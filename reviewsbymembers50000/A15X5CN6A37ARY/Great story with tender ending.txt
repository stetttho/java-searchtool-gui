 I really enjoyed this book and was anxious to have Jessica and Navarro marry and live happily ever after and the author took a different turn that ended wonderfully tender and satisfying.   Ms. Taylor style of writing is very detailed oriented with her descriptions/explanations that greatly bring her tales to life.
