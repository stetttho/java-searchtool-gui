 Regency Era        Seventeen-year-old spunky, free thinking tomboy Alexandra-Alexa Howard was born in England but grew up on her family?s coffee plantation in Ceylon. She was a beauty with storm dark eyes and long gold-tinted auburn hair. Growing up she was allowed free reign, and is now greatly struggling to settle down as a refined young lady. She much prefers to participate in hunting adventures and has a devout interest in the operations of running the plantation.         She lives with her parents, mother Victorine, father Martin, brother Freddy and paternal aunt, Harriet Howard. Aunt Harriet, or affectionately called ?Aunt Harry,? is actually the one who raised her and the one trying to turn her into a refined, marriageable debutant, much to Alexa?s dismay.        One of her family?s best friend, wealthy Sir John Travers, whom Alexa affectionately calls Uncle John, persuaded Governor James Alexander Stewart Mackenzie and Mrs. Mackenzie to sponsor a debutante ball for Alexa?s18th birthday at their Queen?s House in Colombo, capital city of the British Crown Colony of Ceylon. The ball was against Alexa?s wishes, but she conceded to make the best of it in hopes it would soon be over. Upon arriving the night before at Queen?s House, she begged the maid to take to her to the secluded, seldom used, natural ocean water pond, called the Governor?s Pool. Alexa decided swimming naked in the moon-lit warm evening would refresh her spirits enough to endure pretending enjoyment at tomorrow?s ball. While she was taking pleasure in her midnight swim, she alarmingly felt a pair of human hands grasp her around the waist. The hands unmistakably belonged to a man, a naked man, who immediately remarked, ?Well, Well! I seem to have caught myself a mermaid!? Shocked, Alexa was mysteriously spellbound by this sensual stranger and obvious rogue. She couldn?t believe she actually allowed him to steal a kiss and that she enjoyed it and wanted more! She immediately disengaged herself from this stranger and hurried back to her room. She decided to forget the incident ever happened and go on with preparations for tomorrow.         She was definitely the belle of the ball with every unattached man competing for her attention. She was appalled and distressed to discover the arrogantly scandalous stranger in attendance. His name is Nicholas de la Guerra, aka Nicholas Dameron. Alexa was astonished to still feel that same fierce passion, desire and intense dislike for him that she felt last night.        Soon liberated from the responsibility of her parents, she was free to enjoy the excitement of Naples, Rome, Paris and London. Though as much as she tried, Alexa could not forget the desire Nicholas sparked, and being the scoundrel that he is, he soon ruthlessly betrayed her. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn?t overcome reliving the gripping passion and agonizingly delicious ecstasy that only the hated Nicholas Dameron could satisfy. Her entire essence was possessed by this one man who had taken her virtue, scorned her pride and callously broke her heart. Angry and very bitter, she passionately pursued her plan of revenge. She was blind to everything other than her scheme of vengeance, though she was constantly pursued by the marriageable men of the upper crust.        Can she possibly attain a satisfactory conclusion to her torment, or is she to continue suffering this fate that?s worse than death?        The narratives in this novel are excessively long-sometimes to the point of overkill! The 1st 1982 edition consists of 612 pages. I believe if Ms. Rogers had decreased some of the descriptions, it would not have taken anything away from the significance of the scenarios. The plot is filled with love, steamy desire, many surprises, deplorable secrets, shocking scandal, appalling brutality and it?s all very dramatic. You?ll find Surrender to Love is a paperback you will love or one you feel that?s mediocre and a test of your patience. It vaguely reminds me of the book, The Other Side of Midnight (and it sequel, Memories of Midnight; excellent books-definitely recommend!) by Sidney Sheldon. Surrender to Love does take time to read and though I mostly enjoyed it, I will not be adding it to my collection as I doubt I?d read it again. The brutality was limited to one scene, but it was too graphic for me and I won't be seeking other writings of Ms. Rogers because of it.
