 Whitehorn, Montana, 1879 Beautiful and strong-willed Haley Winthrop has a dream of marriage, family and to finally have the peace of mind of belonging somewhere.  Abandoned at birth, Haley grew up in a Chicago orphanage and was no stranger to hard work and loneliness, so when she answered an ad to be a mail-order bride in remote Montana, she knew her dream was within her grasp.  From just one brief letter, the intended groom, Lucas Stoner, sent for her.  Surely, he's everything wonderful and perfectly agreeable and their life together will be long and filled with happiness! Nearing the end of her tiring journey through the beautiful Montana wilderness, the stage was held up by a lone bandit, but this bandit did not want money or jewels, he wanted Haley.  Handsome rancher, Jesse Kincaid, vowed to bring down the evil and greedy Lucas Stoner, the man who had his father killed and what better way to begin than by kidnapping his bride-to-be.  Intimidation, deception and murder is not beyond Lucas's determination to get what he wants and the fact that Haley is an orphan is just the tactic he needs towards reaching his malicious goals; never mind caring about her. While being a hostage, Haley realized her experience of being a captive was nothing like she expected.  Jesse's notion of being a kidnapper was nothing like he anticipated.  She surprisingly takes pleasure in being his prisoner and he began to enjoy being her kidnapper.  Will their long quest that's filled with danger, intrigue and deception eventually bring them together to find eventual peace and happiness where dreams come true?   This is an easy-to-read and wonderful addition to the Montana Mavericks series; guaranteed not to disappoint!
