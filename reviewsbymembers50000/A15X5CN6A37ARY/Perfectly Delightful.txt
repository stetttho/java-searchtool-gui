 Virginia, Colorado 1876 Miss Jenna Winslow needed Rowe Mercer.  She needed to marry him...quickly.  Jenna is a mother with a fatherless infant.  Her solution to the scandal is to become a mail-order bride...somewhere far away.  Rowe is a rugged and gruff ex-bounty hunter-turned-rancher who is ready to settle down to family life and Jenna seems the perfect candidate.  With Jenna's lies to Rowe and Rowe's avoidance to reveal his past, could a marriage possibly work? I thoroughly enjoyed this fun, quick and easy read that keeps you interested from the first page to the last!
