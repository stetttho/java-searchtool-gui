 Wow! This is a great book!  You'll definitely enjoy the characters with their trials and tribulations!  Evie is everything smart and [attractive] and Tyler is in every woman's dreams.   This is the first book in the Paper trilogy.  I also recommend the second book, Paper Tiger and third book, Paper Moon.  Absolutely enjoyable reads!
