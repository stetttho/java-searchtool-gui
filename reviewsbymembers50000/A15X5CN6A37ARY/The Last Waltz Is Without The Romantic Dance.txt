 Romance?  There is not much of it in this historical novel.  This is a good book, but definitely not as romantically inclined as the title, back cover description and sensual sketch suggests.  It is about the life saga of two girls from the teenage years through the twilight years of affluent beautiful Isabel and plain impoverished Marian.  They are forever linked together by the death of Marian's brother and their story is told through the eyes of Marian.  This lengthy and well detailed saga describes the trials, tribulations and little happiness of these women and the people closely associated with them. The storyline is good and easy to follow but I feel it's rather bleak and generally unhappy, if not outright depressing in some of the scenarios.  If I had realized this book is not as romantically inclined and mostly cheery as I prefer to read, I would not have chosen it.  Though it is not what I anticipated, it is a five star read.
