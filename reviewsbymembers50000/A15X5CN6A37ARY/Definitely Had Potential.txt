 I rate this book 2 1/2 stars. The storyline is good, though it was greatly underdeveloped to make it an attractive read.  The characters and how they relate and/or interact certainly had more potential, but it was unremarkably written.  Getting to the root of the plot is rather exasperating and only moderately explained.  Many times I was left wondering what one circumstance had to do with the other and the purpose of some characters.  The writing style did not efficiently flow as I found myself having to re-read something to get the gist or understand the author's meaning.  It definitely could have been a great book.
