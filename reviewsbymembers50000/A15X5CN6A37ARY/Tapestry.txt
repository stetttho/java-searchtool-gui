 If you enjoy high drama with extreme emotions, you'll thoroughly enjoy Tapestry! When I first glanced at the cover and read the back, something akin to the old TV series of Dark Shadows came to mind, but it is nothing like it.  Despite the odd mask aspect, it's a moving love story and is definitely worth your time to read it!
