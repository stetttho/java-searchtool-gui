 Paper Tiger is everything strong and emotional one enjoys in a book and is a terrific second in the Paper trilogy; however, it's not as captivating as the first book, Paper Roses. Georgie a.k.a. Miss Merry is a tough cookie with a big heart and Daniel is everything [attractive] masculine and together they sizzle!  Their tale is of strong social reform with a heartwarming ending. Be sure to read the first book of the trilogy, Paper Roses and complete it with the last book, Paper Moon.
