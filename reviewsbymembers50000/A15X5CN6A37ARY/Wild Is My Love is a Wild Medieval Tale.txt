 The short narrative pretty much sums up what this delightful book is about.   Princess Alysa is trying to maintain harmony and peace within her kingdom and it is an uphill battle.  Along the way, Princess Alysa and a prince from a different kingdom meet and fall hopelessly in love.  Together they fight the evil forces that are trying to take absolute control of her domain.  The detailed storyline includes kings, princesses, princes, servants, bandits and witches.  The scenarios include intrigue, greed, death and the struggles of good, love and power.  The enjoyable plot sometimes seems to drag, but it did keep my interest.  Do not let this prevent you from reading it!  Ms. Taylor has an astute imagination and her stories are sharp and clever and Wild Is My Love is no exception.
