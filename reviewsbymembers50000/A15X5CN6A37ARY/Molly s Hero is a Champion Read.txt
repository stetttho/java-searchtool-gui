 This quick and easy tale is a delight to read; however the beginning storyline did seem to drag on longer than it should.  Once the plot's actions picked up, it passed effortlessly and developed into an entertaining read.  It's a typical Harlequin Historical we all enjoy so well.  The heroine is a strong and determined woman that bears her hardships well and the hero is a robust and resilient man relentless in his pursuits of his dreams.  Together, they are a gritty couple that eventually brings hope to their future.  Very enjoyable, don't pass it up!
