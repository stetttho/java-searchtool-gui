 Virginia City, Nevada 1869  In the dead of the night, Steven Harding recognized the brilliance of fire.  With dread in his heart, he realized it came from the direction of her home; his secret love since childhood.  She is Gloria "Glory" Mae Shaw, the daughter of the late Reverend Caldwell.  Discovering the battered and bruised Glory laying unconscious on the ground with a bloody knife in her hand, he knew he had to do whatever it took to protect her, even if that meant hiding her in a brothel.  His mother's brothel: The Rainbow House.  Glory believed Steven's mother was responsible for her father's death, but what secret about that night lay waiting to be discovered?     Having survived the nightmare of that fateful night of brutality that ended with fire, Glory woke to a more disturbing reality; her dead husband.  The previous year, the beautiful Glory married the sweet-talking miner, Boone Shaw.  Although marriage to Boone was not all it promised to be, she certainly didn't wish him dead.  Now wanted for questioning in his murder she couldn't recall committing, she scarcely believed being rescued and safeguarded by the one man who had reason to let Glory suffer the consequences.  That person is Steven.  But was shielding Glory from the long arm of the law more dangerous than possibly surrendering his secret of loving her from afar?  And how can she call him "enemy" when her traitorous heart revealed otherwise?  What surprises are in store?  This tender story is very enjoyable!  It's also quick and easy to read.  Don't pass up this tale!
