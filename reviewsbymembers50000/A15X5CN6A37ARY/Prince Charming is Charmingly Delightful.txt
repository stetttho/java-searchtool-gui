 1868, England and USA It appears from the reviews of other Amazon.com readers that this book is one you enjoyed or one you didn't.  I'm one who did!  I found the reading consisted of continual light drama so perhaps that is the reason why others did not like it.  There wasn't much variation, but the plot was appealing and most characters were lovable.  It was a pleasing weekend read and I'd recommend it to anyone that likes the body of their books even paced, light and cheerful.
