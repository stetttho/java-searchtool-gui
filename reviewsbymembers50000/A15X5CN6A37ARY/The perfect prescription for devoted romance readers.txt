 The Surgeon has everything one wants in a historical romance novel.  From the first page to the last, it's smart, sassy, thoroughly entertaining and plain pleasurable to read!   Absolutely first rate! Be sure to first read 1. The Surgeon  2. The Engagement and soon to be released 3.  The Proposition.  All three contain some of the same characters.
