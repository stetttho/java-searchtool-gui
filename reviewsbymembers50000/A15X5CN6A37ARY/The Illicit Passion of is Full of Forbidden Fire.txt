 England, 1885-1905 San Francisco, 1905  Nine-year-old wild carrot red haired, green cat eyed, proud and feisty beauty Marissa Ayers first met tall, handsome and wild ebony haired Ian Tremayne while she was an orphan living with her beloved Uncle Theo in a poverty stricken English coal mining town.  Marissa passionately dreamed of escaping her destiny of the coal life to become a refined lady of wealth and respectability.  Marissa had her very personal reasons why this was paramount.  Almost ten years later, Marissa once again met the American Yank Ian.  Marissa secured a position of a maid in the home of Squire Thomas Ahearn and his daughter Mary.  Marissa and Mary became fast best friends and confidants; sharing all future hopes and dreams along with their deepest secrets.  The kind and dying Squire Ahearn loved his daughter so much that unbeknownst to Mary, he secured her future life to his friend Ian. Mary would not receive her inheritance if she decided otherwise.  But Mary's heart belonged to the gentle, common and hard working merchant hopeful, Irish Jimmy O'Brien.  Once Mary learned of her planned future with Ian, she and Marissa devised a plan to switch places.  That plan was marriage for Marissa to the brooding Ian who harbored secrets of his own.  This marriage of convenience would solve everyone's problems.  Mary could marry Jimmy and Marissa would escape poverty.   Can Marissa, Mary and Jimmy pull off this deception successfully?  Can they all happily live their lives with these lies and treachery?  What will Ian do if he ever finds out?  Would he accept the facts fearing that his own secrets will be uncovered?    This pleasing, quick and easy read is full of tender life-threatening journeys of the heart and soul.
