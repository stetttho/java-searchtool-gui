 Lion's Lady is very entertaining and enjoyable.  The aspect of an English child raised by an American Indian tribe and returned to England stirs the imagination.  The embers between Christina and Lyon glow to a red hot fire.  Suspense and humor are a bonus Ms. Garwood adds to her writing. Be sure to read the entire series:  1. The Lion's Lady  2. The Guardian  3. The Gift  4. Castles.
