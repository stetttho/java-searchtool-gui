 I greatly enjoyed these stories!  The tales consist of the contemporary stories of sisters, Suzanna and Diana Brennan and the historical story of the legendary love of their great-great grandparents, Isabelle and Kyle Running Horse Brennan. Suzanna:  Left-at-alter bride, Suzanna spent her wedding night with a sexy stranger.  But when she discovered she was pregnant with his child, she didn't refuse the arrogant cowboy's proposal and found herself trying to win his love. Diana:  Diana couldn't turn down the chance of marriage and motherhood to her childhood love who's now a lonely millionaire and a single dad of a young girl determined to make them a family. Isabelle:  Citified Isabelle returns to the beloved ranch of her childhood determined to make it her permanent home.  She and the handsomely sexy Native American ranch foreman marry to save the ranch despite the fact he's reluctant to admit his true feelings of desire and love.  Be sure not to miss Big Sky Grooms historical anthology of the sexy Montana Kincaid's and follow up with continuing story of a Kincaid brother in Gunslinger's Bride.
