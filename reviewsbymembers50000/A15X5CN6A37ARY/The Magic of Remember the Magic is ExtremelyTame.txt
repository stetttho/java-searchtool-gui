 The story is everything fluffy, warm, fuzzy and unexciting. If you are a devoted fan of Donna Fletcher, you'll probably love this book. Those of us who have never read her works and was anticipating dramatic escapades, it was surprisingly bland and continually flat. I noted the storyline was heavy into messages against prejudice and preaching how one should look at life. I didn't find the messages overwhelming to the point of reader overload; the book just wasn't what I was expecting from reading the back cover. To give Remember the Magic its due, it did keep my interest. It was a pleasant tale and I enjoyed it, but I doubt I will look for more books by this author as I like my books with a more rousing storyline.       It appears Remember The Magic is a somewhat sequel to Wedding Spell. Just because Remember The Magic wasn't for me, it doesn't mean it wasn't a good book and should pass up.
