 Marlow, Colorado 1889 Maggie and the Law tells the tale of Easterner Miss Maggie Peyton's western adventure.   Maggie is an unheard-of-then female university graduate on the trail of locating a missing South American ancient relic from her father's priceless research artifacts.  It's missing due to Maggie's blunder. On route to Marlow, she and fellow coach passenger are in a stagecoach robbery which leaves her financially stranded.  Scientific minded Maggie tells fellow coach passenger the reason for her trip is to retrieve missing scientific research, even if she has to steal it.  Unbeknownst to her, the other coach passenger is the handsome sheriff, Spence Harding. When they finally reach the dusty town of Marlow, Spence decides to keep his eye glued on Maggie and he begrudgingly helps her adjust to western life until she can make enough money for her return trip home.  Along the way, she doesn't realize she is growing to love this small town and that the townspeople are growing to love her.  Most suprisingly is that Maggie discovers she is in love with Spence, but if only Spence would recognize that he...  The town of Marlow, Colorado is first detailed in Judith Stacy's short story of Wild West Wager in the book of A Hero's Kiss with other short stories by authors, Diana Palmer and Mary Burton.  It's my recommendation you first read Wild West Wager in A Hero's Kiss and continue with Maggie and the Law.  In Wild West Wager you'll first meet most of the story's characters and how they fit together before you grow to love them in Maggie and the Law.  You'll absolutely fall in love with Marlow!  (The short story of Snow Maiden in A Hero's Kiss is another success of Mary Burton's storytelling)
