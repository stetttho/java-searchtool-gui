 1859-1921 Kansas  This story is not what I would classify as a typical romance tale.  It's a saga about one woman's life that's full of hardship intermixed with fleeting moments of happiness.   The storyline is good and easy to follow, although somewhat bleak.  Ms. Hermann's writing is clear and precise.  You cannot help feeling Olivia's strife and it's not as cheery a read as I prefer, but the emotions it evokes is what makes it a five star read.
