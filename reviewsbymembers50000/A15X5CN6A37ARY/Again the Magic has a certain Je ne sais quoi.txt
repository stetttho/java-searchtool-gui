 If you prefer your books filled with frequent and explicitly described sexual occurrences, this is a must read for you and Ms. Kleypas knows how to tastefully depict them!   The dialog between the characters is smartly witty and continually electrifying.  The plot is enjoyably good and satisfyingly told; however it doesn?t have fast-paced, high-drama exciting adventure.  Again the Magic is tenderly compassionate and will keep you interested to the last page.
