 April 1899, St. Brides Island, North Carolina  It is a decent read.  It just wasn't remarkable.  It certainly could have been a WOW; it had all the indications to be, but...  The storyline is about the human spirit's determination to survive with dignity and about learning that we don't always have control.  Sometimes that specific lesson is a bitter pill to swallow, especially for a visionary like Grey St. Bride when dealing with the indomitable Dora.    This tale was without a doubt promising, but it was notably undeveloped.  Certain scenarios and explanations seemed to drag on.  The Mail-Order Bride is a quick, easy read and it is enjoyable; it just didn't reach its potential in my opinion.
