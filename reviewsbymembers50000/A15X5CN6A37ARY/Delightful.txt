 HIS EVERY KISS is first rate!  Ms. Guhrke detailed her characters with feeling and told their stories well.  Dylan finds the woman and child that tames his soul and wild ways as much as is possible for a typical tortured genius.  Grace Cheval is a composed and gentle woman burned by her late husband's own tormented artistic brilliance.  Dylan's and Grace's paths cross at a time when they are both at life's lowest and desperate points.  Both are survivors in their own ways and they find the endurance to continue on together, yet at a distance.    Unbeknownst to Dylan he fathered a daughter with a French courtesan and now that the mother died, eight-year-old Isabel is thrust upon her father.  Dylan finds his new-found fatherhood agreeable and hires the destitute Grace as a governess.  Isabel is an unruly genius in her own right, so much so that I found her to be somewhat unbelievable and farfetched for one so young, although it fit the storyline.  Can everyone find lasting love and happiness together?    Follow the comprehensive lives of Dylan, Grace and Isabel, but be sure to first read the prequel GUILTY PLEASURES where Dylan is first introduced.  Although HIS EVERY KISS is a pleasant read, I enjoyed GUILTY PLEASURES much more.
