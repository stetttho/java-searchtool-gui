 17th century France  Seventeenth-century France was a time of fear and persecution.  A time when those who dared to defy the King's Catholic religion were mercilessly oppressed or sent into exile.  One of those is Protestant Edoudard, Comte de Frainville, who was forced to leave his beloved home and family and become a refugee in Holland for over ten years.  His stepmother, Mme de Frainville and younger sister, Claire-Clemence de Frainville, remained behind and as they renounced their Protestant faith.  Now Edouard is returning and Clemence's heart was filled with terror.  Would he be condemned for heresy?  Would Clemence and her stepmother be thrown into prison for sheltering him?  Is Edouard the man he claims to be?  What about the man Clemence as given her heart to?    This blas tale is one be missed.
