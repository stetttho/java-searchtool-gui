 The storyline is great, though I do not think the author developed it to its potential.  I felt the main characters lacked the suspenseful sizzle one wants in a romance novel.  The author could have developed more deeply the difficulty of living in a new land with an unintended spouse and the long road of understanding and mishaps it took to recognize they were right for each other after all.   This is a good, enjoyable easy read, but not a keeper.
