 GUILTY PLEASURES delicious plot is reminiscent of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice with an ugly duckling/Cinderella-ish twist and is absolutely enchanting!  I was enthralled from page one to the last and would have liked the author to continue with the story.  The characters are strong-minded, determined, affable, and completely endearing.  If you are familiar with Pride and Prejudice (a must read classic-romance doesn't get any better than this!), Anthony somewhat reminds me of Mr. Darcy and Daphne somewhat reminds me of Elizabeth Bennet.  Almost from the beginning, sparks fly between the haughty Anthony and the intellectual Daphne. The dialog between the two is continually emotional with snappy, quick-witted dry humor.  Their physical interaction is constantly sensual and always with a dynamical zing.   Through many trials and tribulations of the heart and the eventual meeting of the minds, a tender love story emerges.    A definite keeper to be enjoyed again!  Don't miss it!
