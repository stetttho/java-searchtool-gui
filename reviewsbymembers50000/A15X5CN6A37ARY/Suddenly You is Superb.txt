 Wow!  I loved this book and it?s a keeper!  Ms. Kleypas writes without reserve which can sometimes shock her readers, but is continually in good taste.  Suddenly You is consistently sensual with detailed sex scenes.  If you do not like your books to contain in depth and imaginative sex incidents, you should probably skip this read.  If you can overlook the sometimes crude (but rousing!) episodes, then don?t miss this book as you?ll enjoy the witty and clever plot.  The emotions of the characters are raw and sensitive, sometimes soaring high or plummeting deep and always thoroughly depicted.  The flirtatious dialog between Amanda and Jack is stirring and crackles with enthusiastic ambiance!   Don?t pass this one up!
