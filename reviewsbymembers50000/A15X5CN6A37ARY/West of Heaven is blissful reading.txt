 I thoroughly enjoyed this quick tale of love lost, love found and pulling oneself up by the boot straps.  The solid plot was full of meaning that kept you engrossed from start to finish.  The Characters are strong and well described as having grace, grit and substance.  This book is definitely first-rate!
