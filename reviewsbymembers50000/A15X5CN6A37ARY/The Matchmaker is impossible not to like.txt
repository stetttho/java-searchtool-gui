 If you begin this book knowing it's a light, fanciful and somewhat far-fetched, you'll enjoy the storyline and the characters.  There is nothing serious or in depth within these pages.  If you're expecting something more, you'll be disappointed.  Ms. Plumley writes with humor and her characters are fun and lovable but not at all profound.    If you're looking for silly-sweet, this one is for you!
