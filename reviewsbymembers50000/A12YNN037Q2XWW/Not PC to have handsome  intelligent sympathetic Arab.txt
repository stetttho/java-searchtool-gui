 characters perhaps - but who cares about being PC when telling or watching a rip-roaring dyed in the wool western-in-the-desert story with gorgeous horses and a lead actor who actually acts!!! Viggo gives a performance of nuance and strength here. Omar is a delightful surprise.   This is a little story inside a big one - the western is the big story - Identity is the little one. And they blend seamlessly!  Well worth the time. I am not fond of horse, war, racing or desert movies - nor overly fond of Viggo. No matter - a thumbs up!
