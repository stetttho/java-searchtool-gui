 Becoming helpless... not fun to watch or contemplate. A few really nice high points- powerful visuals and scenery. Really solid performances from the men. Unfortunately, as much as I have enjoyed Meg Ryan in other films... I was not able to connect with her here... which made me doubt Russell's character caring for her... and this undermined the plot. Why else would this professional return to help this woman... unless he cared for her... and I saw no real reason why he should.
