 First and formost is the back view of Hugh Jackman nekkid and fetching in bed - the scene is short and kinda blurry, but a nice bonus and memorable.   Although the movie is slowly paced, Rebecca Gibney is solid as the heroine, and Hugh Jackman does his normal excellent job with his role, as well. The scene stealer is the mechanic - Shane Feeney-Connor - he and Hugh milk this movie for all it is worth. And with Rebecca as the solid center - it works well enough, just not a movie I want to watch more than once.
