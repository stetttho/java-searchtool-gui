 Mr. Denzel and Mr. Russell do their very best to make it as valid as possible. Does not work, and except for Mr. Denzel's dreads, Mr. Russell's nudidity and over the top big-bad fun... it is a knee-jerk slick Hollywood piece of B film fluff... But I enjoyed it. It made me laugh out loud and long at least twice... The 'Staying Alive' bit is perfecto. As good as the 'Smells like Teen Spirit' bit in "Moulin Rouge".
