 I loved him as Captain Kirk, enjoyed TJ Hooker and I dearly love him in Boston Legal - but avoided his recordings before this one. It was given to me as gift and I am so glad!! It is truly a wonderful CD, with character, professional finesse, insight and honesty - and some wonderful music, too. Bravo, Mr. Shatner!!  Thank you!!
