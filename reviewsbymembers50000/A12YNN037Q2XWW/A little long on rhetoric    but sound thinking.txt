 I found the author's style a bit daunting at first. They are so darned certain!! They are young, male and there are three of them... It is to be expected they would be assertive of their opinions. In addition, I entertained an idea, at the point of almost giving up - that perhaps what was giving this book a hard time in my mind was my cooked mentality, not the authors' attitude. I might be just as confident were I raw as long as they. I finished the rest of the book slowly and with careful thought.   I am embarking on 100% raw now because I read this book. I particularly liked Appendix C. I have been blinded by science often in the past, they simply say it in every way a person can understand why raw food is superior nourishment for all creaturekind. Especially humankind.
