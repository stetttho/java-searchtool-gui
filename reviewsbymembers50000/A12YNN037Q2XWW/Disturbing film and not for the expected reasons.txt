 Yes, it is about Hitler and his Germany, yes it is about hatred and violence and about power directed.   This is not a pretty film, but there is poetry in the anger, grace in the mourning, and understanding and almost compassion in the idea that the artist frustrated is the leader we regret following.   The performances are subtle and well textured. Nothing is too heavily peddled, although how can we not know what is coming??   It is well worth watching.
