 Angelina Jolie can act, I have seen her do many a good job - but not here.. she plays it milquetoast as the heroine and I had little sympathy. Clive Owen did as best he could with what he was given, but man, did this flick miss the mark. It it majorly preachy, the timing of the cutting is off, it grates on the nerves to watch it. A planetwide Killing Fields it is not -  IMO only for the die hard fans who will love how gorgeous these two stars look.
