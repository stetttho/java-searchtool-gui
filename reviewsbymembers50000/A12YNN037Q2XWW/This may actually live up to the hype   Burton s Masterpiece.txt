 I am convinced it deserves that title now.  I did not enjoy it right off - the story, style and impact grew on me as it progressed. And the ending had a powerful emotional impact.   In addition to having an entertaining story with wonderful visuals, this film helped me understand and totally forgive any last issues I had with my father.   I give it a big thumbs up!!
