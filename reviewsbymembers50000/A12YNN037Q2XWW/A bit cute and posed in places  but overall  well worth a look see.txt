 Crudup and Danes do a good enough job, but really don't connect as people until... which might be the point!! grin  Costumes aside, this is a story of shedding what no longer works, what was forced upon us when we were too young and could not resist and of discovering who we are now and what we are truly about. That is a difficult story to capture well... they do it here.
