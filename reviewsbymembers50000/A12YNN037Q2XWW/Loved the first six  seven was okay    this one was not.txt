 so much fun... I didn't feel any surprise or delight. NO laughs, either. The others had me laughing out loud! I have no problem with darker stories, but this did not feel darker than the others. I just got the feeling that Janet is not having as much fun anymore with Stephanie's world. "Familiar" is not why I loved the rest of the series.  I will try her next novel... but I am not hopeful.
