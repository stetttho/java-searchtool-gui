 This is an adult film with a wonderful cast of fine women actors! Evocative as heck of the 'North East Well Bred' stuffiness and humanity. (been there, so I knows it.)  Julia is compelling, vulnerable and strong in her role. The entire cast is terrific. Nicely done. And I loved seeing Juliette Stevensen doing an American accent! Okay, I confess I just love seeing Juliette in almost anything - she is a really good actress - IMHO.
