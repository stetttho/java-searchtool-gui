 Well, I've seen the subbed VCDs before and I enjoyed them. If you liked Cardcaptor Sakura and you're ready to graduate to something with highschool characters, this is the anime. Like Cardcaptor Sakura, wands and cards are used but not in the same ways. There's romance and perversion and lots of comedy and flying underwear... You'll have to see for yourself. I loved it very much! It's reccomended if you like other Mahou Shoujo anime.
