 This story is very similar to Hot Gimmick (by the same author): young girl, cute, sweet and nice-looking, becomes the target of several guys and one just happens to be a childhood friend she has totally forgotten about. Only one thing can come from that...  It's a good volume, not much story, but you're introduced to all the characters and prepared for the rest of the story. The old early 90's manga art may be shocking to see especially since the style on the cover is simlar to the author's newer work but once you get past it, you have a fun cute story!
