 With this volume, we are a mere 2 volumes behind Japan and that means the releases have slowed down a lot so this was a well-welcome dose of this series. Unfortunately, it's not enough to tide over until the next volume is released a while from now because in the end, you only want more. The story pace really quickens and gets exciting at this point as several plot points are clarified a little. But not before a little look in on Subaru and Akane's relationship in a cute and tear-jerking chapter. Possibly one of the best volumes of the series!
