 The first time I saw this movie, it totally tore me apart. I thought that it was just so amazing. The creator of this anime did a reeeeeeaaaaally good job with everything. I've seen it a million times and each time, I've  cried. It really impressed me. If you're studying WWII in USHistory, I  suggest watching this movie to see a different side of the Japanese side of  the was than what is seen in textbooks and in class.
