 First of all, I must start by saying that this game is not as easy as it looks, nor is it too difficult that you'll get frustrated. It just has a sweet blend of length, difficulty, and replay-ablity. This game can be easily beaten in a mere day, but you'll miss out on the true experience. It's easy to draw a few lines and tap Kirby a few times and make it to the end, but in each level, there are hidden medals that are well off the main course. You can use these in medal swap to unlock songs, line types and other bonuses for Kirby. As the game progresses, getting to these medals gets tougher.  Also, enemies littering each level aren't the only thing you have to worry about. You have to take notice of how much ink you have, your vitality, and sometimes rising lava, winds, pits, and automatic scrolling.  The game gets really tough XD  There's a lot here to fool around with including a few minigames. I consider this a total must-get for all DS owners who feel neglected by lack of fun titles. If you don't buy this game, at least rent it and play around with it. You won't regret it.
