 Super GALS! is based on the manga GALS! that ran in Ribon, the same mag Kodocha ran in. GALS! may not be as hyper and silly as Kodocha, but it has crazy moments just like Kodocha and should soothe your cravings for Kodocha until it arrives on these shores. GALS! is the story of a group of kogals (trendy girls) living in Shibuya. Ran Kotobuki is their "leader." While she considers herself to be a good kogal, she's going against her parent's wishes to become a police officer like the rest of the family. Ran rebels against their pressure and vows to be a gal as long as she lives. Miyu Yamazaki used to be in a gang and she got into fights frequently. But after falling in love after being taken into a police station, she straightened up and became a good gal. Aya Hoshino, not being able to have a part time job, turned to doing escort services as many bad gals do; but after crossing Ran's path, she learned that she doesn't need to do bad things and becomes a good gal. Ran, Miyu, and Aya rule Shibuya defending it from crime and other gals who wanna take over. But no one will be greated than the #1 kogal in Japan: Kotobuki Ran. If you're just waiting on the edge of your seat for some Kodocha, try some GALS! It's hyper shoujo for the fashionable!
