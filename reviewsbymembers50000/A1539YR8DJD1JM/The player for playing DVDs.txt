 If you just wanna play DVDs, this is a REALLY good player! It comes with the standard features plus a few nifty ones including a bookmarking feature. You can mark up to five points on a disc with one button and then when you want to go back, press another button and you'll be taken to a menu with screenshots of the scene you stopped at. The user menu is also very nice-looking and would be a great player for a family with children because the menus are very kid-friendly. This is the perfect player for someone wanting their first DVD players. It has enough to satisfy advanced users and not too many things to confuse a newbie. The only downside is that you have to hold the chapter skip button to fast forward or rewind. The remote takes some getting used to but it's really nice-looking.
