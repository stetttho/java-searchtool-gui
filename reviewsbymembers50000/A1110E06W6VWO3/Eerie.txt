 One of the greatest films ever made. The little details are especially compelling: the look on Harvey's face after Jocie's death, Christmas carols on a record player, Marco's choice of reading material, the black comedy of  some scenes, and the gunfire turning into thunder. I also liked the  depiction of Communism as a terrible thing that destroys lives.
