 This is unquestionably one of the funniest things I've ever experienced anywhere.  Roger vs the Toad, Walter and Arthur handcuffed to an entertainment unit, the airport, the Russian solvent drinkers--all  hilarious and much superior to so-called "meaningful" novels.  I  usually hate fiction, but handcuff me to this entertainment unit any day!
