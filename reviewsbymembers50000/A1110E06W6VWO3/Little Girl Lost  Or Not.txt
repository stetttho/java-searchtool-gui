 Zackheim's style is certainly readable, but her conclusions leave something to be desired.  She provides the reader with too much irrelevant or misleading detail and too many of her own strong opinions.  I also found  her explanation of Lieserl's ultimate fate to be unconvincing.  To her  credit, she has told a story that should be known, and provided a number of  wonderful photos. In my opinion, two of the photos depict an extremely  plausible candidate for an adult Lieserl.
