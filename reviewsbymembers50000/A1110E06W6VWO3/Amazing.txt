 Like all Hayden's books, this one grabs you and never lets go. The  children are truly amazing in their ability to survive in a world that  treats them like property.  They have a level of  insight and soul that is  rare in adults.  Sheila's transformation is remarkable.  It is a testimony  to Hayden's abilities that her behavior had improved by the end of the  first week.  THIS IS A WONDERFUL BOOK.
