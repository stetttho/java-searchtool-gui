 Torey Hayden has the incredible ability to change lives--in person and through her books.  This one should be required reading for anyone who  works with children or criminals.  Perhaps it would lead to changes in our  current judicial system, which considers children like Kevin and Carol to  be little more than chattel.  I believe some of Kevin's problems stemmed  from his feelings of guilt over Carol's murder and his inability to help  her.  After he visited his former house, he was able to let go and move on.   Perhaps he felt his sister had forgiven him.
