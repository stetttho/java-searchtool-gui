 I have the Palm IIIxe and I purchased this Vx for my son who is heading for college.  This little item, which we equiped with the Landware GoType and keyboard will be able to take just as many class notes as a laptop, and is much lighter and cheaper.  It certainly does not take the place of the laptop - but the way we see it, the less he needs to carry that computer around, the longer it will last. I find, personally, that this little item can take the place of the laptop in may ways, and the 8 MG's is a LOT of storage. I have found it nearly impossible to load that much space up.  I have a total of 32 different add-ons - one which holds a few books, another websites, and another holds many, many documents and databases!  All that and I am only using 3892K (about half of the storage).
