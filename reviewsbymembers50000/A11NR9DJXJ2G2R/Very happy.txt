 It took me months to pick out this keyboard and I am very happy with the choice.  I have had other keyboards and actually gave them away because I was so unhappy with the sound quality...they just weren't "right".  As hard as I would try to "get used to" them, it was impossible and actually had an irritating effect on me.  This keyboard is wonderful - the sounds of the instruments are beautiful and correct.  If you are just learning, the lessons are great.  The song book they send you is written for instruction also - with a little practice you will be on your way.
