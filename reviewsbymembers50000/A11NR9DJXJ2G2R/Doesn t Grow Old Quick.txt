 I bought this for our 12 month old and he absolutely loves it.  It hurts to admit it - but we have spent hundreds on toys for this little fella and this is the only one he plays with throughout the day (he's had it for 2 months)!  He can't ride on it, but I assumed this would be so on account of his age.  He loves to push it around and it doesn't come any where near tipping.  Beware if you have a climber (ours is) because it is a GREAT push-to-where-you-want-to-climb tool. The batteries lasted two months already - even with continual play.  The repetition of things like "don't talk to strangers", "look both ways before crossing the street" and "call 911 for help" are excellent.
