 I haven't found a single relaxation/meditation/nature CD that I like nearly as much as this.  To be honest - there are places on the other CDs that I want to skip over (or just let collect dust).  This one, however, I listen to clear through with absolutely NO problem!  I can't imagine anyone being disappointed.  Everyone I purchased this for was extremely pleased, also!
