 I would probably have rated this higher had I not also bought the Megaland playset at the same time.  The Megaland Playset made this climber go totally unnoticed.  After two months of taking up space, we moved it outside hoping that perhaps this spring it will get more use - and perhaps it will.   Quality is great - and it went together in a snap.  We did appreciate this.  Being made of tough plastic, it is sure to last for years in the great outdoors.
