 This is a great little creative toy.  I have never had one child that didn't appreciate the idea of these building blocks (oldest is now almost 19).  We picked this up for our 12 month old.  Educational wise - you can't go wrong.  It's great for teaching colors, counting, size & relationships (for example, two "half-blocks is equal to one full size block), and also problem solving, for a few. I would advise anyone to pick these up just for the educational value alone.  If you save the simple picture instructions that come with the set (to make the "toolbench"), the kids can also learn to follow simple instructions.
