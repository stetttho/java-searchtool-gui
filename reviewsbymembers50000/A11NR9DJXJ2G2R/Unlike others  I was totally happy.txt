 We got these balls to go with the Megaland Playset.  The box wasn't crushed, and either were any balls - we bought during the holiday rush, too.   The colors are bright and vibrant (excellent for teaching colors and counting).  Durable - I found that they are very durable.  The only thing that has crushed any of them is the jaws of our 100 pound Shiloh Shepherd which we decided should be allowed to play too. Prices, I can't comment on - but we paid the same here as they are at the local department store.  In addition to that, I didn't shop for lower prices because I figured that the time I spent running around or searching the internet (gas and time), it was better for me just to add these in with my order.
