 I ended up purchasing this more for a hobby than anything else.  You definitely will need to get used to the overwhelming capabilities of this software!  There are many free online groups and tutorials to get you started and on your way quickly. If you want to try something new, this is a great idea.  Even if all you want to do is decorate you website, create your own stationery, or fix up those pictures, it's worth it.
