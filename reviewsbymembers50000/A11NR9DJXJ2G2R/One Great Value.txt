 You simply can't go wrong here.  We have a very active 12 month old and he simply loves this.  We were a bit surprised at the size - MUCH bigger than we expected.   The other great thing is this:  You can fold it up in a flash (really - it's that fast) and we slide it behind the couch - when you want to get it out for another week or so, you just pull, give it a shake, and it's ready to go!  We are able to fold it in a manner that we don't even have to detach any parts.  This is especially great when company drops in with their children - they have a "ball"!!  Which reminds me - we did buy an extra 100 balls and are really glad we did.
