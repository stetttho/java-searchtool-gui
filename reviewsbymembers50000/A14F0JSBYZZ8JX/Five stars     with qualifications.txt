 Uru: The Path of the Shell (PotS) rates five stars. Its graphics & sounds are extraordinary; its puzzles are outstanding.   This is a surprising situation where the expansion packs, To D'ni and PotS, exceed the game itself, Uru: Ages Beyond Myst (Uru Prime).   Unlike Uru Prime, neither To D'ni nor PotS is loaded with annoying jump puzzles. Both expansion packs return to the puzzle style of Myst, Riven and Exile.   The qualifications are:   1) PotS contains a logic error. It's possible to complete PotS and skip the Ahnonay and Er'cana Ages altogether.   2) Ubi Soft recommends having the most up-to-date video and sound drivers, I strongly recommend updating all drivers PRIOR to installing Uru.   I did update drivers first, but played Uru long enough where nVidia issued an additional driver update which was immediately installed. After that, Uru would hang at startup with a 'Querying graphics system' message.   The only solution was to remove Uru and reinstall it.   (When reinstalling Uru, first backup your sav, KIimages and MyMusic folders, their default location:   C:\Program Files\Ubi Soft\Cyan Worlds\Uru - Ages Beyond Myst   Then restore them after reinstallation.)   Hope no one else has this problem. It was irritating and almost cost PotS one of its stars.
