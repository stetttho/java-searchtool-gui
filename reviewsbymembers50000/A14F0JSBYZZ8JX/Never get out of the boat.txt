 ... unless you were going all the way.  APOCALYPSE NOW is a brilliant movie, and it is brilliant on many levels.  It is filled with single sentences that succinctly and accurately sum up America's fears and frustrations with the Vietnam War.  Sentences like:  "I love the smell of Napalm in the morning ... Smells like victory." and "Charlie don't surf." are so memorable, and so metaphorically powerful, that they will remain with you for a lifetime.  Based on Joseph Conrad's HEART OF DARKNESS, APOCALYPSE NOW uses exceptional cinematography, music, plot, and acting to convey the ambience and ideas of Conrad's novel. Technically, this movie is outstanding.  I watched it on a 1600 x 1200 pixel, 32-bit color display, and every scene was perfect.  Its music, by THE DOORS, fits precisely with this movie's goals. In its special features section, director Francis Ford Coppola said: "The most important thing I wanted to do in the making of APOCALYSE NOW was to create a film experience that would give the audience a sense of the horror, the madness, the sensuousness, and the moral dilemma of the Vietnam war."  You succeeded Francis; you succeeded brilliantly.
