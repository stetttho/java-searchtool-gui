 Black & White is a powerfully addictive game.  You will find yourself playing it for hours with absolutely no awareness that so much time has passed.  Mouse and keyboard controls are exceptional.  After ten minutes of game play, they are intuitive.  Graphics are outstanding.  They hold up flawlessly on a 32-bit color 1600 x 1200 pixels display.  There is only one problem: you have very little opportunity to delegate authority.  You must simultaneously juggle a large number of villager, creature, and opposition deity needs & challenges.  Your managerial and logistical skills are tested.  But this is one test that you actually enjoy taking.
