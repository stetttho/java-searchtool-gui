 Barbara Stanwyck and Gary Cooper are perfectly cast as Sugarpuss O'Shea and Professor Bertram Potts.  Potts and seven other erudite, academically entrenched professors are creating a new encyclopedia.  Their residence is the perfect hiding place for Sugarpuss, when her gangster boy friend (played by Dana Andrews) forces her to go on the lam in order to avoid a subpoena.  Using subterfuge and feminine wiles, she easily convinces the professors to let her stay with them.  Her pretence being that linguist Potts will benefit from her expertise with modern (1941) slang.  After a lifetime of academic isolation, Potts is attracted by her worldly sophistication and insouciance.  This attraction rapidly turns into love, and this feeling becomes mutual.  "Ball of Fire" is an exceptional movie.  Let's not spoil it by revealing too much.  If you haven't seen "Ball of Fire", it's well worth seeing.  It's so outstanding that one viewing is not enough.
