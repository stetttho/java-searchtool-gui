 OK, I admit it: Robyn Miller's music appeals to me. It has a mystical, surrealistic quality that is enticing. However, music is very idiosyncratic, and what appeals to me may be an anathema to you. Try the "Listen to Sample" selections, and see if they are at least in the ballpark of your musical tastes. These selections are only 30 seconds long, but they give you a rough, first approximation of the ambience of this CD. If you liked the game Riven, you'll love its soundtrack. My CD did have a "hiss and surface noise" problem, when I first played it. But this problem disappeared after my sound card was upgraded to a Creative SB Live.
