 The Exile Soundtrack CD encompasses the musical themes from all the ages of Exile: Tomahna, Jnanin, Amateria, Edanna, Voltaic, Narayan, and back to Tomahna (in that order). Melodies are so haunting that they seem more like mantras than music. Its 30 tracks remind you of every aspect of your Exile gaming experience. Even if you haven't played Exile, its music is enticing.
