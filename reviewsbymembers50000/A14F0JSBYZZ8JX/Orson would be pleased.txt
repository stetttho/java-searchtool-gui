 When Orson Welles found out that Ted Turner wanted to colorize Citizen Kane, his response was: "Tell Turner to keep his damn caryolas away from my movie."  It was Welles' greatest masterpiece, and he was very eclectic about how it was marketed.  I believe that Orson would be pleased with the Citizen Kane (Special Edition) DVD.  This edition gives you three perspectives: Citizen Kane sans commentary, Citizen Kane with Peter Bogdanovich's commentary, and Citizen Kane with Roger Ebert's commentary.  Their commentaries are excellent.  Bogdanovich views Citizen Kane from a predominately psychological perspective, and Ebert views it from a cinematic perspective.  Their commentaries complement one another perfectly.  Disc 2 (The Battle Over Citizen Kane) explains the historical background of Citizen Kane.  I recommend that you view disc 2 before viewing disc 1.  Disc 2 eradicates the misconceptions associated with this movie.  Eliminating these misconceptions lets you view Citizen Kane in terms of the story that Welles wanted to tell.
