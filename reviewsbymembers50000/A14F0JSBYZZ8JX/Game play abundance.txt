 My Myst Uru: Complete Chronicles (CC) experience is unusual...  At the beginning of 2004, played Uru: Ages beyond Myst (Uru Prime), later played the To D'ni expansion pack, finally played the Path of the Shell (PotS) expansion pack.  This trilogy was played on a 1 GHz, 512 MB RAM Windows ME PC.  That was a mistake.  Age loads were annoyingly slow, jump puzzles were arduous, game play was occasionally sloppy and Uru Prime, its 1.2 patch, To D'ni & PotS wouldn't install properly on my new computer.  Decided to replay Uru after upgrading to a 3.8 GHz, 2 GB RAM Windows XP Professional PC.  CC and upgraded hardware made a huge difference...  The above problems evaporated.  With its images & sounds set on 'Ultra', CC became a vastly enhanced gaming experience.  Images became real, three-dimensional.  Sounds were varied and rich, you could feel their intricate textures.   Discovered only one gotcha, CC plays best on an 800 x 600 pixels setting.  If your resolution is set too high, say 1600 x 1200 pixels, images are incorrectly rendered.  For others, there's another hardware gotcha,  "NOTICE: This game contains technology intended to prevent copying that may conflict with some disc and virtual drives."  If you have a single drive DVD computer, it's understandable: you'll opt for a DVD-RW.  If so, CC's anti piracy software may stop a DVD-RW installation dead in its tracks.  Even if CC does install, it may not play properly.  So please consider this alternate...  A dual drive DVD computer is about $100 more than a single drive computer.  In your dual drive computer, you have two DVDs:  A DVD and a DVD-RW.  This gives you the best of both worlds.
