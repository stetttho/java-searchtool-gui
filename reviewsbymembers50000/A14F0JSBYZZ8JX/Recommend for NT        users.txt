 I agree with the "A Disappointment" review.  Their chess game is not even in the same order magnitude as ChessMaster 8000.  Their other games will also fail in comparison with their full-blown 95 / 98 / ME counterparts.  But ChessMaster 8000 wouldn't run on my Windows 2000 computer and neither will many of those counterparts.  95 / 98 / ME users have an abundance of game software.  This is not true for NT / Windows 2000 users.  I am going Classic Board Games three stars and recommend it for NT / Windows 2000 users for two reasons: it will run, and a full Classic Board Games install does not require a CD to initiate it.  This is convenient for gamers who simply want to play off their hard disk.  If you are a 95 / 98 / ME user, skip Classic Board Games, and buy those counterparts.
