 The strategy guide achieves its goal: it explains Exile in intricate detail.  It also delineates the history and philosophy of Exile's five ages.  My only objection to this guide is that its Golden Walkthrough (chapters 1 - 6) makes Exile a little too easy.  However, this objection is ameliorated by the guide's Soft Hints section (chapter 7).
