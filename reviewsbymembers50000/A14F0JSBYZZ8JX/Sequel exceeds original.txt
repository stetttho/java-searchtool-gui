 Exile is an outstanding gaming experience. It deserves five stars. It has one introduction (Tomahna), one lesson (Jnanin), and three prerequisite (Voltaic, Amateria, Edanna) ages that, when solved, will lead you to the Narayan age. Solving the Narayan age will return you to Tomahna, and your quest is completed. The Voltaic, Amateria, and Edanna ages may be played in any order. The Amateria age was my personal favorite. Its scenes were so spectacular that they reminded me of why I loved Myst. My only objection was that the Narayan age is too short. I wanted to ride in the gondola with Saavedro when he returned to his home city. But this objection also shows Exile's high gaming quality. Even after hours of play, you simply don't want this game to end. A great many of the negative reviews were predicated on the fact that pre patch version of Exile had an abundance of bugs. This version was installed, and ran perfectly, on my Win2000 system. The Version 1.2 Myst III: Exile patch was not necessary. Ironically, my Windows ME system did require this patch.
