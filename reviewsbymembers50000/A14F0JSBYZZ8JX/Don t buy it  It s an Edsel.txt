 When you buy the Encyclopedia Britannica DVD, your anticipation is that it's a Rolls Royce. It's not; it's an Edsel. Not only does it have non-resizable windows, its level of technical detail stops at about a college sophomore level. This is adequate for a high school student, but I expected a much higher level of erudition from this DVD. After all, it's Britannica.
