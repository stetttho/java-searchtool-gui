 Gordon Liddy tries to make us think that the immediate past in the U.S. is better than what it is now in all respect. This is the past before the Civil Rights movements that in a limited way opened the gates of liberties to some marginal groups and attempted to create a more egalitarian society. He wants reader to think that during the 1930s, 40s and 50s U.S. citizens were really free. Without a historian's critical skills, which would reveal that minorities and women had little civil rights, he will inevitable fall into the trap of blind conservatism that attempt to use history to justify an unfair social justice.
