 First, it's pretty obvious that Noam Chomsky has made a killing skewering Lippman.  Second, Lippman is a snob who thinks that elitest jerks should control the country. Besides that, he is pretty good reading for anyone who wants to know how things are run in America.  The book is full of boring BS passing for history, but when Lippman kicks in accusing the public of being ill informed and stupid, he's at his best, or worst depending on how you see things. He's pretty much in bed with Aristotle, so if you agree with that jerk, you'll love Lippman.
