 Ellul has a real talent for compartmentalizing his work.  His Christian writings deal with Christianity, his social critiques do not mention Christ.  Whether these critiques are motivated by his religion is doubtful. Ellul's greatest gift is separating his emotions from his analysis.  He treats advertisers, communists, and Goebles the same.  They are merely trying to persuade unsuspecting consumers of media. This is an important work that will be forgotten.  Ellul's name usually pops up when people discuss paranoia as a side effect of technological progress, but this is an extremely narrow critique of his works.  What he has given here, is a perfect example of HOW to write a book on media.  His observations are well footnoted, half the book is footnotes, and his analysis is straightforward.  Obviously, this book has to be updated, but it won't be by Jacques.  He's gone. Unfortunately, the Unabomber's association, and highway robbery of his ideas, will further margenalize him. I'm sure that he is required reading, along with Lippman and Goebels, for Georgetown's political graduate students.  If not, he should be.
