 My "predicted rating" was 4.5 stars, so let's call it 4.5 stars.   Bakunin was Marx's biggest (or so they say) rival in the Socialist Party back in the 19th century.  So, yes, many of the ideas here are 19th century.  There's some altruistic stuff (slavery=bad) that has survived but this book is really just a socialist primer footnote, extra reading for Grad Students or debaters. Bakunin was no writer, he was an activist.  He doesn't believe in God, and thinks the State has supplanted God as the means to effectively rail in the rabble.  He's not the guy you would invite to the democratic fundraiser. Anyway, sooner or later you may decide to put the book down and actually get out there and do something.  Bakunin would have wanted it that way.
