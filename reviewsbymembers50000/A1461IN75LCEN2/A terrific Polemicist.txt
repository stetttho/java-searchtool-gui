 Russell skewers all who believe they are right, regardless of their motivation.  To him, anyone spouting Dogma is an open target for ridicule. My favorite piece, "the superior virtue of the oppressed" is as relevent today as it was eighty years ago.  In it, he attacks those who look for a cause to call their own.  He dispells the notion of the good ole days and questions whether any group of humans is morally superior to any other, regardless of their place in the power scheme. A truly terrific writer.  If you haven't read Russell, you know nothing about philosophy.
