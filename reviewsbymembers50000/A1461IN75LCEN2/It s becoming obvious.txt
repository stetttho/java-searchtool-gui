 Why we have a separation of church and state, and why (if the world is going to survive) that separation needs to be worldwide.  When people believe that (their) God is instructing them how to run their government, then it completely precludes any chance of diplomacy between nations.  It is absurd to think that the problems in the Middle East are somehow prophesized and predetermined by the Bible, the Koran, or any other holy book.   I wonder if the author of this book is up to date on the numerous issues at stake in Israel and Palestine, particularly the settlements and Israel's violation of the 4th Geneva convention. I doubt it. I would venture that the author thinks that the Jews have a holy right to the promised land, so we should wipe out the Arabs or force them from "Eretz Israel" (which includes most of Iraq).  I'm not placing the blame solely on the shoulders of the Israelis, for the Islamic nations have committed just as many sins in this affair, most of which are well known in the United States and therefore not necessary to introduce.   Until religious fundamentalism is removed from politics, a concentrated and coordinated few will dominate politics in the Middle East and (sadly) in America.  Because religions vary so wildly from person to person and country to country, they must be removed completely from politics.
