 This hysterical comedy starring Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey is filled with some of the funniest lines and sight gags I've seen in a long time.  The plot is basically this,  although it veers around somewhat through all of the antics the two half-wits get into;  Lloyd(Jim Carrey),  meets the woman of his dreams,  Mary(Lauren Holly) while picking her up to drive her to the airport.  Unbeknownst to him as she walks to her gate,  she leaves a briefcase on the ground to be picked up by two tough looking criminals(Karen Duffy and Mike Starr).  Not wanting his love at first sight Mary to forget her briefcase,  Lloyd springs out of the limo,  grabs the briefcase before the thugs can,  runs after Mary'[s already departed plane,  and falls off the jetway.  It turns out that he and his best friend Harry(Jeff Daniels) has also been fired,  so Lloyd tells Harry about his new-found love.  "L: She actually talked to me,  man!  H:  Get outta here!"  Lloyd decides to pursue Mary, who told him that her next stop would be Aspen.  Harry agrees to go with Lloyd,  whild they unknowingly are pursued by the two criminals. This movie is a scream!  Jim Carrey is wonderful as Lloyd,  as is Jeff Daniels playing the equally moronic Harry.  Also great is the supporting Lauren Holly,  who incidentally began dating Carrey after the movie finished.  The smaller roles are perfectly played by Karen Duffy,  Mike Starr,  Charles Rocket,  Teri Garr,  and Victoria Rowell.  You'll laugh yourself silly!
