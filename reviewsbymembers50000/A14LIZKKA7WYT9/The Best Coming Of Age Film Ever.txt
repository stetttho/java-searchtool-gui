 Such a movie like Stand By Me only comes once in a lifetime.  Luckily,  it is captured by Rob Reiner's excellent direction and the four boys' incredible acting.  The story,  based on a Stephen King short story,  revolves around Gordie(Wil Wheaton),  Chris(River Phoenix),  Teddy(Corey Feldman),  and Vern(Jerry O'Connell).  Having heard about the disappearance of Ray Brauer, they discover from Vern that his brother ran across the body,  but could not tell the police because he was in a stolen car.  Eager to claim fame,  the boys set off on a long trek to find the body and become famous.  Throughout this trip,  they learn more about themselves and each other than they could ever imagine.  Vern's brother tells the leader of his gang Ace the whereabouts of the body,  so they too set off for the body.  This comedy/drama is simply incredible.  I grew up watching this movie.  Wil Wheaton is brilliant as Gordie,  the would-be writer.  The late River Phoenix gives an unforgettable performance as Chris.  Corey Feldman plays the wild and crazy Teddy with great effect,  and Jerry O'Connell is hysterical as Vern.  Kiefer Sutherland is also excellent as Ace,  while John Cusack makes a good cameo performance as Gordie's deceased brother Denny.  Rob Reiner directs with a keen and knowing eye,  giving the blend of humor and drama just the right touch.  Fantastic Movie!
