 Quentin Tarantino's amazing movie which he wrote and directed as well as played a cameo role in,  is one of the best movies ever made.  I mean it!  The film feels like it was written and directed in a white HEAT,  showing how truly great a talent Tarantino really is.  Peppered with outrageous humor,  characters,  and situations,  PULP FICTION is a masterpiece.  The movie revolves around several characters whose own personal stories finally interweave with each other.  John Travolta is unbelievable as Vincent Vega! Superbly played,  he can be despised and loved at the same time.  Equally incredible is Sameul L.  Jackson's performance.  In one mesmerizing scene where he is pointing a gun at a guy who has messed with the wrong man, he recites a passage from the Bible,  the camera never leaving his face and his eyes never blinking.  I nearly fell out of my seat! Uma Thurman is great as the beautiful but drug-addicted wife to Marcellus Wallace(Brilliantly played by Ving Rhames).  One of the best performances in the entire movie is that of Bruce Willis,  who finally shows that he is truly much more than just an action star.  Harvey Keitel astounds as The Wolf,  the man you call when you've got a problem.  Although he only has a few minutes on screen,  he is awesome.  Christopher Walken provides a wonderful cameo in which he explains to a younger version of Bruce Willis the way his father died.  Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth make a dynamic duo as bank robbers,  and Maria de Medeiros is very effective as Fabienne,  Willis's girlfriend.  Eric Stoltz and Rosanna Arquette are very good in their small but important roles,  as well as Steve Buscemi in his very small and unrecognizable role as the Buddy Holly waiter.  Tarantino won an Oscar for his screenplay,  and he definitely deserved it.  Go out and rent it or buy it.  Worth it!
