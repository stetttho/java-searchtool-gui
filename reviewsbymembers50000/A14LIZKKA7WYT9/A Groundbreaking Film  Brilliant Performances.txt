 It is a rare occurrence when one finds a movie that can captivate a viewer and suddenly and without warning turn everything around to the point where the person says,  "Wait a MINUTE!"  David Fincher's masterful and exciting film FIGHT CLUB does more than simply entertain.  It blows the mind!  Edward Norton plays the un-named narrator and average-guy insomniac who becomes obsessed with self-help groups,  though nothing is seriously wrong with him.  When he meets another "faker" as he calls himself,  he becomes mixed up with Marla Singer(Helena Bonham Carter),  a chain smoker with suicidal tendencies.  Norton flies around the country assessing car damages for his job,  and on a particular flight he meets Tyler Durden(Brad Pitt).  Tyler is the epitome of stylish,  cool,  and without a doubt the one man who can do anything.  Norton's apartment mysteriouly explodes,  and Durden allows Norton to stay with him.  Together,  they discover a certain animal pleasure in fighting.  They form an underground FIGHT CLUB where men meet and simply fight each other.  Soon however,  this organization will become much more than just a club.  Edward Norton gives a phenomenal and mesmerizing performance and establishes himself as one of the best young actors of our generation.  Brad Pitt is simply amazing as Durden, playing a role that only a gifted actor could accomplish.  Helena Bonham Carter gives a surprisingly powerful performance as Marla and gives the character tons of dimension.  Also great is the supporting performace by Meatloaf,  an ex-bodybuilder with testicular cancer.  David Fincher has directed a fast-paced,  humorous,  and spectacular film whose most incredible and surprising twist near the end will knock you off your seat!  I cannot tell you what that is however.  It is something you must find out on your own.
