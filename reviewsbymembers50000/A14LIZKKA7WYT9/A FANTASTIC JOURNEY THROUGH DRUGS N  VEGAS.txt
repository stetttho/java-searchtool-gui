 Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is unlike any movie you will see for quite a while.  The visionary behind 12 MONKEYS and THE FIShER KING Terry Gilliam has directed this film about a drug-addicted journalist and his equally addicted lawyer with style and panache.  Based on the popular book,  this film is both moving and hilarious on so many different levels.  The plot is basically this:  Raul Duke(played by Johnny Depp;  Edward Scissorhands,  Blow,  Ed Wood),  is a journalist for an unnamed magazine,  who is asked to cover a race in Vegas.  Taking along his lawyer Dr.  Gonzo(Recent Oscar winner Benicio Del Toro;   Traffic,  Snatch,  The Usual Suspects),  they embark on a drug-induced farcical journey into Las Vegas where anything can happen and often does.  The excellent direction and cinematography in this film is stunning,  as well as the performances by the two stars.  Johnny Depp is incredible as Duke/Narrator,  definitely one of his best yet unknown performances(He is somewhat unrecognizable without a head of hair).  Del Toro rocks as Dr.  Gonzo.  Definitely a sign of things to come as he would launch himself into some of the best performances of his career.  Also,  there are many great and memorable cameos by Tobey Maguire,  Ellen Barkin,  Christina Ricci,  Christopher Meloni,  Craig Bierko,  Cameron Diaz,  heck!  Even Dr.  Evil's Mini-Me makes a two second appearance if you look closely.  All in all,  a riotous and riveting movie that I absolutely love!
