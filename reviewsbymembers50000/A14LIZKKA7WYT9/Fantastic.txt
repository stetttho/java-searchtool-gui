 Quentin Tarantino's debut film RESERVOIR DOGS broke new ground that many other directors and screen writers were afraid to tread upon.  This amazingly well-written, directed,  and acted film is about a jewel heist gone wrong and the consequences of each man's suspicions.  Harvey Keitel is wonderful as tough but compassionate Mr.  White(Each man is given an alias name,  no one's real name is used),  Michael Madsen is cool and psychotic as Mr.  Blonde,  Sean Penn delivers a strong performance as Nice-Guy Eddie,  Lawrence Tierney is very intimidating as Joe,  the crime boss,  and Quentin Tarantino gives a great cameo performance as the short-lived Mr.  Brown.  The really great performances definitely go to Tim Roth and Steve Buscemi.  For Roth(Mr.  Orange),  this was a breakthrough role in which he spends a good deal of the movie drenched in his own blood and in his screams of pain never once goes into an over-the-top performance.  It's right on the money.  Buscemi is dripping with attitude and gives one of his best performances until FARGO in RESERVOIR DOGS.  From the moment he appears on screen,  you know its gonna be a bumpy ride.  A must-see for anyone who enjoys lotsa suspense,  catchy dialogue and music,  and some great action scenes.
