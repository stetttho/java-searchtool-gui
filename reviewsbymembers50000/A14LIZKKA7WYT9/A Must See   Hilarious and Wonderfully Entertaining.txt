 A wonderfully hilarious and heartfelt mockumentary by Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy who recently wrote the hit movie "Best in Show."  This ingenious film tells the story of Corky St.  Clair(Guest,  who is also the director),  a New York actor/director living in the small Missouri town,  Blaine. He has written a new musical entitled "Red,  White,  and Blaine"  to celebrate the town's 150th anniversary.  Next,  he must find the perfect cast.  Enter Fred Willard,  Catherine O'Hara,  Parker Posey,  Lewis Arquette,  and of course Eugene Levy,  who create some of the funniest theatrical characters since Mel Brooks' The Producers!  Corky has sent a letter to some New York producers,  and one has agreed to fly down to Blaine and see the show,  Mort Guffman.  The cast becomes extremely excited as they gear up for the possibility of a future on Broadway. Through superbly acted situations and comedic timing and poise,  the rehearsel's finally culminate to the movies best scene.  The opening night of "Red,  White,  and Blaine."  I could not stop laughing at the cameos,  the well-crafted characters,  and the overall joy that was rampant throughout this great little movie.  Anyone who enjoys theatre or just wants to see a great movie nust see this one!
