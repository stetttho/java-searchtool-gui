 BLAZING SADDLES has survived throughout these years as one of Mel Brooks best films.  Filled with hysterical sight gags and some of the funniest lines ever spoken,  it is no surprise that many people argue that BLAZING SADDLES is the best Mel Brooks film.  The film revolves around Bart, a black man living in the time of the old west,  who smashes his overseer's head in with a shovel,  and is saved from being hung because he would be perfect for a plan devised by the sinister Hedley Lamaar.  What ensues is one of the wackiest and out of sight films of the 1970's.  Cleavon Little stars as Bart,  whose fine performance stands out as the best he ever gave to a film.  Gene Wilder is brilliant as ever as Bart's friend Jim,  or as he was known so many years ago, the Waco Kid.  The truly magnificant performances are done by the supporting cast.  Harvey Korman is slam-bam fantastic as Hedley Lamaar!  Definitely his best performance in a Brooks film.  The late,  great Madeline Kahn received an Academy Award nomination for her great performance as Lili Von Schtupp,  and she is amazing from beginning to end.  Slim Pickens shows great comic poise as the dim-witted Taggert.  Mel Brooks plays dual roles as the hilarious Governor and later as the Indian Chieftain.  Dom Deluise,  though only appearing for less than five minutes,  gives a wonderful performance as an effeminate director.  All in all,  Mel Brooks' direction and screenplay co-written by Richard Pryor among others are awesome.  I love this movie!
