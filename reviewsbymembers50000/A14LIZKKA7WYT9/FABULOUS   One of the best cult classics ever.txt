 This fantastic film Pee Wee's Big Adventure can be enjoyed by all ages.  The directorial debut of one of the most influential directors in Hollywood: Tim Burton and an excellent tour de force performance by Paul Reubens as Pee Wee.  This wacky adventure begins with Pee Wee's discovery that his beloved bicycle has been stolen.  After receiving phony info from an even phonier(phonier?  not a word,  but it works!) fortune teller,  he sets off in search of his bike,  which is supposedly in the basement of the Alamo.  Off he goes on one of the funniest adventures ever captured on screen.  Paul Reubens is brilliant as Pee Wee Herman.  Elizabeth Daily makes a wonderful Dotty,  Pee Wee's would-be love interest. Mark Holton is great as Francis,  as well as Diane Salinger as the wanna-be French waitress Simone.  Judd Omen makes a great escaped-con Mickey,   who is the first to help Pee Wee out on his journey.  Also good are the small cameos by such stars as Ed Herlihy,  Cassandra Peterson(TV's  Elvira),  Alice Nunn,  Toru Tanaka,  Carmen Filpi, James Brolin,  Morgan Fairchild,  Milton Berle,  and the best cameo of all,  SNL's Jan Hooks.  Beautifully directed by Tim Burton,  this movie was also written by Reubens and the late Phil Hartman,  who,  if you look closely,  makes a small appearance in the final scene as a reporter.  Definitely a must-see.
