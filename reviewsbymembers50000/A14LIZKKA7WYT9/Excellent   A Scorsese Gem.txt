 Martin Scorsese was honored with by the Cannes Film Festival as best Director in 1986 for his brilliant dark comedy After Hours.  It is an amazing and immensely funny film which features an absolutely amazing performance by Griffin Dunne and great supporting performances by many up-and-comers.  What makes this movie so awesome is the fact that you never know what is going to happen next to this poor sap who just wanted a little love.  The story is simple and very clever,  with Paul Hackett(Griffin Dunne),  a boring word processor,  who meets an interesting but odd girl(Rosanna Arquette) in a coffee shop.  Returning home,  he decides to call her,  and he is invited over to the apartment.  Paul doesn't know it,  but he is about embark on an incredible journey through "after hours" New York,  where all the weirdos (...) are free to roam.  The weirdos (...) include Cheech and Chong,  Teri Garr,  Linda Fiorentino,  Verna Bloom,  Catherine O'Hara(In her first film appearance),  and John Heard.  Bronson Pinchot gives a memorable cameo as an ambitious word processor in the beginning of the film.  You will love this film,  especially the shocking finale.  Scorsese is the best!
