 I've always been a fan of the silent film era,  and NOSFERATU stands out as one of my favorites.  I had only seen it once on a late night channel,  then I saw this version of it at a Blockbuster.  So I bought it,  got all ready to enjoy it,  and then(although it was still brilliant) the music came on.  This pseudo-scary weird accompaniment totally unhinged the creepiness and overall feel of the entire film.  I ask all filmmakers or film distributioners,  WHY DO YOU THIS?  The films are fine by themselves!  If they're such great cult classics already,  why change them?  Sure,  I can completely tolerate Director's Cut Versions of a film,  geez,  I actually prefer it if that is the vision the director had in mind(Speaking of which,  catch the 20th Anniversare Director's Cut of Dawn of the Dead,  there's an example of a great directors cut).  Anyways,  NOSFERATU is an amazing film,  and I say go see it,  but if you happen to see the cover above,  I would personally steer clear of this version unless you're deaf or have a high tolerance level...See Nosferatu,  the original gothic,  and if that wasn't enough,  catch Shadow of the Vampire.  Willem Dafoe's performance is worth the entire strange little film.  Oh,  and John Malkovich is cool in it too.
