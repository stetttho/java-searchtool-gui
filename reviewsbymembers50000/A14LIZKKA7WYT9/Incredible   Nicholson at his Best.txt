 One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is not your ordinary movie.  But it is one of the finest films ever made.  Jack Nicholson stars as R.P.  Macmurphy,  a former prisoner,  has been sent to a mental hospital for evaluation.  He has been charged with brutality and rape,  making the doctors believe there may be signs of mental illness.  What ensues is an incredible movie about one man's struggle to survive in a mental hospital and the effect he has upon the other patients.  Jack Nicholson won his first lead actor Oscar for his performance in Cuckoo's nest.  He is simply unbelievable.  He was very due for an oscar.  This was his 4th nomination.  Fellow nominee Walter Matthau,  upon hearing Nicholson's name announced,  was said to have leaned over to his wife and said "It's about time."  Louise Fletcher won an Oscar for best actress in her unforgettable turn as Nurse Ratched,  the stern facilitator of the mental ward.  There are many patients and people who would soon become big stars,  such as Danny Devito,  Christopher Lloyd,  Louis Gossett Jr., and an amazing performance by Sydney Lassick.  The real deal is Milos Forman,  the winner for best director,  and the man behind such films as Amadeus(His 2nd Oscar for Direction),  The People V. Larry Flynt,  and Man on the Moon.  He even used real mental ward patients to add realism to the film.  This film was produced by a young Michael Douglas,  earning him his first Oscar.  Gripping,  funny,  terrifying,  and ultimately fulfilling,  Cuckoo's nest is one of the best movies ever made.
