 I absolutely love this movie.  I remember watching it on Allen's birthday and they were showing a marathon.  I had never heard of this one,  and I can't believe I'm a big fan of his work and never came across this one.  A must-see!  Woody Allen stars as a man who went into a hospital in 1973 for a routine ulcer operation,  went into a coma,  and wakes up exactly 200 years in the future,  having been frozen.  What ensues is one the most hilarious movies around.  Allen and Diane Keaton are a dynamic comic duo,  and the screenplay by Allen and Marshall Brickman is excellent.  Full of hilarious sight gags in the tradition of Buster Keaton and great one-liner jokes in the style of Bob Hope.  I discovered that this was Allen's intention.  Along with the excellent performances by Allen and Keaton,  Woody Allen's direction and use of music steers toward brilliance. The Rag Time Rascals,  the band he jammed with on occasion,  plays throughout the movie,  with Allen on the clarinet.  Awesome Flick!
