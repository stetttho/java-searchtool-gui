 Mel Brooks won an Academy Award for his screenplay of THE PRODUCERS,  and with due cause.  This hilarious romp through the world of Broadway producers stars Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder in an Oscar-nominated performance and is non-stop funny!  Max Bialystock is a has-been Broadway producer who has been reduced to swooning little old ladies for cash.  Leo Bloom, an honest accountant(Wilder) comes in to help Mr.  Bialystock with his producing bills,  and makes the comment that under the right circumstances,  a producer could make more money with a flop than he would with a hit.  So begins the unbelievably hysterical journey of Bialystock and Bloom in search of the worst play in the world.  They discover a play called "Springtime for Hitler" and proceed to get the worst director,  the worst playwright,  and the worst actor to play Hitler,  and produce the play on Broadway.  There is only one small problem,  the play is a HIT!  People think that it is a hilarious comedy,  and they clamour to see it.  This great film is chock-full of laughs,  and great performances.  Zero Mostel plays a fantastically unscrupulous producer and astounds as Max Bialystock.  Gene Wilder is a comic genius as Leo Bloom,  and he is wonderful.  Kenneth Mars pulls off quite possibly one of the funniest characters ever as the ex-Nazi, Hitler-loving playwright,  and Dick Shawn gives a finely-tuned performance as a psychedelic hippie actor playing Hitler.  I have not laughed more at any other movie.  This is definitely the funniest movie ever.  Go out and see it right now!
