 This is absolutely the funniest video I have seen in ages!  Hysterical,  clever,  with great attention to detail, Steve Oedekerk(Director:  Nothing to Lose and the abominable Kung Pow!) has created a mini-film that anyone from a Star Wars geek to a Jar jar Binks fan can enjoy.(I would have just said a novice,  but anyone who likes Jar jar Binks is below a Star Wars novice.)  It follows the simple structure that made Star Wars IV so great,  and then borrows from Empire and Jedi to make the story even funnier.  Its difficult to explain only because there are never truly any actors per se,  just their eyes and mouths,  which is funny in itself.  My personal favorite scenes are the introduction of Ooby Doob Banoobi(I have the silliest name in the galaxy),  the classic scene with the unwise commander(Why don't you gather some frogs legs and eyes of newt?),  and then the british accents joke,  girlie giggles,  and the slo-motion scene of everybody's reaction when Ooby gets it.  TOUCHDOWN!  Oh yeah,  and the puppet scene.  That is awesome!  (Beneath the floor,  the man does control me,  yeeesss.)  If you love Thumb Wars,  I'm sure you'll like ThumbTitanic.  I admit I didn't love it as much as Thumb Wars,  but its definitely worth the look,  and it does have some funny scenes.  Thumb Wars Rocks!  May the Thumb be with you!
