 PRIMAL FEAR is one of those movies where anything can happen,  and often does.  This eerie and intriguing tale of the murder of an archbishop and the trial of the accused choir boy is directed with skill and dexterity by Gregory Hoblit.  Martin Vale is a famous defense lawyer who takes it upon himself to defend the supposed murdering choir boy simpleton Aaron Stampler.  His former lover Janet will be the prosecutor against him in this all important trial.  Martin may think he has everything figured out,  but he soon discovers the terrible secret behind the innocent face of Aaron.  Richard Gere and Laura Linney give superior performances as Martin and Janet,  as well as John Mahoney and Frances Mcdormand in their supporting roles.  The real story is Edward Norton's incredible performance as Aaron.  He received an Oscar nomination and a Golden Globe award for Best Supporting Actor for his role.  I am now officially a huge Ed Norton Fan!  I would love to give away the secret behind Aaron,  but you've got to see it to believe it!  Amazing Movie!
