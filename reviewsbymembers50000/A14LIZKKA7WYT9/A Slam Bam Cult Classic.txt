 It is one of the most quoted movies in history. The scenes and comedy evoked by the small ensemble of comedic genius's are simply brilliant. MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL is one of the funniest movies ever made. It tells the tale of King Arthur, who is searching for knights to join him at the round table. He assembles them, and then receives a message from GOD to seek the holy grail. Thus begins the quest that will have you rolling off your seat with laughter! From the Knights Who Say 'NEE', the three headed giant, the nymphs of the castle Anthrax, to the silly insulting Frenchman, this movie embodies the funniest situations ever to be captured on film. The bad boys of the hit British comedy show are all together to give the funniest performances of their careers. They are John Cleese(Academy Award nominee:Best Screenplay A Fish Called Wanda), Eric Idle, Graham Chapman, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam, and Michael Palin. Each man plays an incredible array of characters, showing their truly great talents. Terry Gilliam(12 Monkeys,The Fisher King)and Terry Jones(Erik the Viking,  MP and the Life of Brian) direct the film with a masterful stroke, and is also an actor. The best lines in cinema are said here, so don't miss it!
