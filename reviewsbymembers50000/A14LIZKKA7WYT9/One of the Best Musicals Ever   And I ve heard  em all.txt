 This incredibly campy yet brilliant musical take-off of 'All About Eve' and 'The Bad Seed' is hysterically funny with its razor sharp lyrics and very powerful score.  RUTHLESS!,  by Marvin Laird and Joey Paley,  tells the tale of Tina Denmark, who is dripping with talent,  but does not receive the role of Pippi Longstocking in the school play,  so instead of taking this in stride,  she kills the girl who beat her out of the part,  causing total distress in her mother's life.  This cast recording is top-notch and captures the many talents of the six-person cast.  Certain songs definitely stand out as the best in the show,  namely "Talent," "Teaching Third Grade,"  Born To Entertain,"  "I want the girl,"  and finally the culmination in the title song "Ruthless."  My personal favorite is the definite show stopper "I Hate Musicals."  A Fantastic Piece!
