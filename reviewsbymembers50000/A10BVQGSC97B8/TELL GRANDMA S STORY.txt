 While the book was well-written, I found myself interested in the stories that were largely untold. Henry was a jerk and Gillon too self-absorbed and shallow.  What about Ashley's story?  What about Grandma Sarah's story?  There was much more to tell that we were given a glimpse of before Trollope jutted off into the main plot line (that I wasn't much interested in, anyway). I enjoyed her style of writing.  The dialogue was great.  Just felt it could have been a better book.  I am definitely going to try some of Trollope's other books before "writing" her off!
