 That is as much as I am going to give away as far as this book goes.  I kept waiting for something exciting to happen.  Nothing ever did.  Wait, someone threw a brick through a window.  How thrilling.  Huge disappointment, although very well written.  The storyline had a lot of potential, but this seemed more like a first draft than a published novel.
