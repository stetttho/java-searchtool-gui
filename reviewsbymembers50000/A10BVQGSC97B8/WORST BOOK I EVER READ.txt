 This book's characters totally lacked any depth.  One minute someone is having a nervous breakdown and the next she is standing up in a wedding.  As far as the "Big Plot Twist" regarding parentage, what a joke!   It seemed like she ran out of ideas and just threw this in to keep the  "story" going. Fern Michaels (whom I normally LOVE)really  messed this one up.
