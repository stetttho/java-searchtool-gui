 This book was incredible.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I only write reviews about books I feel very strongly about.  This one captures you from the first chapter and draws you in deeper and deeper as you read.  You can empathize with all the characters, even those you don't like.  The Secret Life of Bees could be an Oprah book, except that it is too wonderful!  The vivid descriptions, characters with depth - this book has it all!!  I only hope that Sue Monk Kidd will come out with a sequel, as I feel there is more of the story to tell.
