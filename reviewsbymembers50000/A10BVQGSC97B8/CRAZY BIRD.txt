 I would only recommend this book if all the libraries and bookstores in your community burned to the ground and there was NOTHING else to read. Sounds strong, I know.  But, believe me, it is not worth the couple of hours it takes to read it.  I am 35 years old and could relate to the all the music references.  That was the only redeeming thing about this book - that and the actual style of writing.  Otherwise, this would have only gotten ONE star. What's wrong with it you may ask?  Well, where to begin.  It is obvious this is his first book.  It is equally as obvious that he is a deeply religious man and that he tries to push God and his own beliefs down our throats pretty early on.  But, I trudged through. Some portions of the book were tolerable, but come on.  The main character hasn't had a drink in 10 years - and becomes a raging alcoholic in a couple of days.  Then, as suddenly as he started drinking he stops and becomes completly normal - a SAINT even!  The man is manic/depressive with a few paranoia complexes on top of that!!!!  My point being, how can a character who goes to such extremes in the space of a couple chapters be believable?  Can't be done.  Shouldn't have been done. The ending was "happy" with all characters getting their just desserts.  How cliche.
