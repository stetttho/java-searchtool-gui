 I hate wasting my valuable time reading a so-so book with a terrible ending.  Most books I read fall under either this category or are just plain stupid right from the beginning. I am happy to say Housewrights does NOT fall under either of these two categories!  It is a great read.  Housewrights is actually a remarkably short book that tells a very detailed, complete story.  The twins' relationship is fascinating, and I absolutely loved Lily.  One sign of a good book is when you actually care about the characters.  I actually cried during the last few pages of this one! Super writing, lovable characters, a plot that is interesting, background characters who are developed.  Need I say more?  You'll be happy you read this one, just as I was!  I can't wait for Art's next book.
