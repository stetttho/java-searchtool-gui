 By far, the absolute WORST book I have ever read in my life.  I normally don't like to write bad reviews, but if I stop even ONE PERSON from wasting their time on this book, it will be worth it.  I had to see what else Jamie von Becken had on his "Best" list so I don't accidentally pick one of those at the library!
