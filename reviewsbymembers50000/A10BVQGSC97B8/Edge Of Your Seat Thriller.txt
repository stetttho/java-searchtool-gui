 Wow, what a book!  It was a REAL thriller!  Just when I thought I had it all figured out - whammo - another twist in the story.  I Highly recommend this book to anyone interested in a suspensful, well-written novel.  I had to force myself not to skip paragraphs because I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next!  There aren't too many books around like that.
