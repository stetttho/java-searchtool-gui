 Maybe I'm just a middle-class white girl from Un-diverse Central Wisconsin, but this book was way too racial for me.  I don't understand how race can consume your entire life, your every thought, your every action.  The author is WAY too hung up on who is of the paler nation and who is of the darker nation, etc.  It really distracted me from the book and I had to put it down halfway through.  I don't even CARE who killed the judge.  I really don't.  Seemed Mr. Carter wanted to make some type of social statement that I just don't relate to.  The only social statement I got from the book was that if a white person had written it in the same style, he would be considered a bigot.
