 The Tea Rose is an excellent read.  Yes, it is predictible.  Yes, there is a happy ending.  But, it is a real page turner.  And eventhough there are alot of pages, it goes quick - almost too quick!  The characters are all well developed and the plot is original and captivating.   Highly recommended!
