 Let me start out by saying this is a must read.  It is light, easy and fun.  It is not meant to be believable!!  That is why they call it fiction!  My only complaint is that Jude condensed 3 stories into one book.  Although it keeps the action going, I feel too much of each character was overlooked.  I loved all 3 main characters and would have liked each of their stories told in full.  All in all, though, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys escaping into a book.
