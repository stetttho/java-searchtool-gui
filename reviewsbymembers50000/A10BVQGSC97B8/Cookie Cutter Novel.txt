 No real surprises here.  The typical thriller plot, uninteresting characters, and a chase scene I have read/seen hundreds of times before.  How can we be expected to believe that the villain, Doug, can go as psycho as he did without warning?  I don't think even Jason had as many lives as Doug!   I also didn't care for the graphic violation of Bob.  Didn't need that much detail.  Also, Bob seemed to recover pretty darn quickly from such a horrific attack. NOT recommended by me!
