 Final Arrangements was really a great read.  I absolutely LOVED each and every character in the book.  At first it was a little difficult to get the family tree down, but the more I read, the easier it was to understand. I laughed out loud at points while reading this WONDERFUL story!  It is hard to believe that the author could put such a great spin on such a morbid topic, but he managed to do it with a flair unmatched by any other author I have ever read. Absolutely in my TOP 10 Books of All Time!!!  Give yourself a treat and read this book!!
