 Wow, what a book.  It took me only an hour to read and I knew how it ended before I even started it.  This book still touched me deeply.  I can honestly say that this old professor taught me things that I never dreamt  needed teaching.  It is really so simple. It is hard to describe how much  it affected me in the few days since I read it, but it definitely has made  a subtle impact on how I deal with people and on how I feel about life in  general.Let me say that Morrie's words will continue to change my life for  the better. As the Title to the review alludes to:  If you only read 1  book, let this be the one.
