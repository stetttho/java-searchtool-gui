 I had high expectations for this one.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed.  After the first half of the book I skimmed alot of pages.  It wasn't that it was too wordy.  It was just that I didn't care about most of the characters.  The defendant on trial is pretty much just a name - we never really get to know him or care one way or the other if he lives or dies. The characters that I did like (Arthur and Gillian) were boring and predictable.  Their storyline could and SHOULD really have gone a different way. Susan - why even bring her into the book?  Another pity factor for poor, misunderstood Arthur? Murial & Larry - boring.  Their relationship was an unnecessary addition to the novel.  It did, however, make up the majority of my skimming. The only redeeming factor is the mystery behind who killed the 3 innocent people in the diner. Borrow this book from the library or some poor sap who bought it.  It is unworth your hard-earned cash.
