 Fierce People is one of the best books I have read in months.  Finn, the main character, is a wildly funny, terribly naive, extremely trusting, and hopelessly brave 15-year-old.  He finds himself in situations he can't control and comes out of each of them smelling like a rose.  While reading this book, I thought I knew each and every character personally.  But, the author threw a twist in every now and then, which increased my fascination with the entire population of Vlyvalle all the more. This book draws you in from page one and doesn't loosen its grip until the end.  The climax of the book is a nailbiter!  I couldn't put this one down.  I REALLY hope there is a sequel!!  I would love to read more about Finn and the entire "tribe"!
