 This is great time saving device.  I like the fact that I can just tap my finger on the unit and im logged into whatever page requires a log in.  The initial web site login setup takes a few seconds and your done.  The next visit its already saved and tap away and your in no more typing all those passwords and logins.   It does have a few flaws though but nothing major.  The editing of sites needs a bit of work as its a bit of work if you need to edit a sites login information.  Also, when you reboot your pc the device takes a while to initialize and sometimes its just faster to type in your xp login.    This device works as promised and for the most part I am very pleased with it.
