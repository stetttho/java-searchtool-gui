 This bouncer is very nice but it doesnt bounce.  We received it at our baby shower and I was dissapointed that it didnt bounce and the vibration wasnt very strong.  My baby didnt like it very much.  I ended up returning it.  Its a very nice item and very soft and confy.  If you dont mind that it doesnt bounce then its perfect for you.
