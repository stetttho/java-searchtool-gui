 This charger/battery combo is great.  I use the batteries for all electronic devices and they last pretty long compared to regular batteries.  I have used them in remotes, mice, keyboards, cameras, game controllers, and so on and I have to say that they stand up to our heavy electronic usage needs.  The charger door is a bit annoying but you can pry it off if you want to.  Other than that this device is well worth the money and works great.  I do recommend replacing all your regular batteries with these and you save so much money in the long run.  Buy extra batteries and you wont regret it.
