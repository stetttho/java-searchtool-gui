 I just purchased the Cannon Pixma IP90 Printer and needed it to be a mobile printer.  This product was the answer to all of my needs.  It was easy to assemble right out of the box.  Assembly consisted of opening up the housing and inserting the battery.  You then attached the housing/battery pack to the back of the printer and tightened it up with very large screws that were attached to the battery pack.  You then have the option to attach the supplied cradle which will hold the printer in an upright position and plug in the ac adapter which came with the printer to the battery pack to charge it or you can leave the stand off and lay the printer down and attach the ac adapter that way.  The intial charge on the dead battery took a couple of hours but after that you are good to go.  The battery lasts pretty long as well.
