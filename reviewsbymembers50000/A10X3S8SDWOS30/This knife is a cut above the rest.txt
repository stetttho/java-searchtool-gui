 I bought this knife to replace an older electric knife I owned.  I am into baking breads and other cooking and my old knife had this big screw at the end of it to hold the two blades together and it wouldnt go into my bread slicing guide very easily and it was just a real chore to cut a slice of bread.  So, I started to look for another knife and I came across this one.  I was a bit leary with the price and all but decided to buy it anyway.  I have to say that this knife cuts through the bread so easily and it doesnt get caught on the slicing guide like the other one did and there are hardly any crumbs.  The blades are thin but sturdy and the screw/bolt that holds them togther is small and doesnt get into the way of cutting anything.  I havent used the meat knife yet but I am sure I wont be disappointed judging from how the bread knife works.  The stand is really nice too.  I just sit the stand on my counter and all the parts stay on it.  I keep the knife plugged in at all times and use the safety switch to turn it on and off.  The safety switch is really great to have since I have children and it wont work if the switch is activated.  The colors go great and match with my kitchen and other appliances which are black and silver as well.  The only complaint I have with this machine is that the handle part is a tad bit large for my hand.  I have very small hands and I cant hold it at the end.  I have to hold it very close to the silver band at the beginning of the handle.  Other than that the machine is excellent.  I highly recommend this machine.  You get what you pay for and this is no exception.
