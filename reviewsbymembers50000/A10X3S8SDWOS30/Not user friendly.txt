 This carrier seems to be a great idea and does provide you with hands free carrying of your baby and that in itself is a god sent.  I have problems getting my baby in and out of it.  The snaps or clips that are on the side of seat part are a pain to get on or off.  I can never get them on or off without a struggle and often end up just giving up and loading baby from the top and pulling him out when were done using it.  Overall its a great idea but those clips need some work or a better design would be great.  Overall its a great carrier and doesnt put a whole lot of strain on my back and its fairly easy to slip on and off if you leave some of the straps fastened all the time.  I am petite 5'1 and dont have any height issues with it at all.
