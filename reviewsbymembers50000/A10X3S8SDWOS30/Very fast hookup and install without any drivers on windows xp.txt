 If you have windows xp and this device you will be so happy to see how fast you will install this unit.  You just plug it in and it installs in minutes without any drivers to install or download.  It works with 12 different media types and its very stylish as well.  It stands up on a stand or lays flat on your desk.  The yellow light that stays on can be a bit annoying but other than that this device is wonderful.
