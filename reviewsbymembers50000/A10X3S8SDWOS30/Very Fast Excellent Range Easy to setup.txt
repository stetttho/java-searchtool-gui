 This router replaced a wireless b network running at 11mbps.  I now get 108mpbs on my laptop which uses the srx card and my desktop gets 54mbps (desktop has regular G pci card installed)with excellent reception to both devices.  The desktop is approximately 50 or more feet away from the router and the laptop can go anywhere and still have excellent reception.  The router was easy to install and configure to my cable internet connection and the router setup was easy as well.  You will not be dissapointed with this device at all!  Your network will be blazing with this router and its srx accessories for the rest of your devices.
