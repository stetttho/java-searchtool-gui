 I installed this into my pc using a slot that was 3 slots away form my dvi slot (digital lcd monitor connection) and it caused horrible interference that whenever I would reboot the pc the monitor would go out for most of the reboot and blink and then eventually come back on.  I tried moving the supplied antenna around and no luck.  The reception was not that great either and I ended up having to buy a separate external antenna.  With the external antenna it finally doesnt make my monitor go out but all in all i ended up spending very close to $100 dollars to make my desktop wireless.  As far as the speedboost I dont have anything to compare it to because I upgraded my whole network from a wireless b to the g and anything is better than the b.  Also, my router is a linksys srx and it has higher reception and works at 108 mbps standard so the network is fast to begin with.  I only purchased this device because the srx version was out of stock.  Once the srx version comes back into stock this device will be a spare for customers pcs in the shop to connect to the wireless lan.
