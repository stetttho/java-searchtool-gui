 I saw this machine at amazon.com because I was searching for a hand held blender to mash up my fruit to make my jams with.  I saw this particular model and thought it would be great to have.  The price was a bit high and I fought with myself for a few days on if I should buy it or not.  My father had bought me a hand held blender for a house warming present when I moved into my first apartment and I used it till it died.  I was looking for a good replacement.  I finally after a few days ordered it.  I had it delivered 2nd day and it came on the 2nd day.  I opened the box and immediatley started to use it.  I have to say that I have used it to mash strawberries, apricots, bananas, grapes, apples and many other fruits right in the pan and in a few seconds.  I have used all the accessories for many different things.  I use the large container for making drinks, shakes, and for large portions of nuts to be chopped.  The smaller one is great for a cup or so of ingredients.  Both the small and large containers have a rubber base that double as a lid when you want to cover the container (I am having a slight problem with the base staying on the large container bottom though, once I lift the container the base will stay on the counter).  I used the wisk and beaker for homemade mayo, and salsa and they turned out great.  I thought for sure that the ice crusher wouldnt work that great but I was wrong it did work and crushed quite a bit of ice about 3 cups or so.  The stand was great too.  I installed it on the wall and when I am done using the blender I place it back into the stand.  I keep it plugged in at all times and it is just hanging there ready to be used.  I have only had this machine for about a month now so I am sure I will be using it for other things as well.  It is a great buy and I am very happy with this purchase.  The machine is very powerful, easy to clean, and all parts are dishwasher safe.  I strongly recommend this product to others.
