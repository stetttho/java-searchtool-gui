 I purchased this ebook online and agree with the previous people who were dissappointed with it.  I was pretty upset to find that the letters were not very professional at all.  They indeed would be ok for a quick note but other than that i dont see any use for it.  I needed help with a bid proposal and was shocked to find that the letter was a one page three paragraph letter.  It was not at all professional and would definately not win me a bid.  And last but not least, you couldnt even copy and paste text because the text is not text.  Its scanned and therefore you cant copy and paste into a word doc.  I just wasted $.. for nothing.  Oh well a lesson learned.
