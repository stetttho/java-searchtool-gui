 This toothbrush is by far the best one yet from oralb.  I have used quite a few different models of their automatic rechargeable and battery operated toothbrushes and this one is the best by far.    The brush cleans so well that you feel as if you got a professional cleaning from your dentist.  My children also love it as it cleans their teeth much better than the manual brushes.  I gave it only 4 stars because my unit had a dent/scratch on the lcd screen.  It seems as if it got bumped or something internally.  It doesnt have any affect on the toothbrush as far as i can see so far but who knows.  I was too lazy to return it for a replacement.
