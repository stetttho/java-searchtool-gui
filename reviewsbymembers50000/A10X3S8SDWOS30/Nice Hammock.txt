 The hammock was pretty large and the pocket to store it was a good idea as well.  The only complaint I would have to say I had was that there wasnt any rope to hang it with like what was stated in the description.  There was about 4 inches or so of tie with an S shaped clip on the end.  No rope.  I ended up having to go to the local home depot and spend $10 on some rope to hang it.
