 Upon receiving this item along with the IP90 printer I had no idea where it should be installed into the printer.  The printer was brand new and I no clue so I called tech support and one guy had no idea where to install it and he was actually getting frustrated with me because he wanted to just brush me off and get off the call asap but I wasnt having it after spending over $500 on a printer and its bluetooth and other accessories.  The 2nd tech support guy was a bit better at handling the call but had me do some things here and there and because I was already tired and frustrated I wasnt paying attention and the end result was a completly disabled pc.  The tech guy had me uninstall the printer and software and somewhere in between the computer wasnt able to boot back up to windows at all.  I spent the next month reinstalling everything from scratch.
