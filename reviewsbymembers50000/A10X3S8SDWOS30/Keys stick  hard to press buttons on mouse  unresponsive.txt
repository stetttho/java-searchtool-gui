 I was a long time user of the wireless natural keyboard and it broke and I was looking for a replacement.  I purchased this keyboard thinking it was going to be a good keyboard and boy was I wrong.    First of all if you are familiar with the natural keyboards they are the ones that have the split keyboard and the keys in the center are at least an inch away from eachother in the center.  the comfort keyboard is not split in the center its just curved and is supposed to feel the same but it doesnt.  I typed about two emails and my hands were already hurting.    The mouse is also bad.  The buttons are very hard or stiff.  I was having to press very hard to get the buttons to work.  The scroll button was very hard as well.  I had the scroll button programed to use as a back button and it hardly ever registered the function.    I had to return this keyboard and instead purchased an upgraded version of my original keyboard which is now the microsoft wireless natural multimedia keyboard with matching wireless intellimouse explorer 2.0.  I am so happy with this keyboard and my hands are fine now even after typing this long review.
