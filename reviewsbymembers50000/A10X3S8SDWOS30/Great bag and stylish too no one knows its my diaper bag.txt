 This bag is awsome.  I bought this bag because I am a very busy person and just wanted a bag that I could just throw on and this is it.  This bag has enough room for a lot of stuff and the compartments are so thought out including the thermal bottle holder on the side.  The bottle holder will hold an 8oz bottle and it zips shut.  There is also a mesh bottle holder on the side of the bag for my pepsi that I never leave home without (need that caffeine).  This bag is the best diaper bag I have ever owned and I am extremely happy with it.  But it you wont be dissapointed.
