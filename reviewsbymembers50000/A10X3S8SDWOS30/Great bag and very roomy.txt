 I bought this bag because of the reviews from previous posters.  I was not dissapointed at all this bag is awsome.  I can fit everything in it and still have room for my stuff.  I keep this bag in my mini van all the time filled with all the essential emergency baby stuff.  I used to take it with me everywhere but it was a bit bulky and heavy with all the stuff in it so I opted to leave it in the van instead.  I usually like to have two baby bags anyway one for short trips which I take in and out of the house and one that stays in the van for longer trips.  This bag is designed with the mom in mind for sure and its a great bag.  I would definately recommend it for anyone who has to haul a bunch of stuff around.  For short trips I recommend the baby inovations messenger bag.  I use the baby sling bag for short trips and its awsome as well.
