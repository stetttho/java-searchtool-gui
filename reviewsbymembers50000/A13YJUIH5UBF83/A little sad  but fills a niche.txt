 I suppose if you are a person with little to no education, one who has never read any of the classics of either eastern or western spirituality, and are easily impressed either through lack of intellect or lack of experience, you could find this book "profound." Sad, really, because it is so simplistic and so obviously marketed toward new age "seekers." Here's some advice: try a little harder, reach a little deeper. Read Chuang Tzu, The Rule of St. Benedict, The Cloud of Unknowing, Julian's Showings, Teresa of Avila. . .you'll see what drivel this book really is.  And not only is it drivel, much of it is nonsense. The bit about not taking anything personally really stands out. The author contends that nothing is about us--nothing is our fault. If someone criticizes you it is because of their reality and has no bearing on yours. I'm sorry but sometimes it IS about you. Sometimes we do something wrong and this makes the people around us justifiably angry. In that case it IS about us and we DO need to change our behavior.  This book is perfect for people who want to believe that all the problems in their lives have been brought about by the actions of others. Who want to be told that there is nothing at all that they need to change about themselves. That they simply need to do their best (something that can change from day to day) and ignore what anyone else says because other people only occupy their own dream worlds and do not occupy our own. What a pathetic excuse for a life philosophy.
