 If you like bluegrass you simply MUST buy this album. Dolly's voice is strong and clear. I think my favorite song has got to be "Marry Me."  She's got the innocent optimism of the song nailed, but somehow without making it condescending, and despite the upbeat tempo, she conveys the sadness in the fact that we're only that naive once in our lives and for a very short time.  This is the best album I've heard in a long time.  Dolly shows that she's no hillbilly joke--but a true musician and a great singer. A flawless album.
