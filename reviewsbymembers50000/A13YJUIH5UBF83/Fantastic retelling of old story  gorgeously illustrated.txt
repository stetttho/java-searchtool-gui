 This book is a favorite in our household and both my daughter and my son love it.  The story is retold in such a way that it actually "makes sense." It is exciting--but never overly scary.  The illustrations are absolutely stunning.  They remind me of Modigliani in their simplicity and grace.  If you think all children's books should be illustrated in the "Disney-style" then you may not like this one, but I found the style both unusual and lovely.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone with children aged 4-10.
