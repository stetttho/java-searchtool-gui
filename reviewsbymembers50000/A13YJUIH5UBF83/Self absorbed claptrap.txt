 I was given this book as a gift, and it looked fascinating.  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with it. It is hard to follow, has no clear trajectory, and is full of italics representing the author's (supposedly verbatim) thoughts on the snake handlers.  His tone in these italics is mocking, yet somehow he so admires these people that he becomes a snake handler himself.  The snake handlers are (except for Aline) vile, judgemental, ignorant and violent.  Their theology is laughable. Fine, they get themselves worked up into spiritual ecstasy by dancing around, singing and babbling, etc. Standard group hysteria stuff.  Big deal. Nothing new there. Somehow, and it is not clear how, Covington is drawn to these awful people, and wants to become one of them.  He gets to be the hero at the end when he is cast out for standing up for the rights of women. Imagine that. Everything these people do, everything they say is loaded with import for Covington.  He was "meant" to pick up a snake-handling hitchiker on the side of the road. Immediately Covington concludes that this hitchiker is a Christ figure, an outcast among his own people. It's all fate, each time he wanders down a dusty road he is somehow being "drawn" to the place.  Blah, blah blah.  With its extra-wide margins and triple-spaced text, this insubstantial piece would have been better left for a long magazine article in some journal of the personal spiritual quest.  Just glad I didn't spend my own money on it.
