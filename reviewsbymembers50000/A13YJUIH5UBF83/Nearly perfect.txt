 What a novel, nearly perfect in its scope, metaphors, characterization.  A portrait of New York City, 1970, a dying marriage.  Particularly good is the chapter describing Sophie's affair of several years earlier, and the description of the Long Island caretaker's family. I can't believe I never read this before.  Fantastic.
