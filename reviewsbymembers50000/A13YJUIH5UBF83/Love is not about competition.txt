 I am a mother of two small children (ages 3 and 1) and I do not like this book.  Several people have given it to us as gifts and I have gotten rid of it.  It is about a competition between a parent and a child about who loves whom more.  Love is not about competition--this book is nothing more than a game of "one-upsmanship" between family members.  In our family we love each other without trying to quantify it.  This book has been extremely overrated in my opinion and I don't understand why.  I don't think its lesson is one parents should be imparting to their children
