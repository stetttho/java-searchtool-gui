 A few impressions of Atonement:  The characterization of the adolescent Briony is stunning.  She wonders, at one point, if *everyone* is just as aware of their being as she is.  McEwan's depiction of burgeoning consciousness in an adolescent mind is, I think, nearly unparalleled. I am not a fan of war literature, but McEwan's lengthy description of the miserable retreat of British troops from France during WW II is wrenching without ever being maudlin, sentimental, or gratuitously violent. It is the chaos of war and its humanity that he describes so well. This book was difficult to read yet impossible to put down. I found myself with the book on my lap at work, trying to sneak passages when I could.  I can't imagine any serious reader being disappointed with this book.
