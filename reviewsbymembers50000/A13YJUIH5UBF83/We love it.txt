 My 2 year old adores this book. The illustrations are wonderful and they rhyming story is imaginative in just the way that toddlers are imaginative. It doesn't really make a whole lot of sense but so what!? Our favorite part is when the baby goes to sleep in his shoe and he's "So dozy, so cozy, so tickety-boo" We don't know what tickety-boo is but we love to say it. This is really really cute book.
