 this is the book for you. Strauss knows that as soon as anyone hears that Chang and Eng were married and had 21 children between them the possible "mechanics" of that situation immediately spring to mind. Strauss does not let the reader down--he describes their sex lives vividly and dwells extensively on Chang's problem with alcohol. For all that though, I found some of the characters strangely flat.  Eng's wife Sarah was not in a scene in the entire book when she did not complain about stomach problems. It was repetitive in the extreme.  Chang's alcoholism also was described so often and in such detail that it became monotonous. I found the narrative structure very choppy, as it jumped between their lives as young men and the present lives they led as old men and slaveholders. An okay book, but deeply flawed in many ways.
