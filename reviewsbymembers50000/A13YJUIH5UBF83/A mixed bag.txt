 I am 33 years old and a true Willie Nelson fan (but not a country music fan per se)  I love Willie's activism almost as much as I love his voice.  He is a true original.  This book was, above all, a chance to get inside Willie's head for a while--and I enjoyed that.  And while I will disagree with the reviewer who called him "a genius,"  I still think the book was worth reading.  Most of the jokes were funny, the lyrics are moving, and once in a while, Willie really hits his stride (the section about Farm Aid was fantastic) The book is worth looking at if only for the photographs of Willie and his family and friends. I love Willie, and chances are if you're even thinking of buying this book you do too.  It's not great literature, but it's entertaining most of the time.  Go ahead and buy it, what the heck?
