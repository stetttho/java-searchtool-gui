 If you like stories like this, you can get them for around [price] at the supermarket checkout. Except for the fact that it was published in hardcover, this book has no discernible differences from the pulp romance genre.  A young 23 year old woman, engaged to be married, undergoes a life-altering transition when her young, dashing fiancee becomes paralyzed!  She escapes her contrained life by fleeing to New York and taking another lover--she also pursues her dream of becoming a fashion designer.. . .the sex scenes (frequent) are hilarious--full of euphemisms like "he pressed 'himself' into her"--also reminiscent of the Harlequin romance-genre.  As a bland, predictable romance--it's okay.  But to somehow claim that this book approaches "good literature" is just plain wrong. If you're in the mood for this kind of book--toss it in the shopping cart with the milk and eggs.
