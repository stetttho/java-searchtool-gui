 I bought this toy for my 15 month old son.  His sister covers her ears whenever her brother touches it.  It is LOUD.  Mildy interesting in that it chugs across the floor but the "educational" component is negligible.  It instructs children to "connect Elmo to Ernie" for example but it is difficult to connect the cars and even older children have trouble doing it much less the toddlers to whom the toy is marketed...
