 I picked this book up at random, having heard nothing about it, and I was not disappointed.  The spare but expressive style of the narrative is well-suited to its subject:  a landscape and a people whose surface belies all that is happening underneath. The characterization of the brothers, Luke and Matt, and the narrator, Katie is excellent.  The only exception being the little sister, Bo (the only character based on a real person) whose depiction is, for some reason, flat and one-dimensional. All in all though, this book is very well written.  A good story, and worth reading.
