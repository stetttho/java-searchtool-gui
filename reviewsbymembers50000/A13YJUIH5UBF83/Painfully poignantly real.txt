 This book was a real gem. I won't rehash the plot but just give a few impressions. The relationship of Michael and Pauline was utterly believable. We understand their attraction and the reason for their marriage. We understand their unhappiness but see that in the midst of it there is real love, and real happiness. The description of Michael and Pauline's divorce is when the book is at its best. Michael leaves Pauline--and it would be perfectly plausible for him to return--there was much to salvage in the marriage. They never even tried marriage counseling! But it is is also perfectly plausible that he not return. As is typical of Tyler's novels, each character is painstakingly and meticulously realized, so that the reader is left with the feeling that she has recently been visiting with friends. A lovely book with much to say about marriage and family, love and loss.
