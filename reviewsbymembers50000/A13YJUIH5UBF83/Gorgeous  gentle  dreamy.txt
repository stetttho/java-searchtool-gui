 My son's very first word was "boat!" and now that he is 2 he is still fascinated by them.  We were given this book as a gift and we love it.  The pictures are beautiful.  The text starts out informatively, naming and describing different types of boats--but towards the end it becomes fanciful, as the boats "sail among the stars" and the child falls asleep.  If you have a little boat-lover in your family, or even if you don't-yet, this book will not disappoint you.
