 This book is great.  It sorts the names into all kinds of useful categories and is filled with interesting quotes and facts about naming.  The section on African-American names is incredibly enlightening and  essential reading for anyone who has ever been critical of African-American  naming practices.  It is also a great book for naming a second or third  child--as you can easily get ideas for names which "go with" your  other children's names.  The authors tastes in names in impeccable.  If you  like trashy or trendy names this book is NOT for you--but if you are  looking for a meaningful, classy, solid name for your child I would highly  recommend this book
