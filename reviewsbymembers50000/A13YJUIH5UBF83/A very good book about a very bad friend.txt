 Like other reviewers, I was both fascinated and confused by this memoir. On the one hand, it is exceedingly well-written and compelling. Patchett paints a vivid portrait of her friend Lucy Grealy and their relationship with one another. But Lucy Grealy is not a nice person. She is selfish, insecure, petulant and judgemental. She used Patchett, from the very first moment of their friendship, and continued to use her for the rest of her life. I wondered as I read this book what reason, other than sheer masochism, Patchett had for staying with Lucy. But Patchett was not the only one. Many people were attracted to Lucy Grealy and devoted themselves to her slavishly. Was she a charity project? Did her disfigurement make people feel better about themselves? Clearly her disfigurement gave her license to behave in ways that would not have been tolerated had she looked like everyone else. Perhaps, in the end, the way Lucy treated those around her was payback for the fact that she knew they would not have been her friend at all without her misshapen face.   In this book Lucy is undeniably spoiled and pathologically self-centered. Many people face physical hardship and are ultimately able to transcend it and to look outward toward a world that is full of suffering. Lucy seemed never to be able to do this. She thought only of herself and her pain. She cared only about being loved, not loving. If she had been able to look around her and see that the whole world is suffering, she might have spent some of her energy working to alleviate the suffering of others rather than thinking endlessly of her own. And she might have been a happier person for it. She might even have lived.
