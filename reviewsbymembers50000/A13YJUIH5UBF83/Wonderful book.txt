 We picked this book randomly at the library and have since bought it because it is so wonderful.  The pictures are arresting and artistic while still very appealing to the young child. The story is cute and amusing and is about sharing and problem solving.  My daughter is 3 and she absolutely loves this book and has memorized the whole thing.  I recommend it for any child from age 2 on up.
