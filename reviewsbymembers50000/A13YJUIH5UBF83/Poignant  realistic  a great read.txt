 I very much enjoyed this collection of short stories.  Each one had at least one phrase or passage that was so succinct, so perfect, almost an exact description of a feeling or thought that the reader probably thought he or she was the only one to have ever had.  The characters are believeable, complex, 3 dimensional.  Each story was a little package that I wanted to savor before going on to the next.  A strong collection.
