 Although this book has its flaws (namely placing Gillian at the heart of every single thing that happens to Macbeth) this book was still definitely worth reading.  I loved the descriptions of medieval Scotland, and the castles and the lives of the kitchen staff. It inspired me to reread Macbeth which I hadn't done for at least 10 years, and it really served to "flesh out" the story. I recommend it highly--especially to any Shakespeare fan.
