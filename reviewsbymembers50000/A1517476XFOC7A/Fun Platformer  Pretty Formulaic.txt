 I have loved Asterix and Obelix ever since, as a child, I read the comics in French class.  When I heard that this game was coming out after a moderate European release, I had to pick it up right away.  Other reviews were tepid, likely because this game adds nothing new to the platforming genre.  It's full of "collect 30 helmets" and "beat up x number of Roman soldiers", and you get to alternate between Asterix (fast and nimble) and Obelix (strong and powerful).  The graphics are cute, the sound is appropriate.  I find the humor in the comics (e.g. making fun of Latin) funny, and it is carried into this game.
