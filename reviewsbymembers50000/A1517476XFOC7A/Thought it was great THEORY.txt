 If you want to use this book as a cookbook to help you create better Win apps, then it is dated. If you want some of the vision behind the trends in Windows architecture, then it is great. Despite the advent of Swing with Java and Visual Studio.NET, the principles of GUI design have not really changed, and Alan Cooper's wisdom is still directly applicable! Easy to read, very interesting.
