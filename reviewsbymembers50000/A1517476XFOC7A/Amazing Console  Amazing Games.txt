 I love Nintendo, and bought a GameCube long before I bought a PS2.  After a year, I realized that the library for the PS2 is much, much broader, and that the games tend to be cheaper (probably because there are many more PS2s on the market).  The front-loading CD tray makes it very easy to stack your PS2 among other systems/VCRs/DVD players.  Just be warned that the on-off switch is in the back of the system, so I usually stack mine on the top of other devices to be able to reach it.  The audio and graphics are decent, and provide good game experiences in the hands of talented developers.  There are a lot of games only on PS2 (e.g. Final Fantasy, original releases of GTA, Downhill Domination, Mr. Mosquito, Parappa), and its backward compatibility with PS1 games makes it very easy to find cheap games.  I'm very happy with my PS2, and will keep it for many years to come.
