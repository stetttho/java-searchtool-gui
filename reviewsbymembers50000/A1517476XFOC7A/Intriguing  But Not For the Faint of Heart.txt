 This is the first Patricia Cornwell book I have read, but I enjoy reading true crime novels as well as historical fiction. I have been fascinated by the Jack the Ripper murders for quite a long time, because the perpetrator was never brought to justice.  I have not read any other "Jack the Ripper" books, because none appeared to be more than intellectual rhetoric and conjecture. Through the frenzied prose, one can tell that Cornwell not only studied the Ripper, but has truly vested herself in finding the truth.  She has brought together a collection of research never studied by one person, and added scientific testing (including DNA) to further her cause. The only warning I have is that the subject matter is dark.  You may have read true crime before, watched the Sopranos, and seen shows about the Ripper on the History Channel, as I have.  The depths of depravity that Cornwell's suspect is purported to have sunk will still amaze and horrify you.  There were evenings where I could not sleep because my heart was racing and my stomach was churning from disgust over the atrocities that were committed not only in the Ripper murders, but several other murders that Cornwell alludes may have been caused by her suspect. Despite the gore, I couldn't put it down.  An excellent read.
