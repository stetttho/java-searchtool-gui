 Just read this book as part of an IT Policy course.  Although this edition does not come with the cases, we downloaded cases from Harvard Business School directly.  The three authors are very well known, McFarlan having developed much of the theory in use in the field of IT policy management.  The material is readily consumable, and it contains enough explanation of the technical jargon to satisfy even the most Luddite reader.  I found that the book did a very good job of outlining concerns in today's IT field: outsourcing, project management, security, and IT portfolio managment, as well as key business theory like Porter's five forces and McFarlan's strategic grid.  If you need to know about the theory of IT strategic management, this book is for you.  If you need real-world examples, I recommend buying the hardcover version that includes the cases.  The only reason I do not award this book five stars is because the layout of the book is very 80s; the font is small and the overall look and feel is very dated.
