 I've always loved Nintendo controllers.  Until recently, that was because I could only afford 1 system.  Now that I own all 3 "next-gen" systems, I can safely say that the GameCube controller fits best in my hands.  All of the face buttons are in easy reach, but that isn't the case for the "Z" button, inconveniently located on the top right of the controller.  Seemingly squished between the R and the face, this button is not used by all games, but is a pain to try to hit without straining your hands.  The right "C" stick is another odd addition.  Featuring heavily in games like "Luigi's Mansion", this control pales in comparison to the analog sticks of the XBox or PS2, or even with the directional pad of days gone by.  That being said, this is a first-party controller, and your movements on it are translated precisely to the game you are playing.  Since many games only require use of the left joystick and the face buttons, the above concerns will not reduce your enjoyment of the controller for all games.  I'm happy with my controller, I just hope that the next Nintendo's controller has all buttons within easy reach.
