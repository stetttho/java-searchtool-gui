 This text is very thorough in its overview of IT project management.  Through with the book website, several templates are offered to assist you in managing and developing projects.  The author does a good job of highlighting major issues in each project area, and includes several exercises taking you through each step of the project management process. Be warned, the book is more of a textbook than a practioner read as there are too few real world examples to be an easy read for non-students.
