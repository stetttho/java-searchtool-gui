 With today's computers inevitably connected to the Internet, it is crucial that you put a virus scanner your PC.  It is also key to get regular updates.  Norton has one of the best virus software packages available, and I didn't find it difficult to install at all (mind you, I'm an IT professional, so I am not saying it would be easy for everyone).  I don't recommend all of the other Norton products (e.g. Firewall, SystemWorks) for beginners, because configuring them takes quite a bit of work and it is not for novices.  Don't confuse this virus software with packages that include other, more complex software.  I have relied on this software at home and work for the last 4 years, and it is part of the reason that I have been virus free!  Make sure you enable LiveUpdate and regularly scan your machine!
