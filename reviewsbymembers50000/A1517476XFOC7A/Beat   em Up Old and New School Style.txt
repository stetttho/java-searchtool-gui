 I haven't been into fighting games since the mid-90s, but I picked up DJFFNY because I was really interested in the ability to customize your own fighter and many of the celebrities you can play as this game.  You create your own fighter, customizing everything from skin tone to hair color.  If you aren't the creative type, or just want to start playing, you can choose one of the pre-made characters.  Within the story mode of the game, you unlock additional clothing, jewelery, tattoos, and haircuts as you win matches against opponents.  You also unlock development points (similar to those in SSX 3 or Tony Hawk) which can then be used to develop  your physique, your moves, and your fighting style.  The soundtrack is great, as are the graphics and the voiceovers.  There is a lot of blood whenever you smack someone around, and the sound effects when you clobber your opponent with a bottle or a pipe really sound painful.  The one thing that suprised me was the amount of swearing used.  I'm not a prude, but does there really need to be a four-letter word used every time someone sends you an email?
