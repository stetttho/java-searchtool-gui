 Rockstar has used the previous Grand Theft Auto games to redefine the action genre.  The storyline is substantially larger than previous titles.  While GTA3 took place in Liberty City (New York) in the 1970s, GTA:VC expanded the playable area in Vice City (Miami) in the 1980s.  GTA:SA takes place in California and Nevada in the 1990s, and, for the first time, allows you to travel between three major cities (Los Santos (LA), San Fierro (San Francisco), and Las Venturas (Las Vegas)).  Some of the new features in this game are: 1) the ability to ride bicycles, combines, and many other new vehicles. 2) swimmming!  No more flailing and drowning! 3) Driving between the 3 cities, through hillbilly country 4) Can physically alter your character with tattoos, haircuts. 5) You are what you eat: you can gain and lose weight! 6) Flying airplanes, from remote control to jumbo jets  I really am enjoying this game, having played well over 50 hours and completed less than 70% of it.  The main storyline takes well over 30 hours to complete, and that is only if you don't do any of the side missions (taxis, ambulances, pimping, firetrucks, vigilante, trucking, etc.)  The storyline is very involving, and your character has more depth than earlier games.  (Heck, in GTAIII your character couldn't even talk!)
