 Please know that I love Nintendo, and have owned all of their major systems. GameCube was the first of this generation of systems that I bought (I now own a PS2 and an XBox). I love Nintendo games, so I am happy with it. If I had to choose only one system, this would not be it.   Pros:  * Nintendo's own games (e.g. Legend of Zelda, Super Smash Bros. Melee, Metroid, Paper Mario) are some of the best in the industry.  * The graphics and audio power of this unit are amazing.  * The system is very portable, complete with a handle for carrying.  * The controller is very ergonomic and easy to use.   Cons:  * Many major titles have not been brought to GameCube, even if they are on XBox AND PS2.  * The system requires that you purchase memory cards, and a hard drive is not available.  * Online gaming is not available (I think there might be one game), and is not encouraged by Nintendo.
