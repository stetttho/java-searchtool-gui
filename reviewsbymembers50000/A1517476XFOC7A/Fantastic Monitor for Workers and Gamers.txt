 My work was kind enough to splurge and buy me this monitor to slave writing code in front of 8+ hours a day.  I have to say that I am very pleased with it.  The picture quality is phenomenal and consistent from the moment the monitor powers up.  It also has a "power saver" mode that kicks in as soon as the machine is idle or if the video signal is disconnected.  It comes with 3 factory-preset brightness levels, the brightest being able to work comfortably in the dark.  You can also manually set the brightness to a custom level which the monitor will remember.  Physically, the footprint of this monitor is quite small.  It is a flat panel, with a roughly 8" silver-grey metal base that is itself flat.  This allows me to put papers or my keyboard over it without any difficulty.  The monitor's angle adjusts roughly 85 degrees to 100 degrees (from the horizontal), which is excellent if different people will be using the monitor.  My only caveat is that the top emits quite a bit of concentrated heat, so the monitor should not be placed in an enclosed space.
