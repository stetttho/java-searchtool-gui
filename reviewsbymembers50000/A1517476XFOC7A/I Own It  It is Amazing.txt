 I just bought one for myself over the weekend (thanks to a tip from a friend who works at a store that one would not think of shopping for games at, and they just happened to have a few left!)  This unit is great!  I already own a GBA SP, but wanted to buy a DS for the following reasons:  * Advanced graphics:  The 3D capabilities of this machine are AMAZING.  Mario64 DS looks better on a handheld than Mario 64 looked on the Nintendo 64 and a TV!  * Great sound:  You can choose between surround sound, stereo, or headphones optimized.  It also includes a built-in headphone jack, something that was noticeably absent from the SP.  * Backwards compatibility: It will play all GameBoy Advance games (though not original GB or GB Color), and can hold a DS game and a GameBoy Advance game at the same time.  * Touch screen:  Gimmick or revolution?  I like how touch was integrated into Mario64 and  the Metroid Prime:Hunters demo that is included with the DS.  I think future games will bear out whether it will be a true success or just a niche idea.  As it states in the product description, it comes with two screens, the bottom one being touch-sensitive.  To touch the bottom screen you can use one of the 2 styluses that comes with the product, or a thumb strap that has a plastic piece that can be used for certain types of games.  Currently, the DS library is fairly limited (fewer than 10 games at present), but there are many games announced for the future.  There are literally dozens of great GBA games, so if you're buying this as a present, don't be afraid to buy a GBA game if you can't decide on a DS one.
