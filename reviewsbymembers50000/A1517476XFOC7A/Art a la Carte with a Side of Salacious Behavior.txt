 Robertson Davies' greatest strength has always been in his ability to create a protagonist whose adventures quickly intrigue you.  One can debate the virtues of each novel in this trilogy, but the simple fact remains that as parts of a trilogy the story remains incomplete without reading all three.  Stories as intriguing as this do not often appear.  You will travel between a thinly veiled Toronto and war-torn Europe, through generations of a family and across decades of time.  A master storyteller, you will need to pay close attention (perhaps create a family tree) to understand how everyone fits together.    The literary allusions could have you researching for months, and pepper the pages with just enough spice to add creedence to the education levels of the characters.  The main thread that ties all three books together is the main character, Reverend Simon Darcourt, who is on a quest to write the biography of a philanthropist with whom he was acquainted.  To say that this is the entire story would be a gross understatement.  The plot leaves few stones unturned in the lives of its characters, who three-dimensionally number in the dozens.  Give yourself a lot of time to read this book, because once you start you won't be able to put it down.
