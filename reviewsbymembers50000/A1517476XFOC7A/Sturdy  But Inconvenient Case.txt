 This case came with my iPod, and so I tried it out for the first few weeks.  I'm not a big fan for two reasons:  1) If the case turns upside down (e.g. its on your belt and you bend over), the iPod falls out.  2) You can't push the buttons while it's in the case.  True, you can pull it up out the unopened top of the case and push the buttons, but I'm the kind of person who likes to jump around songs and albums.  I prefer cases that have fronts that you can see the buttons through and push them through.  Perhaps those types aren't as protective, but they work better for me.
