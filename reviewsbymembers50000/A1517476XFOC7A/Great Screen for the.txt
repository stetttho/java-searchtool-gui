 I was waiting to find a 30" LCD television with a brand that I know at less than $1000.  When the Westinghouse appeared, I was hesitant because WH isn't known for its televisions.  I figured I would give it a try.  The picture is great, and there are a lot of different input options (cable, S-video, computer serial port, AV).  This made it easy to hook up my cable, DVD, and video game systems without having to buy expensive adapters.  Although the resolution isn't as good as higher priced TVs, it looks good from about 10 feet away, and I am really enjoying it.
