 Wow.  I've played every Zelda (even the Game Boy incarnations), and this is another amazing addition to the list.  Whether you are 10 or 100, you will be able to enjoy a lot of fun gameplay.  Some of the puzzles are very complicated, but these are reserved to side quests and are not crucial to completing the story. I have almost completed the second set of challenges after at least 36 enjoyable hours of game time, and I still have many, many hours left to complete the side quests! The graphics are better than I had imagined, and it really is like playing a cartoon!  Miyamoto has created another excellent adventure. If you have been waiting for another good reason to buy a GameCube, this is it!
