 This is probably the best new DS game so far.  It makes excellent use of the touch screen, and has many, many games that are a lot of fun to play.  The range of games is great, with only thematic overlap with the previous WarioWare: Mega Microgame$ (for GameBoy Advance).  I think that this game is even better than the first one, as these games really lend themselves towards the stylus.  The only drawback is that the "story" mode only takes a few days to beat.  That doesn't really matter, though, because there are plenty of "toys" to unlock and extra microgames to find.
