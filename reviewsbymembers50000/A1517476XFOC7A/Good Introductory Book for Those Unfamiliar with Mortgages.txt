 I didn't know a lot about mortgages before I read this book.  I picked it up to learn more about any and all types of mortgages, and I wasn't disappointed.  This title covers all necessary terminology, even the most basic (which is great for beginners like me).  The chapters are broken into logical sequence, and the autors do a very good job of directing you to relevant related chapters (e.g. telling you to skip ahead to a later chapter if you are not thinking about certain types of mortgages).  I cannot comment on whether this book would be too basic for those familiar with the industry, but it certainly is an appropriate introduction for mortgage "dummies" like me.
