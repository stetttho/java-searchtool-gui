 Just finished this game (as it was just released), but it really is a fun RPG with hack 'n' slash action.  Unlike  games where you must choose a class (e.g. warrior, rogue, wizard) at the beginning, in Fable your "class" is defined by which attributes you use.  Not only that, but your physical appearance changes based on: which class you choose, and if you are "good" or "evil".  The fighting is more like Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time than Diablo, and it the intricacies of the enemies and the stories are amazing.  I have already started playing through a second time, as a "bad" mage.  The graphics and sound are outstanding, as is the storyline.  The only warning I have is that the main storyline is quite short.  If you ignore the side quests and don't spend extra time roaming through the countryside (which is gorgeous), then this may only be worth a rental for you.  I like that even once you finish the game, you can return to Albion as your character and just wander around, visiting places and finding treasures you hadn't seen before.
