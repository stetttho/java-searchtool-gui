 One of the only problems with GameBoy games are the small screen that they get played on.  The GameBoy player attaches to the bottom of your GameCube, and allows you to insert your games and play them on your screen.  If you're color conscious, make sure the color matches that of your GameCube, as it adds about an inch and a half below the console.  If you don't need a portable device, but want to play some of the great GameBoy games out there (WarioWare, Metroid Fusion and Zero Mission, Legend of Zeldas...), $50 is a steal!
