 I am an incredible Davies fan, and have lived and/or travelled to many of the places he writes about.  This trilogy takes place in "Salterton", a thin veiling for Kingston, Ontario, Canada, and Queen's University, located there.  Unlike his other university-set novels, Salterton features contempt for the frivolity of faculty and persons who live in a small town.  While not entirely inaccurate in his portrayal of a small university-centered Canadian town, it doesn't relish academia in the way that the Cornish trilogy does.  As always, the pages are rife with attention to detail and tangential storylines are fleshed out with loving care.  It is as if seven or eight short stories collide into three great novels.  If you enjoy these, I strongly recommend the Deptford and Cornish trilogies; both are better examples of Davies' literary gifts.
