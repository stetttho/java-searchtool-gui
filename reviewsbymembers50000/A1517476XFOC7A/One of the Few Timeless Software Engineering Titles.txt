 This book is SO good that I am not even certain that I feel honored to have the ability to rate it! The mythical man-month draws important distinctions between the management of software projects as compared to physical products (e.g. construction, car parts, etc.).  These differences include the "man-month", or what can be accomplished by one man in one month.  Drawing powerful analogies between poor software engineering (such as expecting 9 women who are newly pregnant to produce a baby in 1 month), Brooks succinctly identifies key areas of oversight made by managers. I recommend this book to all students of software engineering, technology managers, and all people who are tired of working on yet another late and over-budget project.
