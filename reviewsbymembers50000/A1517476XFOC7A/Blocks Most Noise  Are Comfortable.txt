 I bought these headphones to help me study in loud enivronments.  They block the majority of noises, including traffic, people yelling, stereo/television noise from next door.  They won't block out loud noises in the same room (e.g. loud TV or person yelling), but I think that's good because you want to be aware of dangers nearby!  I'm no audiophile, but the sound that comes through these headphones sounds just like the quality that comes out of my stereo.  They fit a little differently from most headphones, with the connecting bar fitting behind your head rather than sitting on the top of your head.  I don't know if this would affect people who wanted to use these headphones while moving (e.g. commuting or exercising), but for those of us sitting down while wearing them, they are very comfortable.
