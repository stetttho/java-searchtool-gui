 I was lucky enough to have my workplace pick these up for me. After years of working on a laptop, I was a bit wary of all the bells and whistles these two devices afford. I have quickly adjusted and find them both amazing.   The keyboard has "Favorites" buttons, which I have programmed to my five most used applications (e.g. email, browser). There is a "media center" control at the top, which allows me to quickly mute the volume, should I need to speak to someone. There are also other buttons for messenger, web pages, My Documents, the calculator, and logging off, all of which are very convenient. There is also a wrist rest built in, ensuring that your palms are high enough when typing.   The mouse has two buttons as well as a vertical and side-to-side scrolling wheel, which allow me to quickly scroll through doucments without having to move my hand. There are also two really convenient buttons under my thumb, which allow me to navigate back and forward through web pages. If you are left handed, the same buttons are available on the left hand side of the keyboard, meaning that you may not even have to take your hands off of the keyboard to do much of your navigation.   I have the wireless receiver about a foot from the mouse and the keyboard, and do not have signal trouble. There are other people who use the keyboards and mice in the same office, and we don't have any cross-signaling issues.
