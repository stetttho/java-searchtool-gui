 This book was more touchy-feely to me than practical.  I have taught extensively in the past, and do not need a book that gives me fundamental pedagogical skills -- I already possess them. I was looking for a book that would assist me in converting a course from face-to-face to online.  This book has an extensive section on the technologies required to teach online, which will be helpful to those who have never used computer before; to me, it was a waste of space. There is no discussion of merits of different instructional design methodologies, and not a lot of concrete examples of how to teach online.  This is a very light book, and I wouldn't use it anywhere except possibly to familiarize upper management with the logistics of online teaching. For those teachers/professors/instructors/educators who are going to be on the front lines of online education, you can give this book a pass.
