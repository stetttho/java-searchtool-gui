 This kit connects easily to the bottom of the iPod, and does what it advertises.  The cord is long enough that people in the backseat can manipulate it without pulling it out of the lighter socket.  If that much cord is not needed, there is a Velcro strap that can be used to keep the excess coiled up.  When it's charging the iPod, there is a green light that shines through the plastic at the end of the adapter that plugs into the lighter socket.  It makes it very easy to tell if the connection is made successfully.  Also, the whole device has a very small footprint in terms of the amount of space that it takes up when putting it into a bag with the iPod.
