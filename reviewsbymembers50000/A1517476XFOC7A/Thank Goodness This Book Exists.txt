 So I've been tasked with teaching online, but I didn't know where to begin.  Sure, I can teach decently in the classroom, but I wanted a book that would show me how to transition my existing pedagogy into a successful online course.  If you are in a similar situation, THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU! A quick look at the table of contents (available via Amazon's "look inside" feature) will reveal that this is more than a simple primer.  This is a book written by people who have online teaching experience and can give you practical advice (as the title suggests).  You can take a face-to-face course and get quite far in converting it into an online course. The only caveat I have is that many of the web links included with the book are now defunct.  Though irritating, this is not a major problem, because searching for the article or site via Google (or another search engine) you can easily find its new home.
