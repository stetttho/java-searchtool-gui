 Having taught system analysis and design in the past, and having taken courses on it, this is one of the better books out there.  The difficulty faced by the authors is that there is no "one true" methodology for analyzing and designing systems.  This book does a good job of overviewing the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC), and brings real-world examples to the table.  An on-going example does a good job of illustrating how all of the diagrams work in a real-world scenario.  This is one of the few books to give a strong overview of the entire process, and does not get mired in anecdotal monologues.  Odds are, you will need to read more than one book to understand this subject, and hands on will be needed to be able to implement the techniques used.  I have extensive programming experience, but many of my classmates had none at all, and yet we all found the book informative and interesting.
