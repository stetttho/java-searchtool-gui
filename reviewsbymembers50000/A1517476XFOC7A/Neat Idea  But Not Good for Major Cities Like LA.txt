 If you live in an area with relatively few FM stations, this transmitter would be great.  If I stay in one place, I can find a station and the reception is great -- comparable to the megawatt radio stations.  I bought this device to be able to play my iPod through my stereo in my car when I commute (50 miles across greater Los Angeles area).  Unfortunately, there isn't an appropriate station that isn't overridden throughout the entire drive.  Luckily, for cities with fewer stations, there is a utility that Griffin provides that will tell you what station(s) you should use, based on your metropolis.  Unfortunately, both stations listed for LA are in use somewhere along my drive, making this device useless for my purposes.
