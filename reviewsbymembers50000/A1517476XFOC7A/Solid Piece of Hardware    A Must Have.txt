 With games on CD and DVD and no built-in hard drive, having a memory card is a must for anyone who wants to be able to save their progress from session to session. I have always preferred to use the Sony memory cards with my system.  Call me a snob, but I prefer to use them because the manufacturer of the PS2 has to be able to maximize its hardware the best.  If you buy a Ferrari, would you then use no-name parts?  Of course not!  Spend the extra few dollars and get a good card. I have saved games for at least 10 game titles on my one card, so you don't need the "1GB" (or whatever the size of the month is) cards. Please note that this card does NOT work with PlayStation One games.  Only PS2 titles.  You'll need to buy a PSX memory card for those older titles.
