 I haven't looked forward to a GBA game that wasn't a port from NES or SNES in quite a while.  This game is a GBA original, complete with all of the side-scrolling action that made 80s/90s platformers classics in their time.  I'm not a big anime or Astroboy fan, but the story of this game sucks you right in from the beginning, explaining all that you need to know about the robot and why you are fighting your way through each level.  To complete the game and unlock all of its bonuses, you need to play through the game twice, with new levels and abilities unlocking only during the second playthrough.  There are also three difficulty settings: easy (good for first-time players and children), normal, and hard (best for veterans).  This game is good for all ages, and an absolute gem of a game.  A must own for those who like side-scrolling action!
