 This game is gorgeous, and the perspective is unique and fantastic.  Unfortunately, some controls do not translate as well from computer mouse (or gamepad) to PS2 as they could. I had such high hopes for this game, but I am just not able to use both analog joysticks, the L1/2 and R1/2 buttons, and the button pad at the same time.  Call me uncoordinated (despite the fact that I have been playing video games since before there were home video game systems!), but I don't want to give myself carpal tunnel syndrome from playing a game! I would also like to state that "bullet-time" was a neat style of visual effect in the Matrix.  It is not something I want to see in shooting games in the future, as it just adds a level of implausibility to an otherwise realistic game.
