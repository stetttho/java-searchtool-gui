 I really like the phone.  The fact that it is a flip phone keeps the screen protected from scratching.  It is very small, and takes up little space in my bag or on my belt. The case it comes with is really useful; it includes a belt clip and a small velcro strap that keeps the phone from falling out if the case is turned upside down. The pictures from the camera are decent, but become pixelated very easily if you try to email a close-up (that you have zoomed).
