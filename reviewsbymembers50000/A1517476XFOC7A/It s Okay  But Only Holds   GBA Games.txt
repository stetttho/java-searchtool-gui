 I got this case as a gift, and it's a great case if you want to take your GBA SP and a few games for a short trip.  If, like me, you like to take several games and the adapter on longer trips, it's just too small.  At most, the case can hold the GBA SP (and one game inside) and 3 additional games.  The games are stored in a little pocket on the front of the pouch, protected only by the flap.  This isn't a lot of protection, should the case fall.  The SP itself is pretty well padded in this case, as it provides enough protection for the system itself.    I have taken to using another backpack to hold additional games and the adapter, but I still put the system inside this case before putting it in the backpack.  If you want a cheap case or only have a few games, then this is the case for you!
