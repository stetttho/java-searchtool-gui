 This is the only book I used to prepare for my Sun Certified Java 2 Programmer Exam, which I passed on the first try.  I supplemented my learning with a few web sites, but the bulk of my research came from this  (relatively) inexpensive book. As a programmer with no C or C++  experience, I can safely say that this book did not require that  knowledge. I didn't notice the typos that others have talked about, and  could compile all of the examples in the book (save a very long GUI example  that tried my patience at 3am one night). Compared to the  books/publishers I have used in pursuit of Visual Basic certifications,  this book is very clear and a pleasure to read. I will continue to hold  on to this book as a valuable reference for years to come.
