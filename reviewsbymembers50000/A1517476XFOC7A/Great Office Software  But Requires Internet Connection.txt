 I love MS Office, and I assume that if you're looking at this version you are a student/teacher familiar with office applications.  2003 does not offer enough improvements over Office XP to warrant purchasing this as an upgrade.  If you have Office XP, you may want to wait until the next version comes out.  You won't be missing much!  Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and Outlook are industry standards in office applications.  You can save your documents in a variety of formats, including those that are compatible with WordPerfect, Open Office, or older systems (e.g. plain text or RTF).  The only caveat I have is that many of the features that make the 2003 version great require connection to the Internet.  If you are connecting via dial-up, or using a non-connected machine, you will not be able to access some help and some media content.
