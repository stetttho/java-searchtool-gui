 I enjoy role-playing games, and have for well over a decade. That being said, I'm not the kind of person who likes to have to learn entire new sports games or languages to figure out a game. FFX does not require that you learn all of its minutia to complete the game, but its amazing graphics and captivating storyline make you want to learn more and more about Tidus, Yuna, Wakka, and the other main characters. With the upcoming FFX-2, learning about Yuna in her first game will become all the more important.  As much as I enjoy the lush graphics and amazing storyline, it seems that FFX is continuing a trend that began with FFVII and continued. The trend to which I refer is the gradual decline in fighting and increase in short dialog sequences that are not possible to skip. In FFX the first 2 hours seem more like the FF movie than a video game. This is great in terms of graphics, but bad for those of us who like to tear into the battle schemes and destroy some baddies!  All in all, another great game that raises the graphical and plot bar for all other RPGs.
