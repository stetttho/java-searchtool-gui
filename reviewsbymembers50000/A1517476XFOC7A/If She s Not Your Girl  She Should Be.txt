 I don't know who decided that this album would be a strong follow-up to "i do not want what i haven't got", but they made a terrible marketing mistake that will likely leave Sinead a one-album wonder. (Okay, okay, some of her antics likely had a hand in her decline in popularity, but I digress). This album is one of the most relaxing albums I have heard in a long time. Not afraid to stretch the range of her voice, O'Connor allows her voice to show vulnerability as well as passion. When I first saw the playlist I thought that she must have chosen this as a quick way to throw out an album after her commercial success, but her interpretation of these songs shows both practice and perseverance. Once you start listening, you will first marvel that it is Sinead, then forget that it is and simply enjoy.
