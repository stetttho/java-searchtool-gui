 I have read all of the books, which is an imperative prerequisite before embarking upon this, the most recent book.  The storyline is taken to new heights in this volume, bring back all of your favorite characters, ghosts, and Muggles.  I am sure that you have heard that there are serious plot developments in this, Harry's second to last year at Hogwarts, and I will not reveal them in this review.  It suffices to say that Rowling has remained faithful in developing her characters, and their connection to the reader is deepened as they grow and mature in this novel.  I really enjoyed this book and am looking forward to the conclusion of the series.
