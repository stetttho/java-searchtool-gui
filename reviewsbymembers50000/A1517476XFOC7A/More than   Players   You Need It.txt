 Putting aside the debate as to whether or not the PS2 SHOULD have included more controller ports, one needs to accept the fact that it only comes with 2. I like the MultiTap in that it is made by SONY itself, and is both reliable and durable.  I only give it 4 stars because the short cord makes it difficult for those of us who prefer to have our PS2 stored on the second shelf of a cabinet (I have to put a small table underneath to keep the weight of the MultiTap from damaging the input slot). I would have preferred either a plug in piece that adheres to the front of the PS2 (perhaps uding both controller ports for support) or a much longer cord.  As it stands now, I may have to buy a controller extension cord to correct this design flaw, which is irritating when I already paid for the MultiTap. It works, it's first party, and it's reliable.  Hopefully the PS3 will take advantage of the wireless revolution and the cord issue will be a thing of the past!
