 This CD is put out by a radio station (Star 98.7 FM) in Los Angeles, and its original proceeds went to charity.  The songs are "unplugged" versions of hits (and soon to be hits) by famous artists.  The results vary widely.    Evanescence is not nearly as good as the album version, and Liz Phair's stage fright makes her song painful at times.  Matchbox 20, Jason Mraz, and Tori Amos all put in stellar performances that make this CD well worth its price.
