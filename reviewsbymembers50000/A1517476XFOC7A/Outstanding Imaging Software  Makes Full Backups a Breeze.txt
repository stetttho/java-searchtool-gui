 Ghost is one of the most consistent, tightest applications available for quickly creating drive images.  Its interface is helpful and straightforward, and as long as you have the space or the media it can make the image for you.  I have found that restoring from a ghost image is both reliable and easy.  I don't know why people who are concerned about losing data and getting viruses don't use this product more often!!!
