 There seems to be a lot of misinformation about this game, so I wanted to write a review to clear it up.  Feel the Magic:XY/XX (FTM) is a cute game whose storyline is that you are a boy smitten with a girl.  To win her affections you must do silly things to try to impress her (like swallow and then regurgitate goldfish).  Once you've got her attention, you must then protect her from a kidnapping punk, a snake, a killer plant, and various other threats.  In so doing, you win her love and gratitude.  The game is rated T for 'Crude Humor, Mild Violence, and Suggestive Themes'.  Yes, the woman is in a bikini, and yes, you are flirting with her, but there is more crude behavior on prime time television than can be found in this game.  Its only shortcoming is its length; it is only about 10 hours long, and only a bit longer if you want to find all of its secrets.  All in all, this game is very fun and its lighthearted flirting makes me nostalgic.  It really makes good use of the touch screen, as all of the gameplay involves touching, breathing, or talking at the lower screen.  A great launch title!
