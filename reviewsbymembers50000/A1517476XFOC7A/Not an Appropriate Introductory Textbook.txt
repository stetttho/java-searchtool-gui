 A course I took earlier this year used this textbook, and I wasn't too fond of it.  The book's explanations were very clinical, and other reviewers are correct in observing that it has many typographical errors (which are very frustrating when trying to solve mathematically inclined equations).  The professor deviated substantially from the text, supplying us with several real-world examples and more on the theory behind the examples given in the book.  If he had not done that, I do not think I would have been able to learn the material from the book alone.  Many of its explanations are too brief and lack depth or supporting examples.  If you are teaching an information systems course and intend to use this textbook, be prepared to supplement it with substantial cases or lose the interest and comprehension of your students.
