 This case is great.  I use my iPod in the car and at work, and I like to be able to rotate through songs quickly and easily.  The case that comes with the iPod is hard and opaque, so you can't push the buttons or turn the wheel.  This case has one transparent plastic side and a cute belt clip mounted on neoprene (think wetsuit material) on the other.  The drawstring at the top seals the case, protecting it from most damage.  This case has served me well for the better part of a year, and has kept food and drink out of the buttons!  The only concern I have is that sometimes moisture gathers between the face of the iPod and the clear plastic.  If I take the iPod out and use a cloth to soak up the water, it is good for another few months.
