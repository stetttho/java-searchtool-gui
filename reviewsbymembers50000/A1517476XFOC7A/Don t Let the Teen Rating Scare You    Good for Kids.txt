 This game is classic!  I just bought it, and it cracks me up.  The humor is a little off color, hence the Teen rating, but it isn't anything worse than cartoons kids would see on Saturday mornings.  The graphics and sounds are good, and somewhat realistic.  The game centers around Jake the dog, whom you direct to complete various tasks to collect bones.  The jokes will crack adults up, and kids will like the running around as different kids of dogs.  The key to the game is smell-o-vision, where the view switches to first person and now smells are visible as colored clouds.  You need to collect different colored clouds to compete in challenges, like tug of war and peeing competitions!  Once you win a competition, you can then play as that breed of dog (e.g. chihuahua, mini-doberman, husky).  At $20, this is s a great game for kids and adults.
