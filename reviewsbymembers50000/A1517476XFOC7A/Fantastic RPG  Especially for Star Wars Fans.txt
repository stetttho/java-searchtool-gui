 This game is the reason I bought an XBox.  I love Star Wars, and I love RPGs.  Based on screenshots and word of mouth, I decided to take a chance on this game.  I was not disappointed.  You can choose from 3 character types, male or female.  As you progress through the game, you meet up with 8 other characters (e.g. Jedi, droids, a Wookie) whom you control at various times. Depending on the choices you make, you will choose a side of the "force".  There are two distinct endings, based on whether you are on the "light" side or the "dark" side. The graphics are stellar, the play is not purely linear, and there are plenty of optional side quests to keep veteran gamers interested. I thoroughly enjoyed this game!
