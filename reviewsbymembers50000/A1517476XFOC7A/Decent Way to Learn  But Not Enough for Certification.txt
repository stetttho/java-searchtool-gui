 If there's anything I've learned in my years of programming, it's that you need more than one book to achieve a Microsoft programming certification.  Usually MS Press (recently affliated with/purchased by McGraw Hill) books are the gospel, but their theory goes much further than their hands-on, which is far from extensive.  In the past I have used Sybex's books, which have much better hands-on examples, allowing you to explore all of the features of the environment.  These books are very helpful to me, but I certified in VB5 and 6, and have been working with .NET since Beta 1.  These books will not be helpful to someone who is "new" to Visual Studio languages, or new to programming altogether.  If this is your first MS programming cert, be sure to pick up other books as well to ensure you cover the breadth of material necessary.
