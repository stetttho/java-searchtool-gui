 This is a pretty solid combination package. The keyboard has "Favorites" buttons, which I have programmed to my five most used applications (e.g. email, browser).  There is a "media center" control at the top, which allows me to quickly mute the volume, should I need to speak to someone.  There are also other buttons for messenger, web pages, My Documents, the calculator, and logging off, all of which are very convenient.  There is also a wrist rest built in, ensuring that your palms are high enough when typing.  The mouse has two buttons as well as a vertical and side-to-side scrolling wheel, which allow me to quickly scroll through doucments without having to move my hand.  There are also two really convenient buttons under my thumb, which allow me to navigate back and forward through web pages.    I have the wireless receiver about a foot from the mouse and the keyboard, and do not have signal trouble.  There are other people who use the keyboards and mice in the same office, and we don't have any cross-signaling issues.
