 Just got one of these as a gift, and it's great.  I own an iPod and regularly buy songs from iTunes for it.  The setup of iTunes is fast and quick, and the downloading of songs is easy.  Once you enter in the card # (on the back, under some silver coating that can be scratched away), you can then buy 15 songs which are automatically downloaded to your computer.  These cards are an excellent way to give your friends or kids music without having to give them your credit card information!
