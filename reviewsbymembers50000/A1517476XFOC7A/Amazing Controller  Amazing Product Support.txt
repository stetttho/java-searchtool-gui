 Received this controller as a gift, after much hinting and requesting on my part.  Needless to say, I was thrilled when I opened the gift and found this controller.  My excitement was short-lived, as the controller didn't work properly.  I installed the batteries and plugged the receiver into the machine, but the right analog stick wouldn't work.  Some games it registered only downward motion, others it didn't register any motion at all.  Needless to say, I was crushed.  I phoned Logitech's customer support, and after hearing my tale, they sent me out a free replacement within 3 weeks.  The new controller works perfectly, and set up only took about 5 minutes.  This controller feels the same as the regular DualShock PS2 controller, only lighter.  The receiver is very small, fitting into a single controller slot and only protruding a little more than a memory card.  The batteries are included, and they are supposed to last over 100 hours (with the rumble feature turned off).  I have not had any problems with the new controller, and am as happy with its performance as I am with its wired counterpart.
