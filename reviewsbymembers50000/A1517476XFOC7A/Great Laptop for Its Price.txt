 I use my laptop at least 3 to 4 hours a day, and regularly travel between work, home, and school.  I just bought this laptop and really enjoy the speed and large screen it affords.  The built-in wireless network card works well, and has an "off" switch so you can turn it off when you aren't using it.  My only caveat is that the backlight for the LCD died after only 11 days of use and had to have it replaced.  I haven't had any problems several months later, and am still satisfied.  I've played games (though not the latest releases), developed software, and run office applications successfully on this machine.
