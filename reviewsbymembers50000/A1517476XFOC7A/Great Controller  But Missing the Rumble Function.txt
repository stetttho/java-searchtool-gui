 If you own a GameCube, I hope you enjoy the ergonomic design of the controllers as much as I do.  When Nintendo announced it was releasing a first party wireless controller I was very excited.  This controller doesn't disappoint, with the same button and stick layouts as the wired first-party controllers.  You choose a frequency to use (by rotating a numbered dial on both the controller and the receiver that plugs into the controller port on the Cube), which allows you to use up to 4 Wavebirds at a time (should an aggressive Super Smash Bros Melee match be in your future).  The controller also has an on/off switch, which allows you to shut it off and save extra battery life, which is a nice touch. I also appreciate the red light on the receiver, which lights up when it receives the signal from the Wavebird (making it very easy to tell if you are in range).  The only complaint that I have is one that Nintendo has addressed, namely the lack of Rumble functionality.  To paraphrase Nintendo, to add the rumble feature would have greatly shortened the battery life of the controller.  For many games, the lack of rumble feature isn't an issue, and the WaveBird works perfectly.  For those games that rumble is a major part of, I just use an extension cable for my wired controller.  ;)
