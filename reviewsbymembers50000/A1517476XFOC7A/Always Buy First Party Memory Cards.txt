 Nintendo has produced quality first-party hardware for decades, and this memory card is no exception.  I am glad that they stepped up and created a larger memory card to compete with third-party cards (e.g. MadCatz).  You may be able to find a "super-sized" memory card by a third-party company, but I don't recommend it.  Said cards are notorious for reliability issues, and losing your (or your kids') game information isn't worth the few dollars you'll save by buying directly from the manufacturer.
