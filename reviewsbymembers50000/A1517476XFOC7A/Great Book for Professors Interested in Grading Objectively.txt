 Although one can never be truly objective, this book is a good step in the right direction.  It explains what rubrics are, the theory behind them, and testimonials as to how they can be used.  Many science professors use rubrics, but few arts faculty are aware that such cut and dried schemes can be useful to them.  Interestingly, if you are instructing adults (e.g. post-secondary), rubrics not only assist the instructor in grading, but also the student in understanding what your expectations are.  If you suffer from grade challenges or suggestions that your syllabi are too vague, this book may be helpful to you.  It will help you understand why you should use rubrics, but, more importantly, it will help you work through the phases of creating them for your classes.
