 Microsoft has released another version of its penultimate Integrated Development Environment.  Forgive me if I am not as excited as I was for 2002.  I love Visual Studio and I love .NET, but there just isn't enough "new" in 2003 to warrant spending money on a new Visual Studio.  With VS 2005 coming out next year, if you are already using VS 2002, just wait for 2005.  If you're still in the pre-.NET days (e.g. VS 6), spend the time better training and preparing yourself for the upgrade.
