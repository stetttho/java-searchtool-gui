 I own a GameCube, a PlayStation2, and an XBox.  I bought my XBox to play Knights of the Old Republic, which was one of the first XBox exclusives that really caught my eye.  The XBox has amazing graphics processing, sound, and the built-in hard drive saves you from having to spend money on a memory card.  Although the "network adapter" is built-in, you need to pay a monthly fee in order to connect to XBox Live.  The XBox library of games is fantastic (Splinter Cell, Ninja Gaiden, EA Sports, Fable, KOTOR, Burnout 3, etc.), though where it does best is in how much better it interprets multi-platform games.  Games like Red Dead Revolver, Grand Theft Auto, Prince of Persia, and others just play much better on XBox than on PS2 or GameCube.  I initally bought all multi-platform games on PS2, but now I usually buy them on XBox.  I'm really quite happy with my XBox, and enjoy a lot of my games on it.  I just wish that the controllers were a little more ergonomic.
