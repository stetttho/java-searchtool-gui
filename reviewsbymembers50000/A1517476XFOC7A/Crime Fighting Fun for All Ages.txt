 This is a great game for all ages.  The action is great, the graphics are amazing, and the fact that there are both "kids" and "adults" modes makes it even more appropriate for all kids.  It is about a comic book/old Japanese movie junkie whose girlfriend is kidnapped by the villains of just such a movie.  Joe must step up to become "Viewtiful Joe", his super-hero alter ego, to save her. Joe's powers include speeding up and slowing down time, as well as zooming in on the action.  Each is earned over time, as are additional tricks that you can buy using points you collect by defeating monsters.  Speaking of which, the "monsters" in this game are primarily cartoon robots, which is a pleasant change from the usual drug kingpin/zombie/turtle choices. I like this game a lot, and it is one of my favorite releases of the year, for any platform.
