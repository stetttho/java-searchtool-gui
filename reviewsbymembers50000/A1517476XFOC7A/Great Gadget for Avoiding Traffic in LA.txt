 There are only 2 metro locations that this is available for: Los Angeles/Orange County and Seattle.  As I live in LA, that's the version that I use.  There's a monthly service fee, which can easily be renewed online (I just renewed for another 6 months yesterday).  I got this as an Xmas gift, and I wasn't sure how much I'd use it.  Sure, I drive an average of 1500 miles a month on LA freeways, but would I really use this device when I can check online?  As you can tell from my score, I sure do!  It comes with a suction cup that sticks to your window/windshield, allowing you to easily view the traffic.  It's simple to read: solid bars mean medium traffic, flashing bars mean heavy traffic.  You can quickly glance at it and get an idea of what's ahead.  The only 2 problems I've found are that:  1) It must remain on all the time (no off button), and if you take the batteries out it takes a few minutes to reload the traffic data.  2) Certain areas never seem to report.  (You can check which areas are not currently reporting by pushing the light button and holding it for a couple of seconds.)  These areas are few and far between, and it may be because Caltrans (from which the device gets its information) may not have those sensors up at the time of my use.  Overall, a great device that saves me a lot of time.
