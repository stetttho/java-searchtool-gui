 This game is outstanding!  I first saw it on Cinematech (a show on G4TechTV) and was intrigued by the graphics.  After reading praise for it from many magazines, I decided to pick it up.  You play the role of a prince whose father (King of the universe) "accidentally" knocked all of the stars out of the sky.  It is your job to recreate stars (and some of the major constellations) to repopulate the sky.  Sounds pretty unique, but it is the gameplay that gets you.  You push a "katamari" (Japanese for ball) around, and it picks up items that are smaller than it.  You start by picking up thumbtacks and sticks of gum; eventually you can pick up people, animals, and houses!  Most stages are timed, making the manic nature of the game even more fun.  This game has great music, decent graphics, and the kind of "old school" simple fun that is lacking in a lot of today's newer games.  Its $20 price tag makes it affordable, but its gameplay will keep you coming back for more!
