 My hands certainly aren't baby-sized, but the D controller is just too large (one industry reviewer has called the D the "hamburger" controller).  I own 2 S controllers, and they've been able to handle a lot of playing (10 hours per week for over a year) with no problems to my hands or to the controllers themselves.  They still work perfectly, and the analog sticks are as sensitive as ever.  Compared to the 2 other consoles, the S controller is still very large, but it is a vast improvement over its predecessor
