 This is a great price for a good charger.  It is a standard charger, fitting in the lighter of standard cars.  It charges phone's battery quickly, showing a green light while charging.  My only warning (though not a flaw with the charger itself) is that the two prongs are much more susceptible to damage than the o-shaped adapter connector used by other manufacturers (e.g. Nokia).  You have to pay attention when plugging it in, and tugging sharply on the cord could damage the adapter and/or the phone.
