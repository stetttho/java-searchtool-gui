 I have owned GameBoy portables since they came out in the 1980s.  Never have I enjoyed Nintendo's handheld technology more than with this product.  Taking the best parts of the GameBoy Advance (large color screen, access to an excellent game library), Nintendo has improved upon its original model by adding several great features.  The features I enjoy most include:  * Backlight --> you can play your GBA SP in dim rooms, on the move (when you don't have access to extra light), heck, you can play it IN THE DARK!  This is an amazing improvement.  I'm sure that the third party market that has made a mint off lights for the GameBoy and original GameBoy Advance systems are very mad, but this internal light is even better than any of the numerous add-ons I've bought over the years.  * Rechargeable-battery (with adapter) --> you can now charge the internal battery by plugging it into the wall (or by buying a separate car charger).  The battery lasts anywhere from 6 - 10 hours (depending on whether you use the backlight or not).  * Flip-top screen --> this smaller, sleeker design also serves to protect the screen from getting scratched  All told, these additions are amazing, and saved me at least $25 (now that I don't have to buy all those add-ons from another company).  I really enjoy my GameBoy Advance SP, and play all of the great new GBA games as well as my old black and white GameBoy favorites on it.
