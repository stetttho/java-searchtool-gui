 First of all, how a book of the most influential Irish of all time could be written without including the Ard Ri,Brian Boru is beyond me.  St.Patrick was listed as number one and he wasn't even Irish!  Michael  Collins should have been first if you leave out King Brian.  The Kennedey's  were of course listed again...I don't care where their ancestors came  from....The Kennedeys are NOT IRISH!   Margaret Sanger making the top 10  was an abomination and is a smack in the face to all Irish Catholics.  As a  brief biological sketch of famous Irish people and those of possible Irish  descent...it's not a bad book.  However, the ranking system left much to be  desired!  Mindless fluff for Americans who think they're Irish and  wannabees to read while they drink green beer and eat corned beef and  cabbage on Saint Patrick's Day!
