 I bought this book in an airport newsstand prior to an 11 hour flight.  As a firearms designer and history major, I thought it would touch on the basis for my thesis that "Development of Firearms Launched the Industrial Revolution."; boy was I ever wrong. At points it's fairly compelling, yet midway through the PC pablum it's just a case of having [$$] invested and half the pages gone and 5 more hours to kill on the flight! His arguments become ridiculous.  He cites that African animals were incapable of being domesticated, ignoring the fact that water buffalos and rhinos can tame down easier than a Jersey Cow! He writes off Elk, Wapiti, and Caribou being unable to be domesticated by "Native Americans" yet their genetic equivalents (Reindeer) have been domesticated by the Finns and Icelanders for centuries!  Climate and predators are equal in all instances, the only difference is the people! His obsession with the tribesmen of New Guinea contained some interesting points and that is where the book was possibly worth the price and why I gave it 2 stars.  The only other bit of insight might be the dim bulbs that loved it are either so brainwashed by the left or just believe everything they read.
