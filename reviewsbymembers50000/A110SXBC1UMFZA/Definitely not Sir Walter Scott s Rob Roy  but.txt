 ....it's a great story nonetheless!  The scenery is beautiful...the costumes authentic, the swordplay was marvelous!  O'Sullivan's March by the Chieftains was a perfect  choice for the soundtrack!  Definitely a movie  you have to watch two or three times to really appreciate. Reminder's of  what's really important in life abound in this film...the importance of a  man's word, importance of the family, etc.  One of my favorites!
