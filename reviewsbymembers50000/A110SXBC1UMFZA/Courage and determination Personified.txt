 Chris Ryan's book is an inspirational piece about survival.  The detractors can say what they wish, the bottom line is that this man evaded Iraqi patrols and walked across the desert into Syria with no food, little water but with the skill, courage and determination that has made the UK into a great nation. While his writing may not be the caliber of Hemmingway, Shakespeare, etc; it rings with the truth that only a memoir can have.  The only book that tries to debunk it is written by an Islamic British exile who takes the word of Baathists and shepherds over decorated SAS Soldiers.   Ignore the detractors, although they are few in number.  Some folks can only make themselves feel big by tearing down others. I gather the majority of those writing negative reviews lack the ability to do what Chris did, let alone the equiptment!  Read this book, it's an inspiration.  There were many times when I was a Marine and found myself going through a rough spot and I'd draw on the knowledge that someone else had gone through what I was going through, and worse...and they made it, so could I!  This book will provide that for future generations.  I'd call it required reading for anyone considering a career in Spec ops! Semper Fi!
