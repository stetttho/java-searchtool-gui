 With talented writers like this....you really have to wonder why Games Workshop continues to "borrow" themes from other writers, history, etc!   A great series of short stories...I can't wait to read the  other two books in the series!  Whether you're a R.E. Howard or a  Tolkien fan...you will enjoy this book!
