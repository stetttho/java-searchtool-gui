 This was Mr Cahill's second book that I read and despite my Irish heritage and love for his first book "How the Irish Saved Civilization" I must admit this one was better!  Cahill breathes life into Abraham and Moses in ways that no Priest or Preacher ever could.  This book actually made me pick up The Bible again and read it with a renewed interest and greater understanding than I had before.  END
