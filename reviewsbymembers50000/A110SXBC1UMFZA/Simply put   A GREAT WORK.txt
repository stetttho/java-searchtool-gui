 Keneally's book is powerful...the chapters on the Famine almost brought tears to my eyes.  I especially enjoyed the chapters on Thomas Francis Meagher, who is a "not-so-distant relative" of mine! I had heard  a few stories about him in the Civil War but this was the first time I  actually read anything about him!   I would reccomend it to anyone  wanting to learn about the history of the Irish, in particularly of those  who "found themselves in Van Diemen's Land". But also students of  Common Law and the Constitution might want to read it for the Draconian  laws the British imposed on the Irish (e.g."imprisonment for even  thinking aloud that the British Empire might be overthrown  someday"). It is lengthy but well worth the time to take to read  it...the illustrations and photos are wonderful too and really aid in  picturing the details of the times.
