 This book was hard to put down.  Durant's writing style and sense of humor make it compelling, as if you're hearing a story from a good friend.  The slices of his life besides his captivity in Somalia also give insight into this man and show how they forged his will and gave him the ability to survive his 10 days in captivity and keep his mind intact. I'd reccomend this book to anyone who has read Black Hawk Down; especially if you think Bowden came off as a Clinton apologist.  Durant expresses the feelings of every red-blooded American Serviceman who has served durring the past 10 years! I found one small error in the book and even it was probably just an oversimplification and not crucial to the plot, itself.  Other than that, it's earned a place of honor on my bookshelf.  One that is increasingly becoming more "Army" than "Marines".  I left the Corps 10 years ago and I'm going into the Army in the next 10 days! All we need now is for this story to be turned into a movie and done well.  The small piece of it shown in Black Hawk Down does not do this man any justice. Thank you, Michael Durant.  God Bless you and your family!  Semper Fi! Hoo-Ah! NSDQ!
