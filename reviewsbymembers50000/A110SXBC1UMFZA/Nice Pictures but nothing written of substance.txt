 Osprey's Men-At-Arms seriesmay be the greatest source for depicting how historical warrior's dressed and may give you a good pallette for painting wargames miniatures, but the facts they quote as history leave alot to be  desired.  The illustrations are wonderful and the b&w photos of  artifacts are interesting but a serious student of history can find better  sources other than this book.  I give them 5 stars on the pictures but only  1 on the subject matter at hand.
