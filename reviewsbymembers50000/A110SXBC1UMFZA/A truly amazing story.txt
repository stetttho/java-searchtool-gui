 My good friend, knifemaker and martial artist, Ernest Emerson reccomended this book to me.  All I can say is, "WOW!"  This is one of those books that will change your life and the way you lok at things.  A blend of the old world and the new.    As one reviewer said, this would make an excellent movie.  It's the story of a virtuous man and his relationship with his family and God and the amazing things he could do in spite of his small stature.  Unfortunately the book is out of print and the high prices reflect that.  It is still worth it nonetheless!  Grab a copy if you can find it!
