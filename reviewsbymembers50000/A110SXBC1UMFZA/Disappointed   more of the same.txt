 Crossan is a brilliant man primarily because he was educated by the Church.  In fact as a "priest" all he did was attend school on the Church's dime.  He never did parish or missionary work.  He took the easy way out when the gravy Train had run it's course.  Sad, in some ways as he is a brilliant man.  This latest book of his is very scholarly but really contains no new insights not found in his previous works.  I reccomend it only if you've never read his other books and are looking for a synopsis.
