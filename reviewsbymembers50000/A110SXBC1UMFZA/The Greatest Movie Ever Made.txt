 First of all William Wallace was not a Highlander and never wore a kilt into battle and he never painted his face blue in the manner of the ancient Picts.  The movie tried to portray him as a "noble Barbarian" but  in fact he was more of a Barbaric noble.  In the real battle of Stirling he  actually skinned the English commander "from the nape of his neck to  his left heel" and made a baldric(belt for his sword) out of it.  Yet,  Mr Gibson declined to show this in his film. Historical Inaccuracies  aside...this movie is my favorite. Not every great film has to be based on  a true story...although a more historical film would be just as  entertaining, if not more so. The battle scenes are so realistic, you feel  you are in the middle of the action.  The soundtrack is Awesome and yes  those are Ulliean pipes not bagpipes played in the background. I've seen it  40 times and never get tired of it!
