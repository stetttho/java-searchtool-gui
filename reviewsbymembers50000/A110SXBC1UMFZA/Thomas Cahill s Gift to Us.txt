 The third installment of the "Hinges of History" is Cahill's latest gift to us.  I enjoy Cahill's easy to read style, full of anecdotes that not only gets the message across but makes you want to read more.   Ignore the detractors!  Read the book for it's own sake...for a fresher  insight into Jesus and the followers of the early Church.  If you want a  literary epic read Virgil's Aeneid in the original Latin,  "Arma  virumque cano!" If you want a down to earth fresh look at the Life of  Christ pick up "Desire of the Everlasting Hills".  To the  halfwits who wanted footnotes and a bibiliography, they must have closed  the book before page 320 or they got it as a .99 Book Club deal, because 22  pages of this book are acknowledgements, footnotes, and references!
