 Cahill's book is superb and despite what his detractors may say, this easy to read style may be instrumental in getting a broader spectrum of readers interested in his book and in the Irish.  The chapter on St Patrick made me  think of him in a new light...as the man he was as well as the Saint he  became.  Much better than the ridiculous statues of him in Green robes  chasing the snakes with a shamrock.  Mr Cahill has become one of my  favorite authors!
