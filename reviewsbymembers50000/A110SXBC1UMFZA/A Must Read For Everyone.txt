 I've read it twice and loved it...Even though it's about poverty in Ireland, it's not about poverty, it's not about Ireland...it's about the triumph of the human spirit over adversity.  McCourt's writing style is  what lends it the most credibility...in the beginning it has the quality of  a child telling a story and it matures as he does throughout the book.  I  didn't care much for his "afterschool activities" in the later  chapters...the book could have done without them, but I guess the crucial  part of any memoir is the truth through your own eyes.  The last chapter is  perfect!  I'd reccomend to anyone!
