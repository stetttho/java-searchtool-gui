 I love this album. It is moody, as other people noted here before me. And you know why? Because Carol king finally sings her own music. I think, that this album symbolizes the passage between Carol King the writer and Carol  King the singer, the artist. After years of writing for other people, being  aside, Carol is in the spotlight again. Songs coming from the heart  combined with minimal musical arrangement. A true masterpiece, one of the  most influential albums of modern pop music.
