 A must have book for all photography fans and amateur photographers. Annie has her own unique style - she knows exactly how to seize the moment. Her early photographs describe her family, Rock stars and their fans and even  simple people - in that special moment that will never return, that moment  that Annie so creatively captured. Annie's Photographs, are  semi-journalistic, and describe a given situation - no excess face powder  and bright lights. Besides these, the book contains her most famous  "staged" photographs, in which Annie took pictures of famous  people from her own perspective. I must say, that the scenarios and poses  chosen for most celebrities fit them like a glove. My favorite photographs  are the one in which Woopie Goldberg is soaking in a bath full of milk, and  the beautiful photo of Sting, standing covered in mud, in the middle of the  desert (of course, there is also the famous photograph of John and Yoko).
