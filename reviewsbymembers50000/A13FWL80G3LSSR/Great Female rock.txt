 I love to explore, and that is the main reason why I bought "Stretch princess" without reading about it in some newspaper or hearing a song on the radio. I just "bumped" into their CD while surfing, and I  am not sorry. Not at all. When the package arrived, I realized that the  pamphlet inside the CD did not contain the lyrics, nor did it contain  information about the band. "Hum" I said to myself, "They  must be a young straggling band, so they did not focus on the cover and  instead, they focused on the music". After one listening, myself  agreed completely. It is one of the best female Rock Cd's of the year.  Great beat, good guitar ensemble. The fact that the band is somewhat  ambiguous only increases my feeling that you do not need to listen to a  star pampered with heaps of public relations in order to enjoy good music.
