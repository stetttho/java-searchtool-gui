 Well, It seems to me that PAULA COLE has grown up a bit since "This Fire". When I first listened to "Amen" the music sounded "Hippie-Like" and very naive. After Listening to this album  carefully, and especially to songs like "La Tonya" and  "Free" I realized that the lyrics are hypnotizing and there is a  lot of meaning in them. I almost believed her. I consider this cd as a good  atmosphere cd, especially for dusk (preferably if you have a sea-view).
