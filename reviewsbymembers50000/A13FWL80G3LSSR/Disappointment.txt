 Aye.... no, no, no. I had great expectations from this cd. I thought that it would be as good as    "ADIEMUS", but I was wrong. It is less lively and much less melodic. I expected choir chants and powerful medieval  music, but what I got was an amorphous mixture of sounds. Do yourself a  favor, buy ADIEMUS, and not DANCES OF TIME.
