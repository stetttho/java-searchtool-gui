 I am a great fan of Sting. He has inspired me ever since I became familiar with his work. I always used to close my eyes and see the castles, fields and heroes he used to sing about. That is why I was very disappointed with  Sting's former album and VERY disappointed with Sting's current new album:  Brand New Day. It seems, that Sting is going on "fishing trips"  for new sounds and new types of music, instead of focusing on his own,  unique style, the one he is loved and appreciated for. He is doing a  terrible job - I come from Israel, where we are exposed to authentic Arabic  fine music. That is why, to my ears, Sting's attempts to sound more  "ethnic" are pathetic. This whole album is an aimless mixture of  sounds, and Sting, as a great artist, gets lost inside. I can only hope  that this album was made for pure fun and that soon we will get to hear  Sting's real beautiful mellow Celtic-like tunes.
