 Lene Marlin's album is lovely. Today, when professional producers assemble new bands and groups on an artificial production line every now and then, groups that do not focus on the music but on their looks and pose, it is  very difficult to find such a refreshing young artist, an artist who writes  her own lyrics and music, and who is worthy to the title "artist"  and not "puppet". I am not saying that Lene is a top artist or  that her music is the biggest jewel in the crown of modern music, but it is  definitely absorbable, slightly alternative and melodic. It is worth having  in your collection.
