 Perhaps one of my all time favorite. In my humble opinion, this is Sting's most complicated and touching album. I remember going to see him three times on the "Ten Summoner's tales" tour, one day after another.  I was not the same girl afterwards. I kept on listening to this album ever  since. What truly astonishes me is the level of writing - not many  musicians have the talent for lyrics like Sting has. The songs are  cheerful, sarcastic, sad, bitter and witty all at the same time. Sting  wants us to pop and see the world throw his eyes, and he does that by using  his magnificent powerful words. Every Time I listen to "Fields of  Gold" I can actually see the fields he is singing about, and I miss a  heartbeat every time I listen to the sincere "If I ever lose a faith  in you". Don't miss this true masterpiece.
