 This album is a direct continuation of the duo's former album, Walking Wounded. The comparison to the latter is inevitable - this album is a shrine for electronica - house pulse beats and techno buss n' drum rhythms.  However, I truly find Temperamental to be much more alienated and gloomy  than Walking Wounded. See it this way - Walking wounded analogues to a  beginning of a party when everyone is still hesitant and need lighter music  in order to "absorb the atmosphere", while  "Temperamental" fits better to the late hours of the night when  everyone is vigorous and energetic. I think that this album lacks a bit of  human touch and Tracy's vocals only come in second after the music. I would  recommend to buy both "Walking Wounded" and  "Temperamental" and to play them one after the other for the  complete experience.
