 This is really great! After I purchased the pendant, they e-mailed me asking to pick the birthstone combination for my mother's pendant. They custom made it and shipped in just 3 days and it really looked great! Nice size, sturdy, great packaging in a nice wood jewelry box and all the genuine gemstones were top grade. I had an emerald in my pendant and the quality was really high! Clean, clear and very brilliant! You can't go wrong with this mother's pendant.
