 This is really a Great quality, very well made solid Ring. They custom make your stone combination using top AAA grade quality gemstones! As far as mother's ring, you can't do better than this one. Their customer service is great, they contacted me immediatly for the color stone combination and custom made the ring in 3 days. And it really looked great! All the stones matched nicelly and were clean, clear, bright and with very vibrant colors. The final ring really has to be seen in real life to truly be appreciated. It truly is a gorgeous piece. You will be really happy with it.
