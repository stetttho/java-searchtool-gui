 Add N to (X) makes music that is weirdly brilliant.  Revenge of the Black Regent combines a sort of down-beat art rock style with 70s synthesizers.The style is completely coherent and alien at the same time.   Imagine Portishead backed by a Yes/Kraftwerk tribute band consisting of  Daleks. This CD contains an abolutely brilliant (adult) animated video  for the song "Metal Fingers in My Body" (quicktime/mpeg).  I had  trouble with the official interface.  If you do too, just look for the file  "video1.mpg" on the CD. --Pat
