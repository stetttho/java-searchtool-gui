 I love this book!  Part first aid, part do it yourself podiatry.  Learn to  diagnose and treat running injuries.  Shin splints, stress fractures, they  cover it all.  Then, learn to diagnose and treat the underlying  problems. Everything is clear and practical.  Weak arches?  Here's how to  tape your feet to support them.  Need heel cushioning?  Use makeup sponges.    This is a must for anyone who runs hard.  By learning to diagnose and  treat yourself, you'll prevent injuries and improve as a runner. --Pat /  zippy@cs.brandeis.edu
