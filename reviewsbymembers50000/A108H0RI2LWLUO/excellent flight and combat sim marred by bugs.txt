 Falcon 4.0 is simply a wonderful flight sim and combat sim.  Bythe latter, I mean that it realistically simulates many of theelements in a campaign besides just your flight, and really gives the feeling that you're part of a larger military operation. You're tooling along in your F-16, accompanied by as many as 3 other falcons. Meanwhile, other elements are off on their own missions (attacking ground targets, escorting bombers, doing recon), *and* the enemy is scrambling planes and coordinating its anti-aircraft units in a realistic way. Note that this game is very deep.  The default settings are forgiving and there's an "instant action" mode for those of you who just want some quick fun.  If you take the time to get into the game, you will find that there is a *lot* to learn. The tutorials are quite thorough, and I recommend playing them to understand the capabilities of the plane and its systems. One nit -- I really wish the tutorials had an audio briefing.  Unfortunately, you need to consult the manual with each one to understand what you need to do.  An audio briefing and audio cues during the tutorial missions would have been a very useful touch, and I'm surprised they aren't there. You absolutely need a flight-sim style joystick to play this game well.  I'm using a Thrustmaster Top-Gun with four buttons and a 4-way hat switch, and it works quite well with the game.  If you want to get the most out of Falcon, get a throttle control too.  There's really nothing like hunting for the ECM key on the keyboard when a radar-guided SAM is flying up your tail at Mach 3. I gave this game a 3 out of 5 only because it is not stable.  On a B/W G3 with MacOS 8.6, ATI Rage 128 OEM, and 64M of RAM, it crashes randomly during startup.  I've never had it crash mid-game, but I have had it crash every time I've tried to load a campaign that I had saved. END
