 If you can afford the...wireless, and realize that this is not going to replace your desktop for web surfing, the Palm VIIx is a good way to stay connected.  And it fits in your pocket! Like the other  Palms, the VIIx does what it claims, and never complains. There are two  catches, though. 1) wireless applications are a very limited version of  the net.  There's no built-in web browser that lets you go to any old web  page.  So unless you install 3rd party programs, you're limited to the 40  bundled destinations (Amazon, AskJeeves, CBS Marketwatch, Fidelity, ...).   Surprisingly, there was no built-in wireless phone book. 2) the wireless  connection is slow and expensive.  The bandwidth is under 9600 baud, and  there's a 2-4 second delay between clicking and getting a response. If  you're an information junkie (stock quotes, news, email, eBay--is this  you?) you will easily blow through the limited wireless plans... On the plus side: 1) I was always able  to connect to the wireless net (in buildings, in a car, in a park where  cell coverage is spotty) 2) The device always did what I expected. 3  stars.  I'd give it 5 if the wireless service was cheaper and  faster. --Pat
