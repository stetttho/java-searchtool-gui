 This is a favorite with every kid I know.  But what do kids know?  They listen to Raffi. * From an adult perspective, this tape is amazing.  The playing is superb and intelligent, the lyrics are sincere, heartfelt, and  often pull-your-leg funny.  Grisman and Garcia play with and off each other  beautifully. The musical skill here is extremely high, but feels unforced  and simple. For example, listen to the song "Arkansas  Traveller" about an encounter between a city slicker and a country  bumpkin: Slicker: Well, hello stranger. Bumpkin: Why, hello  stranger! Slicker: Yer corn looks awful little and yeller. Bumpkin: I  planted the little and yeller kind. [cue duet] Listen to the banjo and  mandolin duet of turkey in the straw; the playing is quite intricate and  beautiful. What's right about this tape: it entertains and engages  without once stooping to dull playing or insincere, tired singing.  Unlike  Raffi, for example, this tape never feels like an act. Recommended for  any kid.  Also, any adult who likes good acoustic or folk guitar.  This is  a tape I play all the time, whether or not kids are around. --Pat *  Please, no hate mail from all 15 of you adult Raffi fans.  I know the  lyrics to Baby Beluga and I'm not afraid to use them.
