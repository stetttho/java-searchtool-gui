 I found the robot central character intriguing.  Williams was excellent as one who lives by the rules but yearns to be break free.  However, this was a soap-opera treatment of the story:  heavy-handed music and  too-many-characters who became two-dimensional cutouts.  I felt that the  director was trying to force my feelings, rather than simply telling the  story well and letting it carry the mood. If you like a little Asimov  with your General Hospital (or a little GH with your Asimov), give it a  try. If you want a more serious science fiction take on what it means to  be human, try Blade Runner. --Pat
