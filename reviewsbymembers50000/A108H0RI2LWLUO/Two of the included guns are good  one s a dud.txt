 This system comes with three guns. The Hornet (six-shooter), Scout (pistol), and Titan (bazooka). The Hornet is a decent primary nerf weapon, but be aware that it does not work reliably with the blue microdarts that Nerf makes (these are the ones that come with the Maverick). The Titan is fun and has great range but hits with too much force at close range to use safely indoors -- it is capable of leaving a welt or knocking an appliance off a shelf.  The Scout pistol is pointless. While it holds three darts, you have to reload it manually after each shot. I rarely bother to use the Scout.  I've used several different Nerf guns, and while a particular model is only in the stores for a short while, I think the Nerf Maverick (revolver) is the best recent gun to have if you only can have one. Second best is the Hornet, which does allow you to squeeze off six shots quickly. The only problem with the Hornet is reliability -- about 25% of the time shots just dribble out instead of going the distance. I've found the following to be helpful with the Hornet:  1) the dart must be in excellent condition 2) squeeze the trigger quickly, not slowly 3) make sure the gun is pumped enough that it makes that somewhat rude noise that indicates that the air reservoir is full. 4) be sure to pull the grey slider at the top to reset the firing order (there's a mechanism in the gun which tells it which dart chamber should get air next -- this slider resets the mechanism to the first dart chamber).  Best of luck, and good nerfing.
