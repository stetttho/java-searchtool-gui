 Where to start? This album is brilliant and alien. Add N to (X) has a clearly developed style, borrowing from Can, Kraftwerk, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Wall of Voodoo, Holger Czukay, Wendy Carlos, the Residents, and Portishead. The opening track, "We Are Add N to X", is an absolutely wonderful introduction to the band. Most of the other 12 tracks fit together as a movie score written by Daleks -- at times edgy and slightly menacing, but mostly wonderfully, absurdly weird. "The Black Regent" is one of the few duds; it's confined and doesn't go anywhere interesting. "King Wasp" is infectious. Highly recommended for Electronica/Ambient fans. --Pat / zippy at cs.brandeis.edu
