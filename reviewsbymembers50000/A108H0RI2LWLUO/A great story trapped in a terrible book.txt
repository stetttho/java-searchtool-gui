 I love the OED. I read CT Onions' "Oxford English Dictionary of English Etymologies" for fun. I couldn't stand this book. Why? The writing is awful. Winchester takes a short story and pads it to a ridiculous degree. Further, his writing is awkward and cliched; it's on the level of a 1950's pulp mystery. Not that there's anything wrong with that. But a book about the creation of one of the best-written dictionaries in the universe should be written with thought and care. Instead, The Professor and the Madman gives one the impression that the author had a page quota to fill. As other reviewers have stated, the real life story didn't have that many events. This story would have been better told in 10 pages rather than 240. Avoid this book unless you enjoy pulp mysteries as much as you enjoy the Oxford English Dictionary.
