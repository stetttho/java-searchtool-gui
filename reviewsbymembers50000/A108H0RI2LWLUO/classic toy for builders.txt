 Total hit for the 3 and up set. And I do mean "and up," adults like to play with this toy too. Just wait -- you buy this for a kid, the kid builds something and brings it to you. And then you start adding parts, moving things around, before you know it, you've made something new. The pieces are well made and feel good in the hand.  They all go together in satisfying ways, and the things you can build somehow all feel well constructed. Classic wonderful toy for people who like to build. Some pieces are choking hazards, so 3 is the minimum age, and then only for kids who don't put things in their mouths.
