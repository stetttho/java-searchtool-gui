 Beazly has written the perfect reference for Python.  This book has every important function *concisely* described and with excellent real code examples (as opposed to the ubiquitous `desktop calculator' ones that many  books use). Whether you are experienced with Python or are just starting  out, this is THE python reference. I'd put it up with Kernighan and  Ritchie's "The C Programming Language" and Guy Steele's  "Commmon Lisp: The Language (1st ed)".  There's no higher praise  than that. --Pat / zippy@cs.brandeis.edu
