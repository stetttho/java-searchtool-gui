 Besher's ideas are interesting. Take Johnny Mnemonic or Snowcrash and add in a great deal of Buddhist spirituality and a bit of Chinese medicine. However, the writing is absolutely, Bulwer-Lytton contest awful.  Some examples: "His hands caressed the globes of her derriere," "Their feet touched, and they smiled," "His finger traced the slippery third rail of her shaven..." well, you get the idea. Besher has no ear for dialog, and the prose is what you would expect from a senior high school student in the first week of creative writing. Mr. Besher, you have a lot of promise. Please, take a year to practice writing with a good teacher. Your stories will benefit greatly, and your readers will be able to experience your ideas more clearly and pleasantly. For readers who would like similar stories, but with better writing, check out Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson or almost anything from William Gibson.
