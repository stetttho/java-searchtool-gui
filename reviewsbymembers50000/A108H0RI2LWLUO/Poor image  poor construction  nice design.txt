 This does quick and dirty webcam video. So don't expect beautiful photograph-quality images. The camera has a nicely designed base that can sit on a desktop or hang on top of a notebook screen. But that's where the nice design ends. The cheap [EDITORS - DO NOT DELETE "cheap" - this refers to the quality of the plastic, not the cost of the camera] plastic that attaches the base breaks easily and is difficult, if not impossible to fix (I'm talking about the black plastic screw that connects the base to the oval camera body. It can snap, and when it does, there's *no* way to glue it back together and still be able to re-insert it into the camera and base) So if you buy one, keep your receipt. Mine broke on the first day, and with no abuse, I swear! Image quality review - exactly like other Quickcams. It needs lots of light to get good shots, it has a manual focus that feels like cheap plastic (because it is), and colors are usually off. On the plus side, the camera folds up in a clever way to protect the lens, and it is a pretty handy size for notebook users. If it weren't for the base's weakness, I'd give it three stars. But with the base problem, I can't recommend it at all. One star.
