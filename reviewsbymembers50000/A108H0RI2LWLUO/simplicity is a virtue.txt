 I had been looking for a microwave with a simple controls. No twenty-button space shuttle control panels, no clock that I have to set every time the power goes out, and no wondering whether I'm supposed to press "time" or "clock" when all I want to do is reheat my coffee. Nope, I just wanted a microwave with an analog egg timer, a power setting, and that's it. This is the microwave I got and I've been very happy with it. It just does what it needs to do. It's large enough to hold a dinner plate, and powerful enough to do most reheating jobs in 2-3 minutes. If it ever dies, I'm getting another one. --Pat / zippy@cs.brandeis.edu
