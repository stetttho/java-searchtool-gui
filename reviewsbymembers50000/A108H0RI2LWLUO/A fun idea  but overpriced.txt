 I won't downplay this light - it has a great list of features. However, if you want just as much light in the exact same package, but without any fancy programming, you can pick up very bright LED keychain lights for under a dollar. My local electronics store sells 'em by the register as an almost-free gift. The one on my keychain is a no-name brand, probably from China, and the LED is blindingly bright.  --Pat / zippy@cs.brandeis.edu
