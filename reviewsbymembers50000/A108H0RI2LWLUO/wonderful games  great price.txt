 The Mac Action Sack contains Marathon 1, 2, and Infinity. Marathon is a 1st person shooter (like Quake, Doom, etc).  The difference is that Marathon has a great, engaging story *and* incredible level design and art.   The levels drip with suspense and dread, and it's clear that someone paid  attention to every detail -- when could you ever say that about Quake?   Nothing in these games is tossed in.  It all fits together: ambient sound,  story, levels, animation, icons, etc. etc. etc. The graphics are fairly  simple and will run on almost any Mac (certainly anything since  1995). Note that while Marathon will run on a LAN, it will not run across  the internet (it cannot handle latency). Also, Bungie released the source  for Marathon 2 (having lost the source for Marathon 1, which I'm sure is a  story in itself).  Anyhow, there's a community of programmers who have  updated Marathon to use OpenGL and take advantage of modern graphics cards.   See source.bungie.com for the latest build of Marathon Open Source. The  Sack includes: Marathon 1,2, and Marathon Infinity, Abuse, Pathways into  Darkness, and Minotaur.  Marathon and possibly Abuse are the one's you'll  spend most of your time on. --Pat / zippy@cs.brandeis.edu
