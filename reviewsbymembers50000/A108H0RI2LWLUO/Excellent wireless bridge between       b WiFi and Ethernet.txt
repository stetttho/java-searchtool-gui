 I am very impressed by the WET11. It is essentially an ethernet to wireless adapter that Just Works. It is unlike bridges, including the Linksys WAP11 v2.2, in that it looks like a regular wireless client to your existing wireless network. So you can use it with *any* 802.11b (WiFi) base station without having to configure that base station in a special mode to do bridging. The Linksys WAP11, by contrast, can only bridge with other WAP11s. In my network, the WAP11 is a client on my Apple Airport (Graphite) wireless network. I configured the WAP11, hooked it up to my remote ethernet device, and it all worked flawlessly. The WAP11 is surprisingly small - a bit larger than a pack of cards. The power cord transformer (wall wart) is also small. It doesn't cover up multiple outlets on a power strip like most electronic devices. At its current one hundred and five amount I recommend it highly. The WAP11 comes with an ethernet port (of course) with a crossover switch. The crossover switch means you can plug directly into another ethernet device (a PC, XBox, or whatever) without using a hub. Very nice touch. --Pat / zippy at cs.brandeis.edu
