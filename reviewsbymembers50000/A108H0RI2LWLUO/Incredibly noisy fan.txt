 I bought one of these for home use to replace my old 10baseT hub. I plugged in the Linksys switch and, my god is it loud. It has two internal fans in its tiny case, spinning at high RPMs. It's as loud as a server or a ten year old PC.  Despite its tiny size, this box is not suitable for home or any other quiet environment. A machine room, sure, on a desk or in your music studio? Absolutely not.  I'm sending mine back and getting a fanless Netgear switch instead.  --Pat / zippy@cs.brandeis.edu
