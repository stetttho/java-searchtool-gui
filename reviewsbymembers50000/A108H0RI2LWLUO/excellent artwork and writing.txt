 This is one of my twenty favorite children's books, up with Good Night Moon.  The story is compelling (every other page is a cliffhanger) and the artwork is excellent and perfectly matches the alternating moods of the  story. I had never heard of the author (Remy Charlip) before.  Now, I  want to read everything else by them. This book is a storytime and  *bedtime* favorite for the 3-year olds I know.  Must give them interesting  dreams! --Pat
