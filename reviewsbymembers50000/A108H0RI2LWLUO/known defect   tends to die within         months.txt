 I bought this DVD player in July 2003 and enjoyed it until Apr 2005, when it stopped working with a "HO2 - NO DISC" error.  It turns out that premature death is a common problem with this player. A search on "Panasonic DVD-S35" and "NO DISC" will bring up these reviews.  Reviewers share a common complaint -- the player is great for the first year, and then dies (I got 18 months out of mine).  I strongly advise that you do not buy one of these used, as it is unlikely to last even a full year.  --Pat
