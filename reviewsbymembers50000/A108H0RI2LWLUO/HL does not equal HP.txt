 Our office got one of these since it was hundreds cheaper than a similar Hewlett Packard (HP) LaserJet. While I was a huge fan of HP LaserJets because in my years of experience with them they never, ever, ever complained, rarely jammed, and never died, I was willing to give the Brother (HB) a fair trial.  What a mistake! Over a year's use in a small office (7 users) with fairly simple print jons, this Brother printer would regularly hang and require a power cycle and random opening and closing of doors to make it reset. I never saw this sort of behavior with HPs The moral? Laser printers have a lot of moving parts in a harsh environment (high internal temperatures and toner dust). You can get away with a cheap monitors, motherboards, and almost anything else electronic, but with printers a cheap design will absolutely cost you downtime and frustration. My advice - if you value your time and rely on your printer, look at something more solidly designed. I recommend HP LaserJets. --Pat / zippy@cs.brandeis.edu
