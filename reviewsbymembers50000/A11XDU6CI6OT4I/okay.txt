 I was eager to get this one after reading the first book. It was definitely a page turner, and kept me up very late a couple of nights. Contrary to the editorial, I agree with the reviewer that said that not all characters are either totally good or totally evil, but many are. One or two characters surprised me late in the book. It's true that the male protagonist is a pure prince who can do no evil, but the other main character in the book is more complex. Like it or not, reformation-era theology permeates the book. However, it was fun to read. The main gripe that I have with it is that it is too short, and moved along too fast. The world of the Seven Kingdoms could be better developed...as it stands, each kingdom seems pretty much as any other. Nevertheless, I enjoyed reading it.  Moves fast and is fairly enjoyable light reading.
