 I had great hopes for this.  I've long searched for ways to cut weeds without having to bend over.  This tool is lightweight, enough so for one-handed use.  Perhaps durability was sacrificed for weight, but after being used for only a short time, the spring in the mechanism up top dislodged somehow and the blades would no longer open correctly.  No amount of trying to grab the end of that  spring with longnosed pliers would work to pop it back where it was supposed to go.  The tool is riveted, not bolted together, thereby preventing me from taking it apart to try to fix it.  I had to toss it in the trash as it was useless, taking up room, and irreparable.  I've had other stuff from Fiskars that I was happy with, for example a bypass pruner with long handles and a gear mechanism for leverage.
