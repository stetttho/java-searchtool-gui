 As a diehard fan of CRPGs, and especially of BG1, BG2, and Icewind Dale I was sorely disappointed in this expansion pack. Unlike Tales of the Sword Coast, which proved to be a challenge, my "final save" party from IWD breezed through this easily. I finished this expansion pack on the second day. Sure there were some graphic improvements and higher experience levels, but this thing was nowhere near worth..., not for just the few quests that you get for it.  The boss, or "foozle," or whatever you might call him, was a disappointment, too, much less difficult than similar monsters in BG2.  If you have unlimited funds, go for it, but I would say that you should wait for it to show up in the bargain bin.
