 This refers to the paperback edition.  I'm about  halfway thru the book, and I can say that it's taken me a long time to get here.  The setting, historical background, etc., had enormous potential in my mind. The description of the land under the influence of the Mist seems so much like  where I live in Feb-April, when it is always cloudy, rains almost every  day, and everything is gushy and mushy mud, etc.  Imagine if it never  stopped.  Fascinating.  The personalities and interaction of the brothers  also were fascinating to me as well.  Unfortunately, the sheer length and  complexity of sentences, while I can understand them, make reading this  more like studying my technical literature than leisure and enjoyment.   It's like the author has to prove how verbose she is.  Also, many sequences  in the book are difficult to follow, as if this book had to have a prequel  that the reader had to have read prior.  I had this same feeling when I  read the 'Lord if the Rings'  having not read 'The Hobbit.'  Basically you  just felt lost sometimes. For me, it just seems like work to try to follow  this book.  It is definitely not fast-paced.  Thank God for the glossary in  the back with descriptions, or it would be hopeless for me. Also, the map  in the front is scaled down so much most of the writing is illegible.   Thus, even if you had some idea where a location in the book was on the  map, you likely would not be able to read it.  Only the plot and storyline,  and the character development keeps me going with this one.  This is one  that is easy for me to put down. I had great hopes for this after the  Empire books, but then again, Ray Feist's books are fast-paced, don't bog  you down with unnessarily long descriptions, and are just plain fun to  read. Have to be dedicated to stick with this one.
