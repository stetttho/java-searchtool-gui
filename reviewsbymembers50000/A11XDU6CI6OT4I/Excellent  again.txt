 This book is a fitting successor to the Dragonbone Chair. Tad Williams continues with his fine work in the previous book. Again, this is a story of epic proportion, with numerous subplots and lots of character  development. Osten Ard again is a vibrant,believable world in the process  of being overwhelmed by a seemingly unstoppable ancient evil. The heroes  are a scattered, ragtag bunch running for their lives, having a vague  notion of how the evil should be stopped, but having very few options at  their disposal. It just seems that there is no way in the world that good  will prevail here, although here and there there are hints  as to how it  might occur. The despair of the main characters in the story is almost  palpable.  I found myself identifying many times with characters, many of  which are memorable.  Characters grow and develop in the book and in the  reader's mind.  This book is more fast-paced and has more action than the  previous title, but character development and interaction are not  sacrificed.  Magic is referred to more than in the previous title, and is  of the sort that implies that much effort and power(fueled by hatred and  vengeance) were expended in its implementation.  The enemy strikes with  magic in places the reader would never expect. This book again contains  much in the way of kingdom politics, intrigue, betrayal, loyalty, dark  scheming, and much, much more. This book kept me up very late some nights  so I could learn what happened next.  Again, much of what will probably be  important is not revealed early in this epic tale.  I felt like my  understanding of the Sithi was very inadequate and grew very slowly, just  as Simon's did.  Like the mortals in the books, it is difficult so far  for  me to truly understand the culture of the Sithi and its timeless  ways.   I'm looking forward to finding out more.
