 My turntable died years ago and I wore out the cassette version that I had, so I was elated to find that I could order this here.  I was disappointed to find that some of the best stuff was not included to allow  one CD.  I would far rather pay more and get the whole thing.  This ranked  right up there with radio stations cutting out some of the guitar solos in  songs. ANyway, this brought back the nostalgia from my early high school  days, when I had all of REO's early albums. Gary's solos here are still  incredible, and I don't think he got much credit, unfortunately.  All of  their stuff from the 70s was so much better than the post-Nine Lives stuff.   Every song here, I mean every one, is great.  Listen to them before they  went pop to sell more records.  After HI-Infidelity came out, I lost  interest in them.
