 I really enjoyed this coming of age tale of young  Lerris.  The start was  very slow, i.e., Lerris plodding along in his Uncle's woodshop.  I almost  couldn't get past the beginning, but once he set forth on his Dangergeld I  could scarcely put it  down.  The magic system of Chaos and Order really  made tangible sense to me, more so than in many other books of this type.   I recommend it to any fan of the genre.
