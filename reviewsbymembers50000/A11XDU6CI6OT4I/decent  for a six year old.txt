 This product will work quite well with XP or 2000.  My daughter especially likes the explorer part.  She has learned some things about ancient Egypt from this, and it seems to be getting her interested in other cultures.  She is just now starting to get into the math CD, and it's a little hard for her, but she's catching on.   Overall, it was a well-spent $19.  It will work with Farstone's virtual CD, for those that are tired of saying "don't touch the shiny part" and washing CDs.
