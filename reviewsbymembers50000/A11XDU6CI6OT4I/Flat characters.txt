 I picked up this book, a hardcover, in the bargain bin for four bucks or so.  The map inside the cover was interesting. An archipelago world, hmmm, possibility of lots of naval action here, I thought.  I have to say that I  have not finished the book.  I can state that the storyline and historical  background had fantastic possibilities in my mind.  But the flat characters  just aren't able to pull it off.  They seem dull, lacking emotion, and just  don't seem to be developed in a way that they could have been.  I found  that I had no sense of identifying with them.  It seemed like I could care  less what happened to them.  Whether that changes in the later stages of  the book, I don't know, but it was such drudgery getting there that I had  to stop.  I don't like posting a bad review, but this is my opinion and can  be taken or left, keeping in mind that I'm a doctor, not a writer.
