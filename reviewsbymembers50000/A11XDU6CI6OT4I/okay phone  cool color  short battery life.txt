 The phone has a good feel in your hand and good balance.  I really like the color.  Its range and clarity I would rate about average for a 900 mhz analog phone, not nearly as good as a DSS though. I really like the volume  control, and the headset volume on medium is as good or better than high on  some other phones.  My main gripe is with the batttery life.  I have the  black version of this at the office and the battery will last almost a  week, and that would include at least 2 hours talk time, but my blue  version at home will go only 2-3 days and very little talk time before  beeping.  I don't understand the difference between the two, unless I have  a dud battery.  The battery is not available at any of the local stores  here,it seems to be proprietary, which is a big downer for me. The phone is  easily programmable to call in, for example, a telephone dictation system,  and get  dictations.  There is a way to put pauses, etc., but the how-to is  buried in the manual.  Once it beeps for low battery, you have very little  time to finish your conversation.  The ability to choose between four  different ring tones is nice.
