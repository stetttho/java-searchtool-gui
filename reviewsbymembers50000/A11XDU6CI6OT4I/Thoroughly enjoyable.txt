 This second book in the Tobyn-ser chronicles series was very difficult for me to put down. I forsook quite a bit of sleep in order to finish it quickly, and I can't say that about very many fantasy genre books that I've  read lately.  The historical setting that the novel takes place is very  interesting, but certainly not new, i.e., a high-tech society existing in  the same world as a society steeped in magic.  There certainly were enough  plot twists to keep me coming back.  What I really enjoyed was the  character interaction and politics of the magicians in the Order.  I came  to really care about what happened to the main characters, and the action  was very fast-paced. I also got a very strong sense of the history and  culture of the two lands that the book takes place in.  Unlike quite a few  fantasy books, it is easy to picture what the author is trying to say as  opposed to some other books I'm struggling with that have long and run-on  sentences.  In other words, it was easy to enjoy just reading both this one  and the first one, and not having to work hard just to understand it.  The  author took a character, Orris, who seemed pretty arrogant and distasteful  in the first book and matured him and gave the reader a whole new way of  looking at him. The only thing that bothers me about the plot is, if the  technolgical society is so advanced and would certainly explore and fly  over the oceans, why wouldn't the pristine, unspoiled, resource-rich  Tobyn-Ser come to its attention far sooner than this?  I'm not sure that  this nagging question is answered adequately, but it may just be me.   Certainly doesn't spoil the book, nor keeping me from recommending it  wholeheartedly.
