 This CD is not recorded with the best of technology's offerings. The rain sounds like spittle, and the thunderclaps sound as fake as something from a 1940's melodrama.  Not a lot of reality here. My advice is to buy Thundering Rainstorms. The Thundering Rainstorms CD seemed more "real" and less phony. I love the storms of the Midwest, but listening to Electrifying Thunderstorms made me think of horrid old B movies. By the way, if you are making a movie that needs a thunderstorm track, then this is for you. Total "B" Movie sound.
