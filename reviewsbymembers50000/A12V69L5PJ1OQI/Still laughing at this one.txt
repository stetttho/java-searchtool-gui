 This movie never gets old!  It is still as funny as ever, and the extra footage even seems to add a little continuity. I come from a suburb of Chicago, and a great amount of the fun I have is in seeing old, familiar places being turned upside-down by the hilarious exploits of Jake and Elwood.  A little-known fact of this cinema milestone is that it documents, with great care, much of Chicago's past look.  The Maxwell Street sequence, alone,is a clearly-intended slice of the city's history.  The beauty, and the cultural depth of Chicago, are fondly portrayed.  And don't forget the music!  I gotta tell you that this movie has soul, as well as humor.  All-time great musicians are all over this work. Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, James Brown, Cab Calloway, and don't forget John Lee Hooker!  What a line-up, and what a sound! Seriously good laughs, music, acting, and story.  A real movie classic.
