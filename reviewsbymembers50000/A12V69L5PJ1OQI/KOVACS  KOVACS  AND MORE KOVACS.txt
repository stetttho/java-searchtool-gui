 I haven't seen these bits in nearly 20 years, and coming back to them was like a bullet of nostalgia, with a hint of sadness.  Like the voice-over intro states, "Slow down your internal clock.  It was a quieter time."  The humor is strong on some pieces, but a lot of the stuff on these discs is not as funny as Python, or Belushi.  Still, if you take into account the fact that TV was still a relatively new concept, at this time, and that main-stream America was very laid back, and homespun, you look at Ernie's work, and realize how bizarre, funny, and experimental it all was. The sadness only comes in the fact that many people, today, will dismiss it, as my niece did, as stupid, or boring.  Ernie even pioneered the concept of music videos!  Like the humor of Python, however, some folks just don't get it.  As far as the collection, itself, this 2 DISK set is chock full!  There is so much to it, I had to stop viewing, after the first disk, because I had had an overdose already, and needed to save the other disk for later. There is just so much on these disks, and it is WONDERFUL to be able to preserve these sketches, rather than losing them to the ravages of time. If you enjoy, and respect, the work of Ernie Kovacs, quite possibly the greatest TV experimentalist of all-time, you need to get this collection.  You'll laugh, and remember. Both are important.
