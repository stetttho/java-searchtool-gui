 Ok. If you like the Righteous Brothers, this is a very good collection of their works, but beware!  The makers of this CD did not spend much money on making the sound work for modern stereo systems. The recordings have not  been mixed to enhance their quality. There is hiss, and rather washed out  bass and trebel. NO PUNCH!   I know that these are old, analog recordings,  but they can be cleaner. Also, I remember a more intense version of  Unchained Melody, than the one that appears on this disc. Buy it for the  songs, but not the quality.
