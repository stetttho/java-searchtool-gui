 This is a toy for the adult kid.  Most kids won't even know who Ash is.  Too bad for them!  The detail and workmanship of this movie hero replication is of the highest quality.  McFarlane and company really did a great job!  I do have to agree that it would have been nice if he had a few more quotes to say, but I won't look a gift horse in the mouth.  The films are so loaded with Ash's bad lines that you probably couldn't get them all in.  This figure is big, and heavy, so be sure you have the space, and the place for him!  The durability is excellent, but I won't be as rough on the figure as Sam Rami was with Bruce Campbell. Really a fun toy to have around!
