 For anyone who seeks the multi-facetted wonders that can be created when good old fashioned rock-n-roll is melded with the soul-lifting voice of a full orchestral accompanyment, this is your chance to hear the results!   Lynne & Co. create mental images with music through their use of expert  mixology, and meticulous overlaying. The artistry, both in studio skill, as  well as musicianship, is truly stunning in "Out Of The Blue".  This must-own collection of songs still reaches accross the years to touch  all of those who have a discerning ear for music.  By far, the Electric  Light Orchestra's highest achievement!
