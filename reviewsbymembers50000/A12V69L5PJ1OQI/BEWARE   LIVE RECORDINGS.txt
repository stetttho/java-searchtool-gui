 I was totally misled by the song line-up and the "greatest hits" claim on this dog.  If you buy it you are going to be asking yourself, later, "why didn't I read the reviews."  Almost every good song  he ever did is represented by a live recording done with the pathetic  audience singing along.  Dear God! He isn't even in good voice on these  tracks! and his vocals growl, and crack amidst the shoddy band strains  which accompany him! Save yourself from the grief of having to return this  stinker.  I hope you read this before you make the same mistake I did.   Otherwise, hey, there's one born every minute.
