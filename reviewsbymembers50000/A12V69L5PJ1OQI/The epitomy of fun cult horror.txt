 I won't waste your time trying to explain the plot.  It is what you watch the film for.  I won't tell you it's terrifying, because it isn't.  I won't tout the actors as some of the finest in Hollywood.  They were all "outside" of that genre (thank God). What I will say is that if you love to laugh, and get a few shocks, and experience a creepy, and twisted tale that gets so convoluted you can't really be sure what is coming next, then Phantasm is your ticket to ride.  It's fun, sometimes scary, and visually it is striking, especially when you consider the budget of the film, and the period in which it was shot. But if you have seen this film, previously,you already know it's extreme value in horror cinema's history.   So why buy it?  THE EXTRAS!!! This is Coscarelli's gift to the fans!!!! Lots of home movies shot during the making of the film!!! Interviews!!!  Deleted scenes!!!  Digital sound!!! The actors, and the director, even have a commentary track you can listen to, while you watch the film: providing great insights into the making of this fine work.  Many humorous anecdotes, and behind-the-scenes stories are related. Wide screen play!!!  Uncut!!!  Even a full audio track of the song "Sitting Here at Midnight"!!! If you loved the movie, you must buy this DVD!!! The "Tall Man" commands it! ENJOY!!!
