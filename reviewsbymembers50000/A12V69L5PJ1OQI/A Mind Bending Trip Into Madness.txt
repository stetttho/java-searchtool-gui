 Director Alan Parker teams up with psychedelic supergroup Pink Floyd to paint a vivid tapestry of madness, paranoia, and self-destruction. It is the story of "Pink", a rock star mixing drugs, alcohol, sex, and a lost childhood into a miasma that so strangles, and overloads his brain as to warp reality itself. In the end, he has nowhere to turn but within: the most dangerous place of all. Nightmarish visual imagery, counterpointed by the music of one of history's finest bands, at the height of their compositional skill, drags the viewer through an experience unlike any other previously created for the cinema.
