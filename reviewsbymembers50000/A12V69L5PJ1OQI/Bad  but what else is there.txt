 I hate to say it, but this was not what I had hoped for.  The guy who keeps singing, all through the film, over and over again, was mind-numbingly irritating.  He really wrecked the whole thing.  It was as if Rankin and Bass wanted to make a musical, and not a film portraying the dire events in Tolkein's tale.  There was a song in nearly every scene!  The only things the characters were missing, during these warbling little sing-song episodes, were ice-skates.  Ugh!  One other point that spoiled the film was the poorly contrived dialogue.  Granted, this word-waxing excess was somewhat present in the Rankin/Bass release of The Hobbit, but not to the overblown, and wretchedly unabashed heights of this production.  It just didn't carry very well at all: especially when Samwise is talking to himself, like some Shakespearean sycophant on an amphetamine binge, while Frodo is locked in the tower.  The Bible had less "thee's" and "thou's" strung through it's whole breadth than were encapsulated in that one scene.  My advice is to enjoy Rankin/Bass's version of The Hobbit, (where exposure to bad singing, and over-emphasis, are muted by some very good craftsmanship), then get Bakshi's Lord of the Rings, (because THAT is as good a movie adaptation, for this story, as we have gotten: to this date), skip Rankin/Bass's Return of the King, (it's just not what it could have been, and if you're of an age above 10 it will probably nauseate you) and get ready for the LOTR Trilogy movies, starting Christmas 2001! (Don't forget Tolkien's books, though.  They are better than any film about them will ever hope to be. READ THEM!!!)
