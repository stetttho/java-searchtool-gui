 Sorry, but no matter how much I admire and respect Mr. Lynne, and his wonderful contribution to my musical growth, and appreciation, I cannot write a grand approval for his latest effort. The Electric Light Orchestra were Jeff Lynne, Bev Bevan, Kelly Groucutt, Richard Tandy, Mik Kaminsky, Hugh McDowall, Melvyn Gale, Louis Clark, and "Mack".  This was a collection of highly talented musicians, and technical visionaries, unequalled by any other to date.  Calling this "the return of The Electric Light Orchestra" is like calling an unbroken egg a cake.  You can't have the cake without the egg, but the egg is not, of itself, a cake.  Yes Jeff Lynne has every right to use the name of the group, but doing so shows his all-out sell-out of the name for the sales, and not for the sound of the band.  I am amazed at how many "true fans" of the band are also selling out because they hunger for what is lacking.  What the ELO was is not what this CD is.  The song "Alright" is overrated, and will probably not make the charts.  "Easy Money" rocks a good deal, and you can surely pick out Ringo and George in there bits.  Mostly, however, this work is, at best, a folly of one. The mix is so flat it could be used to level your dinner table!  Here is a game you can play while listening to the entire CD: it is called "Try and find the orchestral influence."  This is a solo work, by Jeff Lynne, and if he had any true belief in it, he would not have tried to hide behind the name of the ELO.  "Armchair Theatre" is back, NOT the Electric Light Orchestra.  Buy it for the continuity of your collection, but know that this is NOT what "real" ELO fans were really waiting for (the unspoken desire...reunion).
