 Who writes these reviews???  This film is not meant for analysis, or introspection, or cultural relevence.  Here is the "bottom line".  Did you think Cheech and Chong were funny?  If you said "NO", then get on with your life! You have no reason to see this film.  If you said "YES", then get yourself a copy of this wraunchy, in-your-face, dube-smokin', road trippin', fart rippin', juvenile-giant of a comedy! Sure it's an all-out sell, for the White Castle franchise, but let me ask you: How many of you were ever stoned, and wanted Whities Sliders???  This movie made my 60 year old mom laugh!  For those of you who are too young, or too disconnected, to know about Cheech and Chong, let me put it plain, and simple.  Did you ever party like a maniac, and find yourself REALLY hungy, horny, and completely lost?  If you've been there, then this film is for you, and ME.  My actual rating is 4.5 stars. Yep. It was that depraved.  ENJOY!
