 I am going to play out some favoritism here.  This is one of the best horror films to come out of the 70's, and onto DVD.  Not only is it a great story; full of twisted characters, sick shock scenes, and deviant sexual content (all with a root of pure evil), it has an unbelievably star-studded cast!  Ask yourself, "Where else, but in the "The Sentinel" can a great actor, like Christopher Walken, say so little, and chew so much gum, and still make it look pretty damn good?" (Was that Wrigley's, or Juicy-Fruit?) Even more...check out Burgess Meredith as Satan himself!  You think Burgess never got more evil than The Penguin?  Guess again kiddo!  OK.  Don't expect DOLBY sound (The sound is good, considering the age of the film).  Don't look for digitally enhanced effects, or quality (No one would want to sink that kind of cash into this 'un). And don't expect a lot of extras (There really aren't any).  What you do get is the uncut (HALLELUJAH!!!) version of a very decent print of the film (Sorry. No widescreen folks). Get it because, soon, you may never see a chance to get it again.  This film is very obscure, and will, in time, be lost forever.  Great for dark nights, and popcorn!  Turn off the lights, and have a chill.
