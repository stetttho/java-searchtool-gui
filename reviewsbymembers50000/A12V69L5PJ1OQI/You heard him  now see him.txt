 Here is your only chance to see the great talent of Jeff Buckley, live and in person.  Sadly, he lost his life in a swimming accident, and the world will be diminished, musically, by this tragedy.  However, some of his finest work is captured here.  This concert gives the viewer a chance to see a young talent ply his skills with pure artistry. His guitar is captivating, and his voice is haunting.  Give yourself a musical treat, and pick this DVD up.  The only reason I gave it 4, instead of 5 stars, is because of a digital flaw in the song Lilac Wine.  The program stalls in this song.  I checked on more than one DVD player, and they both manifested the same pause.  Other than that... a great buy!
