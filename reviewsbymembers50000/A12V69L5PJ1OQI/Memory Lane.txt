 Maybe I wasn't old enough to remember, but this film sure shows it like what I imagined it would be.  The end of the 50's innocense, and the start of a whole new America: for better, and for worse. Watch the two worlds; established authority, and rebellious youth, clash in some of the most hilarious situations brought to the screen.  See the 50' fade, while the Hollywood Knights do their level best to preserve a dying lifestyle with pranks, public obscenity, and farting.  This is Animal house meets Happy Days, with a bit of ominous "coming of age" stuff thrown in to put a little tear in your eye.  Personally, I could have done without the whole "Vietnam foreshadowing" thing, or the mushy romance sidlines, but as I see it, this film wants to make a little statement, while it keeps you laughing.  So get a taste of what the good life used to be like.  This film should keep you entertained all the way through.
