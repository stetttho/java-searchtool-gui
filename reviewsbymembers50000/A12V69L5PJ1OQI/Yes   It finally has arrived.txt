 For all of you who were alive, and still in high-school when this film came out, here is a chance to re-live the fun, the talent, and the artwork that Bakshi wrapped around Tolkein's classic tale The Lord of The Rings. Sure it looks dated!  It was a time unto itself, and I remember a cloud of smoke in the theatre that seemed to permeate everything, while I watched the wild imagery up on the screen.  The hairstyles, the coloring, the ambience of the film were all part of the era, but they still seem to lend themselves to the positive side of the viewing experience, and not to the negative.  Maybe younger persons will find it flaky, or just plain stupid, but that is something to be expected from kids who have their ideas, and ideals, spoon-fed to them by MTV, and a culture that seems to regard Fantasy as a wasteland-realm for the socially mis-fit. And ENOUGH from the HARDCORE, Tolkein, religeous-right!  Any of you who claim Bakshi didn't see it the way it was supposed to be, or state that he "put bad 70's hair on everyone", should "get out of your parent's basements and find a job, and a girlfriend!  What a bunch of nit-picking, self-proclaiming garbage!  I read the books too, and I'll bet that what I saw, while reading them, looked nothing like what you saw.  But I digress.  This is a great film, and I recommend it highly.
