 Here is the Electric Light Orchestra's swan song.  While Lynne did a good job of creating some memorable songs, by this time he had really started to miss the mark as to what fans truly wanted from him. Now the lead guitarist, and front runner of the Electric Light Orchestra had started using ELO as the actual name of the band, and was cutting even more corners, as well as group members. No longer interested in the band's persona, or legacy, J. Lynne had decided to be an "artist" rather than a writer of music for the E.L.O.. He was tired of the same old thing and wanted to "grow" and "evolve" his vision for the band.  This meant, of course, that the music would change.  This release has the Lynne touch, musically, but it lacks, completely, the depth, and beauty of an orchestral influence.  You will be hard pressed to hear any symphonic instruments at all, as this was the continuation of Jeff's "forget the cellos, we have synthesizers" attitude. He actually took on the jobs of many of the other members, and became the group itself.  I gave this recording 3 stars because, as I said earlier, the writing, and the voice of Lynne were still working fairly well, and his talent does come through, but the rest of the band, for the most part, was no longer there, and the sound shows it.  Worth the buy, but as Discovery showed, the E.L.O. was moving into a more plastic neighborhood.
