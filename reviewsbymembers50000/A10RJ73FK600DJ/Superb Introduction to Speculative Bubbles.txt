 The heading for one chapter of Edward Chancellor's fine book quotes the investor Sir John Templeton: "The four most expensive words in the English language are 'this time it's different.'"  Templeton's words sum up the most important lesson to be learned from this outstanding history of speculation, which focuses in particular on those manic episodes called bubbles, in which the prices of assets are driven to levels far above those justified by the assets' underlying fundamentals. Chancellor's account, while not a comprehensive study of speculation, thoroughly examines major speculative periods from the tulip mania of the early 17th century, to the Japanese "bubble economy" of the 1980's.  Three repeating motifs characterize these speculative episodes.  First is the irrationality of financial markets, especially the way in which people of all eras are susceptible to the euphoria which inflates a bubble.  Second is the constant recurrence of manipulation of markets by the greedy and unethical, the likes of Jay Gould and his accociates. The third and most important theme is the existence of parallels between past speculative bubbles and conditions in our own time.  Chancellor convincingly argues, for example, that the internet mania of today is similar in many ways to the British railway bubble of the 1840's. I strongly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in financial markets or their influence on history.  The only, slight caveat I would offer is that it helps a reader to have at least some knowledge of the language of financial markets, as Chancellor at times tosses terminology at readers without offering a clear definition.
