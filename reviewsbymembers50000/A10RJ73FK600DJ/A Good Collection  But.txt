 This is a very nice "best of Nanci Griffith" Collection. Griffith is one of the finest singer-songwriters of our time, and anyone unfamiliar with her career will find this album is a solid introduction.  Among the eleven tracks are three Griffith compositions that I find completely unforgettable:  "Love at the Five and Dime," "There's a Light Beyond These Woods," and "It's a Hard Live Wherever You Go."  Also included is the vigorous "Outbound Plane," the haunting "Late Night Grande Hotel," and Griffith's famed cover of Julie Gold's "From A Distance." While this is, as I said, a good album, there's a better "best of Nanci" collection in existence.  You can get virtually all of "The Millenium Collection"--8 out of 11 tracks, including all six listed above--in the collection "The MCA Years."  The latter album, with 18 songs total, offers a broader overview of Griffith's career.  Unfortunately, it's apparently becoming harder to find; Amazon has it listed in "limited availability."  So for now, this album will probably have to do for those wanting a sampling of Griffith's considerable talents.
