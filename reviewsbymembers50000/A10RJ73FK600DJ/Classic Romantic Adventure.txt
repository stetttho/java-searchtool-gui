 This is the sort of romantic adventure that Hollywood doesn't make much anymore--the sort of movie that has been superseded, lamentably, by the speical effects-laden action movies of today.  "The Sea Hawk" is  one of the finest of the genre. In one of his finest performances, Errol  Flynn is Captain Geoffrey Thorpe, an English privateer modeled after Sir  Francis Drake.  War looms between Elizabethan England and Spain.  We meet  Captain Thorpe when he captures a Spanish ship carrying the new Ambassador,  Don Alvarez, and his half-English niece, Donna Maria (played by a radiant  Brenda Marshall). As Thorpe conveys the ambassador to England, sparks fly  between him and Donna Maria, of the sort that let us know that they're made  for each other. At Queen Elizabeth's court, Thorpe's fellow "sea  hawks" press the queen to build up a fleet, while her counselor Lord  Wolfingham opposes them.  Thorpe, with the queen's completely unofficial  sanction, plans a blow against the Spanish, while his romance with Maria  blossoms.  But wait, why is Lord Wolfingham spending all that time with the  Spanish Ambassador... Besides Flynn and Marshall, the film boasts  standout performances from Flora Robson as Queen Elizabeth, Claude Rains as  Don Alvarez (surprisingly sympathetic towards his niece and her love for  Thorpe), and Henry Daniell as the sinister, well-named Wolfingham.  Farther  down the cast you have solid performances from the likes of Alan Hale, Una  O'Connor and Donald Crisp. The jewel in "The Sea Hawk's" crown  is Erich Wolfgang Korngold's score.  Korngold was the John Williams of his  day, the master of the rich orchestral film score.  Why he didn't win an  Oscar for this, his finest score of all, is one of Hollywood's many  mysteries.   But of course, so is the question of why Hollywood doesn't  make movies like this anymore.
