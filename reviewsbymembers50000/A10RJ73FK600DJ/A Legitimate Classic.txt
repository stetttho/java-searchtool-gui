 Fred Anderson's stated goal in writing "Crucible of War" was to produce "a book accessible to general readers that will also satisfy...historians' scholarly expectations."  I am pleased to report that he attains that goal as completely as anyone could reasonably  expect. Anderson's subject is a relatively small slice of US history--the  conflict known variously as the French and Indian War or the Seven Years  War, along with the war's immediate aftermath.  His narrative is highly  informative.  He describes how isolated skirmishes on what was then  America's western frontier escalated into a true global war, involving  every major European power.  He convincingly explains how England  eventually came to triumph over her rivals, and to inherit much of France's  erstwhile colonial empire.  Although his focus in on North America, he does  not neglect events in Europe.  He then shows how events like the Stamp Act  Crisis and Pontiac's Rebellion were inextricably linked to the war and its  outcome. Anderson deserves credit for his skillful blend of diplomatic,  military, economic and social history into a coherent whole--he should be a  model for other scholars in this respect.  Also noteworthy is his clear  identification of the interest of the four main groups involved in the  North American conflict--the French and their Canadian colonists, the  English, the American colonists, and the Native Americans--and his  untangling of the conflicts both within and between these groups. While  specialists may end up quibbling with some of the details of Anderson's  interpretations, he seems to me to have amply demonstrated his claim that  the French and Indian War was an extremely important influence on the  revolutionary events of the following decades.  "Crucible of War"  is a genuine classic of historical writing.
