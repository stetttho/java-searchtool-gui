 All of the strengths that have won Emmylou Harris so many loyal admirers come together on this album, and are amplified by the energy and intensity of a great live recording. Harris has always had exceptional taste in selecting material to record, and "At the Ryman" is no exception.  She draws on great songwriters old (Stephen Foster) and new (Steve Earle, Bruce Springsteen) to present a program that is so strong it's hard to pick out the highlights.  Fans of Bill Monroe will be delighted with the three Monroe tunes on the album.  Perhaps the peak of the many high points is a beautiful medley of Nanci Griffith's "It's a Hard Life Wherever You Go" and Richard Holler's "Abraham, Martin and John." Harris is in superb voice throughout the concert, and once again has surrounded herself with a brilliant group of musicians, the Nash Ramblers.  Led by bassist Roy Huskey, and featuring some brilliant fiddling from Sam Bush on several tracks, the Ramblers are worthy successors to Harris's Hot Band of the 70's and 80's. Lovers of traditional music of any sort--folk, bluegrass, etc.--will want this album, as will anyone interested in an introduction to Harris's artistry.  And if any Harris fans don't own this album yet--well, the "click to order" button is just up the page.
