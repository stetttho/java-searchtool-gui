 Emmylou Harris has always been known primarily for her appealing interpretations of other people's songs.  In this album she reveals her own talents as a songwriter--of the 12 tracks, Harris wrote or cowrote all but one--and they appear to be considerable, especially when it comes to bittersweet ballads.  The title track and "My Antonia" are masterpieces (when I first played this album, I couldn't get the latter song out of my head), and several other songs grow on you after a few listenings. Some reviewers object to the sound of this album, and I agree that if you're used to the Harris of "Roses in the Snow," or "At the Ryman," you will find it very different.  To me it recalls the sound of Celtic groups like Clannad or maybe Altan.  I personally loved it, but I guess it may not be for all tastes.  Vocally, Harris is as good as ever. "Red Dirt Girl" richly deserved the Grammy it received for Best Contemporary Folk Album.
