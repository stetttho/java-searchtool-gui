 Philip Kitcher is a professor of philosophy at UC-San Diego.  A specialist in the philosophy of science, he has also authored books on sociobiology and cloning.  This book is a valuable contribution to the evolution-creation debate. In "Abusing Science," Kitcher's  emphasis is on the logic of creationism--dissecting the arguments made by  creationists, especially Henry Morris and Duane Gish of the  ludicrously-named Institute for Creation Research, and thoroughly debunking  them.  To give one specific example: Creationists are fond of arguing that  evolutionists date fossils based on the ages of the rocks in which the  fossils are found.  But, say creationists, the dates of the rocks are  established using fossils; so, they claim, evolutionists are guilty of  circular argument.  Kitcher shows how this argument is a misrepresentation  of the science: creationists ignore the numerous alternative, independent  methods for dating rocks, such as radiometric or stratigraphic methods.   Throughout the book, Kitcher exposes scores of weak creationist arguments  just like this. It is worth noting that Kitcher quotes at great length  from creationist authors, and cannot validly be accused of any  misrepresentation of their arguments.  Kitcher also shows how the  creationist attack on evolution is really an attack on all science:   "If evolutionary biology is to be dismissed...all the major fields of  science will have to be trimmed--or, more exactly, mutilated--to fit the  creationist bill." While Kitcher's somewhat meticulous style makes  some demands on the reader, it is well worth the effort.  Even though his  book is nearly 20 years old, it is still relevant to today's debates--it is  astonishing how many of the arguments put forward by Philip Johnson, for  example, are just recycled from Morris and Gish.  Anyone who is a science  educator or is concerned with educational policy would find this book  especially valuable.
