 In today's US it is almost impossible to avoid encountering standardized tests--mass-produced, multiple-choice, fill-in-the-bubble, machine-scored  exams of all sorts.  Standardized tests are used to assess the performance  of public schools, in many systems to determine which students will be held  back a grade, to decide who will get into college, and into graduate and  professional school, and who will get certain jobs.   In  "Standardized Minds," Peter Sacks delivers a devastating critique  of the use of such tests.  His indictment includes a wide range of  particulars, only some of which can be summarized here. First,  standardized tests are not a source of useful information.  A widely used  reading test given to elementary school students can err by as much as  three grade levels in measuring a student's reading level.  The SAT,  required for admission to most colleges, has no use other than to make  predictions, with limited accuracy, of students' freshman year grades.  The  GRE, required for admission to most Ph.D. programs, actually has a negative  correlation with future success as a scholar. Second, standardized tests  are very biased.  The best known of these biases is that of the SAT against  low-income, minority students.  Sacks shows that this bias extends to other  tests as well.  Another bias identified by Sacks is that standardized tests  are biased in favor of superficial thinking--the ability to rapidly recall  and repeat facts--and against the deeper thinking necessary to solve  complex real-world problems. Third, and perhaps most harmfully,  standardized tests promote "teaching to the test."  A number of  states have established what Sacks terms "high-stakes  accountability" programs, in which standardized test scores determine  whether students are promoted to the next grade or are allowed to graduate,  and are used to rank the performance of schools.  Sacks documents how such  "high-stakes" programs cause teachers to spend enormous amounts  of time drilling students in preparation for the tests.  Such teaching  practices promote rote memorization and superficial thinking at the expense  of critical thinking skills and genuine understanding--hardly a desireable  educational goal. It is important to note that Sacks is not merely giving  his personal opinions.  He has studied and mastered a great deal of  research.  At the same time, his book is far more than a dry academic  recital.  Unlike the Dinesh D'Souzas of the world, Sacks knows the proper  usage of anecdotes--to illustrate a generalzation, not as the basis for it.   Of the many illuminating stories he tells, one bears repeating.  St.  John's University's psych department requires students entering the Ph.D.  program to take the GRE, which is useless except to make somewhat accurate  predictions of first-year grades.  Students seeking a masters degree only,  while they take the same first-year courses, are not required to take the  GRE.  However, if these students wish, on completing a masters degree, to  enter the Ph.D. program, they must then take the GRE, even though the only  value of the exam is to "predict" their grades in courses they  have already taken. Sacks ends the book by noting some optimistic trends,  such as the growing number of colleges and universities which no longer  require applicants to take the SAT.  However, breaking the tyranny of  standardized testing will not be easy--the political pressures for the kind  of superficial "standards" and "accountability" such  tests provide are enormous.  But reading Sacks' book, and freeing your own  mind from the spell cast by standardized test scores, would be a good  start.
