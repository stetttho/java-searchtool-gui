 Any thoughts that Nanci Griffith might have lost her edge, either as a songwriter or a performer, should be dispelled by this superb album.  It mixes several moving Griffith originals with some well-done covers. The opening track, "Clock Without Hands," has a tone of bittersweet reminiscence that sets the mood for the entire album.  Several numbers look back at the Vietnam War, and some reflect Griffith's commendable involvement in the international campaign against landmines.  Both these themes merge in the album's showstopper, the rousing and moving "Pearl's Eye View," which has me fascinated with Vietman-era photojournalist Dickey Chappelle. A part of Griffith's career has always been coverage of the works of other great songwriters, so it is a pleasure to see her record three songs by John Stewart, another of my favorites, on this album.  An even greater pleasure is Stewart's own presence, playing guitar for all three tracks and singing harmony on the best performance of the three, "Lost Him in the Sun." Fans of Griffith, or of excellent songwriting in general, should find this album well worth owning.
