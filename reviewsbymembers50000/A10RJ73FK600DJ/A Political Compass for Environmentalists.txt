 This very perceptive book establishes Philip Shabecoff as one of the top journalists of our time.  In it he tries to outline a course for the environmental movement to take in the coming decades.  What makes "Earth Rising" so important is Shabecoff's understanding that modern societies like the US are faced with three enormous and intertwined problems.  Besides the environmental degradation that rightly concerns environmental activists, there is the increase in both social and economic inequality, as well as the dysfunctionality of our money-dominated political system.  Shabecof argues that, since none of these problems can be solved in isolation, it is essential that the environmental movement become involved in dealing with all three--by, for example, working for reform of the political process--rather than focusing solely on their own set of specific issues. If Shabecoff had done no more than make this point, his book would merit 5 stars for the skillful way he presents his case.  But there is much more food for thought in the book.  For example, recognizing that scientific analyses of environmental problems are crucial to understanding and solving them, Shabecoff calls on scientists to follow the lead of those who, like Edward O. Wilson and Richard Leakey, have become strong advocates of the environment and its importance. Anyone who is concerned about environmental issues, or who considers themself an environmentalist, would learn a great deal from reading this book.
