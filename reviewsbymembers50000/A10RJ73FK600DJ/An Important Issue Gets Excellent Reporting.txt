 This book begins as a personal story.  One day journalist Stephen Fried was forced to rush his wife, novelist Diane Ayres, to an emergency room, when she suffered a severe seizure.  She turned out to be suffering an adverse reaction to an antibiotic, Floxin, which she had been instructed to take for a minor urinary infection.  "Bitter Pills" grew out of Fried's attempts to understand what had happened to his wife. Fried, and his readers, soon discover that Diane Ayres' case was not unique, or even rare.  Floxin is only one of legions of prescription drugs which can cause severe adverse reactions, which cause at least 45,000 deaths per year in the US (some estimates go as high as 200,000).  It is a tribute to Fried's excellence as a reporter that he is able go beyond his dramatic personal story to give a comprehensive picture of what he calls " the hazardous world of legal drugs." Fried reviews the history of drug regulation in the US, and ably documents the shortcomings of the current regulatory system, as well as the inordinate influence drug companies have on the process.  Two of the many specific "hazards" he identifies are the desperate need for doctors to have an independent, reliable source of information on the drugs they prescribe (almost all the informatin they currently have comes from drug manufacturers), and the equally crying need for an effective system for reporting and cataloging adverse drug reactions. I put this book down very impressed with Fried as both a reporter and a writer.  He has clearly immersed himself in an important issue long enough, and deeply enough, that he has mastered it.  He has then turned around to convey the complex issues involved to readers very effectively and without losing their interest.  I look forward to work of similar excellence from Fried in the future.
