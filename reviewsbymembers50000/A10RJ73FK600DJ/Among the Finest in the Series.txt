 From Russia With Love ranks among the top three films in the durable James Bond series.  As in many of the best films in the series, the tone is  relatively serious.  Rather than the fantastic schemes of some of the later  Bond films, the plot is a fairly straightforward espionage story, dealing  with Bond's attempts to get his hands on the obligatory MacGuffin, a coding  machine.  The story is believable and there is an atmosphere of genuine  tension throughout the film. From Russia With Love's greatest strength is  its superb cast.  Sean Connery, in his second outing as Bond, is very good,  handling both dialogue and action adeptly.  Daniela Bianchi is a beautiful  heroine, and her onscreen relationship with Bond is very plausible.  Other  roles are also cast from strength--Lotte Lenya and Robert Shaw, as the  principal villains, and Pedro Armendariz, as Bond's fellow MI-6 agent, are  the most notable performances. While From Russia With Love cannot be  considered a classic movie--it owes too much to North By Northwest for  that--it is a very enjoyable movie to view again and again.  I watch it  several times a year.
