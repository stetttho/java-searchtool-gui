 "Dancing Feet" is an apt name for this excellent album.  Dancing rhythms abound, both in instrumentals like the "Turf Lodge" set that opens the album and in vocal numbers like the martial "Tranient  Muir" and the exuberant "Maggie Lauder."  For a change of  pace, there is the finest version I have ever heard of the oft-recorded  "Wild Mountain Thyme." The Tannies are best known for the  excellence of their pipers (Iain MacInnes on this album), but to my mind  their musical signature is the guitar work of Roy Gullane.  His playing on  this album is simply electrifying. Fans of the Tannies will find this a  marvelous addition to their collections, while anyone wanting to give them  a try will find "Dancing Feet" an excellent first purchase.
