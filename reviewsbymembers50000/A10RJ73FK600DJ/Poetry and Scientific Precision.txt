 It is rare to find a book on a scientific subject that is both accurate and precise in its science and beautifully written.  It is no surprise to find that Sandra Steingraber, author of such a book, is both a Ph.D.  biologist and a published poet.   "Living Downstream" is a  superb blend of rigorous analysis and poignant memoir. Steingraber  documents the increasing evidence of a strong link between rising cancer  rates and environmental contamination.  At the same time she tells her own  story--that of a woman who suffered and survived cancer while only in her  20's.  This book has justly been compared to Rachel Carson's "Silent  Spring" and may, if read widely enough, have the same worldwide impact  that Carson's book had forty years ago.
