 I am normally not a fan of horror films, but I saw some of the reviews of this one and decided to rent it, and did not regret doing so.  It is now part of my collection.  What made it enjoyable were: 1.  Director Wes  Craven's way of poking fun of horror film conventions. 2.  A good script  by Kevin Williamson. 3.  Above all, excellent performances by the  ensemble cast.  Neve Campbell is really the lead (although only third  billed) and she is a superb heroine--sympathetic but also tough when she  has to be.  She is supported by great performances from Courteney Cox,  David Arguette, Rose McGowan and Jamie Kennedy, while Drew Barrymore is  superbly terrified in the opening scene. I greatly enjoyed this movie and  was glad to add it to my collection.
