 I initially purchased this CD in order to have a recording of Maura O'Connell's beautiful version of "It's a Beautiful Life," which was the theme song of one of my favorite radio shows when I lived in Southern California (the same show mentioned by a previous reviewer).  But while that track remains my favorite one on "Slide Rule," I have discovered several other treasures on this album as well.  Legendary dobroist Jerry Douglas surrounded himself with a top-notch group of instrumentalists, and then brought in several guest artists for specific numbers.  While fiddler Stuart Duncan is the only member of the core band who I was previously familiar with, all of them--Scott Nygaard on guitar, Mark Schatz on bass, Adam Steffey on mandolin and Craig Smith on banjo, along with Duncan and Douglas himself--are superb.  In one highlight number, Alison Krauss sings a very gentle tune called "I Don't Believe You've Met My Baby," while on another Alan O'Bryant joins the band for a very appropriate tune for a Jerry Douglas album, "When Papa Played the Dobro."  Naturally, there are also several standout instrumental numbers.  Several, such as "We Hide & Seek" and "Shenandoah Breakdown," give the entire band chances to take the lead.  In another, the "New Day Medley," Douglas shows what a beautiful sound a solo dobro can create.  Any lover of traditional music of any sort will want this album.
