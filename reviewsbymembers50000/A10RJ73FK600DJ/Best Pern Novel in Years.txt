 With this novel Anne McCaffrey gets away from some of the weaknesses that have plagued recent novels in her saga of the planet Pern--the excessive number of viewpoint characters and storylines and the rushed quality of the  plotting.  Masterharper of Pern is the story of one of the author's  favorite characters, Robinton, and covers his childhood, adolescence and  early manhood.  In it we learn much of the "backstory" behind the  "Dragonriders of Pern" trilogy, the beginnings of which this book  overlaps with. Lovers of the Pern novels will most likely enjoy this  book--although not the best book in the series, I found it to be superior  to any since "Dragonsdawn."  If you are new to the series, it is  not the best one to read first--start with "Dragonflight" and  "Dragonquest."  Read "Masterharper" if you like them.
