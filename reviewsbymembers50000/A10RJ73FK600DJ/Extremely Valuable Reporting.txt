 Christian Parenti's "Lockdown America" is one of many excellent recent books on crime policy.  As do David Cole and Elliott Currie, Parenti contributes to showing the failures of the one-dimensional crime policies  of the past 20-30 years, during which time the only acceptable variation on  "get tough" has been "get  tougher." "Lockdown" consists of three parts.  First,  Parenti surveys the development of crime policy over the past 30-odd years.   His account is sterngthened by his placement of crime policy in a broader  context of important social and economic trends such as growing income  inequality and the decline of manufacturing employment, especially in large  cities. The other two segments focus on two groups who are on the front  lines of crime policy--the police and prisons.  Parenti describes a number  of disturbing trends, such as:      -the spread of  "zero-tolerance" policing policies, and the enormous increase in  lawlessness and violence on the part of the supposed keepers of the law.       -the growing militarization of police forces as seen in the  proliferation of paramilitary SWAT teams and similar units, many of which,  again, are responsible for wildly excessive use of force.      -the  rampant degree to which prison guards engage in violence against inmates as  well as formenting such violence among inmates themselves. Parenti's  reporting is first-rate.  While his book is not a complete picture of the  crime issue--he is somewhat short on solutions--his account is a valuable  complement to the more policy-oriented work of Cole or Currie.   "Lockdown America" deserves to be widely read.
