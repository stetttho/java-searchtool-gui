 Star Trek II succeeds because, unlike the earlier Star Trek TMP, it goes back to the strengths of the original TV series.  Star Trek has never been "hard" Sci-fi; it has always been at its best when it focuses on  an attractive group of characters--Kirk, Spock, McCoy et al.   If you  haven't seen it yet, Star Trek II builds on an episode from the TV series  entitled "Space Seed," in which Kirk encounters a former dictator  of Earth named Khan, defeats his attempt to hijack the Enterprise, and  maroons him on a deserted planet.  Some 15 years later, Khan escapes, gains  control of another starship, the Reliant, and learns about the film's  MacGuffin, the "Genesis" device, potentially a lethal  superweapon.  Once again, the Enterprise is "the only ship in the  quadrant" available to deal with the crisis.  Along the way Kirk  discovers he has a son, and we also meet Lt. Saavik, a half-Vulcan protege  of Spock's. But the plotline is almost secondary.  Star Trek II is really  about how the characters, primarily Kirk and Spock, deal with growing old,  and with "no-win" situations, and eventually with death.  I've  sometimes thought of it as sort of an outer space counterpart to  Peckinpagh's "Ride the High Country." The cast is great,  especially Shatner and Nimoy, but also including Ricardo Montalban as Khan  (reprising his guest role in the TV series) and Kirstie Alley making an  impressive debut as Saavik.  Nicholas Meyer directs ably, and James  Horner's score is excellent. Of the six movies centered around the  original series Star Trek cast, I consider Star Trek II to be the best.
