 There have been several movies centered on the famous "Gunfight at the OK Corral."  I have seen at least six over the years.  Tombstone is probably the best of them other than John Ford's classic "My  Darling Clementine," which remains in a class of its own. The  central roles in any OK Corral movie are always Wyatt Earp and Doc  Holliday.  Val Kilmer's performance as Doc Holliday is the finest I have  ever seen on screen.  Kurt Russell plays Wyatt Earp.  His performance will  never erase memories of Henry Fonda, but it is solid.  Russell captures  some of the moral ambiguity of the real Wyatt Earp.  The supporting cast  is very good, led by a magnificent performance by Sam Elliott as Virgil  Earp.  Also noteworthy are Powers Boothe and Michael Biehn as the Earp's  foes, Curly Bill and Johnny Ringo, and Dana Delany as Josie Marcus, Wyatt's  love interest.  Western buffs will also want to watch for veteran Dobie  Carey in a small role.  Tombstone is also a visually beautiful  movie--some of the cinematography is spectacular. The one weak part of  the film is the final segment (about the last 20 minutes or so), which  degenerates into a montage of gunfight scenes where it is nearly impossible  to keep track of what is going on or who's just killed who.  But overall,  Tombstone is a very fine Western.
