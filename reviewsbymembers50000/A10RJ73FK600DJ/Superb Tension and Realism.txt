 No Witnesses is Ridley Pearson's third novel, of 6 to date, featuring Seattle homicide detective Lou Boldt and police department phsychologist Daphne Matthews.  It is a superb part of one of the must successful and  enjoyable mystery/suspense series going today.  I am amazed that Hollywood,  ever-starved for good storylines, especially when it comes to action films,  has yet to film any of the Boldt/Matthews novels. Pearson's has two great  strengths as a writer.  First, he has the ability to weave a complex plot  while sustaining tension.  Second, he can present the details of police  work, especially regarding forensic evidence, in a manner that is both  realistic and attention-holding.  No Witnesses does not disappoint in  either respect.  Someone is blackmailing food conglomerate Adler Foods by  threatening deadly contamination of their products.  As Matthews (who is  romantically linked to Adler's CEO) and Boldt begin a low-profile  investigation, it becomes clear that the blackmailer has the means to carry  out his deadly threats--he seems to be able to introduce poisoned products  right onto grocery store shelves.  While Boldt begins to build a chain of  evidence that he hopes will lead him to the killer, deaths begin to mount,  and some of those who are supposedly on Boldt's side reveal that they have  their own agendas. Pearson creates strong, three-dimensional characters,  none more so than Lou Boldt himself.  Boldt, along with Michael Connelly's  Harry Bosch, ranks among the most interesting fictional cops of the  1990's. Anyone who enjoys a good mystery, especially one centered on  realistic police work, would enjoy No Witnesses.  The Boldt/Matthews  novels, while a series, can be read out of sequence, so if this one sounds  good, don't hesitate to dive right in.
