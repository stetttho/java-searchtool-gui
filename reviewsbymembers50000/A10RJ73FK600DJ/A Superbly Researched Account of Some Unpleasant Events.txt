 The CIA has always been a very secretive organization, and remains one today.  In 1996, the publication of Gary Webb's "Dark Alliance" series threatened the CIA with unwelcome public scrutiny by exposing its  complicity in the drug trade: the CIA-created Nicaraguan contras were  funding their operations, in part, by selling crack cocaine on the streets  of Los Angeles, with the agency's knowledge.       Alexander Cockburn and  Jeffrey St. Clair's  "Whiteout: The CIA, Drugs and the Press"  jumps off from here.  Wisely, Cockburn and St. Clair do not make Webb's  story the core of their book; Webb's own book does that job admirably.   What they do contribute to this story is a devastating account of the  shameful way that the mainstream press, led by former intelligence officer  Walter Pincus of the Washington Post, turned on Webb in an effort to  discredit him and his story.  Cockburn and St. Clair repeatedly expose the  flaws in mainstream efforts to "debunk" the Dark Alliance series,  and catch many reporters acting as little more than flacks for the CIA,  often writing stories that said little more than "we know Webb's story is  false because the CIA told us so."       But the core of  "Whiteout" has a more historical perspective, as the authors set  out to review the underside of the history of the CIA and its precursor,  the OSS.  And an ugly picture it is, too, as we see these agencies:        -recruiting the Mafia to assassinate foreign leaders.       -recruiting  Nazi scientists to conduct experiments (often on blacks) in torture and  mind control.       -helping war criminal Klaus Barbie escape Europe, and  justice, to become a South American drug lord, arms dealer and apparent CIA  operative.       -allying with the opium and heroin traders of Southeast  Asia.       Working with drug dealers and other criminal elements is so  common for the CIA that it would appear from this account to have been  standard Agency procedure.       "Whiteout" is a well-written  and well-researched book.  Helpfully, the authors end each chapter with an  annotated guide to further reading on the subject.        "Whiteout" is not pleasant reading; I could only take so much at  a time before having to put it aside for the day.  But it is necessary  reading. In a democratic society, an agency such as the CIA, if it must  exist, must be under constant scrutiny or it will lapse into lawlessness  (the same is true of law enforcement agencies).  It is clear that the  mainstream media are not going to provide such scrutiny, so we must turn to  independent journalists like Cockburn and St. Clair and others like them  for the accurate information we need.
