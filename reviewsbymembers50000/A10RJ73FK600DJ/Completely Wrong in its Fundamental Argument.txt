 I'm amazed at the pro-Johnson reviewers here who have complained of negative reivews that allegedly ignore Johnson's arguments.  In fact, previous reviews have dealt with many of Johnson's central points, in  particular his main argument on the subject of naturalism.   To be  scientific, a claim must be testable--it must be possible to demonstrate  with evidence that the proposition is false.  Science must, then, by its  nature, confine itself to studying claims which can be tested with  evidence.  Claims that attribute some event to a supernatural force of some  kind, including all "God did it" claims, are inherently  untestable, and therefore, scientists properly do not examine such  claims. Johnson simply does not understand the centrality of testability  to science.  Therefore, when he observes scientists ruling out supernatural  explanations, he wrongly attributes their action to a quasi-religious bias  in favor of "naturalism."  This fundamental failure to understand  science invalidates Johnson's arguments.
