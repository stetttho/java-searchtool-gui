 Growing up listening to my parents' Kingston Trio albums, I knew who John Stewart was, and was vaguely aware of his solo career.  So when I came across this CD in the remainder bin of some forgotten record store, I decided to give it a try, and wound up being blown away.  This is a fantastic album! Recorded in March 1974, "The Phoenix Concerts" captures the highlights of the first 5 or 6 albums Stewart recorded; at least 8 of the 18 tracks included have to rank among Stewart's greatest compositions ever--"Cody," "Kansas," "Pirates of Stone County Road" and "California Bloodlines," among others.  While it only covers a portion of Stewart's career, I consider this album to be the best single-disc introduction to his music currently available. Stewart is a great live performer, and this album captures that quality.  From the opening "Wheatfield Lady" to the final "Let the Big Horse Run," every number crackles with energy.  A bonus is the inclusion of Stewart's between-songs banter, which used to liven Kingston Trio concerts.  The absolute show-stopper is the "Last Campaign Trilogy," in which Stewart combined a new song, "The Last Campaign," inspired by his experiences with the 1968 Kennedy campaign, with two older numbers, "Wild Horse Road" and "All the Brave Horses," into a stunning medley. Some of the best contributions to Stewart's albums over the years have come from his wife, Buffy Ford.  She contributes several vocals here, and is in especially stunning form on "Cody" and "All the Brave Horses." This album seems to go in and out of print, so Stewart fans who do not own it would be advised to snap it up while it is available.  Anyone who isn't familiar with John Stewart's career should take the opportunity to sample the music of a greatly underappreciated songwriter and performer.
