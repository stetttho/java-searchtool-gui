 This is a book that truly merits the label "must reading."  It  played a role in changing my own thinking on politics and history when I  first read it in the early 1990's.  During my "College  Republican" days, my view of Martin Luther King, Jr. was not  especially favorable, and I was almost totally ignorant of the history and  background of the civil rights movement.  But after reading Taylor Branch's  book, I could no longer shut my eyes to the hard truths to which he bears  brilliant witness. Martin Luther King is the central figure in Branch's  narrative, but the book is much more than a biography, as befits its  subtitle, "America in the King Years, 1954-63."  For example,  Branch begins his account with the stormy tenure of Vernon Johns as  minister at Montgomery, AL's Dexter Avenue Baptist Church--at which church  Johns was replaced by a young man still often known as "Mike"  King.  By broadening his account beyond King's own experiences, Branch  accurately conveys how the civil rights movement was far more than just the  activities of a few well-known leaders. Branch's research would do credit  to any professional historian.  He conducted hundreds of interviews and  worked with a vast amount of primary source material.  His writing is  compelling, repeatedly capturing the intensity of both public and private  events.  Even though the hardcover edition is over 900 pages, when I first  read it I found it incredibly hard to put aside.
