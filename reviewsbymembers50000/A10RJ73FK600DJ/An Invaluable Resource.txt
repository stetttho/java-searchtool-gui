 I've been a folk music fan for years, but only recently have I become fully aware of the incredible range of artists and music that's out there.  I have found this guide incredibly helpful in choosing new albums to purchase, or in deciding which new artists to try (I have it to thank for my love of the music of Nanci Griffith and Tish Hinojosa). While the title indicates a focus on folk music, the guide's definition of "folk" turns out to be quite broad--it includes folk-rock, country, bluegrass, some blues, and Celtic music.  For each artists profiled, the authors identify the best albums ("what to buy" and "what to buy next").  They also include a fairly complete discography for each artist--the albums included seem to be those that were in print at the time of publication.  Instead of Amazon's stars, the authors rate albums at one to five "bones." In a work of this nature there are always possible quibbles one can have, either about the critical judgements of the authors (not one Joan Baez album rates five bones?) or their selection of who to include or exclude (Willie Nelson makes it in, but Waylon Jennings doesn't?).  The one inexcusable omission, especially since Pete Seeger's picture is on the cover, is that of the Weavers.  But even that error, grievous though it is, does not detract from this book's value.
