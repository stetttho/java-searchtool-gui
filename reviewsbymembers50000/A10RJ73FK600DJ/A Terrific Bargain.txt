 This album combines several of Stewart's finest songs, such as "Cody," "Pirates of Stone County Road," and "You Can't Go Back to Kansas" at a bargain price.  The performances are  excellent--only the Spirit/Survivors medley is somewhat disappointing.  For  anyone not familiar with John Stewart's work this is a good first purchase.
