 Star Trek III is the exception to the general rule that the "odd-numbered" Star Trek films are the weak entries in the series.  It is ably directed by Leonard Nimoy, in his first directoral effort, and features some excellent performances from a strong cast. "The Search for Spock" is part of a loose trilogy that begins with Star Trek II.  Like the earlier film, it builds on the character relationships established in the television series.  At the end of Star Trek II, Spock apparently sacrificed his life to save the Enterprise, and his body was sent down to the surface of the newly created Genesis planet.  But it develops that Vulcans like Spock have a "katra," a sort of spiritual and intellectual essence, and Spock managed to infuse his into Dr. McCoy before he died.  So Kirk and McCoy have to hijack the Enterprise to return to the Genesis planet (with the aid of Scotty, Sulu and Chekov).  Meanwhile, back at that very planet, Kirk's son David and Lt. Saavik (Robin Curtis, the one weak link in the cast) have found a living Vulcan child.  And lurking somewhere out in subspace is an ambitious Klingon (Christopher Lloyd), who is surely up to no good (trust me, this all works better on film than it sounds in print). Nimoy directs ably from a script by Harve Bennett.  William Shatner turns in his usual solid job as Kirk, while Lloyd is well cast as his antagonist.  With Spock not a presence on screen, other cast members get more of a chance to shine--Nichelle Nichols as Uhura ("You want adventure?") and George Takei as Sulu ("Don't call me Tiny") have marvelous moments.  Most important, given Dr. McCoy's central role in the plot, DeForest Kelley gives his finest performance in any of the Star Trek films, if not his entire career.
