 I had high hopes when I learned that PBS would be showing these adaptations of four of Elizabeth George's Lynley/Havers novels.  The television version of George's "A Great Deliverance" had been well done, and I hoped to see that quality continued in these productions.  When I watched the PBS broadcasts, my hopes were dashed.  For some reason, the producers decided to try to fit these adaptations into a broadcast time of under 90 minutes each (whereas "A Great Deliverance" was a two-parter that ran for a total of nearly 3 hours).  To do so, George's intricate, nuanced plots were butchered, and her complex character interactions reduced to mind-numbing simplicity.  The one redeeming feature is that Nathaniel Parker gives a good performance as Tommy Lynley. Whether you are a lover of Elizabeth George's novels, as I am, or are just looking for a good mystery video, you should try something else, as this set would be a waste of money.
