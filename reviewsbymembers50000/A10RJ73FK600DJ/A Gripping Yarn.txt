 This was Michael Connelly's first novel (of 6 to date) featuring LAPD detective Hieronymous "Harry" Bosch.  Matters begin innocuously enough when Bosch discovers that a dead body found in a drainage pipe is a  one-time Vietnam comrade of his named William Meadows.  It appears to be a  simple drug overdose, but Bosch suspects foul play, and when he determines  he is right, he is plunged into  an investigation that develops into far  more than a single murder case. The "iceberg" plot where a  complex scheme is only gradually exposed is a crime fiction standard.   Connelly is, even in his first novel, a master at this type of plot-line.   His characters are three-dimensional and interesting, especially Bosch and  his uneasy ally, FBI agent Eleanor Wish.  Best of all, Connelly knows his  territory--a former Los Angeles Times reporter, he knows LA and the LAPD (I  suspect he still has sources in the department).  The Black Echo is a  superb novel.
