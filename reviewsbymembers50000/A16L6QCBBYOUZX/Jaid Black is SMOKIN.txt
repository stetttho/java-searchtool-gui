 If you like romance, if you like futuristics, if you like HOT, this is the series for you.  Mind you, this is not for the timid and throw your preconceived notions about morals and romances out the window before you sit down with this book.  At times I was shocked, and at first I wasn't sure if I liked some of the things the characters did.  But the erotic factor is off the charts and so is the romance--after you adjust to the sexual standards on the planet of Tryston.  I just finished Book 3 in the Trek Mi Q'an series, and I can tell you it only gets better!
