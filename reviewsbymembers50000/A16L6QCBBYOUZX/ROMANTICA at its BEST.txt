 If you've been reading Jaid Black's TREK MI Q'AN series, you'll be thrilled with this latest installment. And if you haven't experienced this series yet, try it, you'll LOVE it. Jaid Black writes the best of that fairly new genre, ROMANTICA, a delicious blend of erotica and romance. No one does it better. She'll scorch you with the erotic elements and leave you sighing blissfully over the romances between her characters. Every book in the series has several romantic relationships simmering and boiling in different stages, kind of a several-for-the-price-of-one deal. Black does a great job of weaving the various couples into each new story, revisiting familiar faces and always introducing new ones. She sets up the next installment in the series superbly, so that even though you're more than satisfied with the ending of the current romance, you're fully charged and rarin' to go on to the next. The only problem with this is waiting until the next one is released! Once you've gotten a taste of Black's futuristic world of Tryston and its sexual delights, believe me, you'll be hooked. In my opinion, ENSLAVED is the best book in the series, with a fabulous emotional depth. But then, Black keeps improving upon fantastic with each new book, so who knows what the next one will bring? I can't wait to find out.
