 Jaid Black continues her winning streak with the latest installment of her fabulous TREK MI Q'AN series. Once again, she astounds us with her imagination, always introducing new species, the latest being a vampire-like barbarian race that intrigues us with just a "taste." We can only hope that she plans to satisfy our whetted appetites with a bigger gulp next time. If you haven't tried this series yet, and you think you'd like a futuristic, sexually-oriented society with stunning erotica and equally generous helpings of pure romance, give the TREK series a try. You'll be sooooooo glad you did! Be forewarned though, it's highly addictive!
