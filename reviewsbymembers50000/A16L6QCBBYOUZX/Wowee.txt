 She's done it again, and I'll say it again: if you like romance, if you like futuristics, if you like HOT, buy this series by Jaid Black.  This book's better than the first because the world Black has created just keeps getting richer.  Not only do you have the main characters' relationship to follow, you get a whole soap opera's cast full of steamy sex and sizzling romance.  Be really nice to yourself and indulge your senses with this series.  You could read and enjoy NO MERCY by itself, but you'll enjoy it a lot more if you know the characters from BOOK ONE: THE EMPRESS' NEW CLOTHES first.  But be warned: this series is not for the prudish or timid.  If that warning excites rather than alarms, run don't walk to buy this series!
