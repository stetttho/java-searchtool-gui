 This album is actually a very odd,strange,and distorted record that has catchy hip-hop hooks and spooky techno pulses. Among the distorted melodies are many soundbytes and intro pieces that make rap dj's look like Mary Poppins. The best songs on this eerie, but entertaining record,are probably "Through The Walls" and "Since We Last Spoke" which are both poppy and rockish in thier own sense. This is a spookshow not to miss.
