 First off i will say that this album is not very great, as a matter of fact its not even worthy of maybe a....spot on MTV. Listen I dont hate MTV I just want it out of existance as soon as possible, and if you love Good Charolette and New Found Glory, then you'll LOVE this album. For MTV has pushed this album(which is horrid by the way)so much that i want to maybe...burn it. Yes, i want to burn this monstrosity, i am gonna be straight forward...anyone who buys this, isnt that smart...
