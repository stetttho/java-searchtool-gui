 In a time of Gangsta Rap a few MC's known as the "Afrocentric Native Tongues" who preached non-violence and exploring the Rich African cluture were slowly on the rise. The likes of De La Soul, the Jungle Brothers, Big Daddy Kane, and most importantly A Tribe Called Quest were stopping the street violence and starting the intellectual street smarts. And while many may say that De La Soul is the greatest Afrocentric Hip Hop group...they would be wrong. For this album not only proves just how amazing A Tribe Called Quest is...it also shows that Intellect is more valuable than Brawn: 1.Push It Along-A 2.Luck Of Lucien-A 3.After Hours-A 4.Footprints-A 5.I Left My Wallet In El Segundo-A+(Best Song On CD) 6.Public Enemy-A 7.Bonita Applebum-A- 8.Can I Kick It?-A 9.Youthful Expression-A 10.Rhythm(Devoted To The Art Of Moving Butts)-A 11.Mr. Muhammed-A 12.Ham 'N' Eggs-A 13.Go Ahead In The Rain-A+(3rd Best Song On CD) 14.Description Of A Fool-A+(2nd Best Song On CD)
