 There is no denying that The Faint is a great band, with techno, emo, pop-rock they have changed the underground emo scene for the better, however this album, unlike Dense Macrabe, has most of the songs with the same exact beat and the same exact tone of his voice. Now there are a few gems(Dropkick the Punks,I dissapear, Southern belles in London sing) but for the most part even though most of them are alright all of the songs sound somewhat the same. So, in contrast buy Dense Macrabe instead, but if you are a MAJOR Faint fan this is just what you are looking for.
