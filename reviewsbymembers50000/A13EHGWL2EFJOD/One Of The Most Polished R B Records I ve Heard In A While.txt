 As a kid growing up listening to a variety of music, especially Hip Hop and R&B, I've had alot of of music listening experience and to be honest with you Anthony Hamilton isnt exactly the savior of R&B, but that doesn't mean he isn't talented. As a vocalist Anthony is fantastic when it comes to tone control of his vocals and as a songwriter he is well crafted, however, that doesn't mean that he doesn't need practice.The Album Opens with "Mama Knew Love" a classic example of smooth R&B and follows into one of the albums best tracks "Cornbread, Fish, and Collard Greens" a greasy, hip hop/soul mashup with fine results."I'm A Mess" is a great desperation love song and could be one of my favorites on the album. The Album Closes with "I Tried" a good closing to a good album with only three dissapointing tracks("Since I Ain't Seen You", "Better Days", and "Lucille").This record isnt exactly the rebirth of soul...but it sure as hell is a decent attempt.
