 Good Charlotte need to get thier heads out of the sand and stop playing such god awful music. First off i would like to say that i USED to think not that bad of Good Charlotte back in the Self Titled album days, but when they released The Young and The Hopeless their rep just crashed with me. I dont really understand why most of these Snotty little teens who Loove MTV, you know the brainwashing, sex obsessed channel that claims its "Music Telivision" but hardly ever shows music and that is targeted at kids my age(14), and listen to every G.D. word they say. But I just want to say one thing, YOU GUYS ARE NOT SOUIXSIE AND THE BANSHEES AND YOUR MOST CERTAINLY NOT GREEN DAY SO STOP TRYING TO BE. Now i know that all of my other teen friends will vote against this because they've never heard music outside of MTV before but before you do...just take a listen to Nevermind by Nirvana, Revolver by The Beatles, or Franz Ferdinand.So my fellow music listeners, put the idea of buying this self loathing crap and pick up real music.:-D
