 Let me get this straight...Im tired of rap. There, i said it; what used to be a pioneering and poetic look into life on the streets has turned into an orgy of objectifieng women, shooting people for no reason other than he feels like it, and doing as much drugs as humanly possible. The only question I have for fake MC's like Nelly and 50 Cent(Yes in case you havent noticed he might have the street cred but he falls in the catergories obove...ALL of them) is Why are you content in ruining the kind of music that has changed the world in so many ways to ignorant, sex oozing, violence without a cause spewing nonsense? The answer is clear and simple...They have no guts, do you remember the good days of old school rap when MC's like Public Enemy and Coolio brought to life the torment and toil of the streets in ledgendary songs like "Fight The Power" and "Gangsta's Paradise". Now what have we come to in the rap world...50 Cent singing about "Lollipops" and "Candy Shops"(Basically hardcore sex) and Nelly talking about Oral Sex on "Tipdrill". Thankfully there are some MCs bringing back the great origins of hip hop in todays music(Eminem, Kanye West, Madvillain)but it seems the more they try the more the "New" hip hop seems to grow. So I have one thing to say...We need you Chuck D and Flavor Flav, we need you N.W.A., and we need you KRS One to help breathe some life into a dying genre. By the way...this cd sucks.
