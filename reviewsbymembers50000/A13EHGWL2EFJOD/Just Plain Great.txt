 Sgt. Peppers Lonley Heart's Club Band is quite possibly the most influential album of all time and is just as relevant and fantastic as it ever was. Every song on this album is lyrically and musically creative and astonoshing. The album's spirit is undeniable as many today still see it as the most innovative album of the 20th century. I reccomend this album to anyone who wants to listen to an album that has influenced countless bands over the years. I hope this review has helped you come to a descion. Thank You for reading my review.
