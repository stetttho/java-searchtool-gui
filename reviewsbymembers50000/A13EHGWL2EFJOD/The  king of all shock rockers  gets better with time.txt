 I used to be OBSESSED with Marilyn Manson, i had all of his albums, 5 t-shirts, 2 dvds,1 vhs,and many other ridiculously unnesescary items, but eventually i got over it. However, when i heard he was coming out with a best of album, i decided to just say "what the heck?" and get the thing, well it was a darn good descision. Marilyn Manson is probably one of the most clever artists of our time by infusing early gothic style(Souixsie and the Banshees, the misfits) with heavy meatal thrash(Nirvana, mettallica) and turning it into a style all of his own, and this compact disc proves that. There,truth be told, is only one REAL flaw with the album is the somewhat mundane, repetative subject lyrics of Manson's work. Hey, don't get me wrong here, i like Marilyn Manson as much as any mansonite around, i just feel listening to the same basic "life sucks, drugs are fun, god is not real, and sex is numb" theme to most of his songs gets a little tedious after a while. BUT besides that i would reccomend the album to anyone who wants to listen to goth-thrash metal at its finest. Thank You for reading my review and i hope it has helped you in youre descision making.
