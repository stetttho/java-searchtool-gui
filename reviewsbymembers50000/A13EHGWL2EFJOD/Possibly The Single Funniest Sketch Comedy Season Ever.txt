 I Really Don't Know What other way to say this than this is possibly one of the funniest sketch comedy seasons in the history of television. Even from the very first episode of the second season you can tell that this is far supirior to the 1st(Although the 1st is hilarious as well) the second season hosts so many legendary sketches I won't even bother to list them all...but I'll get down to some of my favorites: *Samuel L. Jackson Beer  *The Racial Draft *Black Ghallager(One Of My Favorite Sketches In the Season) *The Three Daves *(Of Course)Rick James In Charlie Murphy's True Hollywood Stories *Prince In C.M.T.H.S. *Moments In The Life Of Lil' Jon *Mooney On Movies And Negrodamus *Black Bush *"I Know Black People" *Making Da Band *Kneehigh Park *Wayne Brady's Wild Ride With Dave Chappelle *and my favorite...Chappelle's Show's Greatest Misses Episodes  Those are just a few of the sketches and the extras are just as good: *Extra Stand Up From Dave(Very VERY Funny) *Bloopers and Deleted Scenes(Also Very Funny) and *The Extended Rick James Interview(Probably the funniest Dvd extra I have ever seen in my life)  Well That pretty much covers it...so if you're considering buying this, then stop considering and do it(Warning:Chappelle's Show is not for people offended easily).
