 Hands Down This Blues Record is ESSENTIAL to ANY music listeners. I dont care if your a metal head, a hip hopper, or a Jazz afficianado, this is the blueprint for years of music to come. The stories behind Robert Johnson are ledgend, after all, a man that was virtually ignored in his time who was unearthed years later is now one of (if not the) most influential blues artist of all time. There have been stories passed down since his 1936 debut that he even sold his soul to the devil for his musical talent. Every single track is worth listening to from "They're Red Hot"(Arguably an early Rock 'n' Roll like track) to "Walking Blues" to "Preachin' Blues"(A Song Many Claim Is About His deal with the Devil for his unimaginable talents) to "Malted Milk" all of his incredible groundbreaking songs are on this two disc set. And folks...its worth every single penny.
