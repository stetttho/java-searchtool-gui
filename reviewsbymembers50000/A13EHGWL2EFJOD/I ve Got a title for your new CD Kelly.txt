 Its called "Daughter Don't sing". Thats how bad this cd is. When i bought this "Tragic" teenagers cd I was hoping for actual music...guess what I was wrong. I heard her alright version of "Papa Don't Preach" and I thought that if that wasnt half bad why should this be? Wow....Kelly really needs to take her own advice and shutup. Almost all of the songs on this record are unbearable. So this is why I am so sick of relatives of talented singers coming out with there own albums, they simply arent even close to being worthy of their sibling or father or whatever *cough Ashlee Simpson cough* so case in point. SHUT THE HELL UP KELLY OSBOURNE, YOU ARE NOT SOUXSIE FROM THE BANSHEES OR LITA FORD SO JUST TAKE YOUR OWN ADVICE AND SHUT UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
