 When i first bought this record i wondered wether it would be as good as it was hyped up to be...well, long story short, it was all that and more. Infusing Catchy pop hooks, clever lyrics, haunting melodys, and new wave flavor to indie rock Franz Ferdinad has made one of the most amazing records of the 21st century. Franz Ferdinand's self titled debut starts out with the with the catchy, but haunting melody of JAQUELINE and soon leads into TELL HER TONIGHT a new wave song, that has a 60's era rock chourus, then comes the albums strongpoint and first single TAKE ME OUT wich is purely indie rock at it's finest, THE DARK OF THE MATINEE(my personal favorite of the album) is so clever in its construction with lyrics and music combined this is almost worthy of comparison to great songs like "Imagine" or "Like a Rolling Stone", following that comes AUF ACHSE a simple song with simple lyrics and music. CHEATING ON YOU is an excellent song that puts fake rock bands like G.C. and New Found Glory in thier place with a pure rock vibe that even the biggest meatalhead would enjoy,THIS FIRE follows and is so intresting in its construction that it will leave you with just a few breaths in you, after that comes DARTS OF PLEASURE wich is new wave indie rock at its core and is refreshingly different, MICHAEL is alot like CHEATING ON YOU in contrast that it is pure rock, COME ON HOME is like JAQUELINE in the contrast that its haunting melodies and tremendous lyrics are the main draws to the song, and last of all comes the incredible closure 40' which is a calm, yet energized song that is done in 1970's fashion. Well I hope my review will help you in your descicion, but in the meantime...LONG LIVE FRANZ FERDINAND!
