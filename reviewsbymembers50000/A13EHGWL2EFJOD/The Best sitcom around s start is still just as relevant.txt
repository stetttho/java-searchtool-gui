 Seinfeld is arguably the greatest sitcom of all time by making a bold decision in making a sitcom purely about everyday stuff like Soup Nazis or "Friends With Privaleges" deals. In the first and second seasons the show changed television by, instead of making a show about spys or other ridiculous non-beliveable subjects, made a show about the every day human life which is essentially "Nothing"!!!! That is why seinfeld,whether about ridiculous food waits in chinese and other restuarants or about the sweet sweet taste of revenge, has still left a mark on television that can never be removed or copied, which is proof that Seinfeld, the smartest,cleverest,and possibly funniest, sitcom of all times is still just as relevant...
