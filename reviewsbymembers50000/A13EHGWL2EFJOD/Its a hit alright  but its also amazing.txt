 I was blown out of my socks when i first put this album in the stereo. That is the one sentance that should describe your reaction when you hear this album,if not you would be classified as a perfect patient at your local loony bin. Not only does this album reming me of a younger, more folky Alanis Morrisette, but it also is a soothing contrast to most of the loud, heavy albums being released as I type. To start off, It's a Hit is an excellent song with fairly well written lyrics while polar opposite to the chilling harmonical masterpiece Accidental Deth. While all of the other songs are great, More Adventerous is one of the best female vocal folk songs i have ever heard in my 14 years of existance. So, long story short this is an album NOT to miss.
