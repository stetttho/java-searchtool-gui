 "Indie [Slang For Independent} Rock Is the Underbelly of  Rock." said Meat Puppets front man Curt Kirkwood in the Mid Eighties, and while for the most part Indie rock has been shunned over the years since leading Indie rock groups like Pavement, Dinosaur Jr., and the Pixies have disbanded, in the year 2004 it suddenly became the new "it" music. With people like The Killers, Modest Mouse, and Interpol suddenly becoming major icons in modern music, it looks like Indie rock may have found its glory days. Of all of the indie rock "heroes" no one is more powerful than the modern Indie-rock Kings Franz Ferdinand, and with their sophomore effort they do nothing but back up their place in history as one of the most popular Indie rock bands of these past two decades. You Could Have It... opens with "The Fallen" a cheese-grater guitar shredding Funk Rock anthem about the wonders of Destruction N' Rock and Roll. Coming Shortly after "the Fallen" is "Do You Want To?"  the first single off of the album and one of their catchiest songs ever, all an ode to the wild party driven lifestyle the four boys from Glasgow, Scotland have had thrown at them after the success of their self- titled debut album. The Two Standout Tracks On the Album are "Walk Away", a bittersweet ode to rejection that could've easily been written by Burt Bacharach, and "You Could Have It So Much Better..." a pounding bass n' drums anthem about the sheer annoyance of Passive-Aggressive people. All In All, the album has only one weak spot (Hence the Four Star Rating) and that weakness is in the song "You're The Reason I'm Leaving" a sloppy, watered down virtual remake of the song before it "Evil and a Heathen." The Days of Pavement being the Indie Rock Gods are long gone, and I doubt if the now bloated R.E.M. can ever take back the throne of the lords of the Underground, so to all of you fellow Indie rockers, take a step back, Franz is the new King.
