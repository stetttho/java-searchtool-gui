 The first Wu Solo album, Mef had alot to live up to in order to maintain the Wu's rugged and raw sound...while some say the album isnt good I dissagree. This is a rare type of feat in the hip hop world blending haunting melodic beats with quiet,almost secretive rhymes...Definetley grows on you in the end.  1.Tical-8/10-Ticaaaaaal, this is a pretty good song, aight hook, mef spits some gems on this one...Cop Dat. 2.Biscuits-8/10-Really tight beat and some pretty cool rhymes but the hook just ain't that...um..great...Cop Dis. 3.Bring The Pain-10/10-My 2nd favorite on the album, pretty hazy beat and a clearly reggae influenced hook...Cop Dis. 4.All I Need-10/10-My Favorite on the album. Hazy, Mezmerizing,Mysterious...Just Ill, All I gotta Say is...Cop Dis. 5.What The Blood Clot-7/10-I ain't feeling the beat but Mef spits some fire on this...Check Dis. 6.Meth Vrs. Chef-9/10-Great concept and well carried out. Both Jhonny Blaze and Chef flow pretty good on this plus the beat is really cool...Cop Dis. 7.Sub Crazy-10/10-The hook is what made this song for me, Tight beat and rhymes wif some crazy backround vocals...Cop Dis. 8.Release Yo' Delf-7/10-I Don't like the "I Will Survive" thing that much but the overall track aint that bad...Check Dis. 9.P.L.O. Style-8/10-Nice beat and some fire being spit by Mr. Mef...Cop Dis. 10.I Get My Thang In Action-9/10-Pretty Tight Beat, Nice Bullets from Mr. Mef's gun and a pretty tight hook...Cop Dis. 11.Mr. Sandman-8/10-This track is absolutley crazy. The hook is like something outta a Horror movie and so is the beat. Rza spits some crazy rhymes on this, Nuff Said...Cop Dis. 12.Stimulation-7/10-I ain't feeling the beat or the hook on this one, Mef couldve saved his fire for a more worthy beat...Check Dis. 13.Method Man Remix-8/10-Nowhere near as good as the original but still pretty Ill...Cop Dat.  Final Word:It May Take A While To Sink In But It's Definetley Worth It...Cop Dis.
