 Like many reviews for this album i will also say the cliche' line "A breath of fresh air" because De La Soul were indeed a deep long full breath of fresh air. With this one compact disc De La Soul kickstarted an excellent Mcing career that has lasted over 15 years to this very day and are still producing and making excellent album. De La recorded this at the top of thier game and made a hip hop career out of posotivity and pride, and they deserve every thing they get: 1.Intro-N/A 2.The Magic Number-A+(2nd Best On Cd) 3.Change In Speak-B+ 4.Cool Breeze On The Rocks-N/A 5.Can U Keep A Secret-A 6.Jenifa Taught Me-A 7.Ghetto Thang-A 8.Transmitting Live From Mars-N/A 9.Eye Know-A+(3rd Best On Cd) 10.Take It Off-N/A 11.A Little Bit Of Soap-A 12.Tread Water-A 13.Potholes In My Lawn-A- 14.Say No Go-B+ 15.Do As De La Does-N/A 16.Plug Tunin'(Last Chance To Comprehend)-B 17.De La Orgee-N/A 18.Buddy-B+ 19.Description-B 20.Me,Myself and I-A+(Best On Cd) 21.This Is A Recording 4 Living In A Fulltime Era(L.I.F.E.)-A- 22.I Can Do Anything-N/A 23.D.A.I.S.Y.
