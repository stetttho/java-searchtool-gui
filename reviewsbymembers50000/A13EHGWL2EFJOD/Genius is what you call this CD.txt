 There is no doubt in any TRUE hip hop fan's mind that KRS-1 may be the best MC of all time, and this album just backs that theory up. Originally recorded after the death of his Boogie Down Productions partner Scott LaRock, KRS decided to pay tribute to his lost friend By All Means Necessarry, hence the name of the Album. This is a true Hip Hop classic and one of the most influential albums of all time. A MUST HAVE for ANY Hip hop or music fan.  1.My Philosophy-10/10-Awesome, a Hip Hop Classic. 2.Ya Slippin'-10/10-My favorite track on the album, Unbelivable, hip hop at it's finest. 3.Stop The Violence-10/10-Probably the most influential BDP song out there, great beats and infamous hook. Classic. 4.Illegal Business-10/10-One of the most funky and catchy hooks from KRS, plus some pretty amazing lyrics and funny Fat Albert samples. 5.Nervous-9/10-Just a bunch of talking over a beat. But the beat is tight as hell so it carries the whole damn song. 6.I'm Still Number One-10/10-Nice flow by KRS on this one, and a pretty tight snare beat too. Plus many see this track as the one that proves he is the number one. 7.Part Time Suckers-10/10-Tight track with some pretty tight snares. Just plain good. 8.Jimmy-10/10-Awesome song wif a catchy as mess hook, and some pretty cool and creative lyrics about safe sex. 9.T'Cha T'Cha-10/10-Nice flow from Krs and a pretty tight hook. 10.Necessary-10/10-Even though its a talking track it's still a really good and true look at hip hop music.  Overall this Cd is awesome. Get this cd by all means necessary, no pun intended.
