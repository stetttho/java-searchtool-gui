 In the history of hip hop there have only been a few albums so good that you literally get up and dance during the middle of it...well this is one of them. Probably the most infectious rap cd of all time, these Brooklyn MCs made a masterpiece from the start to the finish. Personally I feel this deserves to be among the 5 mic classics from the Source. I really can tell you no more than to get this album now by any means. Yes, it is really that good; and trust me...you won't be dissapointed: 1.Mic Checka-A+(Best On Cd) 2.Jussummen-A+ 3.They Want Efx-A+(3rd Best On Cd) 4.Looseys-A 5.Dum Dums-A 6.East Coast-B+ 7.If Only-A+(2nd Best On Cd) 8.Brooklyn to T-Neck-A- 9.Klap Ya Handz-B 10.Straight From Da Sewer-A+
