 When it comes to early hip hop...the possibilities were'nt necessarilly endless. The rules basically were if you have some flow and a good dj you were in...oh yeah by the way, ya gotta be black. But Rick Rubin thought otherwise by signing these Jewish Manhattan MC's to his Def Jam label and made hip hop a household name in white suburban America. Not only did white kids love the Beastie Boys, but most hip hop lovers in general loved them. And judging by this album...i can see why: 1.Rhymin & Stealin-A+ 2.The New Style-A- 3.She's Crafty-A- 4.Posse In Effect-B 5.Slow Ride-B+ 6.Girls-B+ 7.Fight For Your Right-A+(3rd Best On CD) 8.No Sleep Till Brooklyn-A+(Best On CD) 9.Paul Revere-A+(2nd Best On CD) 10.Hold It Now, Hit It-A 11.Brass Monkey-A+ 12.Slow and Low-A 13.Time To Get Ill-A
