 When MADtv first came out in mid 1995, many speculated whether it would be even close competition to SNL...well it was. With crazy, wild humor and an awesome cast, MADtv was a groundbreaking show that pushed the limits on the rude, and crudness of American comedy. With classic skits like: Gump Fiction, O.J. Simpson bloopers, The XXX Files, and the UPS guy, MADtv proved that not only was it funnier than any sketch comedy show on t.v., it was also more creative. After MADtv all of the original cast has found thier calling after the MADness, for example: Mary Scheer(host of Cabana Chat) is now producer of the hit t.v. show Most Extreme Elemination Challenge.  David Herman is now voice of Roy on Father of the Pride, and Mayor PoopenMayor on Futurama. He has also starred in Dude, where's my car? Bryan Callen is now star of shows like Oz, CSI, Law & Order, and 7th Heavan.  Orlando Jones is one of Hollywood's top black comedic actors starring in movies like Runaway Jury, Evolution, and Drumline. Phil LaMaar, maybe the most succesfull of all, is voices and stars of shows and movies like Spider Man 2, Futurama, RENO 911, and Samurai Jack.  Now Stern sidekick Artie Lange has made appearences in Elf, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, and Old School. King of Queen's star Nicole Sullivan has been on Family Guy and Kim Possible, and Debra Wilson, well we love Debra Wilson. Features include HILARIOUS bloopers, a "We're missing most of the first cast, but we'll call it a reunion anyway" 200th Episode, deleted sketches(that were deleted for a good reason, they're pretty dull),and a collection of MADtv's best parodies.  SO... GET OFF OF YOUR FAT [...] AND BUY THIS DVD, NOW!!!!(you won't be sorry.)  I GIVE IT:*****:five stars
