 I had a toothache today, a SPLITTING toothache. The kind you can only get by having your braces tightend by a money craving Orthodontist. That being said, i came home today, talked a little to my girlfriend on the phone, and then had to get off because my toothache was SO unbearable that I could not even breathe another breath. So what did I do but reach for a "Trusty" tylonal. Trusty my ass. This stuff doesnt work at all, as a matter of fact I find it can sometimes make headaches or toothaches or sore muscles even worse! My tooth still hurts and I can bareley stand looking at a tylonal bottle just knowing how much they take peoples money for a placebo colerd tablet that doesn't help pain in the least. Case in point, this is useless, If you want a pain releaver...try taking a quiet nap, that aughtta do it.
