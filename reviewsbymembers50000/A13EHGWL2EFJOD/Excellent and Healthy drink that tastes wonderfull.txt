 I gave up drinking lactose about three months ago and I had to make a decision between so many different kinds of soy milk I almost went crazy, that is untill i bought silk.... Now as you probably can guess Silk is a play off of two things Soy and Milk combined in word form meaning Silk, and the fact the silk is as smooth as silk and let me tell you buddy, it is...Not only is Silk awesome tasting it is also INCREDIBLY healthier than normal milk that comes from a cow or goat or lizard or whatever the hell animal that has milk. So in contrast Buy the regular Silk(Not the chocolat or the vanilla, 8th Continent is better with the flavored ones)if you want to drink a healthy, delicious, and lactose free beverage.
