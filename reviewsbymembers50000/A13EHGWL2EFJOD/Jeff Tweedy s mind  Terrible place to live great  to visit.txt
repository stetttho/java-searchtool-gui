 This album was recorded on a smooth-sailed pot trip,and most fans know this...but what they don't realize is that this album has broken so many boundaries for music in general, right under our noses. By fusing and melding such taboo artforms as what's known as "Greatful Rock" after the pot loving 60's band The Greatful Dead and indie rock, Jeff Tweedy and company have made,quite possibly one of the top 5 albums of 2004 and i'm sure glad they did. The album is such a clever mix of soothing, pop hooks and stoned, jam sessions which blend perfectly in songs like Hummingbird, I'm a Wheel, and Spiders(Kidsmoke). This album is so refreshingly experimental that you just might be so entranced you may not remember what happend that day--just a warning. So, enjoy this drugged out album, for your own sake.
