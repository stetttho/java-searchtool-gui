 I really don't know where I should start with this review...I can remember when i was 7 years old, My dad had just gotten home from work holding this cd in his hands with a grin on his face, then he put the cd in...I can remember dancing to how great this cd was. To this day one of my favorite hip hop songs of all times is "I Got It Made". Its too bad that this album was forgotten, it deserves to be among the classics like "It Takes A Nation Of Millions To Hold Us Back", "Straight Outta Compton", "All Eyez On Me", "Ready To Die", and etc. So the final thing I wunna say to all u young hip hop heads out there trying to figure out whether to get this joint or not. Cop It and discover the REAL sense of Hip Hop Musick.
