 This record contains some of the best rhyming i have heard on a rap album in a while, and i must say right now it is EXTREMLEY refreshing to not hear the kind of stupid rap today but clever,true rap that people like Ghostface and Kanye West have restored. The songs on this album are good, with 2 exceptions,and the beggining songs really get you angry like on "Biscuits" and "Metal Lungies" which are virtually gun-clap seethers. By the end however he's begging for his girl("Tooken Back"), sprinting for his life("Run"), and taking stock of everything worth living for("Love"). So all in all, it is a good album and i strongly reccomend it.
