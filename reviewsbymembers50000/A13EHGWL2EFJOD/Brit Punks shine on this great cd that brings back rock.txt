 These London guys are bringing back rock in a way that The Strokes and The Hives(Even though i love BOTH bands) wish they could. With thier awesome melodies and cranky rhythm guitars the Libertines have injected rock with an indie noise that is a mix between Modest Mouse and Interpol. The disc starts out with a few good tracks, but the ones that stand out are "The Man Who Would Be King" and "Can't Stand Me Now". Twoards the middle of the record it really hits you how good of an album this is with tracks like "Campaign Of Hate" and "What Katie Did". The end is just plain astonishing because of excellent tracks like "Road To Ruin" and "What Became Of The Likley Lads". So all in all this cd is a majorly amazing blend of melody and cranky method guitar that is DEFINETLEY a U.K. album worth spending $14.95 on.
