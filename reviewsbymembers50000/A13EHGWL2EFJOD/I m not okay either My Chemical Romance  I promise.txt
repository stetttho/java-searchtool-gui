 What a disgrace punk rock has become, it seams like punk has been going to the dogs for a while now, it seems like punk is dead, and if its not My Chemical Romance(In cahoots with Good Charolette) have put the final nail in the coffin and are now suffocating punk to death with thier poser goth music. I feel that if Joey Ramone or Sid Vicious were alive to see what dumb bands like My Chemical Romance have done to the music they started, they would personally beat them up. I hate this band so much that i wish for them the same thing that happend to John Denver, except i did'nt want that to happen to John Denver unlike My Chemical Romance.  So my closing words are, F U MY CHEMICAL ROMANCE!!!
