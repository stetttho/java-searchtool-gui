 In my opinion, The Beatles were the band that kickstarted rock and roll into a new direction and I have always been astonished by their incredible musical and lyrical talents and have loved and enjoyed all of their works(some more than others) and this is a prime example of geinus at hand. HOWEVER, some of the songs on this albumn are ridiculus and baisically cheap fillers. Now there is no denying that this album is incredible with songs like Come Together, Something, and Here Comes The Sun; but some of the songs are just not worth your time(I Want You,Because, Her Majesty, and Sun King are the only ones) but the GREAT songs on the album make up for all of the lyrical blunders of this album so you feel as if the album is great after all. In other words, lyrical and musical blunders don't slow the album down too much; so i do reccomend it(but if i were you i would much prefer to listen to Revolver or White Album). Thanks for reading my review and i hope it helps you in your decsion making.
