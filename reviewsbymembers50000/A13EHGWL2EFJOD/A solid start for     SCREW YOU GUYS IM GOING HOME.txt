 Let me tell it to you straight I LOVE SOUTH PARK, and that being said I paid very close attention to the set this came in and quite honestly, i could've been happier with the overrall package. The episodes themselves are hilarious and quick, and I LOVE the introductions by Trey and Matt(You guys NEED to start doing those bits again, they're hilarious), but have still not started to deliver topical, political humor(That starts later in the 2nd season).The episodes themselves are HILARIOUS, i will now rate each episode with a 1-10, 10 being highest:  1.<Cartman Gets An Anal Probe>-7.5/10-Not my favorite episode, I don't really like the construction paper's grainy feel, but has very funny parts in it("CARTMAN, THERE'S AN 80 FOOT SATTALITE DISH STICKING OUT OF YOUR BUTT!") and a fairly funny intro by Matt & Trey. 2.<Weight Gain 4000>-10/10-GENIOUS episode with hilarious scenes jokes and of course....Weight Gain 4000! 3.<Volcano>-8/10-Pretty funny plotline involving Skuzzlebutt the man with Patrick Duffy for a leg, and REALLY funny lines from Cartman, plus the animation is getting alot cleaner and crisper. 4.-10/10-FUNNY AS HELL, Stan's dog is gay and they try to make it not gay....HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA, TWO WORDS...TELEVISION GOLD!!! 5.<An Elephant Makes Love To A Pig>-9/10-Weird idea eh? Elephants plus pigs....ah well who cares it makes for a great episode of South Park with Stan's Clone 6.<Death>-10/10- Funny episode with a really funny repeated line("I'm not touching that one with a 20 foot pole") and Creative concept. 7.-7.5/10-Funny at first but then gets a little bit stale and tired... 8.<Starvin' Marvin>-10/10-Ledgendary episode in which the boys adopt a starving etheopian, whats not to love? 9.<Mr. Hankey The Christmas Poo>-8/10-Howdy Ho! Hilarious introduction to Mr. Hankey with a hilarious scene with Kyle in the bathroom. 10.<Damien>-8/10-Pretty funny episode itself, but a HILARIOUS introduction by Matt and Trey. 11.<Tom's Rhinoplasty>-10/10-One of the best on the set, funny as mess Mr. Hat!!! 12.<Mecha Streisand>-10/10-Yet again, another ledgendary episode in which Trey and Matt really make fun of Streisand worse than anyone else in the history of the show(Besides Phil Collins...) 13.<Cartman's Mom Is A Dirty Slut>-10/10-Yes she is...but that doesnt stop this episode from being my favorite...Westside!!!  The extras on the set are lack luster, however, and dont really live up to expectations. Sure, the music videos and television promos are funny but where is the commentary here, is it THAT bad that Warner Brothers said "Nuh Uh thats too bad even for DVD release!"...I don't think so. So overall this would be a good purchase to make, just dont expect the easter eggs to be awesome.
