 Oh my lord, this is great. I cannot belive how good of an album this is for one that was basically a self-recorded demo. PJ has made a masterpiece with this album and i'm simply amazed by the way the music contrasts the vocals of Polly Jean Harvey in a way that makes my mind grin with pleasure. The songs on the album are all equalally fantastic and has an amazingly harmonical vibe to it. This record clearly proves that P.J. Harvey is the new Neil Young. The songs on this album are micellaneously great from everything from the NYC rocking "Who The F!#$?", the haunting bass rythms of "It's You", The slow rockin' "Life and Death of Mr. Badmouth", and the soothing, folky song(that is my personal favorite) called "End". So all pay salute to our generation's Neil Young because frankly, after making that album...she deserves it.
