 Hey, don't get me wrong here, I like seeing puppets make Prank Calls as much as the next guy, but i just was a little dissapointed with the overall package of the DVD. When i bought this DVD i was hoping to see NOT ONLY hilarious, insane prank phone call puppet action(which i did), but also some more extras then there were. The show itself is funny as it could be but the extras are just SO dissapointing that it knocks two stars off of the rating. So in the long run, get South Park or Chapelle's Show instead of this, but thats my opinion. I hope this review has helped you make a decision. Thank You for reading.
