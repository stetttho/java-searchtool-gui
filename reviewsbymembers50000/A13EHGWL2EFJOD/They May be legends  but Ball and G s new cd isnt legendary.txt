 Before Outkast, Before The Geto Boys, Before Arrested Development, there was 8 Ball & M.J.G...the souths premire rappers and some of the greatest southern Mc's to ever grace the world of Hip Hop music. And while Ball and G may be legends thier new cd is anything but legendary, and there is one reason for that...Bad Boy Records. Bad Boy and Ball and G are so different from each other that when combining MJG's southern drawl and 8 Ball's Graspy Hardcore rhyming with Crunk beats it fails miserabaly and leaves with dissapointment: 1.Album Intro-N/A 2.You Don't Want Drama-B+(2nd Best Song On CD) 3.Straight Cadillac Pimpin-B 4.We Do It-C 5.The Streets-C+ 6.Mad Rapper-N/A 7.Shot Off-F 8.When It's On-C 9.Trying To Get At You-C+ 10.Baby Girl-C+ 11.Get A Kit-N/A 12.Forever-B+(3rd Best Song On CD) 13.Look At The Grillz-C+ 14.Living Legends-N/A 15.Don't Make-B- 16.Memphis City Blues-B- 17.Gangsta-B+ 18.Confessions-A-(Best Song On CD)
