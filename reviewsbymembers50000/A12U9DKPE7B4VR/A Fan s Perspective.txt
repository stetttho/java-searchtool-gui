 On most good days I consider myself a fan of Laurell K. Hamilton. I have read and re-read the Anita Blake Series, along with ear-marking favorite pages and gobbling up copies of the series that I find in used book stores to give as "gifts" to friends. I am also a member of the Fan Club. So, it is with much disappointment that I confess that this is not a good day and that this is not one of Ms. Hamilton's better offerings. 	The plot goes every which way it possibly can, from vampire politics, to relationship dilemmas, to Dolph's psychological break-down, to the serial killer murders, to the mysterious FBI guys. Personally, I find the most enjoyable moments to be those that concentrate on the police matters as well as Anita's zombie raising and necromancy. But then, I'm not the writer. 	Throughout the book, I found myself increasingly frustrated by all the emotional BAGGAGE that so many of the characters bring with them. From Anita's emotional distance and lack of commitment to Asher's fear of rejection to Richard's loathing of his beast, to Dolph's disgust and devastation over his son's marriage, to Gregory and Stephen's horrific past... I just want to say ENOUGH. I've been dealing with Richard's emotional turmoil for 4 BOOKS! Burnt Offerings, Blue Moon, Narcissus in Chains and now Cerulean Sins. Get over it already!  	I would recommend that people wait for these books to come out on paperback, but then if you are at all like I am, you have a hard time waiting that long. Oh, well. I guess it's time to wait for the next one and keep hoping for a tighter plot.
