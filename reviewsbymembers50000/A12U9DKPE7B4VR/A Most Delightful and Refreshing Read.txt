 First of all, it is hard not to love a character whose name is Sookie Stackhouse. Sookie. Everytime I say the name I cannot help but smile. Indeed, Sookie is one of the most endearing and delightful characters I have encountered in quite a while. She possesses an admirable strength of spirit and courage (even if she does not want to admit to it) and at the same time a sensitivity and innocence and humor that makes you care for and about her. Sookie may be a cutie on the outside, but she's also one tough cookie on the inside. I soared through this book and read it in one sitting. It was a wonderful read. Trouble is on the horizon as the book begins. Bill has become increasingly absorbed in his "project" and takes off on a mission out of town while Sookie is left feeling alienated and brushed aside. Those feelings deepen intensely when Eric reveals to Sookie the personal nature of Bill's departure. When Bill goes missing, as in *poof*, Sookie is out to save the day, her man, and get even if she can. You go girl! I immensely enjoyed the new character of Alcine. What a winner! Eric emerges as a charming, valiant hero, albeit with ulterior motives. Readers can see that his feelings for Sookie are deeping, which makes the interaction between the two characters that much more enticing. My only problem with the book is that I rather despised Bill by the end of the book. He comes across with very little redeeming value and I hope that he proves his worth in the books to come. I cannot wait for the next one!
