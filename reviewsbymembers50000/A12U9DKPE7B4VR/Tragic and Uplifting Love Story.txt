 One of the most beautifully told stories that I have ever read, no matter the subject. Ultimately, "The Passion" is a tragic and uplifting love tale. The Passion refers to the transformation that werewolves experience when they change from human to wolf. I think it also refers to the passion and longing that the heroine, Tessa, possesses in her desire to understand and experience the life of a werewolf. The story reveals Tessa as a woman who, herself, transforms from one who is nave and innocent into a woman who possesses an inner strength and determination to live, and who retains a sense of caring and consideration that makes her story all the more moving. "The Passion" is set during the 18th century and revolves around the story of Tessa, who befriends and falls in love with Alexander Devoncroix, an extremely wealthy businessman who happens to be a werewolf. She has the fortune and misfortune to be the first human welcomed into the company of the werewolves. Due to her position and her relationships she becomes the pawn of another who seeks to destroy Alex. Boyd's werewolves are both arrogant and alluring, and thus powerful and weak at the same time, as the story reveals. The story is as seductive as the characters.
