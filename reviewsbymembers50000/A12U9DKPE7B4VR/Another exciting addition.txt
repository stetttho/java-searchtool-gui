 While I might have my own preferences when it comes to the themes Ms. Hamilton focuses upon, for instance I enjoy the strong mystery and mystical angles more so than the lycanthrope political thread, I always thoroughly enjoy the journey into Anita's world. She is the only author whose work I gleefully anticipate. For as long as she continues the series, I will always read, hoard, devour and re-read her books. That is what being a fan is all about. Thank you!
