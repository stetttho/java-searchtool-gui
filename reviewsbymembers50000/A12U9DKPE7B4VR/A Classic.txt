 According to Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary: legend: "1a. a story coming down from the past; esp: one popularly regarded as historical although not verifiable. b: a body of such stories c: a popular myth of recent origin d: a person or thing that inspires legends" A classic story about vampires conquering the human race, and the last (maybe?) human battling it out against the monsters. The story is riveting for several reasons. The persistence and continuously hard-fought survival of the human compelled me to cheer and root for him throughout the novel. His emotional turmoil and reflections about society draw me into the book and make me feel sympathy and a great deal of fear for him. The story is written so well, with the ever-present question looming over the main character and always in the minds of the readers: is he the last one? If he is the last one, and he dies, does the human race essentially become a legend; that which exists only in popular myth...that humans existed once but that such truth is not verifiable? Does the protagonist essentially become a legend as the last of his kind, living out his days as an inspiration to others?
