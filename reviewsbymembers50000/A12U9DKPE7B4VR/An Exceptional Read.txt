 My mother brought this novel home from the library one day. She never got to read it. It totally and completely absorbed me and has had the same effect upon legions of women. This was the first novel in which I felt so moved by the characters that I wanted to be the heroine and was so entranced by the time-travelling theme that it inspired many a late-night fantasy about Scotland. The book revolves around the life of Claire Beauchamp, a former World War II nurse, who, during her vacation with her husband, Frank Randall, in the Highlands of Scotland, gets transported back in time to the 18th century. "Outlander" details Claire's adventures in Scotland, her relationship with James Fraser and her struggles against her husband's ancestor, "Black Jack" Randall. This book has everything I admire: a strong, intelligent heroine; a valiant and charismatic hero; a nefarious villain that I loved to loathe; a cast of supporting characters that contributes to the development of family, a sense of humor, and various political machinations; a historical backdrop full of intrigue and legend; a well-written story that challenges the reader's mind and tempts our imagination; a stunning climax and a happy ending. I absolutely loved this book.
