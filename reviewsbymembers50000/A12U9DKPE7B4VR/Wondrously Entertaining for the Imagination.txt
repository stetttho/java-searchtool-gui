 While not a classic (yet?), Guilty Pleasures offers a world in which the creatures of fantasy and reality co-exist. The novel is wondrously entertaining for the imagination. At the same time, it offers a unique version behind the history of vampires (including a Supreme Court ruling that legalized vampires and provided them equal rights) and a hierarchy/organization for the supernatural creatures that makes the world believable. The heroine of the novel is Anita Blake, a strong-willed,... necromancer and animator (she raises zombies for a living) who is also known as "The Executioner" because she has 14 sanctioned vampire kills to her name. She is enlisted by the local Master (Vampire) of the City of St. Louis to solve a series of vampire murders. What ensues is a mystery and a battle for power that sweeps the reader along at a quick pace. Hamilton's style of writing is in your face as opposed to smooth or mellifluous and if it's a style you enjoy or can learn to enjoy, you can find yourself absorbed into Anita's thoughts and the world Hamilton creates.  Throughout the book and the series in general, we as readers observe and delight in the development of Anita's strength and sexuality, as well as her questioning of her once accepted beliefs regarding monsters and her own morality and spirituality. The Anita Blake Vampire Hunter series can inspire the imagination, can stimulate questions about good and evil, and can empower readers by presenting a strong heroine to root for.
