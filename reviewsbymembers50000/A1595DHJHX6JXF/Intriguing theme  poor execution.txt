 Karol "Ears" Borya had survived many months in the Mauthausen Concentration Camp during the Second World War. It was there that he first heard mention of The Amber Room, and after his release from the camp he went searching for the treasure. It was never found, however, and forty years later Borya is convinced that the past is behind him - until one day, he gets a visit from Christian Knoll, an "Acquisitor" interested in information about The Amber Room. Soon after, Borya is found dead, and it's up to his daughter and her ex-husband to undertake a dangerous trip to discover the secret of the long lost artifact. Add into the mix two very dangerous "Acquisitors" who will do anything to obtain the treasure for their employers, and you have the makings of a captivating thriller. Unfortunately, Steve Berry's debut novel reads like an unpolished first attempt. Full of plot inconsistencies, a great deal of repetition, one-dimensional, unengaging characters and descriptions better suited to a travelogue, THE AMBER ROOM is frustrating to read. None of the characters are in the least bit appealing, which results in complete apathy for the "climax" of the novel. The pace is slow throughout, and the plot lacks any real plot twists or unexpected surprises which are much needed in this otherwise bland work of fiction. What would have been an interesting non-fiction account of the disappearance of a precious artifact falls flat as an attempt at a mystery novel.
