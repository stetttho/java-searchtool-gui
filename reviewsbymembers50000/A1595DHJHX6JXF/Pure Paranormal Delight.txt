 Declan Fitzgerald has left behind a promising career as a lawyer, not to mention his family, to buy a mansion on the outskirts of New Orleans. Ever since he first saw it as a teenager, Manet Hall has been in his heart. What is it about the abandoned house that pulls him to it? And will the rumors of ghosts and unexplained phenomena scare Declan away from his dream home?  When he meets his beautiful neighbor, Angelina Simone, Declan once again feels an inexplicable pull. But as Declan begins to settle into his new life, and starts to fall in love with the mysterious Angelina, secrets from the past threaten to destroy his newfound happiness. This was my first book by Nora Roberts, and wow - I'm thrilled! Now I finally understand what it is that pulls millions of women to the bookstore every time one of Nora's books is released. MIDNIGHT BAYOU is fabulously written, in a flowing style that's neither overly descriptive, nor over-the-top, but manages to balance beautiful descriptions with realistic dialogue.  But the true charm of the book lies in its paranormal aspects. The ghosts that haunt Manet Hall aren't your typical otherworldly creatures, and as the storyline unravels, Declan and Angelina get more and more caught up in the mysteries of the past. Beautifully blending theories of reincarnation with pure paranormal fun, Nora Roberts manages to create a captivating novel that is sure to delight old fans and new.
