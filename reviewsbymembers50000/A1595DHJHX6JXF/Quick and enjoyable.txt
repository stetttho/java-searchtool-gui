 Kinsey's back. And this time, she's been hired by a man who suspects he's been the victim of an attempted murder. When he ends up dead just a few days later, Kinsey's convinced he was right.  Bobby Callahan is recovering from injuries sustained during a car accident that killed his best friend. When he approaches Kinsey with his theory behind the attempted murder, she's a little skeptical, but decides to do some investigating anyway - because, hey, she likes him. He seems like a good kid, even though his folks are the epitome of a troubled blended family. With his memory riddled with holes and missing pieces, discovering who might want him dead - and most importantly, why - is no easy task.   The third in the ever-popular Kinsey Milhone series, C IS FOR CORPSE also offers a humorous subplot involving Kinsey's landlord, Henry. It seems Henry's been having a little too much fun with a new girlfriend, and Kinsey smells trouble from a mile away.  The plot is predictable, and follows the well-outlined pace of the previous books. Kinsey takes a case, she discovers clues, and it all leads down the same path, to a heart-wrenching, hair-raising encounter with the bad guy.   Grafton's talent lies in her ability to capture Kinsey's voice. As always, Kinsey is an endearing character; someone readers can relate to and root for. A quick, enjoyable read.
