 Jane Gregg works as an assistant editor at Posh, a major publishing company now benefiting from the popularity surge of intimate, explicit biographies. Her newest assignment can make her career, if she can survive it. She's been assigned to edit the memoirs of Natasha Nutley, a woman riding her 15-minutes of fame after riding (literally) a famous celebrity. Now, she's telling all to Jane, who doesn't want to hear most of it. `The Gnat', as Jane fondly calls her, stole her boyfriend back in high school, something Jane has never really been able to get over.  To make matters worse, Jane has two months to find a boyfriend to bring to her aggravating cousin's wedding. At the prodding of her two best friends, Jane agrees to go on a series of blind dates, meeting one `Mr. Wrong' after another. With a deadline rapidly approaching and a very busy calendar, Jane's on a mission to find Mr. Right.  I'm the first to admit that I'm normally not a fan of chick-lit. Most novels I've read in the genre have been shallow, superficial, and poorly written. Imagine my surprise, then, when SEE JANE DATE not only captivated me, but quickly became the kind of book I couldn't put down. I'd grab it out of my purse while standing in line at the grocery store, eating lunch and even - eek! - at traffic lights.   Incredibly well written, with three-dimensional characters that make the romp through New York City engaging and fun, SEE JANE DATE is a must-read for any woman who's ever been single.
