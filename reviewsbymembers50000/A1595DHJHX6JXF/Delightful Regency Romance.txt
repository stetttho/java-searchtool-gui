 Lucy Contrain's husband died a year ago in an accident, leaving her with a lot of debt she has no hope to pay off on her own. Left with one maid (and that's because the girl refuses to leave) and an empty pantry, Lucy must depend on the kindness of others to make it through the day. She attends the Countess of Sealy's weekly salon and is fortunate enough to be given some of the countess's old clothes to wear. But when Lucy finds a note stuck to her door, stating that she needs to come up with 1,000 pounds or lose her house, she knows there's no hope left for her. No kind soul could ever be that generous. Then she meets Nicholas Richmond, whose search for a royal ruby named "the scarlet widow" takes him to Lucy's door. He tells her that her late husband was a jewel thief, a fact that Lucy refuses to believe. Then he mentions the reward for the lost jewel-5,000 pounds-and Lucy vows to help him in any way she can. Their search leads them to the seedy underside of London, to royal salons and theater gatherings, and into each other's arms. The plot may be one you've already encountered in many Regency novels, but it's the characterization that really makes this novel shine. Nicholas is as sexy and charming as you'd expect. He's also a rake, whose reputation with the ladies is the talk of the ton. But there's more to him than that, including a past he keeps hidden from everyone, and a generous, kind heart he opens up to the right woman. Lucy is nave and innocent in the ways of the world, making her a perfect match for Nicholas. She's a quick learner, and it's a delight to see the way she grows from a timid, penniless widow to a confident, gorgeous woman of high society. A delightful book to curl up with, WIDOW IN SCARLET is mostly serious in tone, but provides some great comic relief as well. The love scenes are scorching hot, as is the tension between Lucy and Nicholas.
