 Guy Gavriel Kay is one of my favorite authors and as such, I had very high hopes for this novel. Unfortunately, his Tolkien influence not only shows here, but it overwhelms the book entirely.  The plot is relatively straight-forward: five young people are led through a portal into another world by a mysterious mage and his sidekick. They're told they're only there for a celebration, a few days at the most, and then they can go home. But things go wrong from the very beginning. One of them doesn't make it through with the other four, and the plot just gets jumbled from there.   It sounds like standard fantasy fodder - and it should be. Unfortunately, the language is almost archaic, and the dialogue stilted. Sometimes entire pages are devoted to scenery. It may have worked well when Tolkien wrote, but in today's society, I expect a fast-paced story, full of intrigue and adventure.   At times, Kay offers glimpses of his talent by creating a character so wonderful (Sharra), and a culture so rich (the Dalrei), it takes my breath away. Unfortunately, those glimpses were few and far between. The main characters are bland and uninteresting, with the possible exception of Kim Ford, and they're all much too quick to accept this strange new world they've been thrown in (if a mage came up to you and plunged you through a portal, wouldn't you be a little more resistant to that kind of change?).  If you're a Tolkien fan, chances are good you'll enjoy THE SUMMER TREE. For the rest of us, this book is best left on the shelves.
