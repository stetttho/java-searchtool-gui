 Henry Parker Britland IV is the ex-president of the United States. Newly married, he wants nothing more than to relax with his beautiful young wife. Unfortunately, the ex-president seems to attract trouble, and in MY GAL SUNDAY, he and his new wife find themselves in the middle of three precarious situations. Three short stories comprise this short book, and the mysteries seem to get progressively worse.  I read one novel by Mary Higgins Clark prior to this one, and my expectations were high. However, I was incredibly disappointed with these three short mysteries. They were predictable, dull, and uninteresting. And worse, the endings were sudden, leaving me with the distinct impression that the story didn't so much end, but that Mrs. Higgins Clark had run out of things to say. Hey, maybe she became as bored with the characters while writing as I did while reading. Mr. Ex-President was much too whiny for my taste, while his lovely wife seemed more like Elle Woods in Legally Blonde than the wife of a president in her own right. The book's only redeeming quality is that it's a quick read. At only 206 pages, it'll only kill one afternoon out of your life.
