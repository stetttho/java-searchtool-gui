 Grace is much too nice. She can't bear to hurt people's feelings. And she certainly can't say no when men ask her out, again and again, and again. When they don't seem to get the hint, what's a girl to do? Why, kill them, of course! This is the premise of Jen Sacks' bizarre debut, NICE. Take one sociopath and one assassin and bring them together through sheer coincidence, and you have... well, something like a train-wreck. You can't look away. You can't stop turning pages, even though you want to. There's something so weird about the characters, the premise, and even the writing style, that it just sucks you in. Two hours later, when you put the book down (thankfully, it's a very short book), you shake your head and lament the two hours of your life you'll never get back. Still I have to hand it to Ms. Sacks - the premise is fascinating, and absolutely morbid. Unfortunately, the story never quite takes off. Perhaps it's the lack of empathetic characters. After all, can you ever really like a heroine who kills men because she's can't utter a polite "thanks, but no thanks"? Or perhaps it's the writing style. Written in the first person, the novel alternates perspectives in its short chapters, and the story is alternately told from the point of view of both the hero and heroine. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem - but when the entire book is in first person, and the chapters are often no longer than a page or two, I constantly found myself flipping back to the beginning of the chapter to figure out whose head I was in, and who was speaking. Thankfully, at the top of each chapter is the character's name. Why do I get the feeling that even Ms. Sacks' editor didn't think the double first-person POV was a good idea? Then again, if that's the case, she really should have put her foot down and changed it to third person. Interesting premise that falls short. Pick this one up if you're in the mood for a bizarre read, and you have no tabloids around.
