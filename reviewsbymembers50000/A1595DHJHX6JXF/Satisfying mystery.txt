 There's something infinitely satisfying about turning the last page of a good mystery novel and sighing in satisfaction. Mary Higgins Clark's PRETEND YOU DON'T SEE HER offers exactly this kind of contentment. Lacey Farrell has a job she enjoys, selling real estate in her beloved New York City. When the apartment of a singer who had died in a car accident is put on the market, Lacey is glad for the opportunity to sell it. After all, it's in a great part of Manhattan, the asking price is six hundred thousand dollars, and it's sure to earn her a decent commission. She becomes friends with the late singer's mother, and one night as she goes to pay her a visit, she also unwillingly becomes a witness to her murder. Unfortunately, the killer sees Lacey as well, and she's then forced to join the witness protection program, where she struggles to make a new life for herself, constantly watching over her shoulder on the off-chance that the murderer may have finally caught up with her. PRETEND YOU DON'T SEE HER kept me turning pages well into the night. I finished it quickly, as I found the fast paced writing style enjoyable. The characterization was intriguing. I genuinely liked Lacey, who came across as courageous, caring and altogether realistic. Her genuine feelings for her family and her attraction and unwillingness to lie to a man she met while in the witness protection program made her even more endearing. I found myself wishing that the relationship between her and Tom had been more detailed, but that's what I get for reading a mystery novel rather than a romance! This was my first experience with one of Mary Higgins Clark's books, and it certainly won't be the last. She's indeed just as talented as her reputation led me to believe, and I look forward to reading more of her work.
