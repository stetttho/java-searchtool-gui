 Kinsey Gray and Doug Story have a history - but it's not until Doug announces his imminent move that Kinsey realizes how deep her feelings run for him. Soon, she finds herself using every trick in the book (and in the bedroom) to convince him to stay. But how can she do that when he hasn't even admitted to himself why he's leaving?  Alison Kent has written a contemporary romance with loveable, realistic, sympathetic characters. Both Doug and Kinsey have flaws, hang-ups, and unique personality traits. The secondary characters were also well-developed enough to make me want to read more about them. As this was my first foray into girl-gear territory, I'm going to keep an eye out for the other books in the series.  My only complaint has to do with pacing - I found the novel a little bland and slow in parts. There were chapters upon chapters where the hero and heroine did nothing but sit around and talk (either to each other, or to others). Eventually, I was dying for something more to happen, for a plot twist that never materialized. Still, the love scenes were scorching hot - really sizzling, top-notch stuff, and Ms. Kent writes perfectly - with just enough hints of description to bring the setting to life without bogging down the story with meaningless details. If only the plot had been a little more exciting, WICKED GAMES might have ended up on my keeper shelf.
