 In the not-too-distant future, Amaryllis Lark is a prism, a psychic detective, in the city of New Seattle. A prism is crucial to the well-being of the colonists of St. Helen's, as they developed into two major groups: either talents, or prisms. Talents have a number of psychic abilities, ranging from the mundane (horticultural talents) to the mysterious (illusionist talents). Prisms, on the other hand, help a talent focus his energy in order to be able to use his psychic abilities. Without a prism, a talent wouldn't be able to use his ability for longer than a few seconds at most.  Lucas Trent, also known as The Iceman, hires Amaryllis for her psychic talents. He knows that a close business associate has been stealing and selling corporate secrets, and he thinks there might be more going on than simple greed. When Lucas and Amaryllis join forces, their psychic connection and attraction to each other sizzles. Soon, they're thrust in the middle of a murder investigation, and a love affair neither can resist.  Jayne Castle, who writes contemporary romances under the name Jayne Ann Krentz, and historical romances under the name Amada Quick, has written a phenomenal tale in AMARYLLIS. The romance is strong, and holds its own in a complex and interesting plot. The hint of mystery also unravels nicely throughout the book and keeps the plot moving at a rapid pace.
