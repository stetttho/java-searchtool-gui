 At a time when so many fantasy novels are rehashing the same plot, it was delightful to stumble upon such a different story. The concept is intriguing. The main character, Wizard, is bound by the rules of magic. He must not carry more than a dollar at a time, he must always tell the truth as he knows it, he must remain celibate, and he must feed and protect the pigeons. If you're thinking that the first and last rule make him sound like a lot of the homeless you encounter on big city streets - well, that's the idea. A homeless Wizard. One who has an interesting way to help people. He doesn't cast spells, but he knows things. People talk to him, and what he tells them is helpful, accurate, and always insightful. Then a mysterious, shadowy figure from his past re-emerges and threatens to destroy not only Wizard himself, but the entire city as well.  Though beautifully written, WIZARD OF THE PIGEONS is a very slow paced book. A lot of time is spent on exploring and learning about the characters, and during this time, they don't really do much. Wizard, however, makes one bad choice after another, while constantly doubting himself, until I was ready to either throttle him or throw the book in frustration. The ending is anti-climactic, and quite disappointing as well. Still, despite its obvious faults, I enjoyed reading this book for the simple reason that it's an excellent example of wonderful writing. Great descriptive passages and intriguing themes abound, but if you like your fantasy fast paced, this book won't satisfy.
