 It's the year 1971, and famous rocks stars are dying within only short months of each other. Death can't naturally be claiming such stars as Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison, and Janis Joplin in such a short time span - can it? Ashara Konrad thinks she may know the identity of the killer. She and her identical twin sisters are both vampires, but that's where the similarities between the two of them end. Ashara is kind, vulnerable, loving and picky when it comes to her meals (preferring to only kill the old and the corrupt). Her sister, Zariaz, on the other hand delights in torturing the innocent. Her cold and dangerous nature cost her the love of one remarkable man - Ludwig Van Beethoven, in 1811. When he chose Ashara over her sister, Zariaz was devastated, and set into motion her "one thousand musicians" curse. Her plan was to kill one thousand musicians, which would take the place of the one she couldn't have. With this one book, Staci Layne Wilson has catapulted herself to the top of my favorite vampire authors list. Her characters are extremely realistic. They're each given depth, and believable motivations, and there isn't a stereotypical one among them! The relationship that develops between Ashara and Liam, the lead singer for a new band called "Darkside" is exquisite. It follows the patterns of every relationship I've ever been in (of course, culminating in that happily-ever-after ending which is the trademark of romance novels).  The setting was another aspect of the novel that both impressed and surprised me. I wasn't around in the 70s, so I didn't expect to be too interested in the time period being depicted here. And yet, Staci Layne Wilson's ability to describe the setting captivated me. Everything from the tie-died sweaters to the bellbottom jeans and the marijuana which was so prevalent in the bloodstreams of Ashara's victims served to take me away to another time and place. A beautifully written, fresh vampire novel - don't miss this one!
