 Katie Marcelli has just launched her own party-planning business, and she knows that landing a big contract would put Organization Central on the map. When that contract practically lands in her lap, Katie's stunned and excited. Then she meets Zach Stryker, one of the partners of the large firm footing the bill for her organizational efforts, and she realizes the real reason she was chosen for the job: Zach hopes to persuade her (by any means necessary) that Katie's sister's upcoming marriage to Zach's son is a very bad idea.  Zach's the only one who believes that two 18-year olds shouldn't wed. The Marcelli clan embraces the idea, as does Katie herself, not to mention the recently engaged couple. Can Zach persuade Katie that these two young people shouldn't be allowed to make a mistake that will ruin their lives forever? And can he keep his hands off Katie in the process?  THE SPARKLING ONE has a solid plot which stems from enough internal and external conflict to keep it moving at a rapid pace. Unfortunately, the Marcelli family is so overwhelming and annoying, it's hard to really feel for any of the characters. With the exception of Zach, who is arrogant and cynical, but also charming, sexy, and kind, the rest of the characters have few redeeming qualities.   Ms. Mallery's intent must have been the thorough depiction of an Italian-American family, but the characterization falls short of eliciting a humorous reaction. Instead, the boisterous grandmothers, domineering grandfather, and off-kilter sisters come off as stereotypical and infinitely unlovable. I kept expecting Katie to come to her senses and finally run off for good. I also couldn't understand the reason for Zach's sudden acceptance of the family.   Overall, a sharply plotted tale that fails to deliver due to shoddy characterization.
