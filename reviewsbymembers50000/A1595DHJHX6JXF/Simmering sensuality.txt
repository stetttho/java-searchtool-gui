 Sophie Davis writes a column providing household advice. "The poor woman's Martha Stewart", Sophie doesn't get much of a chance to actually apply that advice - until she buys an old inn in Vermont, and moves her mother and sister along with her. The inn was the setting for a gruesome triple-murder twenty years ago, but Sophie doesn't care much about that aspect of her new home. She's intent on renovating and decorating the place, although she's not too eager to have strangers invade her sanctuary. However, she knows that this is the only way to maintain an income in such a small city. Sophie's life gets even more complicated when the enigmatic John Smith rents an old abandoned cottage near her inn. Why is he there? It's obvious to Sophie that his name is not really John Smith, and he seems to be asking way too many questions about the old murder, yet she can't figure out his true identity. Meanwhile, Sophie has other problems. Her mother, Grace, is slowly slipping away as she battles Alzheimer's disease, and her sister, Marty, is going through an extreme teenage rebellion stage. And why is Sophie so intrigued (and a little frightened) of John Smith? Anne Stuart has created a gorgeous story of finding love when you least expect it. Both characters have issues, and they're as different from one another as could be, yet when they're around each other, sparks fly. The tension and attraction between them is strong, and the reader immediately gets pulled into their relationship, rooting for Sophie and John to make it despite their differences and the obstacles thrown at them. The beautiful scenery and atmosphere works as a wonderful backdrop for the story. My only complaint is that I had the "bad guy" figured out about 1/4th through the story, so the ending didn't come as much as a shock as perhaps it should have. Still, the romance and the incredible sensuality in this story were enough to keep me eagerly turning pages until the end.
