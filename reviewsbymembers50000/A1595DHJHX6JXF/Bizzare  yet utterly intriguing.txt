 When Dylan O'Connor heads out to an art exhibit with his autistic brother, Shep, he thinks this is just another road trip. He plans to sell a few paintings, spend some quality time with his brother, and overall, enjoy himself. He certainly never imagined he'd be abducted by a madman, tied to a chair, and injected with what can only be described as "stuff", even by the madman himself. Then, things only get more complicated when Dylan realizes that his brother's also been injected, and the two meet a pessimistic, negative comedienne, who - you guessed it - has also been injected with the mysterious "stuff". Now, the three of them can only depend on each other. The cops can't be of any help, and they're being chased by madmen who seem even more intent on doing them harm than the original mad scientist who got them into this mess to begin with. What follows is one bizarre adventure after another, as the three try to figure out what this "stuff" is doing to them, whether the effects can be controlled, and whether any of them can ever return to a normal life after all of this. Though the premise is bizarre, and the storyline itself is just as odd as it promises to be, BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON is utterly fascinating. Written in beautiful, entrancing prose, and offering unique insights into the human condition, this is one book that's hard to put down. I often found myself wondering whether events could get any stranger - and they always did. Koontz's imagination never fails to surprise, offering more brain candy than your mind can handle, and inserting enough metaphors and intelligent themes to make you realize that there's something deeper behind this seemingly unrealistic, yet intriguing story.
