 Dr. Toby Harper has a lot on her plate. She works the twelve-hour overnight shift in the Emergency Room, and at home, she takes care of her elderly mother who has Alzheimer's. When a patient is brought into Toby's hospital in the middle of the night, delirious and confused, she's stumped as to what he may be suffering from. His immediate medical tests are clear, and his family knows nothing of any former medical history that may have led up to this. Then things get even more complicated. The patient disappears right off the table, even though he's been strapped down. In an effort to get to the bottom of things, Toby starts investigating a nearby retirement home for the wealthy. With the help of Dr. Robbie Brace who works at the Brant Hill retirement center, Toby slowly starts uncovering clues that finally begin to point her in the right direction. At the same time, Toby's career is in danger as she's being blamed for letting the patient disappear, and her home life is quickly collapsing around her as her mother's nurse quits and she's forced to hire someone else on short notice.  Toby Harper makes a wonderful heroine in LIFE SUPPORT. She's strong and intelligent, and yet she's also very vulnerable and incredibly loyal to her mother. Though it means basically giving up her privacy and her social life, Toby would rather have her mother continue living with her than consider putting her in a nursing home. The secondary characters are also wonderfully three dimensional and interesting, from Robbie Brace, the black doctor among the elitist white staff at Brant Hill, to Molly Picker, the sixteen year old prostitute who wants nothing more than to get off the streets and go home, even though her parents want nothing to do with her. A fully believable, beautifully crafted novel, LIFE SUPPORT is a must-read for fans of medical thrillers.
