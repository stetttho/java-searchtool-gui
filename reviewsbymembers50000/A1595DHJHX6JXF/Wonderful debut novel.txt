 What do you do when you meet Mr. Right, at the wrong time? No, make that at the worst possible time. Blair Clemens is dying of cancer. At this point, all she wants to do is lose herself in her work, and her love of her sixteen-year-old daughter, Amanda. When Luke Bellingham enters her life, a committed relationship is the last thing on her mind. Yet his vulnerability, his concern for her, and his irresistible dog break down her defenses, and she finds herself falling head over heels in love for the first time in her forty-two years, and for the last time in her life. Luke, on the other hand, has problems of his own. His wife left him after years of marriage, without a word of explanation. Now, Luke is heartbroken. He needs to find her, and he needs answers that only she can provide. When he finds himself drawn to Blair, he realizes that the time will come when he'll have to make a choice between the two women who are now irrevocably a part of his life. Written in a warm and hopeful tone, ON A NIGHT LIKE THIS isn't your usual tearjerker. Sure, you'll cry. And you'll definitely laugh at Blair's antics as you read along as well. But most of all, you'll be intrigued, and eager to keep turning pages. Ellen Sussman's writing style is quick, fast, and deceptively simple. Before you know it, you'll be swept away in the world she's created, involved in the character's lives, and eager to know what happens next. Brilliant characterization and lasting themes, such as mother-daughter relationships and empty marriages, make this debut novel stand out from the rest.
