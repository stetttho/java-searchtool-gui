 Benjamina Franklin (yes, that is her real name - as the story goes, her parents were on some heavy drugs when they thought of it) should be walking on air. She has a great job as a writer for a popular women's magazine, a nice apartment, supportive friends - and she gets invited to the best parties. What she doesn't have is "The One" - that perfect relationship she so eagerly craves. When Bejnamina meets Max, and falls hard, she starts to believe he might be "The One". But when he flashes a fake ID to get into a bar, she realizes her problems are only beginning. Max is cute, single, owns his own clothing line, and seems to genuinely like Benjamina - but he's only 20. Can a guy that young be ready for the kind of commitment Benjamina has in mind? Or is he destined to break her heart? HOW TO MEET CUTE BOYS is a fun, light-hearted novel about one woman's relationship struggles. The first-person writing style allows the reader in-depth insight into Benjamina's most personal thoughts and feelings, such as her constant self-doubt and insecurity. A cast of colorful secondary characters accompanies Benjamina throughout the novel. Magazine articles and quizzes, like the ones you'd find in Cosmopolitan, give the novel the feel of a guilty-pleasure. Pick it up if you're into fluffy, and often hilarious reading material. HOW TO MEET CUTE BOYS is like cotton candy for your mind!
