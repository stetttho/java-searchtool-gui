 Thirty-year old Theo Vilmos can't imagine how his life could get any worse. He's still playing in garage bands with band members half his own age, his pregnant girlfriend miscarries and leaves him, his mother dies of cancer, and he loses his part-time job delivering flowers... all within the span of a few short months. But when a walking corpse breaks through his bathroom window, and he's saved from the murderous creature by a fairy no taller than a ballpoint pen, Theo seriously starts to consider that things are only going to get worse before they get better. Thrust into the magical land of Faerie, Theo struggles to understand the laws of a world unlike his own, while at the same time trying to comprehend what could possibly make him as important as he seems to be to the ruling class fairies. It seems everyone wants a piece of Theo, and not everyone's reasons are as benign as Theo would like. Accompanied by Applecore, his savior fairy the size of a ball-point pen, he makes his way through Faerie, most days trying only to stay alive from the myriad of creatures that seem to be pursuing him. Filled with some of the strangest characters to ever appear between the pages of a fantasy novel, WAR OF THE FLOWERS is thought provoking, and utterly entertaining. Tad Williams's ability to write humor, suspense, action, and evoke an emotional response from the reader (often all at once!) is remarkable. The world building is in-depth and enthralling. A stand alone fantasy novel is hard to find these days - one as thought provoking and engrossing as this one is almost impossible to come across. If you like your fantasy with a touch of myth and magic, then look no further than WAR OF THE FLOWERS. It will challenge every fairy tale you've ever heard, and put to rest the question of whether fairies really exist once and for all.
