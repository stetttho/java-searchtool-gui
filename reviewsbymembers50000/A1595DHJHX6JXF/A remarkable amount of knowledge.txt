 What's not to like about a man who is confident in bed, knows how to please a woman, can always get an erection on command, and can have long-lasting, satisfying sex every time? Wait - you say that's not you? Read GREAT SEX, by Michael Castleman, and it will be. Michael Castleman makes it clear that he's not a doctor, or a sex therapist. He does have thirty years of experience dealing with men's sexual issues, however, as an educator and a journalist. This experience shows in every chapter of GREAT SEX. The first part focuses on "The Principles of Great Sex for Men". This is where the author's main theme for the book comes in: stop trying to perform like a porn star, and start using your entire body to pleasure yourself and your partner. Each one of the senses should be involved in lovemaking, and Michael Castleman gives great examples of how to make that happen. The second part focuses on women's sexuality and well being, but keeping in mind that the book is targeted at men, this is more of a learning lesson than an owner's manual. Still, the advice and knowledge offered here is invaluable. In the third part, the author focuses on blending the best of both male and female sexual issues. Birth control, oral pleasure, aphrodisiacs - you name it, you'll find it here. Somehow managing to avoid sounding clinical and detached, and yet also maintaining a friendly, conversational tone throughout the book, Michael Castleman offers a remarkably comprehensive tome between the covers of this hardbound book. Pick it up today if you're looking for a new way to please yourself, and your partner. You may be surprised at what you didn't know, and how much more satisfying your sex life can be.
