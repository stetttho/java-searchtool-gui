 Kevla Bai-Sha was born with no status in Arukan's society. Without a father whose name she could take, she was doomed to remain a "Bai-Sha", selling her mother's wares as a "halaan". But when Khashim Tahmu-kha-Rakyn, of the Clan of Four Waters, takes her as a servant for his great house, Kevla's lot in life begins to improve. That is, at least, until Tahmu's wife realizes that Kevla is in fact his daughter.  Jashemi-kha-Tahmu, Kevla's stepbrother, recognizes her instantly as his father's daughter. He vows that although he can't recognize her as his sister publicly, he'll get to know her privately. Thus begins a forbidden relationship between the two, one that blossoms from affection to a deeply-seeded and unbreakable bond over the years.   But there's more to Kevla and Jashemi than meets the eye. They both have powerful, frightening dreams - dreams that would get them both burned for being possessed by demons if anyone in Arukan ever found out about them. With only each other to turn to, Jashemi and Kevla must uncover the secret to their disturbing dreams, before it's too late.  Ms. Golden has written a breathtaking tale of good vs. evil, treachery and betrayal, and the overwhelming power of love in the first installment in THE FINAL DANCE series. She writes magically - with an extreme talent for description and characterization, and dialogue that sounds true in every instance. Her voice is genuine and unique, never faltering, matching the tone of the novel perfectly at every turn.  Kevla's growth, her coming-of-age and acceptance of who she truly is are vital to the story, and beautifully handled by Ms. Golden. If you're looking for a captivating, intriguing fantasy novel, look no further than ON FIRE'S WINGS. The second novel in the series is scheduled for release in 2005.
