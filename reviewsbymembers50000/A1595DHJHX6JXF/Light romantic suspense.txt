 Johnathan Brighton is badly in need of a vacation, but as he's driving through the lonely desert highway into Mexico, he's pulled over, shot on the side of the road, and left for dead. Six months later, he's lost part of his memory, and the partial use of his right hand. For a workaholic CEO, this isn't just an inconvenience, it's a disaster.  Katie Cavenaugh is an undercover FBI agent struggling to maintain her reputation after an impulsive decision has her boss questioning her abilities. The assignment is simple: pose as John's physiotherapist, find evidence implicating him in a murder committed just before he left for Mexico, and get out. But things get complicated when Katie realizes there's more to John than meets the eye. Can she reign in her attraction to him and focus on getting the job done?  I loved Dee Davis's DANCING IN THE DARK, but MIDNIGHT RAIN didn't quite live up to my expectations. For a romantic suspense book, I had the real culprit figured out from page one. That knowledge definitely made it hard to pick up the book again after putting it down, and it made the story drag in parts.   I found the characters to be three-dimensional and well written, however, with John leading the pack. It was refreshing to read a romance novel where the hero is less-than-perfect physically. This imperfection doesn't make him any less sexy or charming, however. His need for Katie, his reluctance to trust her once he finds out her true identity, and his willingness to fight and discover the truth had me rooting for him throughout the length of the novel.   Overall, a light romantic suspense novel to curl up with at night, and one that won't make you want to sleep with the lights on. For a real suspense thriller, and a better indication of Ms. Davis's talents, pick up DANCING IN THE DARK. You won't be disappointed.
