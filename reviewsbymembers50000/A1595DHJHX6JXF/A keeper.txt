 At any given time, there are thousands of aspiring writers sending out their manuscripts. The majority will never get published. "But I have a great plot!" you think to yourself. "I have great characters, a wonderful setting, a premise that will resonate with readers throughout the ages..." And you very well might. But the secret to keeping your manuscript from returning home with a rejection letter comes down to smooth, polished writing. How do you do that? First, finish writing your novel. The first draft has a particular purpose: getting your story down on paper. Then, pick up Michael Seidman's EDITING YOUR FICTION and read it cover to cover. After you've done that, go back through it, chapter by chapter, and do the exercises, applying the concepts to your own writing. By the time you're done, your manuscript will be a lot better than when you started, and your chances of attracting an editor and perhaps getting your work published will have also improved. Of course, no rule should be followed off a cliff. Common sense is key. If you feel a particular statement doesn't apply to your writing, or you disagree with Mr. Seidman's way of altering a particular case study, by all means, do what's best for you. Just make sure that you have given enough thought as to the reason behind that particular rule.  EDITING YOUR FICTION is a definite must-have for any aspiring writer (and a few published authors could benefit from reading this one as well).
