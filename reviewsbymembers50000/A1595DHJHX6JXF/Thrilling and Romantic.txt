 Sara Martin has been through a lot. Two years ago, her husband and son were both killed in a car accident, and Sara's still mourning their loss. Her nights are troubled by disturbing dreams and crank calls, the latter of which sends her to detective Eric D'Angelo for help. His sexy looks and protective demeanor penetrate Sarah's defenses, but is she ready to loose her heart again?  To make things worse, there's a killer on the loose, and Detective D'Angelo has been assigned to the case. Not only are the murders as grizzly as they come, but they're getting closer and closer to home, and to Sara. Is she the target of a madman? And can she trust her life, and her heart, to Eric?  If you're looking for a fast read, with enthralling, well developed characters, look no further than DANCING IN THE DARK. The suspense thread is wonderfully woven into the story, and it kept me guessing right until the very end. Every time I thought I had the killer figured out, Ms. Davis would expertly throw in another plot twist or minor detail to throw me off track.   The chemistry between Sara and Eric leaps off the pages. They're fantastic together, in part due to wonderful dialogue and great descriptions by Ms. Davis. The romance is believable and realistic, as is their fear and the thread of suspense that flows through that romance. Secondary characters are depth to the plot, and help relieve the tension with the humor and support they offer.   Dee Davis has written a real winner in DANCING IN THE DARK. Just a word of caution: some of the descriptions of the murders are very gory, so if you're easily disturbed by such scenes, you might want to skip this one.
