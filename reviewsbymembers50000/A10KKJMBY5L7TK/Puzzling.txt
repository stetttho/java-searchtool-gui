 Hip moves, nice fight scenes and great makeup dominate this DVD about a vampire war.  Blade is an action/horror story where its hero, "Blade" uses blades, guns, and bombs to fight and kill vampires.  Blade, himself, is a hybrid, part vampire, part human.  With so much going for it, where did this movie go wrong? First, this story is based on a comic series.  There, of couse, is nothing wrong with this, so was the Superman or Batman movies. However, I was more familiar with them.  In Blade, if you don't know anything about the comics, you may get a little lossed in the story.  More to the point, the people here, were uninteresting.  I don't think is was the acting, I think it was the script.  Blade, I think, still has enough in it to appeal to the fans of the comic and some teenage male audiences.  If you are in your twenties, or older or basically any female, I don't think you will like it.  Even dedicated Wesly Snipes fans will probably be happier if they stay away from this horrible horror/adventure movie.
