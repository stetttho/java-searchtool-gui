 This book focuses in on more then Moses' life.  If it just did that, you wouldn't need to buy it, you could just read a Bible.  Instead, in  "Moses, A Life", the author discusses Moses' life, from the perspective of many different people.  Some of these stories are funny, others shocking, but they were all educational and insightful My favorite passage in this book was the fact that, apparently, in some Bibles it says that Moses has horns.  The author relates an experience where someone was starring at him, looking for horns, because the author is Jewish.  It strikes me as a very funny scene.   Yet, at the same time, it is sad.  Here was someone, who read the Bible and took it very seriously, apparently mislead by a bad translation.  How many people may have been mislead about more serious parts of the Bible? In truth, according to this author, the Bible says that Moses was marked by his talks with God.  After Moses meet with God, Moses covered his face.  People who saw his face were shocked.  It was this experience that was translated as Moses having horns.  I never knew that Moses had to keep his face covered and also never knew that others thought Moses had horns.  As such, items like this made this book very interesting to me. There are many other examples.  Did you know that God tried to kill Moses after he picked him to be his spokeperson to the Pharoah?  Did you know that some believe Moses was a prince of Ethiopia?  Did you know that the Jewish leaders may have had a secret code, which was given to Moses by God?  Otherwise, how did he prove, to them, that he was God's messenger? If you like interesting facts like this, you will enjoy this book.  If you, however, are looking for a religious book, this book may not be you.  This is not a book on theology.  It is a book about history or religious history.   If that is the type of book you like, you will love Mose's, A Life.  For these types of people, I recommend it.
