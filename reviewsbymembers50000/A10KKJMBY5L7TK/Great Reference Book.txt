 Great American Trials gives a two or three page summary of the most well known trials in American History.  The editors begin with trials from more then 350 years ago and end in the mid-1990s.  The consistant quality and detail found in this book is remarkable.  It is a very good reference book and an interesting collection of stories as well. For example, do you know what is spectral evidence? Spectral evidence was the belief that the Devil could appear in a person's form, but ONLY to people the devil wanted to tomment.  No one else could see this image.   Since only the tormented could "see" this image, only they knew who the Devil was working with.   What would happened is a tormented person lied?  Or was crazy?  The Salem's Witch Trial was one result when this type of evidence was used. From this starting point, this book again, and again, teaches the reader amazing facts and laws from our past.  The best part of this book is how easily each story flows.  You read this book because each story is enjoyable.  At the same time, you learn about U.S. History and U.S. Law.   Some things in our past, like the Salem Witch Trial, was shocking to most people today.  Other things, like the "Amistad" trial, (called "U.S. v. Cinque"), where black slaves were freed by the American Courts in the 1830s, may fill you with pride.  Still other cases, where ministers are on trial for slander, 200 years before Jim Baker, remind us of the enduring and consistant qualities of men.   All and all, this book is fun, easy to read, and a fun trip into our past.  I would think it would be especially interesting to teacher, lawyers, and anyone with a love of history.
