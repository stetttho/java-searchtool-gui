 Soul of Fire starts where the last book ended.  The Empeor Jajang is still invading from the south and Richard and Kahl need to stop him.  Added to this mix is something called "the Three Chimes."  If allowed to be free, they will destroy magic completely, leaving most of Jajang work completed.  (His goals have been world conquest and a destruction of magic.) Like most of the books in this series, Soul of Fire is a good read, much better then most of the other books currently out and available.  However, the story is getting a little weaker.  I missed Nathan, one of my favorite charactors, from earlier books.  Zed is almost missing from this book as well.   Worse, the author is definitely getting a little preachy.  About 1/3 of this book is dedicated to some new charactors who live in a southern Kingdom.  The book goes over and over about the split between the two people found there.  I didn't care.   I don't believe this part of the story added to it much, if at all. I hope that the author doesn't go down this path more.  His books have been great so far, because of the magic and people.  I don't want a ethics or moral lession everytime I read.  If he has to do that with this series, maybe he should start writing about something else. Still, the overall book is good.  I think most people who enjoyed the others books in this series will like this one too.  I doubt, however, that people will enjoy it as much.
