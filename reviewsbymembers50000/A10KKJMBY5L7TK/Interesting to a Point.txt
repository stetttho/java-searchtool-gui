 The title of this book attracted my attention to it.  What was this book?  Well, it is a collection of case histories of patients who treated with Dr. Sacks.  His speciality, people with nuerological damages.  (Brain Injuries.)  This book is interesting, in that, it exposed me to ideas and injuries I never heard about, let have seen discussed, in any other context. For example, the title refers to a man whose brain could not recognize faces.  It never occurred to me that a face is a collecton of images that your brain "puts together" and makes into a face.  This man could recognize his brother, for example, only because his brother had a large mole.   So, for interesting cases, this book is great.  As a pleasant read, because it is a collection of case histories, the stories tend to be short and, for me, they became a little boring after you get over the freaky factor of the cases.  The cases also seem to overlap somewhat.  If one was reading this for medical information, on the other hand, I would tend to think it is not accurate or detailed enough to be of any great use.  I don't know, I am not a doctor. I am, for purposes of this document, a critic. And, in that capacity, I would warn you away from this book, unless you have a special interest in these types of cases or you like to read about the strange or the unususal.  For me, I felt a little queasy reading these cases, after awhile, because I was getting entertainment by reading about the misforturnates of others so explicitly explained.  (There are some amusing cases, but they are the exception)
