 Ben Stiller plays a likable boy who still loves his high school prom date, twenty years after he has seen her.  Hiring a slimy private detective, he locates her in Florida and drivers down there to renew their romance.  Love is in the air, and their romance begins to bloom again.  This is a comedy?   Yes!  The hilarity is in the detail. In particular, comedies are funny when they catch us off guard.  Again and again, "Something about Mary" does exactly that.  It surprises the viewer in a very funny way.  If you have heard about this movie, the best bits in the movie probably have been spoiled already.  I won't do that here. What I will do it is try to compare "Mary" to the other films out there today.  First, I didn't like the earlier Farly Movies much.  Dumb and Dumber, for example, was funny sometimes.  But, it was hit and miss and, for me, it missed more then it hit.  "Mary" is consistently funny.  "Mary" doesn't depend on slapstick alone.  It turns and weaves an interesting story with some believable surprises.   Reading this review, it feels very dry.  Trust me, the movie is not. I think it was ground breaking and revolutionary.  I would rank this movie with "Blazing Saddles," "Caddyshack" and "Animal House."  They were all classics of their day.  Of them, I liked Animal House the best.  "Something About Mary" is as good today, as "Animal House" was back then.  Of course, if you didn't like Animal House, you might now want to see this film.   For me, they were all very funny.  Mary is  a welcome addition.  You should see it and enjoy.
