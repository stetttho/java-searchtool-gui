 This sweet C.D. compilation of Kink's music from 1977-1986 is  recommended for any music fan.  Better then most, the Kinks have always been able to tell a story while they sing a song.  Each song/story is told with a sense of wit and dry humor.  If you listen close, you will be amazed at how funny most of the songs are, and how honest. Everyone knows, or should know, the song/story  "Lola."  Is it a true story, or fantasy, or a nightmare?  It actually may be all three.  Destroyer, the sequel to Lola is told with the same sense of flair.  Both are rock and roll classics with a great beat.   I was amazed.  How many great songs do the Kinks sing?  How many stories do they tell?   I had only bought one album from them before, only for the song "In the Summertime."   The other songs found there were very disappointing.  Still, I played "Summertime so much," it was still worth the buy.  (Thank God for programable C.D. players.) Unfortunately, "Summertime is not here.  But, every other classic song is, including:  "Superman," "Misfits," and "A Rock and Roll Fantasy."   Listen close, after a while, some common themes will appear.  The most common?  The absurdity of life.  Yet, even if the computer may forget you are alive, (from a different C.D.) you certainly will not while you have such great music to enjoy.  So like the song says, listen to some good music, forget about your troubles for a while, and enjoy the C.D.
