 Mom and Dad are gone for the week.  An18-year-old Tom Cruise is left alone to watch the house  the Porsche, and one cool stereo.  What's a guy to do?  He could study for his upcoming tests, prepare a product for his after school club, and practice for his interview on Friday night with a representative from Princeton.   Or..... he could have fun.  Well, most men may try to be responsible, when they are alone.  When your friends find out that your parents are gone, trying to be responsible is probably a wasted effort.   "Risky Business" is a warning to parents, don't leave your kids alone - unless you are prepared for the consequences.  For the most part this movie builds on itself. The scenes lead nicely from one to another beginning with an adolescent call to a questionable woman.  Eventually Tom is running a bordello for the weekend so he can raise money to buy back his mother's crystal egg, stolen by one of these prostitutes in the first place.  At its heart Risky Business is about a boy trying to do what his parents want, in ways they would never approve.  It is funny.  It is extremely well made. I found myself laughing several times, but more then that, I found myself relating to the characters.  We all have done things that have gone wrong, here they just went really wrong; but they eventually get better.   Along the way we are treated to a first rate comedy/coming of age film.  I highly recommend it, even if you saw it years ago.
