 A Storm of Swords is the third book in this series.  Each book has been well written with twists and surprises which keep on coming.   This book continues that tradition.   First, the war continues.  The Lannister Family is winning but is paying a high price.  The cost of losing, however, is much worse.  The King of the North, Robb, has a new set of problems, and each solution looks worse then the problem.  In the South, Stannis' lot seems worse.  After being thown back at his seige of Kingslanding, many of his supporters have deserted him.  He doesn't seem to have the power to win, but he is unable to concede what he believes is rightfully his. Overseas, the last Queen of the old dynasty has her own problems, which are significant.  And, past the Wall, to the far north, wicked magic has risen and the problem there bode ill for the rest of kingdom. This is just the beginning! This book, a history of the kingdom, plays no favorites.  The good, and bad, of each party is shown.  Some people have more honor then others, but each person also has his or her flaws and defects.  In the last book, Stannis' witch told the Onion Knight that a man is good or bad, not both - but this entire book argues against that statement.  There are no perfect people in this book.  Everyone is flawed, everyone is human. Moreover, because this book is a history of the kingdom, and not the story of a single person, we never know what will happen next.  And I am not going to tell you now.  I will say that there is more death and destruction, and some of my favorite  remaining charactors have been killed.  Who do we cheer for now? That, fortunately, is not a problem.  The writer, Mr. Martin, provides new heroes and villians, and the reader is never forgetten.   If you like fantasy, you will love this book. If you already love fantasy, this book, no doubt, will be one of your new favorites.  I look forward to the next addition, and you will too.
