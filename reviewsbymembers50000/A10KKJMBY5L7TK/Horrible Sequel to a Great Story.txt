 I loved Ender's Game, I hated this book.  It was long, drawn out and predictable.  It lacks the humor found in parts of Ender's Game and the tension.  The only common element is Ender, who seems to have grown older, more serious, and more depressed.  I actually went back and re-read Ender's Game.  Could this be the same author?  Unfortunately yes.  The style is so similiar it has to be written by the same person.  But, when Mr. Card wrote this one, he seems to have forgetten the human element, the compasion, the soul, of the first book.  I finished Speaker of the Dead constantly hopefully for something, somewhere in this book to justify the read.  I never found it.  I hope his other series is good.  I am going to go to that next, instead of finishing this series.
