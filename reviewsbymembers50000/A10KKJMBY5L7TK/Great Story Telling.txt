 Arthur Quinn loves America and American History.  No, he doesn't say this anywhere in his book, "A New World", but his passion is obvious to anyone who reads this book.  The pages are filled with his excitement which will draw in almost any reader, even  those who normally do not like history. Better still, for those of us who do enjoy history, Quinn details portions of American History rarely covered in school or in other books.   The two things I liked best about A New World was Quinn's awareness of the times and his details about its people.  Usually when we study or read about American History, it is in a void.  Quinn is the first writer I have read who talks about how Machavilli influenced John Smith.  John Smith, always a boring figure of the past, now seems like a wild adventurer to me.   Quinn also talks about Indian savagery.  I never really appreciated why the Colonists had such fears or anger towards them.  Our politically correct schools always teach us how Colonists took our land from others.  I have never in school how some Indians tortured soliders so much before a battle, that the European troops gave up out of fear.  Or how these same Indians would take a stick and slowly work it up the bone of a person from his hand to his shoulder.  Not counting the constant war between some Indian Tribes and the colonist, these stories helped me understand the attitudes of those times much better. After Barbara Tuchman's, The Guns of August, this is probably the best history work I have read.  I look forward to reading more from Mr. Quinn.  If you haven't read him yet, this book is a very good place to start.
