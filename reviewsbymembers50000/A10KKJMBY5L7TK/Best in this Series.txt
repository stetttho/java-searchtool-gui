 With such a good series, picking out the best one should be hard.  It is not.  Lord of Chaos is a great book, the best one to date.  Robert Jordan brings together and nicely combines the elements of the past books.   We have great drama, backstabbing, rivarlies and war.  There are major surprises, major, and good new developments.  I especially like Taim joining Rand's side.  It is nice touch.  We see now that the coming war will have great powers on both sides.  The eventual end to this series should be spectular. In Lord of Chaos, indeed, Robert Jordan gives us a sweet taste of the final climax, a great battle scene, the most detailed yet in this series.  All sides, almost, are represented.  At my last count, there must be at least eight different sides here.   Every group, strong at first, has split at least once.  Thus we have two different Aiel factions, or three; the Aes Sedai have split and, if you include the Waive Mistresses and the Aiel, there are four factions there; we have the re-conquering; and, of course, the Forsaken, who themselves are hardly cohesive. Indeed, with all the plots and counterplots, will this book ever end?  It is easy to see, if Rand ever wins, how his winning coalition may break up and war with itself.   Rand, the Dragon, of course will win in the end.  But, if he didn't, the other side would also have trouble surviving their victory. It is hard to see how any writer will be able to maintain the intensity, and the great detail found in this series.  They have been a pleasure to read and I look forward to reading the next parts in this series.
