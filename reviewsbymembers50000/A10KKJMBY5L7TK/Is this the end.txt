 After searching for whales in the past and finding "God" at the end of the Universe, the Star Trek movies looked like they were almost out of steam.  The revenues were low, the critics were howling, and the series (at least in the movies) seemed dead.  And really, did anyone but the fans enjoy those movies?   But, even before "The Undiscovered Country," came out the "buzz" was quite good.  It was back to the basics with despicable enemies, an interesting plot, and a promotion for Helmsman Sulu, now returning as captain of his own ship.  It almost makes you mad at the producers for all of the other garbage they subjected the fans too.  Here is Star Trek almost done right.    In "The Undiscovered Country," the Federation is predicting a possible Klingon invasion because one of the Klingon moons, a power source for much of the Empire, explodes.  A Kligon diplomat, however, seeks a peace treaty instead.  Kirk, ordered to pick up this ambassador, winds up in the middle of a twisted and strange plot which makes less sense the more you think about it.  Take my advice, don't.  Instead, enjoy the special effects, the chemistry between the characters, and the effort that was put into parts of this film.   And while not a classic, "The Undiscovered Country" can be enjoyed by most fans of science fiction and probably will be adored by Trekkers.  If this is the last film with the original crew, we all know it could have been worse.  So, I say good-bye to Mr. Ears, Kirk, Bones, and the whole crew.  They will be missed, but as long at there is cable t.v. and the science fiction channel, I dare say they will always be remembered.  (Yes, yes, I know Mr. Ears' name is Spock, you people need to relax.)
