 This is review for people who read comics. I have read comics from when I was abou 7 or 8 until my late 20's.  I stopped buying them because they were getting too expensive and too many of them were really dumb.  Of them all, Marvel Publishing was the worst.   For example, nobody was ever killed in Marvel.  Instead, they were only seriously injured, or it was a robot, or it was a clone, or it was an "entity" that looked like that person, or it was an alternative universe.  If you read Marvel, you understand what I am saying. So, I went to this film with both hope, and trepidation.  I was surprised.  This is a good film.  It is interesting, inovative, and honest to the comic series.  It does mix the old and new  X-men a little, but it didn't distract from the film.  The special effects are also extraordinary.  The mutant power seem real and are fun to watch.  The only weak part, really, was the story. In the movie, Magneto is back.  He is with the brotherhood of evil mutants.  Their goals is to make all of the most important leaders of the world mutants, so that they will stopped mutant persecution.  To do this, Magneto must power a machine which will end of killing him.  He finds a way to avoid dying, but it may have some regrettable consequences.  Indeed, will he machine even work the way he has planned?  The movie leave that question very much in doubt. But who watches these movies for the stories? We want to see fighting and superpowers. X-men delievers on both.  The fight scenes are done well(although I think they copied somewhat from the Matrix)  and the special effects, with trains ripping apart and Scott's eye beams shooting through buildings, should please must fans.  This is a fun movie, with action, adventure and even a little romance.  Great for anyone who read the comic, good for almost anyone else.
