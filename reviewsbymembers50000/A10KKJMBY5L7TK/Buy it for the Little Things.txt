 If you love the Simpons, your love this book.  The only real question is  why you should buy it after watching the shows so many times on t.v.  Why,  because it is so funny.   Watching the shows, you may miss alot of  things, because they go by to quick, or because there is too much  happening.  The book slows it down and shows your the inside secrets on the  gags and jokes.  Each page has a little biography about a charactor on the  show.  Each page gives us a little bit more to laugh about.  Buy it, enjoy  it, and have good fun.  It is great fun for anyone from 10-100.
