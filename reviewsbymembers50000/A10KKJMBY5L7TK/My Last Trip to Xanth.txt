 This book isn't that bad, if it were the first Xanth book you read.  However, this was my sixth Xanth book.  Alot of the original things, the magic, the irony, the stories, which I loved in the other books are just repeated here.  Worse, in Dragon on a Pedestal, some of the great horrors and monsters of the past books, like the moat dragon, are turned into cute little creatures.  Boo!  Xanth novels were light hearted, but they had a serious edge too.  Here everything is warm and fuzzy and harmless.  There is no tension in this story because we all know that everyone will be okay in the end and, in addition, will be great friends who share milk and cookies.  Boo again!  I remember Castle Roogna where Dor takes Goblins, transformed into rocks, and shots them at approaching Harpys.  Where the Zombie King raise the dead, whose limbs fall off them while they fight.  Here Xanth is too nice and too sweet and too boring for anyone who likes good fantasy to really enjoy.  I would avoid this book if I could.  I already read it though so the best I can do, to warn you about it.  For myself, if this is the direction Xanth is going, I think this will probably be my last trip to Xanth.  Maybe it is time I bought other books.
