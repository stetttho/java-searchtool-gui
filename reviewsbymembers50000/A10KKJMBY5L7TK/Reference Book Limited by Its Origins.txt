 Most of us know by now that Mr. Forbes ran for his party's presidential nomination twice, and lost both times.  What some people might not know is that he, and his father before him, ran a successful business magazine.  You may be thinking that this is all very good so far but, what does this have to do with this book?  Nothing, and everything. A quotation book, by necessity, must pick and choose those thoughts and ideas, expressed in a quote, which the authors find important and/or useful.  This book has too many quotes from  Mr. Forbes Sr.  He was a great business man, but I didn't find his quotes very insightful.  The authors, no doubt, felt compelled to enter this person's thoughts AND THOSE FORBES SR FELT WHERE INFLUENCIAL.   That is this book's flaw.  This book has too many quotes which are unneeded or uninteresting, because of the book's origins.  If you were a great fan of Mr. Forbes, by all means you should get this book.  Otherwise you would be better served and your money will be better spend if you buy a different quote book.  Good Luck.
