 If you like Science Fiction, even a little, you will love this film!  If you don't like Science Fiction, you will probably still enjoy it.  This is a great film.   In the "Fifth Element" Bruce Willis is a retired military hero who now works as a taxi cab driver.  On the day he is to be fired, a beautiful alien drops into his cab - literally.  He falls in love with her even while he is assigned to a mission to save the Earth from total destuction.  Of course, she is the key to the saving the planet.  Together Bruce (who knows his name in this movie, I think it was Colby?) and the Fifth Element go on a secret mission, broadcast to most of the Earth, to save the planet.  With dog faced aliens, a great, GREAT! villian, an interesting music score including some classic and Egyptian music(?), the best possible special effects, Bruce Willis, and a great blend of comedy, adventure and romance - this film has it all.  A great diversion, a great film!
