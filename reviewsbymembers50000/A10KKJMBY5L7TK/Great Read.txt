 Second in the Wheel of Time series, this book can be viewed as the first in this saga because the first book was pretty well contained.  The Great Hunt, however, opens up this series as we are introduced to some great charactors, twists and surprises.  The writer here has done an excellent job describing a place and time which seems so accurate, if you let yourself go, you can believe it is real. In, the Great Hunt, we start shortly after the last book ended.  Rand, and his friends, are up north recupperating after their last battle.  Rand, in particular, is becoming moody because of his struggle with his power and his destiny.  I am not sure why, but why do so many fantasy figures struggle with their power?  In most books it is latent but here, at least, it is very openly expressed.  If Rand, or anyone man, uses their power they will go crazy.  This, for me, is a distraction, but a minor one.  There are alot of good things happening in this book. For example, since Trollocs come from the North, I expected Rand to lead, or be involved, right away, in some type of invasion of their land.  But very quickly we learn that Rand must go South, for a surprising reason.  At least, I was surprised. We also learn that Moraine has problems with the other Aes Sedia.  Another surprise to me.   We learn more and more about this land, time and people.  And every bit is interesting.  My only criticism, a small one, is that there may be too much here to digest.  The last book had a great appendix which explained more about the lands and people.  Here, the appendix is less detailed.  As such, from time to time, when I was confused I didn't really have anywhere to turn.  It didn't happen often, but it was a little annoying.  Compared to the overall scope of this book, however, it is a small complaint.  The Great Hunt is, well... it is great.  Well worth reading.
