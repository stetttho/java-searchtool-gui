 This is an academy award winner.  It has been praised from by everyone as "innovative" and "original."  I found this movie, however, to be a bore.   Kevin Spacey does do a great job portraying a man in crisis.  About to be fired from his job, he blackmails his boss for a big separaton bonus.  With this money, he can live his dream to work in a McDonalds.   I am not making this up.   He also starts lifting weights again, renews his passion for pot, and falls in love? with his teenager daughter's friend.  His wife is having an affair.  His daughter, very unhappy, is dating a local thug and drug dealer. American Beauty takes great pains to excuse everyone's conduct.  The drug dealer's father is a jerk and a bigot.  His wife feels unloved and unsatisfied at home. His daughter is his daughter.  Won't you be messed up in such a family? Personally, I felt that the story itself was slow and aimless.  It was also told in a very depressing manner. What was the point?  It was almost if the writers took the day in the life of some ordinary person and put in up on the screen.  Since, normally, we live day-to-day, there isn't a common theme or connection in such a story.  I realize that alot of people might like the camera work or the performance of Stacey or Benning, but I want a coherent story.  Since there was none found here, I didn't find much to like.  Still, I do appreciate the actor's performance and work on this film.  Thus, I gave it a "2" instead of a plain fail. But whatever I ultimately rate this one, I would warn everyone but "artsy" people away from it.
