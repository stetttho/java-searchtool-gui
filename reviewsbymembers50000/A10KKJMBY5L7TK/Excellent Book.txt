 This book started slow and I almost didn't finish it.  Don't make this mistake.  It picks up in the middle and then it never slows down.  It is a very good read. In Wizard's First Rule, we are introduce to Richard, a ranger.  His father was recently murdered, and it was gruesome.  While off the in the forest,  he encounters a beautiful women fleeing for her life.  Is there a connection? From these earlier scenes, we encounter Wizards, Witches, Friendly Spirits and Deadly Ghosts.  There are also talking dragons and flying, fierce winged warrior beasts.  The whole world may be destroyed, if Richard makes the wrong choice.  The writer has a good sense of style, and good sense of humor, and an interesting sense of morality.   At one point a Wizard says that he did the worst thing possible, he let the people suffer from the consequences of their actions. Of all this is an excellent book and I think most fantasy lovers will enjoy it.  A good start in a great series.
