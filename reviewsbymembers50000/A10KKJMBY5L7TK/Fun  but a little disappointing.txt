 Crewel Lye is story of the adventures of a Barbarian, Jordan, who has a magic talent, he is a quick and very, very good healer.  Since barbarians normally don't have magic, this could be disturbing.  He falls in love with a beautiful women, who appears to love him too.  But love, and magic, aren't always what they appear to be.  Although, sometimes, they are.  With some competing Magicians involved Jordan's life becomes a little bit complicated. While, I loved the early Xanth books and I still strongly recommend them, Crewel Lye is not up to the standards of the earlier books.  It is still an enjoyable read, it is just not as good as the earlier stories.  In particular, I got tired of Jordan referring to the rules of Barbarians.  It wasn't very funny and it dragged on the story. The first Xanth stories had more creativity.  Crewel Lye seems like a copy of Castle Roogna.  The characters are different, but the story is almost the same, including the ending.  There are enough changes along the way to make it interesting, but not as good as the first few books of this series.  I wouldn't recommend it, but I don't warn you off either.  It's okay, which is better then alot of books.
