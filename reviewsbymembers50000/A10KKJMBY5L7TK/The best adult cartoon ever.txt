 No, this is not a porno.  But "Heavy Metal" is drawn and designed with the adult viewer in mind.  Five high quality stories of blood, guts, greed and violence which, in addition, are often very funny.  As a bonus, if you like "Heavy Metal" you will probably be in heaven as some favorite groups from the past can be found here.  (I would argue, though, that "Devo" and "Trust" are not heavy metal groups, they still have some good music.)  Heavy Metal is a perfect gift for fans of the magazine with the same name, readers of Ron Howard and Conan the Barbarian fans.  As for the DVD, its okay. It has some deleted sequences which I liked, but it is probably better that they cut them out of the original movie.  I think it will make fans of the movie happy.  I don't think they add much to other people.
