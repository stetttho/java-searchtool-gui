 It's hard to be fair about this movie.  It is a breed apart from most of the films you can see.  As such most people I know who saw "Fargo" loved it, or thought it was horrible.  There doesn't seem to be any middle ground here. What makes it different?  The story? In the movie credits it says that this was based on a true story.  This always makes me suspicious.  How much of this story, exactly, is true?  I don't know.  The story does seems a little strange, but not unique.  In it a man plans to kidnap his own wife so his father-in-law will pay a ransom.  He hires some local hoods but the plan goes wrong. There are two things about this movie which were really good.  First the acting was almost perfect.  Everyone in this movie seems to be well cast and believable.  Even if it wasn't a true story, you could believe it was.  Which was the other thing I liked about this film, the "side details."  The movie is telling a story about some people who are involved in this kidnaping plot.  But it also tells their stories.  There are a lot of little details about these people and their lives, usually missing from other films. I think that this was what drove some people crazy.  They want their film to focus on one point, one story.  Life isn't like that, normally.  Even in the middle of an exciting event, many other things will always be happening.  This is also what attracted many fans.  The details.   For me, I like films that are different or strange, sometimes.  I could appreciate the efforts made here but, in the end, I didn't enjoy this film because it, for me, was so sad and depressing.  I would give this film a "5" in terms of doing what the directors set out to do.  It accomplished all of its goals. In terms of my personal viewing pleasure, my rating would be much lower.  If the film I described is interesting to you, enjoy yourself.
