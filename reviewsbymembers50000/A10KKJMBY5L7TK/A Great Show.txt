 Independence Day is a throw back to the alien invasion films of the 1950s.  Sure the special effects are superb, but couldn't the filmmakers at least attempt to have some story?  Instead, they have given us a laughable piece of work.  Watch this film in twenty years when the special effects will be old hat, instead of cutting edge, and I bet you will be embarrassed to admit you even saw it.   Still, it is not yet twenty years in the future.  Today, looking at this film, you will be amazed at some of the effects.  For that reason, this film is best watched at a theatre.  Since it is to late for that now, you should see it on DVD so can get the most from the special effects. I would warn you that, even with my enjoyment of the special effects, the action in this film does not get going until about fifty percent through the film.   Does your DVD have a fast forward? Am I being to hard?  Well, let me tell you just two of the things which bothered me about this film.  The aliens are eliminating people, city by city.  Presumably, millions are dead.  Current projections, they will win in four days - killing everyone.  But a scientist, played pitfully by Jeff Goldblum, does not want to use atomic weapons because it might pollute and thus eventually destroy the environment.  Are people really this dumb?  Or how about this, the aliens have some type of super technology that is above anything here on earth.  Our weapons cann't effect them at all. Even our atomic weapons, J. Goldblum loses that argument, fail. Yet somehow, he can interface with their computers with an ordinary apple computer.   Do I really need to say more?  The story, as far as it goes, gets a "1" from me.  The special effects, a 6, thus the 2 rating.  I have actually watched portions of this DVD more then once, because I enjoy the effects.  Expect nothing by way of story, and you might enjoy it.
