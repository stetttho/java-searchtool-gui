 They say you should never judge a book by its cover and, boy is that the truth with this book.  I had bought this book so I could learn the rules of the writing contest but for six months I  never bothered to read it.  It looked, on the outside, very campy and silly.   I didn't want to admit to anyone that I would read such a book.  Recently, however, I was home alone and bored.  I had nothing new to read, so I took a look. This book was great!  A lot of credit must be given the editors who went through, they say, 10,000 submissions to come up with this book, the best of the lot.  Star Trek III, Strange New Worlds, is broken into four parts to reflect the four different shows.  From Star Trek to Voyager, we are treated to stories featuring all of our favorite characters. I was most surprised by how consistently good the stories were.  While there were one or two flops, most of the tales here are very interesting.  About half of them were insights into stories we have already seen.  So, for example, in the movie "First Contact" Lt. Hawk died after becoming a Borg.  What really happened to him?  Now we know.   The other stories were totally originally. My favorite stories were found in the Generations and Deep Space Nine Section.  I especially liked the return of Mr. Barclay and Mr. Moriarty.   My only real complaint, a small one, was my strong disagreement with the stories awarded 1st, 2nd and 3rd prizes.  The second place winner was great.  The other two were not as good or original as many of the great finds in this book.  Still, since most of the stories were so good, I can see how the editors could have made this mistake.   "Strange New Worlds," misnamed since it is really about returning old familiar ones, is a fun read.
