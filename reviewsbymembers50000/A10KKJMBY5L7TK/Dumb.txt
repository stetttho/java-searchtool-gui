 Have you ever seen a movie where you want the hero to die?  No? Watch "The Abyss" and you will.  Anything to end this film more quickly. What was really diappointing is that it was made by James Cameron.  Having seen the Terminator, which I loved, I find it hard to see how both films could have been made by the same man.  Well, this was one of his earlier works.  Thankfully, he learned from his mistakes.   Now, why was the movie so bad?  The plot is okay, maybe a little standard.  An unknown object is found under the water.  Some explorers go to investigate and find something very unusual.  They dig deeper and discover that it appears to be a craft of some sort.  No problem here. The problem comes from two or three different areas.  The acting was poor.  Sorry, but if the actors do a bad job, how can we enjoy any movie? The sub-plots were annoying.  For example, one of the divers is divorced? from his wife, who happens to come about his ship.  Of course, she is supposed to be a hard women, but he still loves her.  Later in this movie his love for her, in a way, saves his life - in the dumbest way possible.  Finally, the "mystery" wasn't.  Everyone knows what the answer to it is at the beginning of the movie.  I was waiting, hopefully, for something else to happen.  It never does. Why two stars?  First, don't let my genoristy mislead you.  Skip this film.  But, today is Christmas.  More to the point, the special effects are interesting.  I also thought the this movie was okay for about 30 minutes.  Then it falls into cliches.  So, it wasn't a total failure (i.e. 1 star), but it certainly was below average and a bore.
