 An emotional Vulcan leads a diverse group of utopians, including a Klingon General, towards Eden.  To get there, though, they first have to hijack the Enterprise, probably the least secure ship in the Universe.  Not that I am counting but I remember, among others,  Khan, Rojan and Harry Mudd (at least his robot) taking over the Enterprise.  Many of the ships crew actually join the utopians as the Vulcan leader, Sybok, exerts a type of mind control/influence.  Sybok  is Spock's brother.   Sybok takes the Enterprise through Klingon space towards its rendevous with "God."  In a galaxy which contained the Organians, the Squire of Gothos, and so many other powerful parties, there is nothing in this film to tell us why this entity deserves to worship.  Sybok remains convinced.  Eluding a wild Klingon captain who wants the "glory" of killing Kirk, the Enterprise stays one step ahead of destruction as it approaches the Utopians destination. Star Trek V deservedly is ranked as one of the worst, or the worst, film in this series.  This film is no better then the original episode where a different set of "Utopians" found that "Eden" had poison fruit and acid on the ground.  To get to this Eden to, by the way, they had also had to go through restricted space.  While I am told that there a new ideas out there, even if true, do we had to go back to old bad ones?   I can not recommend this film to anyone.  The acting, directing, special effects and editing were all bad.  The story was worse.  A big zero, this movie needs to be avoided as much as William Shatner's singing.  Don't go.
