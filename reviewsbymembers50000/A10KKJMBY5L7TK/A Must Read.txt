 Richard Rahl is back and the war with the Order continues.  This time the evil Emperor Jajang has unleashed a horrible plague.   The plague itself is not magic, but the way it was released was.  To combat it, Lord Rahl must find the "Temple of the Winds" where all the knowledge from the past is stored. In the meantime, Jajang has sent an assassin to kill Richard.  Nathan is on the loose and Ann and the Sisters of Light are back as well.  Of all the books in this series to date, this is my favorite.  It has a good comination of humor, horror and magic. At the same time, the author has some underlying views which come out nicely in the book and make it more enjoyable.   I don't think I can add much more to the other review found here, but I would like to strongly recommend this book.  Great fun.
