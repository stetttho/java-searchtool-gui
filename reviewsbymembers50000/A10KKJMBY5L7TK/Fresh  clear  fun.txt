 It is interesting how the great science fiction writers help mold the future even as they write about it.  In, I, Robot, Assimov gives us a collection of interesting tales about humanoid robots in the future.  Robots that look like people, are mobile, and perform a variety of jobs. Today, we still don't have robots of this level, but many people seem to be working towards it. What would we do, what should we do, if such robots are ever created?  Unlike many writers, Assimov sees the great potentinal for mankind, if these robots are created.  Robots, like anything else, are tools.  If you properly design them, we don't need to fear the future, we can look forward to it with great glee.  So, as compared to movies like the "Terminator", I, Robot is really a very nice, optomistic view of the future. Still, there are problems.  In particular, I, Robot, talks about the three laws of robotics.  Robots shall not harm humans.  Robots shall obey humans, unless it harms them.  Robots shall protect themselves from harm, unless it harms humans or means disobeying them. From these three simple rules, Assimov has created quite a few beautiful, and compelling, stories.  Each story is first a work of logic as Assimov explores the limits of logic with each tale.  Each story is, in their own way, a bit of a detective story too.  The reader has a chance to solve each mystery, if he or she takes the time to think, which is the best reason to read them. Assimov never takes the easy way out.  Every story here is easy to read, clear, and very fun.  I, Robot, is the same quality as the first three Foundation Stories.  Eventually, unfortunately, Assimov combined these two story lines.  If you read I, Robot here, in its "pure" form, you will be amazed by this book's strength.  It is as good as science fiction writing can be.  Enjoy.
