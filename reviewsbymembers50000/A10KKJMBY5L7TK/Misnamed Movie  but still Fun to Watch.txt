 "The Patriot" is the story of a family during the American Revolution.  One man, the Patriot, has to care for seven children in the midst of this war.  He does not want to fight in this War.  He, of course, is Mel Gibson. As the war progesses, however, he finds himself drawn into the conflict to protect his family.  That's is why, in my view, this movie is misnamed.  The hero did not fight for America, he fought for his family.  Nothing wrong with that, of course, but the title may mislead you when you see the film.  For me, this is important.  I like all different kinds of movies.  But, when I want to see a "Patriotic movie", it can be disappointing if it is about something else.  With that caveat, the movie is well done.  It is not as good or as inspirational as "Braveheart", but it far better then most of the films out there.   Indeed, if you saw Braveheart, don't expect that kind of film here.   The Patriot, is a family/revenge story, not a story about patriotism in a war.
