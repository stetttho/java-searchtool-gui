 Three stories in one, all on a common theme, the war or series of wars between Man and a Catlike Creature, the  Kzin.  How much you like each particular story will depend on how much you like that particular writer. The first story shows great promise and potential.  It is interesting for two reasons, the Kzin and the humans.  In particular, we get an interesting insight into the Kzin and an equally interesting insight into humans of the future, in some ways, as alien to us as the Kzin are. The humans, in particular, are pacifists.  They wander the reaches of space unarmed and untrained in fighting or combat.  They have not even fought a war in almost three hundred years.  In some new area of the galaxy they find a Kzin crew, breed to fight and kill, constantly at war throughout most of their history. Can a pacifist people, humans, fight and survive against such natural warriors, trained to perfection?  It seems like an interesting question.  The assumption is that the people will lose much, at first.  If they can learn, however, then the Kzin will be in trouble. The problem is, however, that while the first story shows this great potential, the next two, of three, weren't that interesting.  Instead of exploring the issues developed in story 1, they talk about unconnected incident which occur after two or three great wars have occurred.  All of the interesting conflicts I was hoping to see, they never materialized.  Instead, they have already been resolved by time we get to the second story.  Too bad. As such, I would strongly recommend the first story.  Story 2 and Story 3, they were average.  I think the series shows some potential though and I will look at the other books in it.  This one here, as a whole, isn't good enough to recommend.  If you can read the first story on its own, however, do so.  You should enjoy it.
