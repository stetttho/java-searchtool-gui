 Fast paced action, spectular special effects, and a story which brings out the best in all of the cast, this is the best  Star Trek movie since "Wraith of Khan."  While difficult to compare, I think "First Contact" is actually better because it was more original and had more depth.   In "First Contact", the Earth is being invaded again by the Borg.  Picard and his crew are excluded from the fight.  Star Fleet Command believes that Picard may be too emotional in any such fight.  Left on the edge of the nuetral zone, (the space between the Romulans and the Federation) the crew of the Enterprise listens in dispair to the battle reports coming in from Star Fleet Command.  Deciding to disregard his orders, Picard warps to the battle.   This is where the story gets interesting.  We learn that the "Borg" isn't exactly a collective as we have previously believed.  Instead the Borg is more like a hive.  It has a queen who makes all of the decisions and drones who carry them out.  In some ways, this makes the "Borg" worse.  When one is assimilated, they don't really become one of the whole, they become a slave to the Queen. This Queen is one nasty women.  Her invasion of Earth failing in the present, she travels back in time to beat it in the past.  She succeeds.  Only the Enterprise, stuck in "time flux", can do something about it.  Otherwise all of Earth, forever, will be a loyal part of the Borg Empire. The struggle to counter the damage done in the past pits an outnumbered Borg against the Enterpise Crew and, later,an outnumbered Crew against Borg Drones.  In "First Contact", we see Picard enraged as he fights to save the Enterprise and the Earth from an eternity of slavery.  With real tension as the form of the final outcome is always in doubt, great, and believable shows of loyality between the crew, visits from many of out favorite Star Trek characters, lovely surprises, and even a visit to the "holo-deck", this movie is Star Trek heaven.  Superb.
