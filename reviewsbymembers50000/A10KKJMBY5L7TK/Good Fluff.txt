 I had fun reading this book, but it really is far fetched. Never mind the basic premise, that a small American town is transported back in time and place to 1632 Germany, to be in the middle of the 30-year war. You have to accept that premise or you wouldn't even start this book.  No, what is unbelievable is how smoothly everything seems to go for the characters. Without spoiling the story, there never is any tension in the read, because you know who will win and that no one important will be hurt. That is not always bad. Sometimes it is fun to read a good romp. But, if you buy this book, don't expect a Turtledove "Guns of the South", for example, where the history is very accurate and story is so serious. Although, to be honest, I liked the "light" approach.  This story, about how good America is and how Universal are its values, was nice to read. Transported back in the middle of a war; this little American town becomes a beacon for Germans, Jews and even Swedes. As the town grows in population, it grows in power. Eventually it becomes a key player in the 30-year war due to its modern technology.  One of the potential key issues is how religious fanatics would view this strange town. But after the King, for example, sees a cheerleader turned Markswomen (Julie); he refuses to believe someone so spunky could be a witch. Really? Well, like I said it is fluff. Fun fluff, but fluff.  Another issue is whether or not the Americans can turn the tide in this war before they lose the best of their modern technology. The way the story ends, there could be a sequel where this issue is better developed. Overall, if you like history and want a fun read, I think you will enjoy 1632. Just be clear on what to expect. Enjoy.
