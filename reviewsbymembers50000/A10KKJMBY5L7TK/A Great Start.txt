 The Eye at the End of the World is a good blend of the traditional elements of a fantasy combined with the some new twists.  The result is an extremely interesting book which is very enjoyable. For the traditional, like most fantasy books, the hero is from a small country town, far from the center of power.  He does not want, or seek power, but events overtake him and he is forced to first flee, and then fight against "dark forces."  The hero, there are actually several heroes and heroines, but the center person is a boy called Rand.  All Rand wants to do is live in peace, as a sheepherder, with his father. The twists, and there are many, make this book much more interesting and believable.  Rand, first of all, had to live in a small town.  If he had lived in the big cities, he would have been found and, most likely, killed.  That is because, in this world, men with magic go crazy.  And Rand, unlike most heros, may have a natural ability to do magic.   For me, however, the real magic of this book was the writing.  Rand is a young man.  He gets very excited when he meets a "witch", he is very scared when a trolloc, a monster, comes after him, and he is overwhelmingly concerned when his father is sick.  All of these are the natural expected emotions.  The way it is written, makes is interesting. Many times a hero will start out a young boy and end up some type of superstar warrior knight.  Rand is always a young man. He shows some growth, but he is young when this book starts, and he is still young, more mature, but still young when the book ends.   And Rand, is only one of the many interesting people in this novel.  Everyone of them are well developed and interesting. In other words, in this book, people matter.  The writer has remembered that when we care about the people we care about what happens to them.  From the start, you will care about these people and you will enjoy this book.  A very good job.
