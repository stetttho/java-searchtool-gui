 Wow.  I started to read this book because of the reviews on the back.  What a mistake that was.  This book reminded me of the worst classes I had back in College.  I can still remember droll coming out of mouths of half the students as they struggled for the power to stay awake while some boring teacher lectured us on a topic which was only interesting to him.   This book is like that.  It is boring, boring, boring, and uninteresting to boot.  (If there is such a distinction.)  The thesis of this book is that long before the revolution began, people in England and America saw it coming.  It almost seemed inevitable even 100 years before it actually started. Mr. Drapers uses old pamphlets to support his position.  Its not enough that he use one, by the way, if he can use five to say THE SAME THING.  Of course, all of these pamphlets were written in the Queen's English, as it was 350 years ago.  Egad!  What a drag.  I honestly don't know how this book ended, although I pretty sure the Americans won that war.  My recommendation?  Don't buy this one.  If you really want it though, I have one still at home, hardly used.
