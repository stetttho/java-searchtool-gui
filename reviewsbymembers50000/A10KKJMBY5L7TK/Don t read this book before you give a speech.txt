 Lend Me Your Ears is a collection of speeches, based on topic, from Ancient Greece to Modern America.  It is edited by William Safire, an old speech writer for Nixon.  Still active in the field, William Safire has some good insight into what makes a great speech and how we can learn from the masters. In particular, each topic and each speech has an introduction by Mr Safire.  In his introduction he explains the background of the speech,why this particular speech is important, and what makes this speech, in his view, so good.  For the most part, the book is very well done.   I liked his comments and actually have adopted some of his suggestions for my own speeches.  (I am an attorney. I would warn the casual speaker that nothing is worse then read the "best speeches of all time" right before your own presentaton.  I made that mistake, once.)   Why not five stars?  I thought he could have made some better selections.  In particular, he focused heavily on modern America and our politiicans.  I am sure, based on his audience, this was/is a smart move.  By doing so, however, he deleted some speeches that had more impact, more relevence, and more interest to this reader.  Still, this is a minor critic.  It is a good book, just not a five star one.
