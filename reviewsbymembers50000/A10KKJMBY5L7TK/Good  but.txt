 Fun, fast paced, with new charactors to love and hate, the Dragon Reborn is the third book in this series.  If you haven't read the first two, first, you should.  This series builds on itself.  It is not self contained.  As such, if you start here, you may be a little confused. If you have read the first two parts, you should read this one too.  In, the Dragon Reborn, the question asked and answered in the first book, who is the Dragon, is finally answered more completely here.   In a southern land, Tear, there is a castle with relics of magic.  Ironically, in Tear, magic is disliked, on a good day.    However, it is in Tear that Callander, "the sword which is not a sword" can be found.  This sword, which will amplify the power of its possessor, is stuck in a stone like the King Arthur story.  Whoever pulls out this sword, is not the king, but the "Dragon".  I thought that this part of the story was weak.  We already know who the Dragon is, and I would hope that the author could have come up with something more original. Along the way to the sword, however, alot of interesting things happen.  The Forsaken are stronger and acting against Rand and our heroes.  The Aiel, warriors from the desert, are back and may be going to war again.  Perrin finds more wolf-brothers, some who may have taken their link with wolves to far.  Morraine has learned how to take apart time.  Matt is back, fighting and wenching.  Elayne and Nynave are chasing the black Ajah, who may be chasing them.   With some much story, there should be enough here for any fantasy lover.  Mr. Jordan has continued a great tradition and has written a very good book.
