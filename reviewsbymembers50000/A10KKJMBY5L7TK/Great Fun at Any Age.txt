 I first read this book when I was 12 or 13.  It was great.  I recently have re-read it, at age 33, and it is still a good read.  A Spell for Chameleon is one of Mr. Anthony's best books even after 20 years as a writer and well worth the read for anyone interesting in magic or fantasy. In particular, the story centers on a young man named "Bink."  In any other world, Bink would have it made.  He is young, strong, a good fighter, and good looking.  He has a beautiful girl and a good family.   Unfortunately, Bink lives in Xanth, a land of magic.  In Xanth magic is so common that those without it seems strange.  Indeed to be a human without magic, is to be a human who eventually will be expelled from Xanth.  Bink does have magic, he just doesn't know what it is.  As such, he is to be expelled from Xanth to a mundane world without magic. In his adventures, he comes across a magician who controls the weather, another who can transform people to any creature at any time, and still another who is a master of illusions.  He fights with dragons and giant worms, flees from hungry plants, and eventually comes entangled in a plot to overthown the current king. Along the way, he makes friends, falls in love, and, eventually, learns what his magic talent is. A Spell for Chameleon is everything a fantasy book should be.  It has adventure, romance, irony, and monsters.  It is light hearted and a pleasant read.  I enjoyed it very much and, if you like fantasy books, I think you will too.
