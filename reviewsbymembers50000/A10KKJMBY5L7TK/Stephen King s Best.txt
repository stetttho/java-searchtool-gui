 Stephen King, the king of horror, has wasted his talents. He should have focused on fiction as the Shawshank Redemption was one of the finest films I have ever seen.  Mind you, I have liked other movies adapted from his book too (The Stand comes to Mind), but I can think of no other movie which made me think and care more about its characters, then this film.  Both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freedman also deserve acclaim too.  They did fantastic jobs. Robbins, in particular, plays a banker, Andy Dufrane, convicted of killing his wife and her lover.  He is sentenced to a double life term, but his still proclaims his innoncent. Upon his arrival at Shawshank Prison, he is still in shock about his wife's death.   He learns that most of the people there are what you would expect.  They are horrible human beings.  This includes the inmates and the guards.  Cruel sadists without mercy, the people in prison pray upon the weak.  If you are lucky, you may only be beaten once or twice.  For those who aren't so lucky, the daily rapes are part of the territory. While most of the inmates deserve to be there, should they be treated like this?  Yet, sometimes, even the guily grow, even in this enviroment.  Morgan, in particular, plays a middle age black man who murdered some people in his youth.  After 20 of more years in prison he is a good person, a loyal friend. This is Andy Durfrane's new life.  Good or bad, he is stuck there.  Years later, taking advantage of an opportunity, and risking his death, Mr. Dufrane becomes useful to one of the guards, and his friends, and, eventually, the warden.  He has a new purpose in life and, even in prison, he becomes someone who matters. That is the main theme of this movie, hope.  People can change, people can grow, people can be redeemed. Even in the worst environments, you have opportunities.  With some nice twists, an interesting ending, and beautiful writing, I think this film (DVD) was one of the best of the last ten years.
