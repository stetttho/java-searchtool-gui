 Mr. Carnegie's first book, How to Make Friends and Influence People, is one of my favorites.  I would highly recommend it.  This book, his second, is also good and well worth reading.   Its approach is similiar to his first book.  Mr. Carnegie argues by example. He talks about how different people have improved their lives and gives examples from their experiences.  Most of the stories are very moving and inspirational. The writing style is also easy to read and enjoyable.  The truth is, however, that some of the stories actually depressed me.  I also am so familiar with his first book that is was hard to add to it.  But, there is much here to recommend about this book.  It is a worthy self help book, one that you should buy if you worry too much or are depressed.  A book that says it will help you "start living" and does.  Impressive.
