 Mr. Foonberg writes well, but most of what he says does not make sense.   Worse still, I found alot of his advice was old and outdated, even if you wanted to follow it.  The problem is,if you want to start your own practice, where can you go for advice?  Since there aren't many books in this field,  Mr. Foonberg seems to have corned the market himself.  As such, many attorneys seem to buy this book, because there isn't any other choice.  There is. The truth is, as a sole practioner or partner, you have the same problems in law, as you would in other businesses.  You need to find and keep clients.  The better bet, and the stronger advice, can be found in business books.  There are alot of books on how to succeed in business.   My advice is to read those.  You will get more mileage, and better business tips, then found here.
