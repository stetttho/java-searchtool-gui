 Tai-pan is a historical fictional novel.  It takes the reader back in time when Englishmen first were coming to China.  A "Tai-pan" was a leader.  Like leaders in all places and times, those who would be leaders here have more risks and rewards, then the common man.   This is the story of one such leader, a very uncommon man, a trader who son has suddenly come to him from England.  As such, while he is struggling with his competion, and the Chinese, he is also struggling with his willful son. The story, by itself, is well written and very interesting.  For me, what made it fascinating, was the detail about the culture and times, in which, it occurred.  For example, we learn that Chinesse women liked to paint their teeth black - to be sexy.  They also brushed their teeth, with tea.  Strange as it sounds, it was better then the English, who did not brush at all and usually lost them all by age 30.   Where does Clavell get these facts?  I don't know if everything he wrote, as such, is true.  But, based on the way it was written, it certainly seems to be the case.  These details, which flow from this book, add to its charm and made the read one of the more enjoyable experiences I have had in years.
