 Whatever you thought of this movie, the music was definitely good. You can listen to this C.D. as a "best of" the 80s new wave/punk rock. Or, if you were a fan of the film, you can enjoy the music and relive parts of the film at the same time.  Just looking at the songs listed, many should sound familiar to you, some may not. Many of these songs were from "one hit wonder" bands who struck gold with their songs here, and never again. As such, it was never worth it for me to buy the whole album in the past. Together here, it is a great deal.  If you're not sure of some of the songs here, but you do see one or two you like, buy this C.D. All of the music found here is of the same quality. That is the best part of this C.D. You will enjoy the songs you remember. You will also enjoy the songs whose names you didn't remember, but the tunes will be familiar. Valley Girl, the C.D., is a great buy. For sure.
