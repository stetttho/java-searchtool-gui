 The Mummy is the story of a priest who is  executed after killing the Pharoah 3000 years ago.  He is locked in a coffin and eaten alive (we don't see the actually eating) by little bugs called "scarabs."  Cursed with an eternity of living death, he whole tombsite is buried in the desert.  Anyone who finds this Mummy will be cursed and "may destroy the earth".  Since the "curse" was over 3000 years ago, and since his tomb is reportedly filled with gold and treasures, there are a few people who will risk the curse for the gold.   What follows is fun.  It is a tongue in check, whimsical approach at this classic subject.  Great action, fast paced, with fun for most of the family; I think most people who watch it will probably enjoy it, if you know what to expect.  This is not a horror movie.  Instead the film makers made a deliberate choice to make an action movie, which pokes fun at itself and its audience.  The only other movie I have seen, similiar in style and substance to The Mummy would be "Bordello of Blood".  "The Mummy" doesn't have any nudity, and the violence is a little less graphic, but the special effects are better.  I think anyone from 10 years old or up, who likes horror movies, or science fiction, will enjoy this film.
