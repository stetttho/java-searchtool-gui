 Describing or reading a speech is like describing color.  I guess you can do it, but nothing is the same as being there and listening and experience a great speech.  There is a poetry to the delivery which is missing from a dry read.  Yet, if you want to read some of the great closes from the past, this is a good place to start. This books picks 10 closing arguements which the authors state are the greatest of history.  Whenever you have such a book, of course, people will differ on which closes should be included.  By necessity, for mass appeal, oftentimes "famous" speeches, which may not be so great will be included while less famous speeches, which were much better, will not be the cut.  I thought the ones chosen, overall, were very good. Personally I liked the ones I read. My favorite was Clarance Darrow's close in the Leopald and Loeb case.  It was great because it was effective.  Everyone in this case knew they were guilty and wanted them to die.  How did Clarence Darrow change the judges mind?  It was in his words and his delivery.  This was an effective speech. There are others here which I also found very good.  We hear the closing speech from the Nuremberg trials (which I would not have included because I think the win was almost preordained), the close in the Karen Silkwood civil case, the DeLorean defense close and six others.  This is a good book and a good read.  I would recommend it most to history fans, but I think some of the general public would also enjoy it.
