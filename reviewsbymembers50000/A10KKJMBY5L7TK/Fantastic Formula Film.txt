 This film has nothing new in it, but nothing new is required.   If you think about it, aren't most of the James Bond movies, for example, very similiar.  Yet most of them are still very good.   Same concept here.   This is a typical disaster story where something is going to destroy the earth.  (Here, it is an asteroid flying through space) We find some heroes, rebellious drillers and miners of all things, who may be able to save the planet.  They, however, are impeded by stupid  government agents who don't understand the job, or what needs to be done.   Since the end of the story is really never in serious doubt, (how many of you think James Bond will ever lose?) it is how the story is told which makes the difference.  Here we have great special effects, a good sound track including some nice Aerosmith tunes, and Bruce Willis.   The drama overall is good, the comedy is overplayed a little, but it adds to the fun of the movie.  If you want a good night of fun, not much serious thought, this is your movie.  However, if you want a more dramatic and "realistic" view of this particular scenario, get "Deep Impact."  That one is not funny, but it very well made.
