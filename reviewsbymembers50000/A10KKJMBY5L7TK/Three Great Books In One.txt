 Inherit the Stars starts on the moon sometime in the near future when astronauts find a dead body human body 1000's of years old.  How did it get there?  How could it be there?  No one knows.   The writer then procedes, step by step, to explain how this could have happened.  His science is so strong that, if I read this a few years in the future, I might believe it was actually happening.  While the end of the book takes a few leaps of faith, (pun is intended), it all seems amazing real.  It is a fun adventure written in the best traditions of science fiction. The second book here, there are three in one combined in this book, is also great.  It is a story about our first contact with creatures from another planet.  Because these creatures had such a different evolutionary path from us, they are as much different, intellectually, as in their appearance.   The big difference in this story, as opposed to most science fiction, is how nice these aliens are.  Earth falls in love with them and you will too.  The writing, extremely optimistic about human nature, was a nice change of pace from most books of the genre.  Since the violence here is at a minimum, the author uses a few interesting mysteries, unresolved from the first book, to maintain the series pace and tension. The final installment in this series was fun too, but it took a different tact.  The optimism expressed so nicely in the first two books is lost here.  This world has government conspiracies and aggressive alien races.  Violence, or its threat, is finally found in the series.   The science, as well, is a little closer to fantasy then science fiction.  The first book "could" happen, at least it seems that way.  The second story is a fantasy, but its discussions about evolution was great.  The last book would be good anywhere, it jsut didn't fit in very well with the series.  All are good though.  All of them are worth reading.
