 I am an attorney who defends people accused of driving under the influence in California.  This review assumes that you are also an attorney, not necessarily in California. As any attorney will know the laws of one state are not binding, although they may be influencial.  Mr. Taylor's book has an excellent overview of the laws of th 50 states. I read this book and learned alot about how I could defend my clients better.  Unfortately, DUI laws change more then most.  The laws cited here, even when they were applicable to California were old.  While you can update them in your library, I would prefer a book where I didn't have to do that as often.  As such, I would recommend this book, as one of many, to give you an idea about the general state of the laws and some ideas about human chemistry/biology.  But, for a practical guide, I would recommmend his other book "tailored" for California.  Still it is a good book, it is well written, and I do recommend it.
