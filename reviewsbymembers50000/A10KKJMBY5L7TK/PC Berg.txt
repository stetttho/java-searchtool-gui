 This DVD has good action scenes and is faithful to the novel, the Killer Angels, upon which it is based.  Gettysberg, however, is too long (four hours?), suffers from cheap costumes, including beards that almost fall off the actors, and a gross distortion of the racial elements of history.   That is, if this movie had machine guns used in the battle scenes, everyone would be outraged.  Yet, during the Civil War, a war in which race certainly played an important part, all of the actors call black people "darkies."  No, I don't want to hear foul language throughout the film.  But I would have preferred to have no black actors in the film, then to have a film where they were all treated so wholesomely.  In my view, it was almost as bad as having those machine guns in place. Finally, even without these flaws, I think the acting in the movie was quite bad. I didn't find Chamberlein to be very inspiring which, based on his history, I think he was.  I didn't like! Sheen's portrayal of General Lee.  I didn't like Pickett.   So, for me, this movie was bad all around.  I know others love this film.  I can't understand why.
