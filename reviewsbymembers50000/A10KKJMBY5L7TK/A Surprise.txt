 Stranded on a planet with two suns after their ships crashes, a varied group of survivors including a Mullah and some of his followers, a bounty hunter, a genetically altered criminal, an art dealer, and a little boy struggle for survival.  At first, their biggest dilema is surviving the heat and finding water.  If only it was a little cooler, perhaps if both suns would set?  Unfortunately, this does not happen.  The only time there is darkness on this planet is an lunar eclipse -which happens once every 22 years.   This group eventually finds an abandoned science expedition, and some abandoned ships. They also find the remains of that expedition.  Something apparently ate them alive twenty two years ago, during the last lunar eclipse. The natural tension between this diverse group begins to explode into minor outbreaks of violence.  Then, one of the survivors is butchered.  Who is the killer?  In addition, creatures, who are unseen for most of the movie, but whose presence is always felt are soon discovered.  These creatures are deadly, but stay underground and away from the dual suns found on the planet's surface.  Added to this tension, the navigator makes an important discovery, a lunar eclispe is coming very soon.  It will soon be "pitch black" everywhere. Pitch Black does a great job building the story at a good pace.  The tension is believable as the remaining survivors fight for their lives.  Nor does the story take most of the convential, easy ways out.  For example, people who hate each other before they are attacked by these creatues, still hate each afterwards.  This causes problems for their survival. With good special effects and actors who are well cast and do a good job, "Pitch Black" was a fun adventure/horror movie.  I enjoyed it.
