 This movie seems to have some dedicated fans and it may make you laugh once, or twice, but at what price?  It was advertised as an off the wall dark  comedy about a school election where a teacher gets involved and gets caught up in the craziness.  The teacher vs. the annoying student.   Instead, it is a dark and depressing film filled with sick and twisted characters...P>Still, properly done, I guess anything can be funny.  Here almost nothing was.    Failing to be funny, this film tried to somehow be "deep" or "dark."  It failed here too.  All we have is painful film where you don't know if you should feel bad for the characters or disgusted by them.  Even Reese Witherspoon, who does do a good job, can't redeem this nothing garbage.  You only have a limited time on Earth, save part of your precious minutes by avoiding this one.
