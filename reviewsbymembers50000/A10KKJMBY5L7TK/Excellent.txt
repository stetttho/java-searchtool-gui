 Jerry Maguire is a sweet romantic comedy about a sports agent who quits his job after he has a pang of conscious.  He brings with him two things; one employee and one client.  From this base Mr. Maguire is determined to build a business but he finds himself, instead, forming friendships with his clients and developing a romance with a young single mother, who is also his one employee. This movie has several parts, and all of them are good.  It is an honest attack on ruthless sports agents.  It is an advocacy piece for honest and fair business people.  It is an "inside" look on sports, from a different point of view. But, mainly and mostly, it is a romance and a comedy. The interaction between Jerry Maguire and all of those around him has its bumps and tensions, but they work them out.  The film has a happy ending, which made me happy too.  This film was fun, this film was honest, this film was a treat to watch.
