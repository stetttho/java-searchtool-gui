 I never thought natural history could be so interesting, or depressing.  On the one hand Bryson has a good wit and makes some topics which otherwise may be quite dry rather interesting.  He also has an interesting way of explaining science which, while it may not always be technically accurate, it does makes it much more accessible to the masses.  On the other hand, be it death from asteroids or the sun going Nova (things I think must of us were aware could happen) to the end of human society from Yellowstone erupting I have never read such a bleak book.  Worse each "worse case scenario" seems to be overdue.    We seem to be a few million years overdue for a big meteor collision.  Yellowstone, which Bryson describes as a "supervocano" erupts every 600,000 years or so.  As the last eruption was 630,000 years ago we, again, seem to be living on borrowed time.   And on and on it went, wow!  What a buzzkill.    This was actually the first science book I read that my wife forbid me to mention as each chapter seemed to harken a more grizzly end.  Worse, I go to Amazon and everyone who reviews it seems to think it is a happy book.  What am I missing?   This book was interesing as we learn about the people behind the science as well as the science itself.  But happy?  To anyone who thinks this is a "happy" book, I have only three words "decrease the medication."  Still, from any perspective, it is any interesting read even if, at times, it can be a depressing one.
