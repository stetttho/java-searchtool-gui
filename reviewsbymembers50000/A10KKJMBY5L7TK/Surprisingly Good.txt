 An ordinary man, a skeptic, who works for the phone company, nothing in Kevin Bacon's life has prepared him for the strange journey which begins after he is hypnotized at a local party.  He comes out of his trance, not remembering what happened while he was under.  Instead he remembers strange visions and memories of events and people he saw while hypnotized.   These memories haunt him.  At home, even after the party, he continues to hear, and see, strange things.  Flashes and dreams of the future, an instinct that something is very wrong in his neighborhood, visions of ghosts; a radical change in his life has begun. "Stir of Echos" is a surprising good film with strong performances from almost all of the actors.  The first thing I liked about it is, until mid-movie or more, it is unclear which direction this film will go.  At the same time, the people and events in the movie, until this time, are still interesting and fun to watch.  The mystery, what is happening, is the hook which helps pull us along. I won't spoil the surprises.  I will say that the ending, with one exception, was a strong finish.  It is too bad that "Stir of Echos" didn't do better in the movies as it was much better then most films out when it was released.  I  would recommend this film to anyone who likes more thoughtful horror films.  Indeed, for me, this was more of a drama with a horror background.   As for the DVD features, there isn't much here to be gained.  A few trailers don't make up for the extra price of a DVD.  If you are a purist, or can get it at a discount (which I did)  buy the DVD. Otherwise, the video is probably just as good.  Happy Shopping.
