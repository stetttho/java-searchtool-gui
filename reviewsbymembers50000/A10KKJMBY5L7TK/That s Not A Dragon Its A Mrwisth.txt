 Okay, Okay, I don't know how to spell that monster.  But, on the cover of this book there is a red creature which, I hoped, was Scarlet.  Scarlet, you may recall, was the Dragon in the first book.  What happened to her anyway?  In fact, the way Richard Rahl befriends animals, and the fact that he was a ranger, I thought he was going to be an "animal wizard."   Nope, he is still a war wizard, and it shows in this book.  There is more fighting and magic in this book then the first two.  We have new creatures and some old friends including Nathan, Zedd, Gaaarcth and Ann.  The writer has really reached his stride.  This book is better then the first two, and they were great.   There really is everything here.  Richard's romance with Kahlan continues and, perhaps, he has a new love.  We are introduced to a new villian who hunts down and kills people with magic.  There are some horrible, but great, battle scenes as some cites are sacked and the residents pay the price.  And, at the end of the book, there are two great epic battles - with Monsters.  If you don't like this book, you just don't like fantasy.   I like fantasy and, as I said I loved this book, it was simply great.
