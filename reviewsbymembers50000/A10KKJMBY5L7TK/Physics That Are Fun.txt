 I don't understand physics very well.  After reading this book, I think I understand physics better.  It can be a difficult topic and Mr. Rothman's presentation was very clear, easy to follow, and fun.  He has a good sense of humor which moves the book along and makes it much more enjoyable to read. In particular, in Instant Physics, Mr. Rothman covers a history of physics from the Ancient Greeks to the Modern World.  In Greece, Mr. Rothman details the mistakes they made, and the great breakthroughs.  He also takes the time to explain a little bit about the people who made these breakthroughs, and the events around them.  Basically the world we come from influences how we view the Universe.  Without changes in our world, many of the changes and advances in physics would not have happened.   Mr. Rothman has written a good book, which explains physics well.
