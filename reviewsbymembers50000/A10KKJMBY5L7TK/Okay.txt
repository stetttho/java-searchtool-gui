 Final destination is about a group of teenager destined for Paris.  Before the plane takes off one of them dreams that the plane will explode.  Scarred, he scares five or six other people badly enough to get off just before the plane explodes.  From there each of the survivors are stalked by something, death perhaps? My problem with the film is twofold.  First, the film spends alot of time on a side plot focusing in on the F.B.I.  I guess the F.B.I. originally was put there to confuse the audience.  Is death really stalking these people, or is it a young wild evil boy?  Since the movie never really put this in doubt, the scenes with the F.B.I. don't add anything to the film. Second, two of the survivors hate the hero.  Why?  Because he scarred them, I guess.  This really goes back to the F.B.I. sub-plot.  If they thought that he might have blown the plane up, then their fear of him, or hatred, would make more sense. Since they don't seem to believe that, their attitudes are very confusing and unclear.  The timing also doesn't make any sense. The town has 39 days before the killing begins.  Again, why?  Why not 2 days or 100?  Usually these films try to give some explanation for its events.  This film gives almost none. Still, strangely, I liked the DVD more then my review indicates.  I think I liked the concept.  I was disappointed in how it ultimately played out, but I like new and different thinking.  In addition, the DVD itself has a couple of fun extras.  Under games, you can test yourself and see if you are psyhic.  You can also learn when you are going to die.  The DVD also has 4 scene that were cut out of the film.  Instead of making us watch a "director cut", you can just watch the extra scenes at the end.  I liked that alot.  (By the way, I think it was better that they left these scense out.)  Overall I would give the movie a 2, may 2.5 stars.  Since the features were fun, I have given the DVD a higher rating then I would give the film.
