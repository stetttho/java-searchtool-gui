 This book is boring, dull, uninteresting.  I liked the first parts of this series, I even gave them 4 or 5 stars.  This one would get none, if possible.  Literally, nothing happens.  Everyone is getting prepared for something, but that something never occurs.   It is disappointing because the author still has great talent and ideas.  If you only read the first and last chapters of this book, you will see that.  In fact, if you do read this book, that is the approach I would recommend because there is nothing of interest between them.  My best recommendation, though, is to skip this book and go on to another series or, the next book.  I can't imagine that you would miss much and, the way this series has become so repetitive, you probably will re-read most of this book there again anway.  A total waste of time.
