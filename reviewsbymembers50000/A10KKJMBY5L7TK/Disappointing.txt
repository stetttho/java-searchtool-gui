 James Hogan is  probably the best science fiction writer alive.  He has a solid understanding of science and usually researches his topic well.  He also has a knack for taking a known fact and asking the simple questions whose answers are often more complicated then one would believe.  My personal favorite from Mr. Hogan was the "Gentle Giant" series where Mr. Hogan asked why is the farside of the moon so different from the nearside? The answer was a classic series, some great books. In "Paths to Otherwhere," Mr. Hogan explores quantum physics and other realities.  In "Paths to Otherwhere" a group of scientists discovery a way to channel themselves into the bodies of people living on other worlds parallel to our own.  These people are "duplicates" of the scientist living here.  Unfortunately, as compared to his other books, the science here is very weak.   This could be a book on demon possession as easily as a science ficton. Worse, demon possession may actually be more believable.  Additionally, the story is weak.   Most of Mr. Hogan's writing has an element of governmental conspiracy.  Paths to Otherwhere is no exception.  Military conspiracy, here, is the central part of the story as evil military scientists want to abuse this new science.  Brave scientists attempt to defy this misuse of their findings, including a wise Buddhist man.  I never understood why negative racial stereotypes are forbidden while the positive ones are allowed.  Buddhist are no wiser then anyone else, they just pray differently. Anyway, I was very disappointed with this story.  It has all Mr. Hogan's weaknesses and none of his strengths.  If you love Mr. Hogan, you may like this book.  More likely, however, you will be disappointed.  "Paths to Otherewhere" was a weak book, not a very good read.
