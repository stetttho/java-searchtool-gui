 It has been said that great geniuses can make the complicated seem simple.  Oftentimes we see, for example, Olympic divers and gymnists perform miracles of dexterity which seem easy - until you try it. In the world of science, a gifted writer can make the most complicated idea seem simple, even though it is not.   Stephen Hawkins, reputed to be a genius, is not a gifted writer.  Mind you, this is not an attack on his scientific abilities - whatever they are.  This is a complaint about this book.  I simply didn't understand most of it.   Now, this could be because I am inept with physics.  I am.  Besides watching "Star Trek" a couple hundred times, my exposure to physics has been limited to riding rollercoasters and reading a few physics book jackets.  But this book was very hard to understand. I have read some of the reviews here, stating that Mr. Hawkins is very lucid and very clear. I could not disagree more.  This book is unclear and hard to understand.  If you want to impress your friends who haven't read this book or don't understand it, certainly you can buy "A Brief History of Time", put it in your bookshelf, and pretend to know what it says.   But, if like me, you simply want to learn more about modern physics, you should buy some other book, preferrable by someone else.
