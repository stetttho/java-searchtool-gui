 "Chasing Amy" is a cute romantic boy meets lesbian story.  Boy, of course, becomes intriqued with lesbian. Lesbian is interested in boy.  Friends on both sides are confused, angry or bitter. The lesbian friends feel strange that she is dating a man.   While she is not dating any of them, she seems to be betraying their life style.  That is, if homosexuality or lesbianism is a "choice", and not a biological condition.  I hear that some groups were angry about how this film portrayed homosexuality.   Thankfully, this film does not go into such issues.  This is not a "gay" film. Instead the "gay" issues are used to create a believable tension in the film which which are resolved along probable lines, in reality.   Along the way, we are introduced to some fun characters.  Joey Adams at Alyssa did a great job.  She reminds me of Renee Zellweger, whom I also like very much. Some of the other characters, from a young black gay man who pretends to be militant to the friend who sit there and almost never talks are actually sweet spices to this film.  I liked all of it.   More comedy, then romance, this film was worth seeing and almost "unique" among romance.  There was one other film made about 20 years ago, "A different story" which followed the same general lines.  It was also good, but "Chasing Amy" is better.   Recommended.
