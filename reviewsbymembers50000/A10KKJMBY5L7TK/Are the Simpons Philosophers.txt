 Homer as the wise old man?  On what planet?  The concept of a book of philosophy centered on the Simpsons may seem implausible - on a good day, but this collections of Essays describing how we can apply philosphy to the Simpons actually is quite good.  In a series of essays discussing Aristole to Nietzshe, we learn how talented writers can take the material they have and use it for a useful learning experience.   If you know nothing, or very little, about Socrates or Plato, is it because they don't have anything interesting or useful to say?  I say no.  If they had no use, they wouldn't have been read and discussed all these years.  The problem is teacher teach these subjects like it was still 1500 years B.C.   Enter this book.  Using a popular and funny show the writers can discuss how different philosophies apply.  Some of the articles, including the first one, are probably as funny as the show.  Others, well the quality varies.  Still, if you would like to have a little more insight into how some of this philosphers think, and and excuse to read more about the Simpsons, this book is for you. Entertaining and Educations, with the emphasis on educational, The Simpons and Philosophy is an interest diversion and overall, a good buy.
