 The Sixth Day is Arnold's best film since Terminator II.  While Terminator II had better effects, the 6'th Day is a more insightful and intelligent film which still delivers on the action front. Its basic premise is well known.  In the 6'th day human cloning is possible and practical, it is also illegal.  While cloning the biggest fish and fattest cattle has wiped out hunger, cloning of people has been declared illegal.   In this movie, much like reality, however, many people seek ways to skirt the law.  From a scientist, played by Robert Duvall, who wants to bring back his dead wife, to professional football teams that want to guarantee their investments; many people find reasons to illegally clone others. Because cloning is illegal though, what happens to a clone, if the process occurs anyway?  In this story, these clones can be legally "destroyed" (read killed)  This story centers on a man who was presumed dead and cloned so that no one would know a more famous person was also killed.  The problem is, however, that he is still alive. This is were the movie stays true to the action films that Arnold has made in the past.  There are enough car chases, explosions, and fights scenes to satifiy most action viewers.  Along the way this movie, for the most part, still remains a very smart film.   For example, there is a company called "re-pet" that can replace a dead pet with a clone, exactly like it. What are all of the ramifications for such a technology?  Well, both the good and bad are shown here.  The bad points, however, clearly outweight the good ones in the 6'th Day.   The only fault of the 6th day, for me, was the ending which was a little over done.  I think it was done that way, to satisfy Arnold's typical fans, but it didn't detract much from the overall film.  The 6'th Day is a very good film.  Thinking back, after Terminator II and maybe "Total Recall", this is Arnold's third best action film.  Watch it, enjoy it, and learn in the process.
