 Aliens are alive on Earth!  Disguised as normal people, they live normal lives, for the most part.  Like any group of people, um, intelligent creatures, most are good but - there are some bad ones out there.  M.I.B. tells the story of Earth's unofficial "alien police" who keep the "bad" aliens in line. In particular, M.I.B. tells the story of a new potential agent (Wil Smith) on his first case.  An assassin alien has come to Earth to kill the prince of an alien empire and steal a rare jewel.  Lead by a veteran agent played by Tommy Lee Jones, both agents try to save the prince and capture the assassin. During the chase, we are treated to the birth of an alien octupus, exposed to amazing technologies, and given "credible" explanation to some of the enduring mysteries of our time.  This movie delivers on both the action and comedy fronts.  It is funny on many levels, very enjoyable.  Usually I like to compare this movie to another because we all have different senses of humor, but it is hard to do here.  M.I.B. may not be unique, but I don't know of any films quite like it.   Recommended.
