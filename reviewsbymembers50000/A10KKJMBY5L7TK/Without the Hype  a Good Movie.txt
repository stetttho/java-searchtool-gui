 The Exorcist, The Omen, Rosemary's Baby, Stigmata, - stories of devils and demons are as old as man, and often a common theme in Hollywood.  In the "End of Days" we are treating to another story of Hell on Earth, this time the devil is here searching for his unwilling and reluctant wife.  If he finds her, it will be "The End of Days." As opposed to most "Devil Movies,"  this one is at least one half action film.  I guess, with Arnold in the credits, that was to be expected.  And to give this movie its due, it looks good.  The special effects and the action sequences are great.   If that is what you are expecting or want, you should enjoy this film. If you thought or hoped this film was scary, it really is not.  Who would be scarred with Arnold there to protect them? There are also some interesting ethical questions thrown in.  Would you kill one innocent person, to save millions?  Most people would say yes.   The hero in this movie says no, but he doesn't believe in the devil anyway.  The Pope, who knows what she is, also says no.   Who is being more heroic?  The Pope or the misguided hero?   Well, they both have their roles to play in this film.  "The End of Days" is a good film with some good performances from the supporting cast.  I liked the Devil, played by Gabriel Byrne.  There is also a good performance by an actress who plays a police detective also searching for the truth.
