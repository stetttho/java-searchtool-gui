 A great politician has to be able to relate to people.  Make them laugh, feel their pain, understand their wants and desires.   For the most part, however, a history book or text will only discuss the dry political or military parts of our leaders.  Here, at last, one can learn about the more "human" parts of our leaders, what makes them laugh.   In particular, in his third book,  Mr. Dole discusses how funny some of our leaders really were.  I especially enjoyed Lincoln's wit.  For example one general, apparently tired of Lincoln's interference and micro managing, sarcastically wired to Lincoln and informed him that he had captured six cows.        "What should I do now? He asked.       Lincoln wired back - "Milk them." Arranged by funniest too humorless, over and over this book can and probably will make you laugh and marvel at some of our prior leaders.  However, I would like to see a little better organization.  As it is, this book almost useless for a source book for speeches and the like as there is no indexing. In addition, what is here is good, but there isn't a lot.  As such, if you don't have a lot of money to spend, you may want to think twice before you purchase this book.  But, don't worry, Bob Dole doesn't need your money.  He is doing all those Viagra commercials.
