 This book, about a future war between Earth and a buglike race from  another planet, is really more about human alienation, the perils of youth,  and the strain of competition and command.   Ender (Andrew) Wiggins, a  young genius, is set out to train for combat and leadership in this war to  end all wars.  His life away from home and the sister he loves is lonely,  but he endures it as he goes through rigorous training intentionally  designed to isolate and alienate him from those around him even as it  prepares him for command of the human fleet and its fight for survival.  I  guess we have all gone through periods of depression and loneliness,   Ender's case is just more aggravated because parts of it are deliberately  imposed by the command structure at school.   He survives and thrives,  after a fashion and he does pay a price.   This internal struggle doesn't  take away from the battlescenes in this book, which are easy to follow,  built well, and capture our interest.  The politics and internal battles,  the battleroom training simulator, and Card's  vision of the future are all  also compelling.  If you want to read this book, on that level, you will  enjoy it. But if you take you time and enjoy this book on all it levels,  you will have a true treat.  Ender's Game is a serious work of literature  and well as a very good book.  A treat on every level.
