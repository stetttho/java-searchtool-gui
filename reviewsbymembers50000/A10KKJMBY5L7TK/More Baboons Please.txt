 A Primate's Memoir is an interesting coming of Age story with a twist, it last for about 21 years.  In it we learn about the customs of some of the African tribes, the naivety of a young doctor, and the universality of some human folies.  It is written in a clear style by a man with a good sense of humor which he frequently shares with the reader.  In between adventures of the author, we also learn about life among African baboons and the effects of stress on disease. I would have liked more baboons. I never knew that baboons would "join forces" to overthrown a tyrant or have sex with an unwilling female.    I also learned that some female baboons have preference amongs the men.  Unfortunately, there usually is a strict pecking order.  Some of the clever females will try to get the higher baboons to fight so that the female can be with the baboon of her choice.  The more I learned about these clever baboons, the more I wanted to know.  Unfortunately, too often the next chapter would be about another of the author's experiences with Africa life.  Good in and of themselves, they took away from the drama that is a baboon's life. More baboon and less of the author's life  would have made this a great book.  As it is, it is still interesting, just too short on the baboons.
