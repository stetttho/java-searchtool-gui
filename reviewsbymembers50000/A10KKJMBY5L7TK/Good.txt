 Gary Oldman is probably the best actor today.  In the Professional he again does a very good job.  This time he portrays a hit man who reluctantly saves the life of a little girl whose family has just been butchered.    This girl, now an orphan, begins to live with him.  This is this film's biggest flaw.  If you can believe that a hit man would care for an orphan, you will love this film.  If you think that such an action is too unbelievable, this film won't work.   I was in the middle.  On her first night there, he says tomorrow you must leave.  Instead, she stays.  Why?  Well, whatever the reason, from this point on he begins to teach her about his life.  Yet, in the process of teaching her how to kill, he begins to live again.   She, however, is a young girl. Repeatedly in this film she does dumb things which get them into trouble.  But, all of the things she does do, fit within the context of the film. Eventually there is a confrontation between him and her family's killers.  There are a few surprises here, but it is pretty predictable from this point on.  Overall, this film was a mixed bag.  The acting was great.  The effects were good.  The story?  That was its weak point.  This film isn't worth attacking, but it doesn't deserve much praise either.
