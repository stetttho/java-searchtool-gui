 In history class we used to talk about what if scenarios all the time. One of our favorites was, what if Cleopatra had a big fat nose.   In theory, Caesar wouldn't have fallen in love with her, taken her side in the Egyptian Civil War, or made her his concubine/wife.  It was fun, and interesting learning tool, but limited in applications; Cleopatra nose wasn't big and fat. In the hinge factor a former war correspondent talks about how such seemingly random and bizarre factors have changed history. From a wooden horse before Troy (arguably not a random factor since it was a deliberate plan) to a surprise killer bee attack against an army in the middle of a modern war, chance is sometimes the biggest factor in history.  Here, in addition to the stories referenced above, the author discusses how battles from the American Civil War to the Crimean War, WWII, Vietnam and many others were greatly altered by almost random acts. Telling you all the details of the stories ruins the fun of this book.  I will tell you some of the details of only one story, my favorite.  It was about how a drunken army actually lost a battle to themselves!  Better still, they only were drunk at that time by a chance meeting between themselves and some merchants and whores.   Every story here is very interesting, short, about 15 or 20 pages, clear, and a quick read.  You may actually end up believing that chance is the only element of war.  To be fair, "fortune favors the bold" as the saying goes.  I might add, and the well prepared.  Was it Pasteur who discovered one of his great breakthroughs by chance?  I just remember that when asked if he was "lucky" he replied that he was only lucky because he was trained enough and educated enough to be ready when this "lucky break" occurred.  So it is, even more so, with war.   Enjoy the Hinge Factor, a interesting read -until the end.
