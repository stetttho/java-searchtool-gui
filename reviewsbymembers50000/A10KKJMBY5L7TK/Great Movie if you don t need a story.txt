 The first film was okay but this one was worse.  In MI2, the effects and stunts are interestings and fun to watch, but don't mistake that with a good movie.   A good movie needs to have people whom we admire, or hate.  People that we care about, so we care what happens to them.  In MI2, no one is particularlly interesting and most of the actors are just a bunch of bores. If you want to see alot of people riding motorcycles and wearing plastic masks, you will love this film.  But if you want a story, a plot, or acting, you be better served by watching an old Star Trek cartoon.
