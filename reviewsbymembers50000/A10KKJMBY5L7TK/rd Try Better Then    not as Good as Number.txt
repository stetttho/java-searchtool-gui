 Civilization III takes enough from the older game that an experienced player will fill at home, but at a home where a lot of the furniture has been re-arranged.  As you get to know the game better, most of the changes will be more irritating then interesting and anyone on a tight budget should probably avoid this version until the price breaks in a year or two.  For those of you with extra time on hands, however, and a little bit more free cash, you probably could do worse.  Here are a few of the changes in this version: World Conquest?  Forget about it.  Movement is slowed in enemy territory, corruption takes away about 90% (or more) of your new cities capacities, and your conquered cities often rebel and go back to the deposed rule.  This, in particular can be very frustrating when all or most of your armies are there gathering for your next attack.  On the plus each Civilization has unique units which reflect their historic strengths.  As such, playing this game teaches you about history while requiring you to adjust your play according to which nation you lead. Wonder Hog?  Nope.  If you are like me, in Civ II you would try to get as many of the Wonders as possible. In Civ III, there are no caravans to help with your wonders. You can not cheat the system by having a city over produce shields   I could go on, but part of the fun of these games is learning the quirks on your own.   I can feel comfortable recommending Civ III, but is is wrong to to still look forward to number 4?
