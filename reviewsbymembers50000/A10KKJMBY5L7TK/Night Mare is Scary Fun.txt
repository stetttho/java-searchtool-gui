 Nightmare was a good read.  In it we have the point of view of a horse, not a human, not really a horse either.  In Xanth, bad dreams are not accidents but designed.  Special horses, night mares deliver them to Xanthians.  Bad dreams are lessons to Xanthians to punish them for acting badly.  What happens to a horse who no longer can deliver these night mares to others?  Why another Xanth novel of course.  Night mare is good and keeps the tradition of the early books.
