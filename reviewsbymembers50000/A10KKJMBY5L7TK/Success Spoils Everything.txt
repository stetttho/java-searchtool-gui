 In the beginning this series was tightly written and well edited.  With time, all successful authors (e.g. Tom Clancy) seem to throw off the shackles of an editor and make their books longer and more boring.  It is  unfortunate that Mr. Jordan has also fallen victim to his success.  This  book is to complicated and - on many points, to redundent.            If  you like the others books, I guess you should buy it, but don't expect  much.  Personally, I read every other book in this series and, except the  last one, I loved them.  "Daggers" was very disappointing and I  skipped several portions so I would finish it.          For me, this series  may have 10 more editions, but this was my last book.  If you have a  choice, read the new Richard Cyper book.  It is a little long too but, each  book is basically self contained.  Let's hope Mr. Jordan's next effort will  be better.
