 "The Thief's Gamble" is the story of a woman who is a thief.  Now, there are some books out there where we have women heros but ultimately they always seem to be written as men.  Give the heroine a man's name and the story would not change.  Here, Livak, is always a woman.  In that,  the author Juliet E. McKenna's writing style is almost unique.  At least, I have never seen read anything like it.   I really enjoyed learning about Livak and her adventures.  The fact that she was a she added to this book.  Especially since the author always remained true to her character. For example, when she is attacked, she doesn't overpower big men, she throws poison darts.  This made sense to me.  If a woman really wanted to be a thief, this is a reasonable way that she could survive. Indeed, Ms. McKenna continually takes chances and tries new things in this book.  In addition to a woman as the heroine, she switches from first person to third person continually.  As such, we get a personal insight into the story, while still receive a global view.   At first, this style was a little confusing, but I really began to enjoy it as the story goes on.  Livak, in particular, seems to have a real history, a real past.  We only get a glimpse of it, but we understand enough about her to understand why she is a thief.  As the story goes on, she becomes more real.  We care about her, so we care about the story.  Finally, the story gets better with each page.  I understand that this was Ms. McKenna's first effort.  Tremendous!   If she improves with the next book, this series could become a classic.  But, even if there are no improvements, it undoubtedly will be a story worth reading.
