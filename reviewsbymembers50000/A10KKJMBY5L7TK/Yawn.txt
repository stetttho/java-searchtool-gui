 I guess if you are nostalgic for Reagan, this book may make an interesting read.  It also may be a good primer for those of you too young to remember those times.   I found that I learned nothing new, the writing style was a little stiff, and it just seemed to be a let down from the author's other work.   I haven't read the more recent biography of Reagan, "Dutch", which sounded horrible.  I don't know if there isn't much to say about Reagan, or if the people who have chosen to write about Reagan have just done a bad job.  Come to think about it, Lou Cannon just wrote another biography, which also looks to be pretty bad.  Maybe there is something difficult about the subject?  I know he has an adviser Martin? something that wrote another book, wow, that was boring too.  Well, whatever the case, I haven't seen any really good books about Reagan.  Of the mediorce ones, this seems to be the best.  I guess I may like Clinton more then I thought.  I mean, whatever you think about him, you have to believe that the unofficial biography will be more stimulating.
