 From Dusk to Dawn is an action/adventure movie with vampires.  Some people, wrongly, say it is a horror flick but there is nothing scary here, except perhaps the poverty of Mexico.  Instead we are treated to two dastardly brothers fleeing from Texas justice after having murdered multiple law enforcement officers.    One brother, played by George Clooney, is charming.  He is a hard nose professional bank robber who was caught.  His brother is ..... different - a convicted child molester, a psychopathic killer, a loon.  He bust his brother out of prison just before the movie starts.  We begin to observe them as they are found in a local gas station/convenient mart.   After a gun battle, they continue their flight to Mexico where, along the way, they kidnap a preacher and his family so that they can get across the border.  Their final destination - the T***** Twister, or the Kitty Twister, if you watch this film on t.v.  This locale, whatever its name, is a biker bar inhabited by Vampires. The brothers, the kidnaped family, and the other patrons of the bar are attacked by the Vampires, in mass.  From here the movie heats up into a shot them up, stake their hearts, a wham-bam action thriller where everyone must fight, or die.  With an interesting appearance by Selma Hyack and Cheech Marin, laughs and wit, "From Dusk to Dawn" is a classic of its own.  While not as "deep" as "Pulp Fiction,"  it is more fun and as such, may be Q.T.'s best work.
