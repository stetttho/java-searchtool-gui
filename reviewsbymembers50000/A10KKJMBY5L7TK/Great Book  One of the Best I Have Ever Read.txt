 It is hard for me to describe this book fairly.   I think that how you receive it, will depend on who you are and what you want from life.  But, for me, Mr. Carnegie's book was well written, in that the writing style is very easy to read.   More importantly, it was well done.  Mr. Carengie describes how to get more out of life and, if you listen and practice what he advises here, you will probably have a happier and much more enjoyable life.  This is a bold claim, but it it true.  I return to this book, again and again, trying to make sure I am doing what this book says or for ideas on how I can do things better.   The basic gist of this book is that, if you want to suceed and be happy, you need to think what other people want, not you.  By serving others, ultimately, you will be happier and more successful yourself.   Thus, if you want to be greedy, be selfless.  It sounds like a contradiction, but it often seems true.  People will be more willing to help you, after you have helped them.    I actually bought a copy of this book for a few people.  My sister didn't read it, because the beginning of the book tells you to "take notes".   Skip the introduction, if that type of advise distracts you.  Read this book, implement its advise, and have a happier and better life.   How many other books can make that claim?
