 Sorry about that title, but I couldn't resist.  This really is a very good film.  A sequel of sorts, really just a more modern remake, to an American Werewolf in London, this film has a great combination of horror and humor, action and adventure, with a nice romantic element and interesting special effects to boot. In, "An American Werewolf in Paris", some American backpackers are attacked by werewolves in Paris.  Skeptical about werewolves, the survivors can't believe that they will turn into werewolves themselves at the next moon.  They do, with the predictable carnage.  (I don't want to give names and spoil and surprise) Slowly our hero becomes convinced that he does turn into a werewolf during the full moon.  To stop the killing, he has to either kill the person who made him a werewolf, or kill himself.  Problem: He loves the person whom he believes bit him.  Added to this mix, we learn that there is a "werewolf cult" in Paris.  They are feeding on the homeless and visitors from other lands.  The police are involved and suspect our hero is a serial killer.    But this review leaves dry, the great fun of this movie.  For me, more then anything, this movie was funny and interesting.  It is not a comedy, but it is a faithful depiction of young men in the world, in any day.  It also had great action scenes, and THINKING people.  In one scene, a lady chased by a werewolf misleads it with a clever and believable distraction.    In other words, there are no cars that don't start, little children who run towards the bad guys, or the other expected and stupid things we find in most horror movies. This is a smart and sassy clever movie.  Fun for most people from 16 up.  I recommend it.
