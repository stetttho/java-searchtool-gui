 Policemen in the future, hired assassins, track and kill artifical people.  These people, created from human genes, but specially designed to work in undesirable jobs and environments, learn that they have also been designed to die young, lest they present a threat to their creators.  With an unbelievable cast including Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer and Daryl Hannah, among others, and superb special effects; this movie should have been a hit.   With many people, apparently, it was.  Not here.  This story is an example of an interesting idea which just didn't pan out well in the movie. It moved very slow.  There were elements here which were confusing.  Finally, some of the effects were disappointing.  I don't know, in a world with artificial people and flying cars don't you think they would have invented a better gun?  Well, that is a small complaint, I just didn't like it.  To be fair, some people do love this film.  If you like science fiction which is a little different and moves at a very controlled pace, you might like it.  I would guess, however, that most people will not.
