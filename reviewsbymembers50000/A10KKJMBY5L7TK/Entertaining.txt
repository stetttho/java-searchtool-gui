 Whales in space are on the verge of destroying Earth when they learn that their relatives on Earth have all been killed.  Only a quick thinking Kirk, traveling back in time to find and bring back some whales, can possibly save the Earth.   This is the plot of a Star Trek film?  Well, yes.  We never really learn if the inhabitants of the spaceship are whales, but they are sending messages to them so, you be the judge.  While we are on this topic, do Whales have thumbs?   No matter, despite the incredibly weak plot, this movie is actually fun as we see Kirk and crew interact with people in the present.  I guess my biggest disappointment was, normally, you don't watch a Star Trek movies for the laughs.  If you go into this movie understanding that cool special effects, new aliens, and exotic space scences are almost entirely missing from the movie; you probably will be in a better frame of mind to enjoy it.   It reminded me, somewhat, of the story where the crew of the Enterprise go on shore leave and discover Alice in Wonderland.  If you liked that Episode, you should enjoy this film.  Otherwise, watch Star Trek II again or, better yet, First Contact.  Enjoy.
