 I like Star Trek, I just am not a fanatic.  As such, I hesitated in buying  this book.  Why should I care if, for example a Klingon and a Vulcan could  or would want to mate?  They don't exist!  Still, after I read the back and  skimmed through the chapters, I decided to buy it.  It was great  fun! First, this book is based on real science.  The writers are well  educated.  In fact, they are both doctors and they explain real biology in  an interesting way that makes it more interesting and accessible to the  public.  Teachers take note.   But, this book is much more then a  teaching tool. The writers are obvious fans of Star Trek and both have a  delightful sense of humor.  I found myself laughing outloud and sharing  some of the stories with my friends.  But it is hard for me to describe  their humor, with taking away the hard scient. I think the fairest thing to  do, is just tell you the title of some of the chapters.   -What the  future May hold, but Probably won't -Parasitic Possession is Nine-tenths of  the Law or  -Where No One Will Ever Go These chapters are about the  probablities of telepathy, real example of parasites on Earth, (and why  they are unlikely in space) and examples of big bloopers in Captain Kirk's  Universe.  Why and what made the Klingons evolve, for example. Utimately  this book is a tribute to Star Trek's attempts to potray science fiction in  an accurate and truthful way.  Science often inspires science fiction.  It  is Star Trek's great glory that a science fiction series has inspired this,  and other works of science and scientist.  Enjoy the Book.
