 "What If's" covers says that it details changes in history that might have occurred at critical junctions if some minor, or major fact, was altered.  Usually the authors try to change a "minor fact" so that the events that come after seem more probable.  Sometimes they don't even do that.    How much you enjoy this book will depend on how much you know about the various historical events discussed.  If you have studied history, the What If format, is probably something you have discussed with your friends or professors.  What if Hitler won WWII, What if Saddem had invaded Saudi Arabia after Kuwait or had invaded Kuwait during the Cold War?  What if Kennedy had invaded Cuba?   As a teaching tool, What If's can be very useful because we can determine why particular choices was taken, instead of the What Ifs.  As a fantasy format, "What ifs" can be plain fun.  I liked many of the chapter found here, but not all.  One author, for example, questioned what would have happened if the weather was bad on D-Day.  He details how the forcast was part, or all, luck.  But, luck or not, it was true so this chapter, for me, was more fantasy then possible reality.  The more interesting chapters for me, were ones like how Washington almost was shot, but the solider hestitated and lost that chance forever.  This almost did happened, it could have happened, and therefore it seemed more real.  But, whatever your personal preferences, What if is a good read so why not read it.
