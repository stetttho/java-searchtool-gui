 For me, this book was like chocolate milk for children.  If you have had a child, or had a clever mother, you may have been given chocolate milk in the past.  Your mom probably didn't want you to have more sweets, but she also know that it was the best way for you to drink your milk.   Same concept here. Mr. Krauss is a scientist and a teacher who loves physics.  He knows, however, that physics aren't loved by many people.  So he has hit on a clever idea.  He teaches us physics while discussing a popular and fun series, Star Trek.  So, beware, you will learn, if you read this book. You still, however, should have fun.  In this book we learn the scientific foundations for some of the more fanciful technologies found in the Star Trek series.  Everything from warp engines to phasers to holograms and deflector fields are discussed.   Some of the conclusions of the author, I noticed, have disapointed some of Star Trek's hardcore fans.  I don't know why.  I watch the series to enjoy myself.  I still do.  The fact that one person doesn't believe warp power, for example, will ever be practical doesn't detract from the Star Trek's stories.  Indeed, the fact the warp power may be possible, but to expensive, was shocking. Some of the other discussions found in this book were also very surprising.  The author, for example, talks about how the computing aspect of transporters may be possible by the 23rd century.  He also thinks that more active holograms are possible, but ones that touch or interact with people physically, he believes are unlikely.   Again, by discussing these aspects of science, we learn alot about our current technology. This is a fun, informative read, and a good tool for teachers who want to excite their studies about their studies.  For a science book, therefore, I would give it a "5" for fun.  Overall, I have given this book a "4", but it is an interesting read.
