 This is one of those films which were really well made.  As I watched it I really appreciated the art, even if I didn't enjoy it very much.  That, in reality, may be the point.    One of the first scenes in the film shows the invasion of Normandy.  It seems so real; it almost seems too real.   I almost felt like a "peeping tom" as I watched it.  I felt bad for the real men who died facing gunfire on those beaches.  This, by the way, is the first twenty minutes. Afterwards the movie calms down a bit, but there are still alot of very tense scenes as a group of soliders search throughout Allied Controlled France for one private, Private Ryan. Their job is to find him and take him back home.  While the storyline seems inplausible, even the people in the DVD struggle with their mission, it is a useful tool for showing us different aspects of the war. This was a dark, bitter, sad movie.  It had great moments, but it really suceeded in showing some of the real horrors of war.  I know war is horrible.  I didn't need to see such detail in my home.  Again, I think this was the point of this film. It suceeded admirably.   I could appreciate the efforts, but not enjoy the results.  Since, generally, I watch films to enjoy myself, I couldn't recommend this film to others of the same mindset.  If, however, you want a detailed and very graphic view on how war can be, this film hits the mark.   This film, by the way, should not be seen by children.
