 Gray's Anatomy is a "classic" book on Anatomy.  Unusual for a classic, it is everything you have heard.  The drawings are beautiful, accurate, and interesting.  At the same time, this book was a standard text for Anatomy since 1901.  As such, the drawing are only part of this book. The book's main effort is to explanation human anatomy.  It does so wonderfully and clearly, with words.  The drawings are only there to help with the text's explanations. A quick warning.  Since this book has been around since before 1901, there are many, many different versions.  Make sure you check the printing date of the one you buy.  The human body has not changed since this first editions, but our access to it has.  As such, while some of the earlier books are beautiful to look at, the later editions are more valuable as a reference tool.
