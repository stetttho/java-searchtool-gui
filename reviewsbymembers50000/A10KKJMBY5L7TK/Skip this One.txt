 If you are thinking about buying this book, you probably have already read other Xanth books, which are generally quite good.  Centaur Aisle is not  I think is may be because, most Xanth books have plenty of magic.  It is an escape to a different place where anything is possible.  This book is an adventure into Mundania.  Mundania is mundane.  There is no magic there, well, almost none.  As a result, this book isn't as interesting.  This book is also more serious then the other Xanth books.  I like Xanth books because they have a good combination of fun and adventure.  This book is a little less light, a little less fun.  Of all the Xanth books to date, this is the only one I would avoid.  But, please, if you haven't read the first three books go back and buy them; they are great fun!
