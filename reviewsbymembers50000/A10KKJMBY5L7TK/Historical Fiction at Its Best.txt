 The Booke of Days is the story of a minor lord from Southern France who joins the first Crusade.  His name is Roger of Lunel.  Roger joins the Crusade because the Pope has promised absolution for any who fight, and kill, for Christianity.  The irony of this is not lost on Roger who keeps a diary of his journey.  At first Roger examines the ideas of the crusade even as he compares them to the reality.  Knights who ravish women in southern France, wear body parts cut off from their enemies, and murder other Christians who don't follow the proper pope. These are the people who will save Christianity?  With this start, I was concerned that his book might become an anti-Christian or anti-West book.  It is not.  It is a realistic look at the Crusades which describes the good and ill, of all sides.  A Booke of Days also describes the people, the customs, and the times, better then any book about this period I have encountered.  Some of the twists of the personal story seem stretched, but I liked the story so much I will was willing to believe. In the end, rather then being a book about the Crusades, it is a book about Roger of Lunel, set in the Crusades. I liked Roger, so I loved this book.  I also loved the hundreds of small touches which show the effort and the artistry of the author. If this book really isn't true, it could be.  And anyone who has even a passing interest in History or Romance should read it.
