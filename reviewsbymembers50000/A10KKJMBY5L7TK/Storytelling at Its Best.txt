 Braveheart is the story of Scotland's fight for freedom from the English crown.  The King, Edward, is cruel, vicious, and clever.  Meeting leading men at a peace parley, he murders them. One man, late, finds their bodies hanging from the shafts of a barn.  He young son, William Wallace, is there.  The surviving Scotsmen are split.  Most, including Wallace's father, die in battle against Edwards army. Afterwards, Wallace is taken away to live with his Uncle Arglye in Europe.  When William returns years later, his home is much like he left it.  Edward is King. The Nobles are still divided.  Some want to work with Edward and serve him.  Some want to fight him, when a chance arises. Wallace just wants to marry and farm.  Life isn't always what we plan.  William Wallace does marry, but he still finds himself drawn into the war where he becomes a leader of the rebellion.  He wins, and loses, many battles.  His army grows, and nobles fight with him and scheme against him. This movie is graphic in detail, especially the battle scenes.  War is not glorified.  War is a horror.  No one watching this film will want to go out and be hacked by a sword.  But most people watching will understand why some men will choose to fight and die, rather then live under a king like Edward. In between the battle scenes, the movie is filled with a story about friendship and love. It has good humor, where appropriate, and twists, turns and surprises which are both shocking, but believable.  Mel Gibson did a great job.  The man playing King Edward was one of the best villians I have seen.  The Princess, the prince; also portrayed wonderfully. In fact, everything about this film is wonderful. It is the best film I have seen in twenty years.  My highest recommendation.
