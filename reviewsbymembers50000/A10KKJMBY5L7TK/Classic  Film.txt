 A fight to the finish between two killer robots, one a cyborg and one an advanced model, the T-1000, Terminator 2 is better then the original.  In Terminator 2, we see a frightening and compelling view of the future as killer robots step on mountains of human skulls as the try to track down and kill the remants of the people remaining on the earth.   Losing their war, the robots send a assassin back in time to kill the leader of the human rebellion.  This killer robot has a body comprised of a "liquid metal."  It can change shape at will, absorve bullets, and imitate, on contact, any human being. Through a series of spectular car chases, gun battles and robot wrestling; we are treated to one of the best science fiction movies of its time.    This collection is more then just this a DVD version of this movie.  As advertised, it has everything everyone would or should want, if you are a fan of this movie.  If you haven't seen the movie yet, you may be a little overwhelmed, but only in a positive way.  It includes "storyboards" , "director cuts" and inside interviews with some of the cast.   To be truthful, I loved this movie.  I, however, was not a big fan of this package.  The scenes added in the director's cut didn't seem to add much to the movie.  I think this is because I have already seen the movie too many times. When you see a director's cut, the movie seems strange, like those cuts aren't suppose to be there.  More to the point, I loved the movie.  I was not that interesting in all the extra behind the scene materials.  If you like that kind of thing, I think you will really like this DVD.  If that isn't your cup of tea, then buy the cheaper DVD, without all the extras.
