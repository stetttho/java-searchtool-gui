 In this book, we travel to an unnamed world where men and women have developed amazing powers, called Attributes.  These people pose as ancient Hindu Gods and rule over the planet below them.  Essential to their rule is to keep the people in this planet at a primitive level of techology.  This they do most ruthelessly. "Sam", the binder, disagrees.  He wants to aid the people below.  With the aid of others, he lanches a multi-phased revolution against the gods.  Sam develops new religions to counter Hinduism; he makes treaties with this planets natural inhabitants, "demons"; he actually seeks an alliance with the "evil one."    No, this is not Satan.  Who the evil or dark one is, however, is a nice surprise. With an amazing amount of turns and twists, grievous mistakes by "Sam", and interesting exposure to philosophy of all kinds, this book is Zelazny at his best.  It compares in quality to "Nine Prince of Amber," a classic in its own right.  Highly recommended for fantasy and science ficton fans.
