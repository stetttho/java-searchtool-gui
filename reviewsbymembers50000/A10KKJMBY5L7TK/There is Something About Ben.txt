 Ben Stiller does a great job portraying ordinary men in unusual situations.  He is probably best known for "Something About Mary," which was a very, very, funny film.  In "Meet the Parents" he again portrays an average man in a weird situation. In particular, he portrays a young man in love, who just wants to get married.  His first attempt to propose doesn't work, so he plans a romantic proposal at his fiance's home that weekend.  Her father, played by Robert De Niro, is a little strange.  He is either in the Mafia or the CIA, but he is up to something. He definitely loves his cat. Greg, Ben Stiller's character, doesn't like cats much; but he keeps his mouth shut.  From this point onward the movie has a series of strange, but for the most part, believable twists.  The comedy is funny, because we can believe it and are happy it is happening to someone else. Toward the end, however, the movie goes a little bit overboard.  You can still believe it, if you think Greg is close to a breakdown.  I didn't believe it, so the ending took away from the movie.  Still, I found myself laughing out loud several times while watching "Meet the Parents."  There is something about Ben Stiller which makes otherwise ordinary films, much better.  Here he has again done a very good job.  "Meet the Parents" is fun and worth seeing. A 3.5.
