 The first book in this series, Wizard's First Rule, was very good.  This book is better.  The author, it seems, is improving on both his writing style and technique.  The story, as well, in my view is much better.  It starts strong, and continues to be a good read until the end. Literally, literally, the book begins in the garden of the dead wizard, Darken Rahl, moments after he died.  Chase and Zedd are discussing what to do with the boxes of Orden when a creatures from the underworld attacks them.  The "Keeper" creatures are loose.  Will the Keeper follow? I have read others complain that this plot line is too similiar to Robert Jordan's series, the Wheel of Time.  This is both true and false.  The "Keeper" story is one plot in this book.  But, this book is really about much more.  There are other villians and other struggles.  The Keeper story is only part of the tapestry.   It is also interesting, to me, how the "Keeper" is described in this book.  He follows are evil, but the Keeper may not be.  He function, death, is described as necessary for life.  What good function does the villian in the Wheel of Time series perform? I also love the humor found throughout the story.  The author here does not beat you over the head with it.  He has a singular wit to him, which makes these books much more enjoyable.  If you think like the author you will find this book very funny.  Mind me, it is not a comedy.  But, life is rarely a drama or a comedy or a romance.  Life is everyone of those things, and more.  The writer here remembers that fact and puts all the elements of life into his book, while remembering and delivering on the fact that he is writing a fantasy adventure series.
