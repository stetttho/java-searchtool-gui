 I loved this movie, but I hated the first five minutes. If you find yourself watching Starship Troopers, give it at least that much time, before you make any decision about it.   In Starship Trooper, the human race is fighting for survival against a horrible collection of bugs.  These bugs, alien creatures, fight hard and are vicious.  Some can fly, others breath fire, but all of them are intent on wiping us out. Viewed only on this level, Starship Trooper is an excellent war movie with good graphics and lovable heros and deployable villians. (Ugg.  They are bugs for heaven sake!) But, Starship Troopers is much more then a war movie.  It is a civics lession.  In Starship Troopers the director did an outstanding job discussing such diverse issues as both the horrors and necessity of war, governmental proganda and dedication to one's country.  We see military cruelity and we also see why it may be necessary.   I especially love the comparision between the struggles of a grunt solider and a starship crew.  Both think they are suffering, but the film is clear on who has the better job.  On this level, the film is intense.  This film will make you think, even if you don't want to.  It is a classic on every level, you shouldn't miss it, if you like science fiction at all.
