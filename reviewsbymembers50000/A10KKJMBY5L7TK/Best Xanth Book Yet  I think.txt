 I loved all of the books in this series so far, so it is hard to choose a "best" one.  But Ogre, Ogre, is definetely a good read.  It maintains all of the traditions of the first four books, but the action is taken up a notch or two.  It is much better then Centuar Isle, the four book in the series. In Ogre, Ogre, like all of the books in the series, there is a quest or mystery.  Here an Ogre, a vegetarian, travels in Xanth finding adventure and romance along the way.  Smash, son of Crunch, like all ogres likes to rhyme.   For this book, the rhymes are fun and add to the charm of the book. Smash gets into trouble with a demon who, like all demons, are probably the most powerful creatures in Xanth.  (But like all creature in Xanth, we learn that every creature or demon thinks their kind is the "most powerful.)  Smash, who is really only half Ogre and half human, thus has a powerful foe to contend with.  And, since he is only half Ogre, he appears to be at a disadvantage. But, sometimes, your human half can be helpful too.  In particular, humans are smarter then Ogres.  If he can find a way to use his brain and his brawn, Smash may stand a chance.  Otherwise he may be, well, he may be smashed by his opponents.   Ogre, Ogre is another fun, good read.  Plenty of surprises and twists, and much magic, makes this book a pleasure to read.
