 This book is the second in this series.  If you have not read the first book, don't read this one yet.  Go back, read the first book, "A Game of Thrones", and then read "A Clash of Kings".  You will enjoy both books more.  You will also avoid spoiling many surprises and plot twists which are the hallmark of this series.  You have been warned!   If you did read and enjoy "A Game of Thrones", you will love this book too.  The quality is as good or better.  If you didn't enjoy the first book, are you crazy or something?   Seriously, you might still want to consider this book as the pace and action are more intense then the prior one.  In "A Clash of Kings", the war continues.  Tyrion is sent south to save Kingslanding, King Joffery, and Cersei- in that order.  With its forces stripped to fight King Robb, Kingslanding is weak and open to attack from either Baratheon brothers.  Renly Baratheon and Stannis Baratheon are preparing for battle.   But, they are getting ready to kill each other! Stannis has a better claim to the throne, but almost nobody likes him.  Still, he would rather fight and die, then give up what he believes belongs to him. Renly, proud and popular, is also headstrong and vain, in that way he is the dead King Robert's true heir. King Robb, in the North, is attacked by a "friend."  Daenarys is still collecting an army overseas.  Jon and the Nightwatch are in an expedition past the wall.  Bran has discovered that he may have great powers, once more common but now almost forget.  A witch is beginning to influence King Stannis.  More strange creatures are coming in from the north.  And this is all in the first 100 pages!  "A Clash of Kings" was worth the wait, worth the read, and is highly recommended.
