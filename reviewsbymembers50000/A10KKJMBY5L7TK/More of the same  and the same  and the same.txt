 What happened Harry?  The first part of this series was fun because we go to see how some of the most famous and well know figures in history would have responded, in the the author's view, to alien invasion.  I thought,  for that reason, it was fun but not well editted.  This series is  worse. First, it takes over 300 pages of more then 600 before anything  substantially new appears.  During this period we meet some of the new  charactors and most of the old ones.  But over and over again we are told  how remarkable the Big Uglies are and how conservatives the lizards are  -and slow.  Okay, we get the story.  Now where is the story? In  Colonization, Turtledove had the opportunity to be a little  unconvernational.  I would have preferred an earthman invasion of their  planet or the introduction of a new race competing with the humans of earth  and the lizards.  No.  This books, instead, talks about the continued  stalemale of the remaining powers 20 years later!  Please, if people with  1940's tech could have fought them lizards to a tie, people in 1960 with  1980s or beyond tech - that wouldn't even be close.  Okay, I know there  would be some problems but since nothing new is added here, why not buy  something new and different or simply re-read the first books in the  series.  You won't miss much and the writing will be better.
