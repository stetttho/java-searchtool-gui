 Demons Don't Dream is probably a fun book, if you are between ages 7-10.  It details the adventures of a some young adults who, through a computer game, enter the world of Xanth.  Of course there is a computer game which was the inspiration for this book.   In the book, (and game), the reader has a "companion", someone from an older Xanth novel, lead them through Xanth.  Whoever completes the quest first, will win a prize.  Like all Xanth novels, everyone is good - even the Demons.  There isn't much tension or surprises.  Still the writing is fun and, as I said if you are younger, or have young kids, they may enjoy it more. Those who are a little older, 14 or 15 maximum, probably would be happier, though, if they avoided this book.  It is not for you.  If you are older and want to read an Xanth novel, try one of the first three.  They are still written for a younger audience, but they are very enjoyable for older people too.
