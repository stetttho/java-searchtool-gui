 This book is a collection of articles from different people over the last five years.  How much you like any article may depend on how interested you are in that topic and how well the author presents it.  Since all of them, however, are tied together by Scientific America, I would have expected a more consistent style.   Unfortunately the editors do not seem to have much control of the writer's style.  So, some of the article were very clear, others were not written as well.  It really is hit or miss in this book.  There are some really good articles and some that don't quite make the grade.  My two favorites were about the Kupiter Belt and the Oort Cloud.   The Kupiter belt is a colletion of rocks, really, beyond Pluto. Indeed, Pluto appears to be the largest of these planetoids on the fringes of our solar system.  That is why you may have heard that some scientists don't think Pluto desires "planet status."   Further out, about 1/5 of a light year, is the Oort Cloud which contains the true leftovers of our solar system.  The Oort Cloud is believe to be the source of comets.  Comets are relatively "new" and have to come from somewhere because they lose mass every time they come near the sun.  My very favorite was the theory that all the water on Earth came from comets because, when the Earth was formed, all the water was burned off of it while the ground was molten.  Indeed, the moon might have stuck the Earth during this time and then stayed as it was caught it the Earth's gravity. Again, overall, this book was fun.  Written for the masses, but with enough scientific details to satisfy most people with some background in the field.  Probably a better bargain, though, if it comes out in paperback.
