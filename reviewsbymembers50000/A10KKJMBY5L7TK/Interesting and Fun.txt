 This book gives one a good overview of strange and the supernatural.  One by one the book discusses odd events in history and tries to explain them for the reader. The events covered included everything from "Was there an Atlantis"  to "Who was Shakesphere?" Written by two authors, the books seems to be dualing with itself, and its explanations for these events.  On the one hand, the authors will try and give a scientific explanation; on the other hand, the authors give bizarre reasons for these events.  Since some of the events are bizarre, however, maybe only bizarre answers can be given.   I think you will especialy enjoy this book if you want an introduction into the bizarre.  Don't expect in depth discussions of these issues, this is an Encylcopedia.   But as an overview this book was especially good at discussing strange topics, of which, I had never heard.  From a man who claimed to be immortal, to the "Gray Man" found in a distant mountain. Good, not great.  The short sections makes for an interesting read when you are short on times.  Enjoy
