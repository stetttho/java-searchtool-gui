 A disappointing effort, especially for Card.   The Memory of Earth reminds me of the great disappointment Xenocide had been for me after a brilliant book like Ender's Game.... Why is this book so disappointing? The hero, a young boy, is interesting but his time and culture is not.  Much of the early portions of the book are spent talking about irrelevant cultural issues.   Worse they are brought up in incredibly dull ways.   Do we really care that actors in this city perform plays behind masks?   Why is that important?   Does Card need to talk about the voting rights of men, or how they can't own property in the city? The fact men are, in essence, inferior is also a bore.  Yes, yes, it may sound more political correct, but is it really?  If it is wrong to be sexist against woman, it is also wrong to be sexist against men.  No women will be raised up, by throwing down all of the male.  Now, if it advanced the story, we would read it, enjoy it.  Here, much of the PC presentation (only woman can talk to the Oversoul, only woman can be true scholars)  add nothing and is a bore. The truth is half way through, I quit.  I read the last two chapters, which only confirmed my choice.   This is a bad book.  Worse it was written by Card after so many other great efforts.  If you must read Card, try to read his other, better works.  This one should be skipped on by so your Memory of Card won't be hurt by this forgettable book.
