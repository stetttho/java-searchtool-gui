 Shadow Rising is a great book.  It is better then the last one, which was pretty good.  I am hopefully that, if this series continues, it will continues at this pace.  Slow enough to learn more about the charactors introduced in the first three books, but quick and exciting with battles, blood, and suspense. In the Shadow Rising, Rand travels through the desert to met with the Aiel.  Broken up into many clans, they are awaiting a leader who must prove himself to them.  This leader must face testing where, as he struggles against the elements, he will learn secrets about the Aiel's past. Meanwhile... there are other struggles ongoing.  Perrin has returned to TwoRivers where he has learned it is under attack.  He needs to help draw the people together, even as he seeks to learn how the Trollocs are able to travel so far, undetected.  However, Perrin is still fighting with himself, and trying to strike a balance between himself and his wolf brothers. And on and on it goes.  With each book, the author seems to add adventure to political backstabbing with some romance and history toss in.  The results have been a series worth buying and worth reading.
