 With one exception, every fantasy book I have read occurs in the past, in the Middle ages.  Meet the exception.  In Nine Prince of Amber, our hero awakens today, somewhere in modern America, in a hospital.  He doesn't remember who he is or why he is there.  He does know that people seem to be trying to kill him.  Thus, begins the Amber saga. "Nine Princes of Amber" tells the tale of a power struggle beyond Earth.  Nine princes fight and die for their father's throne on Amber.  Amber is the perfect world, of which, even our own Earth is but a pale reflection. Corwin, the hero of this book, eventually learns his part in this struggle.  He was one a favored contender, now he is a unknown wildcard.  As Corwin slowly regains some memories, he finds his place in the upcoming battle.   Meanwhile other threats seem to be lurking close by. "Nine Princes of Amber" has everything a good book requires.  A good plot, an interesting hero, and a writing style that moves the book along.  I highly recommend it.
