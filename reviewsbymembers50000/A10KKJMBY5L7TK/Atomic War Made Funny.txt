 This movie is scary and funny, a hard combination.  A general goes crazy and decides to launch a nuclear war against the Soviet Union with the bombers under his commmand.  The Soviets, however, have a new weapon, a doomsday machine.  If any nuclear bombs are exploded over Russia, a machine will release lethal radition into the air killing all life on earth for 99 years.   What can be funny about this?  Nothing really, if it were true.  The writer actually takes carefully steps to show how it could be true, that is, how it could happen.  The military says no, it is not possible.  I hope not. Since, however, the movie is not true, it is very funny because of some incredible performances of the actors here.  Of them all, George C. Scott (of Patton fame) was the best.  He is bizarre, offbeat, with great timing.  I guess, he was so good, because we believe him in this role.  This movie also has Peter Sellers in three roles.  This is the only movie with Peter Sellers in it that I liked.  He does a great job in all three of his roles.   Most of all, this movie will should appeal to those of you who have a sacastic streak or a sense of irony.  You need to watch close to see all of the special touches added to this film.  Soliders fighing in front of a sign that says "Peace is our profession."  Or the president yelling to his general, struggling with a Russian diplomat that "fighting isn't aloud in the war room."  This movie moves quick and is fun and enjoyable.  Surprising, it can also make you think.  Don't let that put you off though, you don't think much to still enjoy this film.  :) It is very good.  Enjoy.
