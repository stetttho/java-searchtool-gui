 - From the Desk of a Star Trek Fan This movie didn't make much sense.  The other reviews here are already fairly negative so I won't belabor the point but it was very disappointing after the great job done in "First Contact."  I was most disappointed by two things.   First, the spirit of hope and optimism found in the original series is missing.  The story ends up being a deadly squabble between different factions in the Federation about a legal point.  (When does the prime directive apply?)  Picard had stated in other episodes that they don't use money in the future because "we have evolved beyond that"  ("First Contact.")  Yet here we learn that the people in the future, on certain issues, are just as petty and small as anyone today.  So much for the optimism of the future. Second, the tension of the movie seemed a little fake.  If you haven't seen Insurrection yet, there is one part of the film where some officers are trying to move people off a planet they desire.  So there are scenes of fleeing people, terrified, trying to avoid being "beamed up" to a transport ship.   Big deal. Where is the real tension?  Why are this people so scarred?  By this point in the movie it had already been established that they were aware of modern technology.   Almost the last thing on Earth (in Space?) I would want to do is criticize Star Trek.  I loved this series.  But the last thing I would do is be dishonest and say good things about a bad product.  When the movie is bad, say it, unless you want more  movies to be made like this one.  This Star Trek wasn't bad, but it was not very good.  It may be worth seeing for a Star Trek fan, but if you aren't familiar with this series, don't start with this film.
