 Conan the Barbarian is faithful to the books and the comics.  Here a young Arnold Schwarzenegger in his third film, the second where he was permitted to speak, portrays Conan the Barbarian, a warrior, thief and future King. Conan's family is killed and he is enslaved while a young boy.  He works on a farm and later becomes a gladiator-warrior.  Supremely successful, his owner grants him freedom which he uses to track down the killers of his family.   James Earl Jones  portrays the villain, Thusa Doom. By its nature, such a story is little grim, but the writers have added some moments of levity which help move the movie along.  The sword play in it may also seem a little slow compared to the movies produced today.  Finally, the producers opted for a cheap scene where Thusa Doom shoots arrows made from snakes.   My friend loved this scene, but I thought it took away from the movie.  "Conan the Barbarian" seemed almost realistic in an "other worldly" way.  That is, when you watch Conan the Barbarian, you could almost believe you were witnessing an earlier age where a man's might and wits could carry him far.  Where rules were made, based on your sword.  And then they start shooting snakes at people.   Well, it is a small criticism.  If you like swords and sorcery, you should enjoy Conan the Barbarian.  It is a bloody, action film which delivers for its core audience, young teenagers and kids.  The "R" rating is deserved.  This movie is not for very young people, even if it seems to be designed for them.  If you are older and want to travel back to a world that could have existed, this movie is for you.
