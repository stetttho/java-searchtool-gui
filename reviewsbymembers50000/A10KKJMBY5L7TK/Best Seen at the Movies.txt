 The DVD revolution still can not replace the glory of a great science fiction film on the big screen.  Watching this movie at home, it certainly seemed like a smaller and less worthier version of this film then the one I saw in the movies.  Its not the fault of the DVD, it is the fault of my little t.v. when compared to a gigantic screen.  Still watching "Generations" at home had its pluses and overall it was an enjoyable viewing. In Generations, the old and the new combine, to fight an evil that threatens to destroy worlds for its own gain.  In particular, in this film a cosmis entity a found traveling through space.  If you are in this "ribbon", whatever you desire bcome true, sorta. One person, wanting to return to this fantasy land that he visted once, will do anything to get there.  This is too bad for the millions of inhabitants of a planet that will be destoyed for the pleasures of one man.  But, as he say, all things die, it is just a matter of timing. Here, the death of a world will help him, and that is all he cares about.
