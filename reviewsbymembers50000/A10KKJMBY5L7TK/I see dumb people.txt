 Yes, yes... most of us are familiar with the more famous line of this film, "I see dead people", but listen closely and you may hear what this little boy is really saying.  He is describing the audience who loves this nothing film.  You wait and wait and wait, and nothing happens.  There are a few strange surprises towards the end, but it is not worth the wait.  Instead we have a film that meanders along, with nothing much happening while we are watching.   Bruce Willis, as a child psychologist, does do a great job.  However, since Bruce Willis is in alot of other films, you do not have to suffer through this one to watch him.  If you insist, however, you can see him interact with a little boy who can see, and hear, dead people.  Branded a freak by his classmates, alone with his talent, he mets Bruce. Bruce really doesn't believe that this little boy can see dead people, instead he thinks the child is crying out for help.   Who really needs help, and how they get it, is one of the nice twists of the movie.  A few good plot turns, however, doesn't make up for the slow, very slow, pacing.  If you like freaky movies, watch some of the old Twilight Zones episodes.  They are more interesting, and only take 30 minutes instead of 2 1/2 hours to make the point.  Okay, okay, maybe this film isn't "dumb."  But the overreaction by so many to it certainly is.  "The Sixth Sense" is an okay, average film worth watching on broadcast television, but not worth the money needed to buy a DVD. Wait six months, it will be a "movie for a weekend" on a local channel.
