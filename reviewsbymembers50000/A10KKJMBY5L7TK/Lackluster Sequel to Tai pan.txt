 This is an interesting sequel, in that, it takes place about 200 years after the first novel, Tai-pan.  You don't need to read Taipain, however, to read this book.  If you have read Tai-pain, you might enjoy it more.  Noble House tells the story of some Americans coming to Hong Kong to open up a trading house.  They encounter some English traders whose family has been there since the story in Tai-pan. In Noble House we learn that business today, in Hong Kong, is unlike business in any other place in the world. Romance, violence, drugs, and murder, these are all parts of normal life in Hong Kong.  There are interesting characters and a good tension through the book.  If you liked Tai-pan or Shogun, you will probably like this book. Why only three stars?  Hong Kong is written almost exactly like Tai-pan.  I loved Tai-pan because I learned about Hong Kong's past.  I loved learning about the times and culture.  Here, I didn't have as much to learn, I already read the other book!  As such, my rating is based on the story alone.  The story here was okay, but it just wasn't that interesting to me.  I didn't like the "hero" much.  I didn't see much "bad" about the villian.  It did move along, and the story did have one or two twists.  Overall though, it was too long and not interesting enough to rate more then average in my view.
