 Foundation and Empire is the second book in this series.  If you have not read the first one yet, you should.  Still, because of the rare and very clear writing found here, you can read this book and never be confused.  Since both books are so good, why skip the first one? In this book, we return to the future.  A small empire, the Foundation, is on the edges of a greater one.  The "Empire" currently encompasses thousands of worlds.  Still, compared to its past, it has been shrinking.  One of its most able generals, aware that the Empire is less then it once was, decides to expand the Empire.  Unfortunately for the Foundation, he has choosen the systems occured by it, as the best direction for his expansion. Like the first installation, this book continually talks about the "inevitable" victory of the Foundation.  Since they are being systematically destroyed by the Empire, such predictions ring hollow.  How the book solves this problem seems to make sense.   But this war is only the prelude for a greater conflict - a Civil War in the Foundation itself.   Here is a really interesting dilemena.  Since the Foundation is "fated" to survive, what will happen if it wars with itself?  And, to make things more interesting, a third party joins the conflict.  This mysterious entity, the "Mule", leads forces that beats both foundations back.  What is happening here? Again, like the first book in this series, Foundation and Empire is as much a mystery story, as science fiction.  How the author solves these problems are great fun.  The ending, actually the middle of the book, is a great surprise on your first read.  What happens afterwards, and the new developments, make for a great twist to this story and a powerful new development in this series.  A great story.  It is great fun and easily as enjoyable as the first book which, on its own, was a classic.  Read and enjoy.
