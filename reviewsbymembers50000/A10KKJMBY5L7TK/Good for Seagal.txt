 I don't like Steven Seagal.  For him though, this is the best work I have seen him do.  "Five stars."  Yet, when compared to most films, it still average. Still, if you have a free weekend and want to see a fun film, "Under Siege" may do. The plot is simple.  Terrorists attempt to take over a battleship with some inside help. Since the ship is about to be retired, it has a skelton crew which make the take over a little bit easier.  For some reason, however, it still has on board its nuclear missiles.  Would the U.S. Navy allow nuclear missiles to be guarded by a skelton crew?  I hope not. For that matter would they allow a helicopter to land on a ship of war with Ms. Playmate?  Well, maybe. Don't look to closely at the plot, just enjoy the action. It's a Steven Seagal film. There are fights, kicks and flips, and enough violence to satisfy most of his fans.  There is also some nice extra touches.  For example, would the United States attack and destroy its own ship, to save the mainland from attack? In addition, Tommy Lee Jones, as the leader of the bad guys does a good job.  This role was done before he became more famous in "the Fugitive."  Still, you can see here, what made his so go there.  He is fun to watch and saves this film.  "Under siege" also has Gary Busey, as a nasty officer.  Again, this film is fun, a good diversion on a rainy day, but not for anyone seeking serious entertainment.
