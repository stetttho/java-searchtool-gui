 Lord Demon starts out well. It finishes poorly.  I will give you one example.  In Lord Demon the hero, a demon, goes to another dimension to save an ally and maybe a friend.  This dimension is filed with..... hangers.  I kid you not.  Well, "hanger like beings."  Even the charactors in the book are baffled.   Things like this take away from the whole book which, to this point was a good fantasy book.  Afterwards, it only gets worse.  The battle royal is set up well and then nothing.  I won't spoil the disappointing ending but it lacked imagination and conflicted with the early tenets of the story. Curiously, the writing style remains good but if you think about some of the ideas presented you will be very disppointed.   Still, most of the book seemed quite good.  If you like Zelazny, read it.  If you have not read him yet, don't start with this book.  He is a great author but, like everyone else, he can make mistakes and here he did.  There are other, better books that Zelazny has written and you should not be scared off by the disappointing flaws found in this one. "Lord Demon" was good, but there are alot of other books out there, by Zelzany which are much, much better.   Enjoy.
