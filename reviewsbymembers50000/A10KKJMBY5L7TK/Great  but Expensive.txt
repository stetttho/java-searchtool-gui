 In my view, when you buy a reference book, buy one that will last for a long time.  This is especially true with maps.  Since the world will not change anytime soon, a good map can be used for a long time. This Atlas, produced on special cloth(?) paper, has a nice texture and will definetly last. It gives four or five different maps of the same region, including political and satellite images. While the political maps, no doubt, will change, the satellite images will be good forever.  As a bonus it has about 200 pages of information describing the natural and artifiical resources of the world.  Time and again I have found myself referring to these pages as each country is mentioned in the news.  I like having this extra information and I love having these maps. My only complaint, which is small, is that the book is so big.  It doesn't fit in my bookshelf or any of the normal places I would store a book.  If you are tight on space, or if you are low on mony, you may not want to purchase this one.  Otherwise, for an Atlas, this is a great job.
