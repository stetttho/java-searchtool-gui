 I thought that this book was funny.  For the most part, it doesn't include quotations that you will find in other places.  Instead the author quotes people from Johnny Carson to Winston Churchill.  There doesn't seem to be an predictable connection, except the personal preferences of the author.  As such, if you thing like the author, it makes for an interesting read.  I guess it would be of the most use for people who want a good quote, that few other people would use.  I haven't used the book professionally, but I enjoyed reading it from time to time.  And, as a bonus, the author adds in some interesting pictures which I really enjoyed.
