 The Cousins' Wars is a bold attempt to link the Glorious Revolution in England, the American Revolution and the American Civil War.  By graphs and charts, the author shows how the people who fought against each other in England, had decendants fight against each other in the American Revolution.   The author also goes into the reasoning behind the Revolutions and tries to connect them together into one common fabric.  I applaud the effort of this book.   I deploy the results.  The problem, for me, was that the writing style was so boring.  I guess the fact that this book is praised, on its back, by three different professors, should have been a warning.  The following is a typic passage from this book:      "England's first and only republic, declared in 1649, was      at best a partial success.  Over then next eleven years      its poltical alignments shifted and sagged until the           ultimate decison to restore the monarchy." For me, this writing was just too hard to read.  It didn't capture my interst or imagination and, once I deciphered what the author was saying, I disagreed with his much of his thesis.  However, if you like the writing style above, perhaps you will like this book. Me... I can not recommend it.   I don't think history needs to be so stiff, to be enjoyed.
