 This book takes the reader through time and history as the author describes why certain generals won, or lost their wars.  In particular, the author tries to show how certain techniques or tactics used from Ancient Rome to Genghis Khan to Napoleon are still applicable today in the modern world.   Indeed, when these tactics are not used, in Korean for example, the author reveals how he feels the generals have let down their men; and their country. As a primer, this book is good.  The author has a good grasp on basic tactics and very interesting facts about history.  For example, when fighting armies who have elephants, the Romans had bells with them which they would shake, scarring the beasts and making them useless for the battle. As I said, overall this book, as a basic guide, is very good.  It is not for those who have a solid background in this area already.  For me, though, it was very interesting.  I particularlly like the earlier chapters.  In my view, as the booked came closer to present times, the author's emotions and personal feelings made him less objective.  This took away somewhat, from his conclusions but, overall, the book was still a fun read.
