 "On a Pale Horse" is a fun look at an alternative Universe where Newton discovered the basic principals of Science and Magic.  As a result, the 20th Century has magic carpets, dragons and wizards, as well as fast cars, microwave ovens and laser beams.  Zane, a luckless Bohemian with a questionable past, accidentally kills "Death" in a botched suicide attempt.   He soon learns that Death is an office which one earns by killing the prior occupant. Zane is now responsible for killing everyone on Earth, when their time comes.  In particular, Zane existence allows death to occur.  He also has to personally kill those who souls are close to "balance," that is, where their evil and good, are about equal throughout their lives. While involved in his grim task, in death, Zane finally begins to appreciate life, even as he questions the rules by which we all live.  He ultimately falls in love with Luna, the  young daughter of a deceased wizard and gets deeply entangled in a conflict with Lucifer, kings of lies. "On a Pale Horse" can be read and enjoyed as a simple fantasy adventure.  It is, however, more then just that.  "On a Pale Horse" is also the author's attempt to answer some of the basic issues of life.  Why do we die? Why do some people die so soon?  What happens after death?     Some of Mr. Anthony's answers here are interesting, other fall a little more flat.  Since, by his own admission, Mr. Anthony is, or was, an agnostic, it is curious that he is so concerned about what happens to us after we die. I guess Mr. Anthony suffers from the same doubts as the rest of us.  "I fear a just God, even while I doubt his existence."  But, don't let this distract you.  If you want a good fantasy/fun book, this is it.  For me, the intelligent questions about ourselves and our place in the Universe were just added bonuses.
