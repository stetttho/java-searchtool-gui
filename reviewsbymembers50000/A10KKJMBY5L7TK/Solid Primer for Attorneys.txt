 For California Attorneys I would strongly suggest you add this book to your "war chest", if you do DUIs.  There are a few other DUI books out there, but his one is very solid on the law and the reality behind the law.  Mr. Taylor gives you some good examples of cross examination, which I have modified and used. In addition, with the updates, most of the motions I wanted were provided.   I had only two minor complaints.  First, I disagree with Mr. Taylor about DMV hearings.  In this section, Mr. Taylor essentially states that you will always lose.  Wrong.  I have won a few hearings, as I am sure he has, on technical grounds.  I wanted to see if had any such technical grounds that I may have overlooked; he had none.   Come on Lawrence, I have paid you for the book, where are my inside tips.  I have also won DUI hearings on the merits.  As such, again, I am sure someone from Mr. Taylor's offices has done the same.  Unfortunately the book is silent on these points. Second, Mr. Taylor quotes cases which are not published.  He will then tell you that they aren't published, after you have read them.  Judges may not rely on unpublished cases.  If you cited them in court, even if you informed the court that they aren't published, it can only hurt you.  Either the judge will presume you were trying to mislead them, or they will assume that the case wasn't published for a reason.  I just have not found it worthwhile to cite those cases. Still these are only minor points.  Overall this book is well written and well reseached.  A DUI attorney could, but shouldn't, rely only on this book and still come out well in court.  It is well done and a good read.
