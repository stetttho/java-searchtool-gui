 If you like to smile, this book will make you laugh.   It makes fun of everything from acting to work.  And while the jokes run the gambit from crude to sophisticated, a lot of them are adult orientated and sexually graphic.  In other words, this book is not for junior!  If you are over 18, however, I think you will think it is great fun.    While there are many funny ones, the jokes I like the best usually are rooted in reality in some strange way.   This morning I read about how, if a man gives his wife flowers without any reason, there probably is a reason the wife doesn't know about.  While not always true, it is true often enough to make me smile. In addition, some of you will probably find it useful for speechs and writing as it has a good index to quickly find that needed anedote.   Funny and useful?  What a buy. :)  Enjoy it and have a good time.
