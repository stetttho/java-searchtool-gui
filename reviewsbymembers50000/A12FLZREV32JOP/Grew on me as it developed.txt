 Visually, 'Apocalypse Now' is one of, if not the, most incredible films I have ever seen. Cinematically it is undoubtedly a masterpiece. The pacing of the movie is remarkable. I had problems with Apocalypse Now for most of the film because I thought it was too dramatic and detached. But by the end, I was completely submerged in it.  Captain Willard is played by Martin Sheen. He is instructed to kill Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), an apparently insane American who has broken away from the army to play a brutal God. Every character is fascinating and unsettling. Sheen and Brando are extraordinary in their disturbing roles, as is Robert Duvall as the lieutenant colonel who is at one with the war.  As Willard sails up the river, each place is slightly more surreal and wild than the last. The level of tension and activity rise until Willard reaches his destination. Then the story slows to almost a standstill. The final part of the movie is set apart in a mystical space. Then it all comes together.  Most viewers probably know that Apocalypse Now is based on Joseph Conrad's novella, "Heart of Darkness". It follows the book more closely than I imagined it would, especially in tone. However, Apocalypse Now is its own story.
