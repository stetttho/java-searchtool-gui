 This isn't a great epic, and it may have a few holes, but it's great fun! Funny and romantic, Lorna Doone is set in late 1600's England. John Ridd, who has a wonderful smile, hates the outlaws the Doones that plunder villiages and murder innocent people, including his father. As fate would have it, he meets a beautiful young Lorna, who also has a brilliant smile. They immediately fall in love. When John finds out she is a Doone, in fact, the QUEEN of them, it is too late for him. He is already too deep in her spell. He plans on rescuing her from the terrible home she has, but Carver Doone messes everything up. He has always been destined to be Lorna's husband, and he won't let some farmer's boy take his obsession away from him. He is personally my favorite character played by Aidan Gillen, even though it is a kind of corny part. The music and the scenery are breathtakingly beautiful in this classic swashbuckling romance.
