 It begins on a cold winter day when strong winds blow a beautiful wanderer (Juliette Binoche) and her illegitamate child into a fridgid town. She opens up a seductive chocolate shop that shocks and infuriates the town mayor and most of the local residents. Obsessed with moderation, the mayor is determined on driving her and her Chocolate shop out of the town (which initially backfires). However, before his plans can take full effect, the stranger warms up the townspeople's cold spirits with smiles and the seemingly magic chocolate. She happily chips away the ice that surrounds the town until a handsome gypsy comes her way. This makes her think twice about her constant need to travel and resistance to belonging. It ends deliciously, and gives you a fabulous feeling. Chocolat is a dreamy and sweet movie that I thoroughly enjoyed watching. It was beautifully filmed, and the acting was fantastic. Juliette Binoche was charming and beautiful, and even though he had a fairly small role, Johnny Depp was gorgeous and sported awesome Irish accent. This movie is pretty funny at times too! I loved the priest (a young admirer of Elvis) and thought he was so cute - the mayor controlled him so far as to rewrite his sermons. The only thing I didn't really like in Chocolat was that it promoted sensuality. Sure, you should certainly enjoy life, and a little pleasure in chocolate won't hurt anyone, but moderation is not bad. According to the mayor, someone who fasts and pracitces intense moderation is better than a friendly, kind "sinner". I don't agree with that. You should be more unselfish than self-indulgent. I won't give the movie too much rap, though, for the main character is giving.  ANYWAY, I loved the music and thought the movie was simply delightful. Definitely worth seeing.
