 'Memento' is a very well made film. The main character Leonard makes genuinely surprising discoveries throughout his search for the man who murdered his wife. This is a revenge movie in which I actually felt sympathy for the protagonist, for, though 'Memento' is primarily a thriller, it does not gloss over the sorrow Leonard feels about his wife. Unfortunately, Leonard is also very confused and vulnerable because the man who killed Leonard's wife also injured Lenny in the head, causing him to have very short short term memory. One of the main themes of 'Memento' is how crummy people are - and how people will manipulate each other at any chance they get.  'Memento' is famous for being told "backward". One thread plays forward, another, which involves most of the action in the story, works backward, scene by scene. It works well, and is more than a gimmick. The climax is neither predictable nor over the top, and is one of the best I have seen in a while.  The acting is astounding, particularly by Carrie Ann Moss. As her character gradually unfolds, the viewer sees the greatly varied facets of her personality. Joe Palantino is an excellent actor, and he is perfectly cast as an untrustworthy but seemingly helpful cop. Guy Pearce successfully plays Leonard Shelby, who is alternately lost, driven, disciplined, and frazzled. Each main character is sympathetic in some way but has a supremely unpleasant streak.  Due to its intricate plot, carefully attended details, and complex character motives, 'Memento' holds up on repeated viewings. Highly recommended.
