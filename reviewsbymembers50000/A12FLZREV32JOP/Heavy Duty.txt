 P. D. James is never afraid to tackle the dark side of human nature. In A Certain Justice, that is made apparant. It begins with the trial of Gary Ashe, an obvious psychopath who is accused of brutally killing his aunt. Venetia Aldridge, as usual, proves her expertise as a defense attourney by getting the young man off. She regrets it when she finds out that, only a week after the trial, he and her 18 year old daughter are "in love". That sends her into a slight state of hysterics. She turns to her married lover for help to find that he is dumping her. Now, throughout her lifetime, she had gathered many enemies, including her fellow lawyers. With all these terrible events in her life, she takes her anger and despair out on everyone more than ever. So it is no big surprise when she is found dead. Inspector Dagleish enters the story here. There are many likely suspects, but Dagleish thinks that this was a murder that came from the depths of someone's sorrow, not just ambition. The story also focuses on Ashe and Octavia Aldridge. Once again, an impeccably acted, very heart wrenching story is told with Inspector Dagleish. It made me read the book, and I was happy to see that it followed it very closely.
