 12 Monkeys is about a convict from the future. Earth's air is infected with a deadly virus that has wiped out something like 99% of the population. Those who are alive live underground. The convicts "volunteer" to help the scientists collect data on the surface with special suits on. Some of them even have to travel back through time to collect information. This convict, played by Bruce Willis, is the star of this story. He is supposed to get sent back to the year that the virus is released, but he is accidentally sent back five years before the virus is supposed to be sent. Everyone thinks he is a raving lunatic including a very pretty psychologist (Madeline Stowe, who does a fabulous American accent). There, he meets fellow nutcase Jeffery Goines (I hope that's spelled right) who really is crazy! Anyway, he travels through time, and gradually, the story unfolds. A sad romance also grows between him and the psychologist. There are many unanswered questions. You may find the answers to them if you watch it more than once, though, and pay very close attention. This sounds very confusing, and it is. But it is ever so cool.
