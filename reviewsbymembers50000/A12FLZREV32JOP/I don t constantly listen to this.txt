 Which is for the better, I think.  This is the type of album, for me, that I don't think about when I'm not listening to it. When I don't listen, I regret that I bought it. But when I listen, I thoroughly enjoy it. Definitely catchy, in a very fun, bouncy way, as has been said dozens of times here.  This album is not a necessity, but if you don't listen to it that much, it is a treat when you do.
