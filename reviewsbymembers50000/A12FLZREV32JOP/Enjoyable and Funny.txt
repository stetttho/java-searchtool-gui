 I saw a play version of Hello Dolly, and warmed right up to the light story and catchy tunes. The movie version is much more elaborate and blown-up (haha), however it is hilarious. Barbara Streisand makes a good Dolly Levi, a spritely, joyous matchmaker. But underneath her happiness she yearns to move on from her widowhood, despite her fond memories of her husband. She targets Horace Vandergelder (Walter Matthau), a single, half-millionare and owner of a Seed and Feed Store (okay, really not sure of that one), to be her second husband. Dolly goes about this by being his matchmaker and first matching him up with the pretty Irene Molloy, a hat-maker in "the city". Irene, played by Marianne McAndrew, is a sweet but lonely woman, who sings the lovely son "Ribbons Down My Back". The other plotline has Cornelius Hackl and Barnaby Tucker, Vandergelder's employees, escaping small town life and wooing Miss Molloy and her helper. All in all, quite corny and old fashioned, not for everyone, but some fantastic dance scenes and great instances. Streisand is wonderful. And I must mention that I was laughing all the way through at the thought that Michael Crawford, who played Cornelius, eventually played the sensuous, horrific Phantom of the Opera. In Hello Dolly, he is a gawky youth with a funny little voice, while in other instances (mostly later) Crawford has a beautiful, sweet singing voice. Nevertheless, I thought he was real cute and comical in Hello Dolly. Hello Dolly is not a deep or fantastic movie, but is definitely entertaining and nice.
