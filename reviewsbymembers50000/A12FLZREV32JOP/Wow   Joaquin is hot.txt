 When I watched this movie, I thought it was going to be a mindless action romp. I was proved wrong. Despite the graphic violence (I had to close my eyes on some parts), it was definitely an amazing movie. It was so beautifully filmed and acted. The characters seemed slightly odd to our standards. That just gave the feel that this really was more than one thousand years ago and almost a completely different world. Even though the fighting was gory, it was always well choreographed. Russel Crowe did a fabulous job as a brave and honorable fighter (he's awesome!), as did everyone. I definitely suggest this movie, despite the bloodiness (if that's a word). I know I haven't told much about the plot, but there really isn't a very complicated one. P.S. As the emperor, Joaquin Phoenix is great. He's a pretty sick guy but still gorgeous.
