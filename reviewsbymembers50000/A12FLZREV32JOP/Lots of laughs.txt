 Before I saw this movie I thought it would have another Independence Day scenario, the aliens are going to take over the world and I assumed the Men In Black had to save us. Not so. The aliens have already taken over the world, and the MIB are just monitoring them and going about their daily business. (I hope I haven't given too much away!) However, much to the dismay of veteran Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) and new recruit Agent J (WIll Smith) a bug donning a brand new Edgar suit (Vincent D'Onofrio) has just crash landed on Earth, certain to reek havoc. Lets just say this is definitely entertaining! Tommy Lee Jones is great as the funny yet cool as a cucumber "old guy", while Will Smith has lots of great one liners as the policeman turned MIB agent. At first I though Dr. Laurel Weaver, played by Linda Fiorentino, was an unnecessary character put in there just because she was beautiful and they needed a romance. But the next time I saw it, I thought scenes with her in it were actually pretty comical. As for me, my favorite character was the bug - he didn't fit properly in the skin of a human, acted like such a cretan, but was still sarcastic. He was hilarious! (Vincent D'Onofrio can play anything, I swear.) All in all, hysterical movie (funnywise) that is probably worth seeing, if only for its entertainment value.
