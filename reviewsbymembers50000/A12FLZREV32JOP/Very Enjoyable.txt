 I really enjoyed this movie. At first I was reluctant to watch it, generally disliking teen movies, but then I remembered it was an 80's film. For some reason, though 'Sixteen Candels' is pretty crude, it doesn't seem to be as blatant or unrealistic as the modern day teen-flicks. The story is about a girl, Samantha (not Sam), who has her "sweet" sixteen. Unfortunately, not even her visiting Grandparents remember it, her crush seems to be completely unaware of her, and all she can console herself with is some freeky freshmen who thinks he is God's gift to women. (Frighteningly, I know a few guys just like that kid.) The acting and everything is fine, but I didn't really think too much about it. I just watched the movie.
