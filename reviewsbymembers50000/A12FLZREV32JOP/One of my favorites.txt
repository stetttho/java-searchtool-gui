 A drug dealer enlists two conmen to help him retrieve a drug-filled doll from a blind woman.  Audrey Hepburn is very credible as the lovely Susie Hendrix, a feminine and insightful lady who has recently lost her eyesight in an accident. Efrem Zimbalist Jr. plays her rigid but compassionate husband; one of his emotional reactions is my only problem with the movie, and even that can be overlooked. Julie Herrod is the bratty but fairly well drawn Gloria, and Richard Crenna and Jack Weston play the two conmen. Jack Weston's character is the simpler of the two, and Richard Crenna is the dishonest but convincingly charming. The intelligent Harry Roat (or however you spell it) is played by Alan Arkin. Roat is just creepy. He gives bad vibes. 'Wait Until Dark' is one of my favorite films. The mood, supported by music, excellent acting, and an interesting plot, remains tense throughout the movie.
