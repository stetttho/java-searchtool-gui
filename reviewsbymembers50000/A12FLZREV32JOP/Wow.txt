 Devices and Desires is set in a picturesque English cove - save the massive nuclear power plant station contaminating the view. Dalgleish is there to sort out his inheritance from a recently deceased aunt who had lived there. However, he encounters an odd variety of people, some very likable, others despicable, and quite a few holding deep, dark secrets.  First of all, there is the problem of The Whistler, a serial killer who whistles a hymn while strangling his victims. He has already struck at least five times, one of them being a fifteen year old girl (that part is obviously very heart wrenching and scary!) Second of all, there is the strange problem with the nuclear power plant. One of the employees seems incredibly frustrated and distressed about the futute of the plant, but his boss and fellow employees cover it up by brushing it off and telling him to keep silent. Meanwhile, there is the anti-nuclear activist group who may be involved in terrorism. It is gradually being joined by some of the people who work at the plant. The Whistler strikes again, killing two female employees of the nuclear power station. Or, was it him? One of the killings certainly was, but the other is a bit unclear. The unclear death was a beautiful, intelligent, and witch of a woman who manipulated anyone she came across. There are lots of suspects. An alcoholic widower with a family to support, the head of the nuclear station, his sister, and a young environmentalist are just a few. This is far from a neat story with suicides and about ten murders. There are also incredibly adult themes such as incest, bisexuality, and the gross mark The Whistler puts on his bodies. Devices and Desires, however, is an amazing production with its complexity, excellent acting, and harsh realities.
