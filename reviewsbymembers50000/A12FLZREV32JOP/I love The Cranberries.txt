 This is my first (and presently, only) album by the Cranberries. The only difficulty this CD poses is a slight barrier to my assimilation of all their CDs - many songs on other albums are already on this CD. That's my biggest problem with compilation CDs.  That being said, I love every song on this CD. I was practically addicted to it when my sister first bought it, and I know she was. It was difficult to go a day without listening to it (I am not one to listen to a CD twice in one day).  The lyrics and music evoke such a distinct feeling; they strangely pinpointed some of the indescribable emotions and ideas (not profound, necessarily, just unusual) I was experiencing at the time we first got the CD.  The songs are haunting and catchy, but what with an individual edge that brings each piece wrenching emotion.  This is one of my favorite CDs. I cannot be objective.
