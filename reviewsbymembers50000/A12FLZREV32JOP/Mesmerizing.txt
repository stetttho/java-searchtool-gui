 When I first saw Gormenghast, I had no idea what I thought of it. By the end, though, I knew the answer. I absolutely LOVED it. At first I thought it would only be good because of the cute guy in it, but then I discovered its magnetism. It's so weird - I was not prepared for that. I think it was perfect, save a few nitpicks. The acting was amazing. Before I had gotten into the film I thought everyone was overacting, but then I understood why. Everything was overdone (in a good way), and each character represented something bigger in the world (i.e. communist, romantic, intillectual, etc.) The story was awesome, and the characters were hilarious, in a dark sort of way. I think that making this movie seem so lighthearted and then have such a dark view of society really contrasted and worked well. I especially liked Steerpike. He was beautiful, but he also played a hypnotizing character. I really recommend this movie that walks a fine line between comedy and tradgedy.
