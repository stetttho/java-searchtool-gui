 I wanted a griddle because the surface area and shape of frying pans prevent me from cooking as much food at one time as I would like.  I also don't like that most frying pans and stove burners don't match up to make a level cooking surface.  This griddle solves both very well.  It is perfectly flat, allowing the butter or oil to stay where you want it.  It is huge, holding 8 slices of French Toast at once and cooking them all evenly.    I have nothing but possitive things to say about this griddle.  It is exactly what I hoped for.  The only reason why I only gave 4 stars instead of five is that it would have been nice if it came with a cover.  None of them do, but that coupled with the fact that I got it for $10 cheaper then Amazon, on sale at Dillards, earns it 4 stars.
