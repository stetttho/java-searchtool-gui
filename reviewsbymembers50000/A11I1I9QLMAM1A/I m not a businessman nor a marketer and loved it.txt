 I read this book because marketting interests me and I enjoy reading non-fiction.  The Grapevine explains not only WOMM, but all forms of marketting, with examples and the pros and cons of each.    One of the other reviewers stated that The Grapevine is a 200+ page advertisement for Bzzagent.  I can see where he is coming from, but disagree.  I felt that the Grapevine is a book about a form of WOMM which BzzAgent is a proprieter of, not it does not focus purely on that particular outlet for WOMM.  Over all, I think this is a great book for anyone who wants to better understand the marketting industry, from billboards, to taxicab toppers, to radio, and including WOMM.
