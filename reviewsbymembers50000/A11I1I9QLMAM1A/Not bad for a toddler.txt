 I was looking for a laptop for my toddler because she won't stop touching my computer.  She seems to love it.  I wish that it had a bigger screen and did some educational things.  However, it was fairly cheap and resembles mine and that was the main thing I was looking for.  She's dropped it several times and it's still talking.  The things it does don't seem great, but what do you expect for 29.99?
