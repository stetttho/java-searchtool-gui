 When I bought this case I had a Palm V, and it fit great and seemed to be very capable of doing its job.  Unfortunately I quickly decided to return the Palm V and get a M500 instead.  Not wanting to return the case, I decided to use it with the M500.  Though I don't have any problems because of this, I wouldn't recommend it because the fit is not very good.  The Palm V fits in this case snuggly and securely, as it was designed for it.  While using it with the slightly thinner and smaller M500 seems to offer the same level of protection it has too much freedom to move around.  Another reason why I would recommend finding a differant case for the M500 is because wearing the case on the belt is a little bulky.  A slightly smaller case designed for the M500 would be a little less combersome on your belt.   If you need a case for a Palm V, this one is well made, offers protection for the screen on both sides, via hard plates, and seems to handle the everyday rigers of an outdoor job very well.
