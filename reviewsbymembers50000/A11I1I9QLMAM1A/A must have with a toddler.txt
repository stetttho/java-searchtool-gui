 I use the spotbot daily because I have a toddler.  When she spills her juice or her ravioli (with red sauce) or pees on the carpet (she is a toddler) I just fill the spot bot up with hot water (no need for soap unless it's a really bad stain) and put it on the spot and it's clean minutes later.  It does put clean circles all over the carpet, but clean circles are better than red spots.  It is extremly loud and it beeps without stopping when it's done (which means you need to be around it when it stops).  Besides that I have no complaints.
