 The manufacturer says to use their ink in their printer.  Of course they are.  Is it for a real reason, or just so they can make more money?  I don't know.  I go with the real thing, and haven't had any problems.  Probably wouldn't have any with refills or generic brands, but the differance in price doesn't make the experiment worthwhile to me.
