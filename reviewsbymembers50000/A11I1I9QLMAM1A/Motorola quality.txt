 This battery is the same high quality as the extended life Lithium Ion battery that came with your phone.  Talk and standby time lives up to the manufacturers specs.  My only complain is that hot weather seems to cause this battery to wear out fast.  I'm talking 110 degree Texas heat, so for most, this won't be a factor.
