 When you read the reviews for the various FM transmitters and the tape deck converters, you start to think that there is no way to successfully link your IPOD to a car that doesn't have a dock or a Aux plug in.    After reading the reviews I was sure that I was embarking on some sort of a Saga to find the system that would work in my city.  I went to a retail store, where the salesman vehimently recommended the Monster Cable product listed here.  They didn't have any in stock at that store, and I didn't have time to drive accross town to their other location which had seven in stock.  So I went home and saw that it was $20 cheaper on Amazon, so I ordered it.  I was learing about buying it mail order, because I was convinced by the reviewers that it wasn't going to work and I was going to have to return it.  (however you do that with Amazon, I don't know)  Anyway, if you read nothing else, read this line:  I plugged it in in my car, hooked in the IPOD, picked a random station using the instructions that are attached to the cord (very good place for instructions) and there it was.  Crystal clear success on my first attempt.  I drove about 30 minutes to the post office and back and never heard a lick of static nor did my signal fade a single time.    At least in Colorado Springs, CO, this product is flawless.
