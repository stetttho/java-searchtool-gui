 Kenneth Brannagh comes through for Shakespeare lovers in his role as director and as acting Henry V.  Henry V is probably Shakespeare's ideal Christian warrior king as portrayed in the three plays, Henry IV part I, party II and Henry V.  Brannagh brings him to life in this film.  Some background knowledge of the above three plays would help the audience understand the story of Henry V and other characters as they are shown in some of the flashbacks in the film.  A big part of the character from the plays is his transformation from prodigal to gracious and glorious king.  Brannagh captures some of that process using flashbacks to Henry V ("Hal's") days frolicking along with Falstaff and friends.  This film shows the process of Henry V deciding to go to war against France and the implementation of the war machine and actual battles.  We see his devotion to God and country through his turmoil and faith.  The movie shows the conflicts that arise in from our enemies and supposed friends.  I think Brannagh does a great job playing the king in all aspects.  The "Band of Brothers" speech is as good as it gets.  Like the rest of the play, Brannagh edits it down to the core essence and delivers it perfectly.  Like me, you will probably watch is over and over until it is memorized.  There are several other memorable speeches in this play from Brannagh.    The miracle of the Battle of Agincourt is a historical record of how the small and tattered English army defeated a much larger and fresher French foe.  As Henry V proclaims that "God fought for us this day."     There is just no reason not to purchase and enjoy this film.
