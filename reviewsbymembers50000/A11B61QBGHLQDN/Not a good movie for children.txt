 This purports to be a fun children's movie about a dog playing soccer and an orphan fitting in with his new family.  Instead, it has an evil twist that includes a demonic dog catcher that terrorizes the canines and mean-spirited children being nasty to other kids.  I ended up fast forwarding to only the dog playing soccer parts; the other parts were either too stupid, scary or ill-conceived to let my daughter watch them.  I don't know why a child's movie has to have such cruelty and nastiness.  Besides the above, the plot and dialogue is terribly crafted.  This is one I would definitely avoid--regardless of the cute cover that appeals to children.
