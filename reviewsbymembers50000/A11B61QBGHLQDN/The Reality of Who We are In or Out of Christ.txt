 Forde offers readers a remarkable perspective on living the Christian life in true devotion to Christ versus living for self glory.  This is by all means not just a book for theologians and scholars.  This book speaks to any person earnest about worshipping Jesus in Spirit and in Truth.    The content of this book is an antidote to the self-glorifying message shared by many Christian leaders today.  Forde pulls no punches in interpreting and explaining Luther's right-on analysis of Biblical truths.    The end result of the book is self-examination and reformation before the cross of Christ, the power and wisdom of God.  This books message is one of true liberation from self-righteousness and legalism; this message brings freedom and life.  Read this book and become crucified with Christ that you might also be raised  in him.
