 Shutter Island offers an exhilerating, suspenseful and well-written read.  The tale provides plenty of second-guessing and unknowns, until the truth is finally revealed.  There is no fluff, tangents or lack of reality in this book.  Set in the 1950's psychiatric facility on an isolated island during a hurricane--anything can happen.  This is a great page-turner.
