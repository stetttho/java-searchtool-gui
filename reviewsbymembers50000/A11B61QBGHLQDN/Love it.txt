 I can't seem to listen to this cd enough.  It is perfect for listening to while working out or doing anything around the house.   I think this cd will be a timeless classic rock cd.  The songs have an excellent combination of lyrics, sung beautifully, and rock music.  I think as a whole this is one of the best cd's I have listened to in a while.  I hope they can match it in the future.
