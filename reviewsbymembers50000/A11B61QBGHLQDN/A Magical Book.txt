 The Agnes Browne books by O'Carroll make a wonderfully written series.  I have loved The Mammy, Chisellers and The Granny.  I think O'Carroll reached near perfection with The Granny...I think it is the best of the series.  You will love it.  This book will bring you to tears and to laughter.  I only wish it was longer.
