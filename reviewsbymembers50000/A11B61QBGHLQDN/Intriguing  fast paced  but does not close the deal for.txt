 On its own, this book is good, but it doesn't reach the level set by Reich's previous novels.  This one got bogged down at times in financial complexities, too many characters and organizations.  But, it is enjoyable and entertaining.  The plot is believable in this time of constant terror warnings.  The writing is intelligent and smooth.  I think the conclusion is the main area where Reich did not hit his usual home run.  I would call it a double--not disappointing but also not thrilling.  The book could have used an epilogue or a few more chapters.  It is still a 4/5 stars for entertainment and quality.  I think his previous books have been 5/5 stars and I expected it from this book too.  It definitely kept my interest but didn't keep me up at night reading.  There is no doubt in my mind that I will continue to read his books at first opportunity.
