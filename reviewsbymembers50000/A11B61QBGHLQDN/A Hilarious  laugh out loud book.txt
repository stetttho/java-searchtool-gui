 I listened to this book on tape, read by the author.  I really enjoyed his humor.  Sedaris makes observations about his life and laughs at himself and his family.  He doesn't take anything too seriously and is usually the subject of his own jokes. It was a treat listening to him, because he does accents and imitations quite well, but I think this book would be just as funny if I had read it. A good portion of the book focuses on his time in France.  His tales of trying to learn and speak French are too funny. It is hard to explain why this book is so funny, but it definitely is.
