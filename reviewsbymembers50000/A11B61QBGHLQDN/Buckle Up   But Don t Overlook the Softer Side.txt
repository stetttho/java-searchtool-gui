 "I'm going to do what I do best. I'm going to kill them all."  So begins Creasy's (Washington's) quest for revenge and annihilation of a kidnapping ring that has created havoc and misery in Mexico City.   Creasy's passion is due to the kidnapping of a young girl he was guarding, Pita.  Her presence in his life has transformed this one-time assassin from attempted suicide and whiskey drinker to a man who appreciates life and reads the Bible.  The story is thrilling and from the begining has a high level of suspense.  It is incredibly violent, as it shows the cruelty of the kind of people that prey on children and their parents.  The revenge Creasy takes is equally violent but seems reasonable for those kind of people.  In the midst of the violence is redemption for Creasy and salvation for others.  The subject of this movie is disturbing but it is very well done I think.  The supporting characters are all played well, and Washington offers a very convincing performance.  Definitely entertaining!  If you like action, watch this one.
