 the Two Towers continues the exciting story of the fellowship of the ring.  It offers more excitement and suspense as well as several surprises.  Tolkien consistently stretches the reaches of imagination, and he always provides logic and reason so that his story makes sense and follows a consistent stream of creativity. As I read the rings trilogy, I found that it was helpful to have seen to the movies to help picture the events, characters, and surroundings. Of course, the movies made much more sense after reading the books, but I found reading the books more enjoyable than the movies. I am really glad that I decided to read them at a friend's suggestion. Tolkien is an excellent writer. This book along with the others is intelligently written. It is not just kid's stuff. It is stimulating reading. He tells a great story filled with complex characters and plots. The story follows a logical and understandable path that sparks the readers full imagination and range of emotions. This book offers some of the severest character conflicts in the books as the characters must make sharp decisions about their actions and alliances.  It introduces new characters and species that offer fresh starts throughout the story.  This book of the story in no way serves as a filler or drags on and on.  It is filled with action and suspense.  There is no let up in the action at all. And don't think that since you have seen the movie, you don't need to read the book. If you liked the movie at all, you will indeed enjoy the book, especially if your one criticism of the movie is that it didn't make sense. The book will fill in the gaps and will cause you to appreciate the movie much more.
