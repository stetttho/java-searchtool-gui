 Anthony Lloyd does an exceptional job putting into words the events he witnessed during the war in Bosnia and the events of his life. This is somewhat of a diamond in the rough book.  It surprised me with its poetic memoir qualities as well as succeeding in painting a picture of the realities of the war. Lloyd shows that he cannot only take pictures but he can also create pictures with his words.  He was at the center of much of  action in this war and created relationships with people and leaders on all sides.  His story offers many insights about the details of this war, including the tragedies. It is also a personal tale of his life, his struggles with addiction and struggles in his family and with friends.   This book really does not fit into a particular category except the 5 star category.
