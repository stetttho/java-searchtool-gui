 I had delayed watching Rundown because I assumed it would be poorly scripted with less than adequate actors.  I finally got it when my dad and I wanted to watch a tough entertaining movie.  We were definitely satisfied with Rundown.  The Rock comes through solidly as an action figure--tough guy.  His moves are good and his acting passes.  The script is entertaning.  Christopher Walken fills a gap lacking in many action movies.  His character is ruthless but witty.  The combination of actors and actresses gives a good balance, and the story is positive.  If you are looking for a good action movie, check out Rundown.
