 This book is a work of art.  Plath's poetic skill comes shining through in this novel about a young woman suffering from severe depression and suicidal ideation.  Plath's use of words to convey images, feelings, thoughts and personality is precise.  The story flows beautifully, as she tells the story of Esther Greenwood. Esther's fall into depression reveals in depth insights into the malady that come from Plath's own experiences.  This brings up an issue when reading this book.  It is difficult to separate the character and the novel from the author and her own life and tragic ending.  That consistently loomed in the back of my mind as I read about E. Greenwood. I enjoyed reading this, but also had to put it down at times because of the depressing nature of the story.  Plath puts the reader into the thoughts and consciousness of a depressed young woman, and that is not an uplifting experience.  I don't think this is the type of novel you just read for pleasure w/o becoming involved with the character.  Plath wants to make sure you know what it is like to be a depressed person thinking about suicide. It has an optimistic ending that allows you to leave Esther Greenwood to take on the world again and to trust that she will do OK, even though the author fell victim to the depression that haunted her.
