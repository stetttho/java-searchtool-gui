 Lawrence McAuliffe has written an entertaining, creative and thought-provoking novel.  His story consists of all of the ingredients that I think readers desire in fiction.  He writes eloquently, even exquisitely at times.  He uses imagery and descriptions that will make you stop to re-read lines several times to savor them.  He superbly develops diverse characters: a southern-black couple--the man a Vietnam War Veteran, a Wyoming newspaper editor, a Vietnam Veteran freelance writer/loner, a Vietnamese woman, an ex Vietcong soldier, Buddhist monks, and an American soldier searching for a connection to God-all true to life, dead-on accurate portrayals. The story is about war, life, death, redemption, reconciliation, remembering and relationships with God and others.  McAuliffe skillfully crafts the events so that they stir the reader's imagination and lead to variable interpretations and insights.  He doesn't just tell a story; he presents episodes of life, drawing the reader into the circumstances.  As he was a soldier and chaplain in the war, he writes with the experience of action and the wisdom of a spiritual mentor. This book succeeds at combining fiction with spirituality, something many books try and fail to do.  Although shorter in length, Purple Sun is written in the classic tradition of Les Miserables by Hugo and Brothers Karamazov by Dostoevsky, and A Farewell to Arms by Hemingway, and it reminds me of A Separate Peace by John Knowles, also a story focusing on relationships before a backdrop of war.  As soon as I finished it, I thought of several people to share it with right away.  I think you will appreciate the author's honest, humble approach to writing about serious issues without being overly serious.  This book will definitely speak to you; only you can find out what it will say to you.
