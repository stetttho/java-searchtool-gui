 Mr. Conroy is arguably one of the best writers living.  This memoir focuses on his senior year at The Citadel, The Military College of SC-recently in the headlines for the losing battle to remain all-male.  It offers keen insights into his life through writing of the highest level. Conroy's tale follows his senior year but also delves into his life as it centers around his basketball and academic careers.  At the forefront of the scenes from his life is the maniacal behavior of his father, an abusive, sadistic marine who was a tortuous figure throughout Conroy's youth. I found the story of Conroy's development as a lover of books and as a writer extremely interesting.  One could even surmise that all the events of his life served as ingredients to making him a great novelist. One cannot help but to ride on the emotional rollercoaster that this book creates as it follows Conroy's ups and downs on and off the basketball court.  As he writes about specific games he played, it reads like the play-by-play to the NCAA championship game, which every game was to Conroy. The book offers great details about his relationships to other players and people in his life, including teachers, who made a lasting mark on him. As a Citadel graduate and athlete, I found the memoir to paint accurate illustrations of life as a Citadel athlete, trying to excel in a sport when everything seems to be against you-the school, the coach, the students-everything. I don't think any reader will be disappointed in this book.  I highly recommend it.
