 Wilbur Smith is an incredible writer.  He writes eloquently while providing the reader with an action-packed story.  I bought Wild Justice off the new paperback shelf and was disappointed to get home and see that it was actually written in 1979.  I thought because it is a thriller that deals with terrorism, intrigue and military special operations that it would be dated, but I was impressed at how prescient Smith was when writing this book.  The plot could be set in 2003 with only minor changes.  The organizational conflicts and terrorist strategies are accurate and insightful.  The date of the writing does not lessen the book's impact and effect at all. As far as the story, it has everything a thriller needs and more.   Secretive terrorists, special forces, good and evil and gray areas.  It has a very well-written romance.  It has crises of conscience and morals. This sounds cliche but I could not put it down over the four days  it took me to read it.  I felt good about the ending, too.  I have not yet been disappointed by Smith's book, which is great because he has written about 30.
