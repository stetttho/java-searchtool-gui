 This book educated me more about the history of slavery in the USA than any other thing.  The author's investigation about his family's history of owning slaves spares no facts, however disturbing they are.  It traces the history of the slave trade and focuses on the slave business of Charleston, SC where his family settled and started several plantations where many slaves lived and worked.  He finishes his exploration by describing his presence at the family reunion of his family's slaves' ancestors.  This book explains the plights of slaves and slaveowners without any slant caused by some political agenda.  It is a straightforward presentation of slavery and its consequences.  The evils of slavery become apparent by the mere description of history. Ball meanders at some times in ways that may not be interesting to some readers; however, I appreciated some of the details about the history of South Carolina and its environment.   I think this book accomplishes a healing and educational purpose that trancends Ball's family and reaches to all Americans, as we have all been affected negatively by the heritage of slavery in this country.
