 I ordered and read this book after having a daughter.  I wanted to learn how I can help her grow up strong and able to fend for herself and not become a victim of any sorts.   For the most part this book was a revelation to me about the reality women face...a reality of danger, threats, bullying, discrimination, etc.  It made me put myself in the shoes of the women walking to her car in a dark parking lot who fears for her safety and life due to potential dangers.  Ms. Snortland shows how fear is often present in daily situations women encounter. She also indicates changes in attitude and lessons in defense that can improve a women's posture in the world.  It has encouraged me to sign my daughter up for self-defense classes as soon as it is age-appropriate.  I garnered a much better understanding of many societal attitudes my daughter will face as she grows up.  It will really help me be a better father to her. A downside to this book is Snortland's political advocacy.  It is clear where she stands politically and on certain issues she conveys the message that women who disagree are being duped by a male-dominated society. To me this is a totally different issue than what the book purports to focus on.   She should stick to defending women not politics. The above criticism aside, the book is worthwhile for its main message and was helpful.
