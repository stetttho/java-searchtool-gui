 Michael Gelb provides readers with insightful glimpses of ten of history's most important thinkers.  Each person offers a particular  characteristic that Gelb emphasizes to teach the reader how he/she can imitate the great ones.  His profiles of each person also give the reader brief biographies covering the highlights of their lives and contributions.  These were enlightening for the people I was not familar with before and even for the ones I am very familar with like Shakespeare.  Gelb brings out details that are new to me about the famous Bard that I thought I knew inside and out.  He also discusses their weaknesses, such as Einstein's undisciplined personal life that contrasted greatly with his ideas of an orderly universe.  This book prompted me to do some creative thinking of my own and I hope it gave me some long-lasting ideas about how to develop and utilize my own abilities.
