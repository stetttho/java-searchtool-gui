 Ms. Drayton opens her heart and her life in this book as she shares her testimony about overcoming the battles waged against her by those who oppose the work of God and her ministry.  The story Ms. Drayton shares centers on a confrontation between her and other "Christians" during a scheduled prayer meeting.  Her story demonstrates the truth of the scriptures warning of wolves in sheeps clothing who will come to tear apart the church.  She shows that there are indeed wolves in the church and that they indeed resemble sheep.  However, these wolves are, like Satan, prowling around seeking whom they may devour.  Ms. Drayton shows the battle that rages at such times when true believers seek God and face opposition of Satan and his minions.  The witchcraft she faced is described in summary as people "praying" against her and her family.  She and her family suffered during this time, but she praises God that He blessed her in the battle and brought her through victoriously.  She also shares a good bit of personal testimony about how God has worked on her behalf in her career, children and marriage.  She offers many scriptures to support her points and stories, and she concludes with a helpful chapter in which she lists many of the things she has learned through her experience.  It would be much better to learn about witchcraft in the church by reading this book rather than experiencing it yourself by surprise.  Ms. Drayton's account is eerily similar to an experience I had in the church at the hands of two fellow pastors.  It happens because wolves want control and power, and they are very intimidated and threatened by servants of the Lord.  This is a well written book that will bless you and warn you.
