 I think Braine offers helpful suggestions for those who want to writer readable and sellable fiction.  His provides insights learned from experience writing and reading.  He is careful to emphasize that what he advises is what has worked for him and what he has learned and that it is not gospel.  But, he does offer some practical do's and don't's regarding writing, especially when discussing technical things like writing narrative, dialogue, and different points of view.  He inserts many poignant examples of good and bad writing that support the points he is making.  Like the other writers writing about writing, Braine comes to the point that the bottom line is that writers ignore many things and sacrifice others to write and write--writing is work and takes discipline and suffering.  And, Braine is able to offer encouragement and hope that it can be rewarding.  I found the audio cassette at the library and recommend it to you.
