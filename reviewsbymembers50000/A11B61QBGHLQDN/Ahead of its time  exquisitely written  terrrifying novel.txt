 I was surprised by the literary beauty of this book and by its intriguing horror.  It was not at all what I had expected based on my exposure to Frankenstein movies and tales.  This story is quite different in many ways that make it more appealing to the reader. The tale involves a monster that is truly hideous in form but reveals a conflicted mind and heart.  Shelley effectively causes the reader to have mixed feelings about this creature that wields destruction while confessing its own misery and affection for humanity. She also conveys the dangers of a person pursuing his or her ambition at the cost of other values such as relationships and peace.   The novel is told in an innovative fashion.  Shelley uses three different narrators to tell the story.  This creates some variety in the point of view and in the voice of the narrator.   This book is very compelling, but at times I had to put it down due to the tragedy of it.  The whole time you know where its events are leading and a part of you wants to go there and another part wants to avoid it--like watching Titanic, you know it is going to sink but you still hold out some hope it won't and you try to avoid its definitive demise. I think this is a horror story that has yet to be surpassed in literature.  I really felt for the characters, including the monster. I was completely entertained by the skillful writing.
