 The Nazarene paints a vivid, colorful picture of the historical era of Christ in the land of Israel.  Asch excels in describing the culture, geography, politics and religious atmosphere in which Christ lived.  Although, this book is slow in action, it is truly rich in character and background development. Readers of the Bible will see many of its holes filled in by knowledgeable contentions on the part of Asch who seems a keen expert on the times of Christ.  He oddly uses a narrative technique involving citizens of 1930's Poland who have connected with their past lives.  In their past lives, they interacted in the events surrounding Christ's life, and they tell the story from their past lives' perspective.  I found this aspect of the novel strange and unnecessary.  Asch could have excluded the "reincarnation" scenario and just scripted an historical novel based on the known events of Christ's life.  This is not a quick read and was slow and methodical but provides such insight into Biblical events that it is worthwhile.  Asch is a jewish writer but does not contradict Christian beliefs; he rather offers the reader varying accounts of characters in the book, as history itself has done.
