 The Passion cd's keep raising the bar for Christian praise and worship music.  The 13 songs recorded live on this cd project a spiritual earnestness that only comes by much prayer prior to the music being played and sung.  Passion's music, more than any other I think, draws one into the spirit of Worship and turns one's focus to God.  With several leaders singing the songs, there is not a focus on any person or star.  The focus of the cd is on the Lord.  The songs offer great upbeat music and variety.  They keep the listener focused on the message.  You can really experience the excitement of that "one-day" event where this was recorded.  I have four Passion cd's, and I think this one rates at the top.  It is like a great book that I can't put down.  I want to continually listen to it and get caught up in the Praise that glorifies Jesus.  Thanks and congratulations to the Passion team that comes together each year to bless us with wonderful music.
