 This was without compare the slowest, painstaking read yet for me.  I am in a book club with two others and neither finished it because it is so heavy.  I found enough treasures in it to keep me going, but it was tough. The book is strong on character development and dialogue but weak on action and plot advancement.  Dostoyevsky takes many opportunities to discuss philosophy, theology/spirituality and politics.  Most of these treatsies are enlightening as are the characters speaking. I have so often seen quotations taken from this book that I expected to enjoy it much more than I did.  It felt like work, but I am done and glad that I read it.  I'm sure you will be too if you can get through it.
