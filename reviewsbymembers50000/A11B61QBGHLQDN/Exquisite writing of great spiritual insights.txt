 Dark Night of the Soul captures startling insights into the path of holiness and purity---the path of knowing God.  St. John of the Cross illustrates the product of his earnest seeking of God in this book that seems to gain wisdom and understanding that are on a level rarely if ever seen in books.  I was literally amazed at how this book explained the events I had experienced on my spiritual journey.  Unlike most books that speak of blessings, man's abilities, reaching goals through God, this book focuses on the time in the desert, the purging of man's heart, the dying to all things not of God, the journey in the valley of the shadow of death, and the purposes of God for our soul.  It offers the reader a different view of spirituality than the modern books, because like few men or women before him or since, St. John of the Cross shunned the pleasures of the world to gain the fullness of God's presence.  His writing is sometimes difficult to read because it is so heavy with spritual wisdom and assumes a high level of spiritual and theological maturity in the reader.  I read more than a few lines several times before I got the point--I read this over several weeks...a chapter or so at a time.    I recommend this for readers seeking a closer relationship for God and for those seeking understanding about spiritually dry and difficult times in their lives.  No other book I have read offers such a deep description of times when God seems distant and his blessings amiss.  St. John of the Cross inspires one to seek God more fully and in earnest.
