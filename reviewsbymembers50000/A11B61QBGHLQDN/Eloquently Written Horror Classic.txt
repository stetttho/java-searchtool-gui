 Frankenstein exceeded my expectations that were based on movies I have seen by the same title.  This book is a literary masterpiece that sets a bar for terror that is yet to be surpassed. I was very impressed by the writing skill of Shelley.  She does a terrific job telling this story, using three narrators that offer different points of view and voices. The monster is a character that elicited sympathy, respect, anger and hatred.  He is intelligent and articulate in a way I did not expect.  His ability to convey emotions and thoughts creates mixed emotions about him.  Yet, because his hatred and anger prevail, these emotions prevailed in me too in my regards of him. Shelley shows the danger of allowing one's ambitions to overtake balance and reason.  We see the character of Dr. Frankenstein forsake all to see this dream of creating life realized.  We see the consequences of his actions that are a warning to us to tread more cautiously regarding our ambitions. All of the characters are developed comprehensively. I enjoyed reading this but had to set it aside at times because of the tragedy it entails.  You know where the story is headed but still hold out some hope that it will turn out more positively--like watching Titanic, you know it is going to sink but still hope maybe it won't. I think this is a timeless classic you should read.
