 Ms. Kirshenbaum has demonstrated incredible creativity in designing, writing and printing this book.  The pages are magnificently picturesque and stimulating, some even are visual overwhelming.  I can't imagine the time, skill and effort expended to create this artwork.  The book is an example and a story about the history of writing and communication.  Ms. Kirshenbaum offers a plethora of stories and quotes regarding subjects related to both topics.  She also shares her own experiences of the frustrations and rewards of teaching children.  This is a book that people with interest in art or graphic design would really cherish and appreciate.  I think teachers might also be inspired by the ideas presented in it.
