 This is an entertaining,light-hearted book that was very enjoyable, even humorous at times.  If you are looking for a book that is well-written and witty but not too deep or moving, this is a good choice.  A great book for relaxation and joy reading.  Some of the writing is exceptional and will have you chuckling.
