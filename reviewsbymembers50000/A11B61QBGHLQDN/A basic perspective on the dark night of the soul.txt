 I applaud Dr. May's honest attempt to illuminate the mysteries of the dark night of the soul.  He writes a sincere overview of his perspective on St. John of the Cross' and Teresa of Avila's writings concerning what John calls the dark night of the soul, the title to one of his books.   Dr. May is a renown psychiatrist but is not a theologian.  I would say he writes this as a lay-person seeking to understand a complex topic.  I have read St. John's "Dark Night of the Soul" and found insightful, meaningful thoughts relevant to my life in it.  From Dr. May, I gained some understanding of the dark night by his careful analysis; however, his writing lacks the level of Christian maturity that I think is required to write in depth about the writings of giants of Christian literature like John and Teresa.  That said, reading this book was helpful but not necessarily revelatory.  There is some psychoanalysis of the dark night and some references and tangents related to other non-Christian religions that I think were out of place when discussing writings and persons that are fully rooted in Christianity.  Dr. May attempts to write of the dark night as involving the relationship with God, but fails to emphasize the relationship with Jesus.  Teresa and John identify themselves as in Christ--they are not mere seekers of God but are disciples of Christ, so the dark night does not make sense except in light of the cross of Christ.  A main point that Dr. May emphasizes that is helpful is that the dark night is not a single event in life but is rather something can can occur several times in cycles.  During a lifetime,a person my experience many nights and many dawns.  He also helps the reader to identify signs of what he thinks are and are not indications of the dark night.  Overall, this is a helpful book but not eye-opening, and I appreciate it and Dr. May's attempt to get his hands around such a deep, mysterious topic and share it with his readers.
