 This true story of the whaleship Essex caught and held my attention as I read through it as quickly as I could.  Even though non-fiction, it reads like an adventurous novel---a much better read than Moby Dick.    The author includes the historical context and taps several sources to provide details about the tragedy, as well as the whaling industry.  I think this book has what it takes to appeal to all readers.  It is insightful, reavealing, entertaining and suspenseful while being entirely unique.    My wife and I both read it within a week and highly recommend it.
