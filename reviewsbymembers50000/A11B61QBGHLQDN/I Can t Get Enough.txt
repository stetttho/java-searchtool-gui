 Will Ferrell is one of my all-time favs from SNL.  I rented this DVD first and liked it so much I bought it to add to my collection of SNL best-of's. This contains most of his funny characters...the Professor and his "lover," the cowbell skit, Pres Bush, Craig the cheerleader, the morning show, and of course the high school music director.  These are great to have on hand to pop in when I want a laugh. There are a few skits missing...I wish they had put the skit when he is in the backyard yelling at the kids to "Get off the Shed"!!! But overall, I think the hits are here.   If you are a Will Ferrell fan, I don't see how you can be disappointed with this collection of skits.
