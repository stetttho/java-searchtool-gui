 This was rivetting, even though it has some serious story flaws (what movies don't these days?).  It creates suspense and intrigue while causing the audience to care about the main characters who we want to see make it through this terrible ordeal. The idea of a virus of rage may be surreal but it allows the movie to show how some people even w/o the virus behave as rageful animals toward other humans while others behave with compassion.  It also makes me look at all of the violence I absorb into my mind and how it affects me. Although there are no big stars in this movie, it is well done.  Like Trainspotting, by the same director, it is disturbing at times to watch but also rewarding at times.  It shows the best and worst of humanity. With all that said, it is gruesome and has horrible scenes that are not appropriate for the young or those who do not like to watch horror. You will think about this one afterwards!!
