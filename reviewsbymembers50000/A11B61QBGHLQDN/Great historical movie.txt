 The Black Robe offers entertaining insights into the cultures of Native Americans in the face of approaching settlers/pioneers.  The focus is on a Jesuit Priest who has left France and then the safety of a French Fort to venture into the wilderness in hopes of connecting with an Indian tribe.  The movie conveys the commitment and utter sacrifice the priest makes to reach these people. I think this movie offers an accurate glimpse of how the Indian tribes lived and clashed with each other and with the elements.   The interaction between the humans and each person's inner questioning and conflicts reveals much about faith, acceptance and life in general. The scenery of the movie is amazing and alone would make the movie worth watching. The story has sparked my interest in the events, so that I want to look into reading the book. It looks like the author and director were sincere in their efforts to tell a historically accurate story.
