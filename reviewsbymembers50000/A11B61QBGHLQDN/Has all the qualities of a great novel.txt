 The Fellowship of the Ring not only lays the foundation for the rings trilogy but shoots the reader off on an entertaining ride through danger, intrigue, mystery, and battles between good and evil.  In this book, Tolkien develops the characters and backgrounds of the story and also includes suspense and excitement along the way.   As I read the rings trilogy, I found that it was helpful to have seen to the movies to help picture the events, characters, and surroundings.  Of course, the movies made much more sense after reading the books, but I found reading the books more enjoyable than the movies.  I am really glad that I decided to read them at a friend's suggestion. Tolkien is an excellent writer.  This book along with the others is intelligently written.  It is not just kid's stuff.  It is stimulating reading.   He tells a great story filled with complex characters and plots. The story follows a logical and understandable path that sparks the readers full imagination and range of emotions. When you buy this, you might as well buy all three books of the rings set because it is essentially one story divided into three books.  This book does not complete the story but only a section of it. And don't think that since you have seen the movie, you don't need to read the book.  If you liked the movie at all, you will indeed enjoy the book, especially if your one criticism of the movie is that it didn't make sense.  The book will fill in the gaps and will cause you to appreciate the movie much more.
