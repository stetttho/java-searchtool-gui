 In describing Lost in Translation, I can say that Bill Murray is a funny actor regardless of the setting.  I don't think many if any actors could have pulled off this role as well as he does.   The movie presents glimpses of two people's lives as they befriend each other during their ennui in Japan.  The development of the relationship between Bill Murray's character Bob Harris and the character played by Scareltt Johansson is enjoyable and is really lovely. I enjoyed the scenes of the Tokyo nightlife.  The movie just seems to fade away in ending.  There is no defined plot or climax and the audience must decide how it ended, what the lessons are, and what the point is. The movie is relaxing to watch, not too stimulating or exciting but enjoyable. The bar for it was set high by the many praises in the media so it did not meet those expectations for me but I was not disappointed.  I liked the characters and that made the movie.
