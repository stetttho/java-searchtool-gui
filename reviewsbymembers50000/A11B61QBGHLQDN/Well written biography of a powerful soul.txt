 Kathryn Harrison writes triumphantly about Therese Martin the Saint of Lisieux.  Her biography captures the historical character from childhood to her death at age 24 years.  Harrison portrays the life of Therese amidst the context of the late 19th Century.  The focus of the book is on the family life and the convent life of Therese and her seemingly constant struggle to rest in perfect devotion to God to whom she had sacrificed her life.  Harrison writes exquisitely of Therese, but she writes at times from a freudian, humanistic point of view, somehow missing or misunderstanding the mysticism of Therese's life that is the one characteristic that makes her life remarkable.  I think this comes from the writer discounting the reality of Therese's constant communion with God.  I recommend this book because it illustrates the power of a quiet life lived in the love and service of God.  Harrison successfully shows the effect of one life lived fully for God unselfishly and sacrificially.  The final pages offer a brief glimpse of the enormous impact Therese has had on people since the time immediately following her death.
