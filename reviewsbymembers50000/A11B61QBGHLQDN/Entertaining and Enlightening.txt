 As a Shakespeare enthusiast and writer, I completely enjoyed all aspects of this book.  Gollob honestly shares his passion of Shakespeare and his personal history, both are well-written and lucid narratives of exploration and discovery.  This book is part memoir by a literary expert and part commentary of learning about Shakespeare.  I wish I had Mr. Gollob teach me Shakespeare in college rather than the tenured professors I had.  I recommend this book to anyone at all interested in Shakespeare and to anyone who enjoys an excellent memoir.
