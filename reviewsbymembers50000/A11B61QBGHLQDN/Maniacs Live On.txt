 Thoroughly good cd.  The songs are classic Maniacs.  Mary Ramsey is a more than adequate replacement for Natalie Merchant.  She has a beautiful voice that works nicely with the music.  The songs are not quite as stimulating as some of the previous Maniac songs, but are highly enjoyable.  Maniac fans will not be disappointed.  I certainly an not.
