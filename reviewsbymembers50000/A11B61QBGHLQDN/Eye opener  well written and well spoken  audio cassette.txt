 This story is hard to imagine anyone living through.  Mr. Ladd's accomplishments are outstanding.  This brings a reality to the reader that most people have no idea exists except those living it.  This autobiography also shows the power of determination, attitude and self-reliance.  This should be inspiring and educational to young people especially but also to adults who can see the world from a young black man's perspective.  Ladd allows us to walk in his shoes for a while; it is a privilege and a lesson.  The narrator for the audiocassette does an excellent job reading the book.  This story reminded me of "Finding Fish" by Antwoine Fisher, another great, inspiring story.
