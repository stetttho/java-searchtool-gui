 Not only is Robinson Crusoe an extremely well written, entertaining novel, but it was the first of its kind.  Defoe's novel is fresh  and intriguing today just as it was when written. Defoe's language reveals classic appreciation of the English language that really appealed to me as a reader.  His narrative accounts of adventure, shipwrecks and survival are precise and captivating.  this book is made up of many short stories tied together in following the main character.  The character grows and matures through his trials and becomes a man worthy of emulation. Defoe shows brilliant insight into humanity through his writing as his main character challenges nature, savages, and his inner darkness.  I enjoyed the spiritual aspects of the book.  Any close look at a character such as Crusoe would be lacking if it did not follow his spiritual transformation as well as his physical changes. There are some brief slow parts interspersed in the book that are more like speedbumps in a great tale that many have tried to imitate but failed.
