 Christopher Reich may have tried to do too much in The Patriots Club.  Unlike his previous books that followed a believable and streamlined story or plot, The Patriots Club entails a much more complex and unwieldy story line.  The action begins with Thomas Bolden, a Wall Street Executive, with a violent history, gets targeted by a shadow club of players who run the government and control secret organizations spying on whoever they choose.  Bolden becomes more than they bargain for and competes against the all-powerful organizations with the help of underground renegades and gang-bangers.. Throw in a romance, 25 yr old murder and bombing, federal appropriations bill, presidential election and investment banking, torture techniques, and conspiracy theories relating to America's major wars, and you have the ingredients of this novel.  This story is like a combination of the movies "Enemy of the State" with Will SMith and "National Treasure" with Nicolas Cage.  Bolden is able to elude the fully equipped spy network that is after him while his girlfriend investigates the history of the secret club that has run America from its founding.  They and a few other good guys take down the evil network and save the President all in 400 pages.  Reich is a gifted storyteller, but I think he tried to tackle too much here with this plot.  Once I got into it, I was eager to see how it finished.
