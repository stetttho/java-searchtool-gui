 These songs are great to listen to, even the ones that have not become "hits" entertain.  This is a broad variety of styles, too.  This is a cd you can listen to while doing anything--working, reading, working out, cleaning or driving.  I think if you like REM at all, you will be happy listening to this cd.   The jacket includes a brief story about each song's genesis.
