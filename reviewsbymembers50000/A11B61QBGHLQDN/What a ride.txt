 Seabiscuit does not disappoint.  It is much more than just a story about horse racing.  Seabiscuit explores a full range of human (and animal) conflicts, dreams, loss, hope and victory.  The characters all experience trials and restoration.  Some of the acting and set that is era-related seems staged and too made up, but the story and the main characters carry the day. I was moved emotionally by the triumph of the horse, the jockey, the trainer and the owner.  This is definitely a feel-good movie, because it gives you every reason to feel good about the events in it, plus since it is based on a true story, it is totally realistic and believable--nothing in it is too good to be true--it is good and true. I think you will really enjoy it.
