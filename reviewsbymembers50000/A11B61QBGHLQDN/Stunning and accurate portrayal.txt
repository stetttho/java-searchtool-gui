 Gibson's Passion portrays the suffering of Christ as well as I could imagine it being done in a film.  His goal is to show the audience what Christ endured on our behalf, and I think he has done it.    The torture, bloodshed and cruelty are shocking and offensive, but that is the way it happened.  This is what Christ experienced in the final hours of his suffering on earth.  The mocking of the Romans, the accusations of the Jewish leaders, the conflicts of his disciples, and the love for Jesus by the mass of people are all portrayed.    The effects of flashbacks during the film to Jesus as a boy, young man, and times with his disciples emphasize his humanness and relationships.  The focus on Mary and her love for her son is gripping as we are forced to consider that Jesus is her child whom she has cared for.    We see the anguish Christ faces when in the garden contemplating the suffering ahead of him.  Satan is present there and throughout the film to tempt and ridicule Jesus.  All of the time, Jesus keeps his eyes on his Father and the mission he is accomplishing for all people.  The film makes it apparent that at anytime Christ could have ended it all my calling on God for angels or my using his power to stop it.  As we see in the garden, even as he is being arrested he heals the soldiers ear.  Although there were several players involved, we see that no person caused Christ death, but he gave his own life.  The fact that the language is aramaic and latin is not bothersome at all and I think it adds to the profundity of the words spoken.  I can't imagine this movie being done better that it has been done.  It completely fulfills the goals set for it: to display the suffering of Christ and the love in his heart.
