 I think this is a powerful picture of Luther's life of devotion, courage and reformation.  The film offers intrigue, suspense and seems to be historically accurate.  Luthers spiritual growth is boldly displayed.  We see his personal reformation of soul that inspired his movement.  He combats physical and spiritual enemies, those seen and unseen.  We see the lust for power and wealth that corrupts religion (in this case, the Roman Catholic Church) and that hinder spiritual freedom for all.  The movie provides the conflits Luther faced as he boldly stood on his articles of faith.  It also examines the conflicts within the Roman Catholic Church at the time between those wanting to hold onto power and those wanting reform.  This is a well-done biographical film that captures the multi-faceted life and a spiritual and intellectual giant who lived a humble life.  We learn of his great passion to share the love of Christ above all else.  I think most would enjoy this film and be moved by it.  I was worried that his faith would be watered down and made ambigous, but the movie shows his true Christian faith and emphasis on the word of God.
