 As an adult, I thought that scary movies were things of the past--Friday the 13th and Halloween from my youth,  but The Ring jumped from the screen and creeped me out.  Not more than five minutes into it, I had goosebumps and was checking behind me.  Not only is this scary and creepy, it is also a psychological thriller and mystery movie.  It is actually intelligently written and directed--I think a rarity for the scary movie genre.    The acting is believable and genuine, even the children and teens perform well and add to the climate of fear.  The story takes a few twists and is unpredictable until the very end.  There are no lulls and no resting until the tv is turned off.  As one reviewer intimated, you will need to get religion to get this one out of your system.
