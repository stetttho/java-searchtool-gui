 C S Lewis is perhaps the greatest Christian thinker of the last century.  His words are quoted by nearly all contemporary Christian non-fiction writers that I have read.  I think these fictional, fantasy stories of Narnia even surpass the quality of his non-fiction writings.  Each of the seven books is complete in itself but also connects with the other books in the series, so they really read like one integrated story--not unlike the Lord of the Rings series.  Having all of them in one binding is convenient and allows the reader to go straight through in one book.  Lewis employs great imagination in describing his fantasy world of Narnia.  He creates special characters with magical attributes.  The children he creates are like genuine children in every way.   His skill truly shines in the changes displayed in the children as they experience adventures.  I was amazed at his insight displayed in the character Aslan that is a form of Christ in the books.  The relationship that Aslan has with the other characters is plain yet mysterious just as a relationship with a God-like character must be.  Every encounter the characters have with Aslan is wonderfully touching and in some ways revelatory.  Most of all, I recommend reading the series because of how enjoyable they are.  They illustrate the battles of good and evil and the tensions involved in everyday life and the choices to do the right thing or the easy thing.    The book contains illustrations for each chapter in the book that add to the pleasure of reading it.  The only downside to this version is that it is hefty.
