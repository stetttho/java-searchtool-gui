 Odd Thomas lives up to Koontz' reputation and trademark blend of sci-fi, spirituality and quantam physics.  Koontz weaves a terrific blend of all the above along with humor, insights into human behavior, and in-depth character development--all without ever getting too far out in left field, except maybe once.  Koontz again demonstrates his keen understanding of the constant tension between good and evil forces within and about the human race.  The characters in Odd Thomas reveal gifts from God and bonds with Satan.  The book is told in the first-person narrative by the character Odd Thomas, a delightfully mysterious and playful young man who is fully in love with his girlfriend Stormy Llewelyn, an intriguing character herself. He has a strange gift that makes all of his waking moments interesting and adventurous. He is a great character in an entertaining story.  I look forward to reading "Forever Odd."  The action is gripping and creative to the end.  This will be a quick read, because you won't want to put it down once you get into it just a little bit.  (Don't miss when Koontz pokes fun at the movie about the dog and the "alien thing.")
