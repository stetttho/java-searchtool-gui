 I have not read this book so did not know what to expect with the movie.  I was reasonably entertained by the characters and their dialogue.  It becomes creepy and sort of trite when the aliens show up and start incubating in and inhabiting human bodies.  The story remains suspenseful, as long as you don't try to reason too much and logically explain the events occurring.   It includes the usual alien activity.  The take over humans, hatch in humans, exercise mind control, hijack cars, etc.  The aliens in this movie are vicious but have a sense of humor. Morgan Freeman lends authenticity to the story but still does not make it realistic.   I think you can expect to entertained and creeped out bu don't expect any meaningful story or realism when it comes to the aliens' involvement.  It is a mix of many of King's previous movies, the good and the bad.
