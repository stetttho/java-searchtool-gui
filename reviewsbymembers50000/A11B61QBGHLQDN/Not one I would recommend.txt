 I began listening to this book on tape with great anticipation due to the positive reviews it has received and the idea of learning to live more in the present.   I was turned off by the poor writing, subjectivity of the ideas, lack of fresh ideas, discarding of timeless scriptural doctrines in favor of doctrine based on the author's personal experiences and opinions (what sounds and feels good), and the repetition of thoughts over and over. The author is appealing to what we know to be true--that to live in the present is the key to faith, joy and contentment, among other virtues.  He also knows that we would all like to believe that all paths lead to God, no matter what we call him/her, and we can all find him/her and the truth in ourselves and experience enlightenment by disciplining our thoughts.  It reminds me of the Celestine Prophecies, another book I found to be based on inane ideas and consisting of poor writing.  I think you will feel the same about this book as you did that one, which was also very popular.  Throw Deepak Chopra in the same group.  This book is similar to his "insights" on knowing God. The audiotape is read by the author who just plain sounds goofy.     This book should land under the humor section.  Tolle's idea of enlightenment is nothing new.  He pales in comparison to scriptures, classic philosophy and literature and even to modern motivational writers like Zig Ziglar, Rober Schuller, Norman Vincent Peale, John Maxwell, Anthony Robbins, Robert Collier, Thomas Merton, Og Mandino, etc.  Their writing is head and shoulders above this drivel.  Keep this book in the context of centuries of spiritual writing that the author disparages based on his personal "enlightenment."
