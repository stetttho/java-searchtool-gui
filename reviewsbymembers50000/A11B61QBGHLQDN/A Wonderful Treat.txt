 There is something for everyone in O'Carroll's writing.  If you read and enjoyed "The Mammy" then don't wait another minute before reading "The Chisellers."    O'Carrol writes another splendid narrative of the adventures of Agnes Browne and her children.  This book, like The Mammy, will cause you to laugh and will almost bring you to tears at other times.  The only downside of this book is that it is over too quickly.  Thank goodness there is still another one in the series to read.
