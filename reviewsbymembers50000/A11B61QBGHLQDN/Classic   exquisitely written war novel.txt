 All Quiet on the Western Front presents the perspective of WWI as told by Paul, a frontline German soldier.  Within a few pages of the book, I recognized the writing as being worthy of the "classic" label and as one of the best war novels of all time.  It is spectacularly written in English, though a translation from German.  The novel captures the action of WWI along the frontlines, including the horror of consequences of the battles.  Within the larger picture of war, the novel tells the story of Paul and his fellow classmates who were encouraged by an enthusiastic teacher to join the war effort.  Readers learn how the war is seen by them and how it effects them.    The novel shows the conflicts between the frontline soldiers and the military leaders commanding from afar.  Remarque reveals how these soldiers, often fighting hand-to-hand with the enemy, see the war as useless and hope only to survive and for peace.  The narrator describes the battles and his feelings and thoughts about the war.  The soldiers discuss the incoherence of their mission in the war and why the French and others are their enemies.  They acknowledge a lack of enmity with their enemies and a desire to continue their pre-war lives.  As one after one of the soldiers in his company are killed and wounded, Paul becomes less optimistic about the final outcome of his battles.  This is a powerful novel that should continue to influence readers' views of war.  The lessons taught in it have proved as relevant today as when they were written. It is also a well-written, intriguing book that I fully recommend for study or pleasure
