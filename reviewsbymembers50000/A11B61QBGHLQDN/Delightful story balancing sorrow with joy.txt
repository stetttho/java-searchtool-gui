 The Mammy is an eloquently written story about a family in Dublin, Ireland.  The book is entertaining and moving.  It is lighthearted at times and at other times it deals with serious matters such as death, sickness and religion.  There are several laugh-out-loud moments when the author brilliantly captures the closeness of friends who share tragedy and exhiliration.  The several children in the story offer a spectrum of personalities and clash and interact entertainingly.  The story is full of wit and insight into human behavior, especially the love between mother and children.   I have given this book and its sequels as gifts to the delight of several friends.  And I recommend it for you.
