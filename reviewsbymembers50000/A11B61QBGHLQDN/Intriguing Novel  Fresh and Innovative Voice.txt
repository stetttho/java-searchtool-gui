 Gantt has written a captivating novel. Losing Summer is refreshingly well written and succeeds at captivating the reader with its intrigue and suspense.  What stands out most to me about it is that it reads like a memoir. I felt like the main character, Daniel, is a real person telling his story. Gantt excels in character development. When the book is done, you will have become a personal acquaintance to the main characters.  The story is right out of our culture with young adults living life to the hilt. They experience a sudden halt to their exuberance when one of their own takes her own life. Her three friends are left wondering why. So are her wealthy, prominent father and the police.  The tale leads the narrator-Daniel and the reader through a labyrinthine tunnel that may or may not have a light at its end.  This book is unlike any other novel I have read due to its bold, in-your-face writing that turns out to be a welcome change from so many of the recent novels I have read. Gantt makes a real investment in his characters, and I think they offer a great return.  Before you read this book, make sure you have plenty of time set aside and do not have to get up early the next morning, because you will not be able to put it down once you start it.
