 This is one of only a few movies that I have ever seen that show the realities of the Christian life.  "The Gospel" shows the tensions and struggles that occur within the church and church family among people trying to live for God in our culture.  "The Gospel" may at times seem low-budget compared to some of the blockbusters we see in theatres, but it compensates with truth and emotion.  The characters are real, their struggles are real and the presence of God in this movie is real.  The music throughout this movie is exceptional.  Regardless of your musical interests, I think you will enjoy the songs.  "The Gospel" has been labled a modern version of The Prodigal Son--it is that and more as we see the pastor's son torn between secular success and salvation at home in the church, and we see a young, fresh pastor decide whether he is going to work for his name or God's name.  There are tensions between the sexes, between friends, between fellow ministers, and especially between a man's will and the will of God.  I didn't know anything about this movie before renting it, but I am truly proud of the people who made it and acted in it for presenting such a profound version of the gospel.  Now I'm going to buy the soundtrack.
