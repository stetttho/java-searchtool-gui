 Keenan explores the realm of the soul in this pleasant, enlightening discussion.  A problem I had is that he never (that I can remember) defines the soul or discusses the spirit.  So, much of the language about the soul is somewhat ambiguous.  I think at times he referred to what I consider the spirit as the soul.  I never grasped exactly what he means by "soul," which is frustrating when that is the focus of the book. Much of the book lacked the passion that really moves a reader to wake up to the sense of soul and spirituality and the need to address the unseen world.  The book is told/read without much drama. Keenan does share insights about life that will probably cause you to examine your priorities and direction in life.  He shares stories that are relevant but that didn't seem to strike a loud enough chord to me.  I think he could have gone deeper into his spiritual well to offer the reader more living water that what is here. I think there is a lack of specificity about what he truly believes regarding the soul.  He doesn't share much of his Catholic belief system but more of a watered down spirituality that ignores much of what one would expect a Catholic priest to believe. There were some nuggets that I can take with me such as looking for the miracle in everyday life, expecting gifts from God and from life, and trusting in the guidance of providence when least suspected.   I would encourage him to be more earnest about what he believes in the future.
