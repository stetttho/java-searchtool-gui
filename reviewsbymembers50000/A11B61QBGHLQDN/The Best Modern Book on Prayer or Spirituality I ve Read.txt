 Richard Foster has penned an extraordinary book on all matters related to prayer.  This book will take the novice or mature seeker of God into a deeper, more meaningful relationship with God through inspired, disciplined, educated, meditative, and comprehensive prayer, as well as and Spirit-led spiritual warfare.  Foster doesn't miss a point on the subject.  His writing is supported by references to renowned Christian authors, mystics, and saints from all generations.  Foster cites these sources seamlessly throughout the book.  I read this book slowly, over several weeks and let each chapter's message sink in.  Foster truly provides readers with a guideline for prayer in this book.  If you are at all interested in reading a book on prayer, definitely dive into this one.  You won't be disappointed at all.
