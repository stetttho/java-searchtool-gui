 The Taking offers classic Koontz writing, suspenseful, creative and poetic.  Koontz paints a horrific picture of an end-of-the-world scenario as experienced through the eyes of a young couple.  What seems like some sort of cross between an alien invasion and night of the living dead combines with the evil nature of some sociopathic characters in this doomsday night of terror.  But Koontz offers something deeper than the typical sci-fi saga.  He entwines a Biblical theme that creates a deeper meaning in the plot.  Koontz, as usual, works dogs into the mix as somewhat heroic characters.  For us dog lovers, this is something we enjoy in Koontz' books.  I think this is a good try by Koontz to expand the horizons of his writing and incorporate some spiritual themes to accompany his typical good v. evil scenarios.  I believe Koontz conveys a more insightful grasp of the nature of evil than any other writer I know.    If your a Koontz fan, don't hesitate to pick this one up.
