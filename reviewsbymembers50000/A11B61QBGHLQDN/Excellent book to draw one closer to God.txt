 The Prayer of Jabez leads the reader to a closer relationship with God through a prayer that reveals God's desires for us.  The prayer , as discussed by Dr. Wilkinson, does not lead us to ask for "stuff" but blessings that involve interaction with God and experiencing his presence.  Dr. Wilkinson's examples of his own blessings from the Jabez prayer all involve ministry and really blessing other people by God working through him.  Contrary to several reviews' statements, this book is not about materialism or selfishness.    An example from the author's life is about him leading a youth group to evangelize children and beachgoers.  They led many to Christ as they exceeding their own reach and allowed God to "enlarge their territory" in ministry.  This is the idea of Wilkinson's book:  to live the Bible.  He basis his ideas on the brief passage of scripture, but his expansions of the ideas involve the big picture of living for Christ.  This book is as much a testimony of God's work in the author's life and through the author as it is about a prayer, but Dr. Wilkinson gives all the credit to God and to his own attitude toward God that has been shaped by his adherence to the principles revealed in this brief prayer from the Bible.  Dr. Wilkinson writes simply and profoundly about the context of the prayer and elaborates on each line of it.  This book will lead you into a fuller experience of the abundant life Jesus came to give us--if you will follow its guidelines and not try to make them conform to a worldly point of view.    I think people reacting negatively to this book are reacting to something other than is on the pages of it.  This is a book to read on a regular basis as a supplement to scripture.  It serves to inspire a renewed vigor in prayers.
