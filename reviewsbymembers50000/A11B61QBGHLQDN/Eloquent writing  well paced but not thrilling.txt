 I think any bibliophile appreciates reading any writing by Buckley who makes the most simple passages eloquent and vivid.  Reading Spytimes is no different (except for the sex scenes that were arkward and cumbersome).  It was an introduction for me to this era of subterfuge within our government.  I was not familiar at all with the historical characters of the novel, so I did not have the background data that other reviewers have possessed.  I found the book engaging but not thrilling or suspenseful.  It flowed consistently and held my attention.  It is good historical fiction, providing enlightenment and fabricating details to fill in spaces.  This book is not lengthy so did not go into much character depth or background information on situations.    It is revealing about the CIA and counterintelligence process, as well as the divided loyalties of high officials.  I'm sure Buckley draws on much personal knowledge to offer readers a realistic view of the intelligence realm of government.    I think it is a worthy read for those who have interest in spy stories and who appreciate fine writing.  But don't expect to be blown away with intrigue.
