 What is Divine Providence?  Shakespeare writes that "there is a divinity that shapes our ends, rough hew them how we will." (Hamlet)  This book expands on the theme of allowing providence to shape our ends and trusting in the wisdom of providence.   Taken on its own, this book may inspire some readers to be passive regarding life's outcomes, as other reviewers have suggested, but we read this in light of so much contemporary preaching and Christian writing about being proactice and successful and prosperous and "blessed" in all we decide to do that reading this book gives us a different view that will provide balance to our spiritual lives.  It is a view of contentment at the feet of God, a view of trusting in God's presence and compassion.  I was thrilled while reading this book.  It is a book to inspire us all to sit at Jesus' feet and listen to him, as Mary did, rather than asking Jesus to bless our busyness from a distance. One must remember that this is a book of compiled letters to nuns and notes for lectures to a similar audience.  These are exhortations to nuns who have devoted their lives to Christ.  The casual Christian may find the exhortations extreme and that they do not fit into our Christian America mindset.  The structure of the book does create a more laborious read than modern books that flow better due to proper formatting. I recommend this book as I recommend Imitation of Christ by Thomas a'Kempis.  They are books that are relevant and I think necessary to modern Christians, especially those caught up in the "Purpose-Driven Life" movement.  I bought a copy for my pastor to read, because we plainly do not hear of this kind of devotion today.  It is not a movement but a sacrificial life the author promotes.
