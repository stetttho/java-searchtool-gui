 Mr. Pilcher puts together a fine story focusing on relationships and personal transformation.  His characters are believable though not too deep or complex. The story moves along and is interesting.  I listened to the cd of the book, and the narrator does an exceptional job reading the book and speaking for the characters' accents.  You will thoroughly enjoy listening to him.  I found myself sitting in the parked car to continue to listen--it is the audio equivalent of a page turner.  I think this is well-written and fluid and explores some of the dynamics in today's family that has two working parents trying to fulfill themselves in careers and family.
