 The plot of the Life of Pi has much potential for an exciting novel. Unfortunately, it is a laborious read, except for portions where the author just writes the story without any tangents and unnecessary stream of consciousness episodes that serve no purpose. There is too much telling of irrelevant details and thoughts and too little showing the reader entertaining action. The action that does occur in the book is intriguing--the ship sinking, Pi and some animals in the lifeboat, their subsequent interactions, and his quest for survival. There is a plethora of opportunity here to better captivate the reader, but the writer attempts to stimulate us with droll talk of religion and mundane information. The book ends with attempts at profundities but just left me wondering what it was all about. I think I have a decent sense for spiritually significant writing, but I did not catch any meaningful insights from this book. Maybe I missed it. I think there are some real inconsistencies with the main character Pi. I know this is a story of a child being told by the child as an adult, but Pi is like a small child in one scene and next thing you know he is lecturing about religious ideas. He is familiar with the nature of animals from growing up in a zoo, but then he weeps over a fish he has to kill to eat. The interaction with the tiger and the other animals was entertaining and imaginative and may make the book worth reading--there just isn't enough of it and it tends to become filled with minutia rather than action. The high expectations generated by the introductory chapters never came full circle. You might enjoy this book, but it is one I was disappointed with throughout as my expectations were let down.
