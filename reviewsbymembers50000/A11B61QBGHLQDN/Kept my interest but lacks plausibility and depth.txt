 Danny Cray, struggling twenty-something artist, seems to turn into a cross between Austin Powers and Jason Bourne overnight as he strives to save the world from a Billionaire techno-savvy far-reaching sociopath who we suddenly learn is broke.  The story touches on many topics without ever delving into them long enough to create real interest.  The author touches on nano-technology, art, turkish/kurdish culture & religion, and somehow the Billionaire knows how to basically steal a person's voice and image and generate a techno-clone.  All in all it was just too much flamboyance.  However, the story moves along from one event to another at a fast pace and is entertaining.
