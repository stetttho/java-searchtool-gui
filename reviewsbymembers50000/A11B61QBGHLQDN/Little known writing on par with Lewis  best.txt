 The creativity and keen spiritual insights that have made C.S. Lewis the most renowned Christian writer of the modern era combine with eloquent poetry to reveal the writer's struggles, hopes and nightmares that predate his conversion to Christianity.  This book of poems illustrates his yearning for truth and salvation by revealing his images God, man and Satan in delightful, rhyming lyrics.  The intellectual and spiritual force present in these poems create a powerful edge rarely matched.  Readers will discern the drive that eventually leads Lewis to find "his heart's delight." This is a must-have for those who have appreciated Lewis' other writings.  Lewis' searching and questions parallel many who have had doubts about the present reality and character of a God that seems to hide in mysteries.  The genius behind Mere Christianity and the Chronicles of Narnia is behind these poems, even though he has yet to have his eyes opened.  The heart of a desperate, sincere seeker of God is painted in these lyrics that in themselves make great poetry.
