 I enjoyed this movie.  It reminds me of Hannibal with Anthony Hopkins.  John Malkovich perfectly plays Tom Ripley.  He is the evil protagonist that you end up rooting for.  The intrigue in the movie stems from an innocent Italian husband and father being pulled into the role of assassin as part of a sick game played by Ripley. The movie contrasts the sociopathic Ripley who easily justifies killing with a conscience-stricken picture framer who can't stomach killing others but learns to do it.  The movie also shows the consequences of evil actions--that there is no such thing as getting away with it, even for the conscienceless Ripley. The acting is superb and the plot driven at a face pace.  The events are realistic and not far-fetched like so many thrillers recently.   With a main character like Tom Ripley, no one is safe in the movie.  He is cast as very much like Hannibal Lector--the refined psychopath.
