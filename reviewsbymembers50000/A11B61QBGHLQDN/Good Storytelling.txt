 Grisham tells an intriguing, captivating story in The Last Juror.  It had several stereotypical yet enjoyable characters.  The time and setting of the novel are conducive to an interesting plot with several conflicts and twists.  There are some cliche's here though that lessen the impact of the novel.  For example, the evil Padgitt family that lives by itself on the island and rarely ventures into town, the redneck sheriffs and gool ol' boys around town.  But I'm sure they are founded in truth.    Grisham follows through on this story and closes well (unlike The King of Torts which fizzles at the end).  It is a good, entertaining read that has more than a little humor and good wit thrown into the mix.
