 Antoine Fisher's story is moving, gripping and inspiring.  I can't think of any person who, after reading this book, would not in some way become a better person.  Antoine Fisher is a hero, a mentor and an excellent writer and story teller. His story is as sad as a story can be at times.  His childhood is utterly tragic and shows the evils of humanity and the shortcomings of our culture and society.  Yet, throughout his misery, he maintains an inner spark that drives him through the trials he faces, one obstacle after another.  This is a story of a beautiful human spirit overcoming everything thrown against it--selfish, abusive people, a system that doesn't care, anger and bitterness, violence and apathy.   Finding Fish tells how a lost soul became found and flourished.  It shows how the love of people can make a difference in a life.  It also shows what does really matter in the end.  I think Finding Fish should be required reading for all people.  I am thankful to Antoine Fisher for sharing his story.   The movie was good, but it does not do the true story justice--there is just too much there to put into a 2 hour movie--so read the book.
