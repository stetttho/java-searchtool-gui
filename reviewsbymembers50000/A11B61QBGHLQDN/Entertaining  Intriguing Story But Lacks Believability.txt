 The Syndrome captured my attention and lured me into an exciting story.  I read it over a few days whenever I had a chance.  It is a page turner.  The story involves conspiracy, secret governmental experiments on humans, assassination plots, false memory and mind control.  With those topics at the center of the story, the details become blurred and the believability of the events lessens.  But even so, the action is exciting, the main characters likable and not too simple, and the writing is pretty good.  There are plenty of surprises.
