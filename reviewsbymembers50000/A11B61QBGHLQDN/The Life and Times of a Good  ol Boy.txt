 I was interested in this book because Hillerman is an accomplished writer, and I thought I would learn some about the craft.  I learned much more about life and history and enjoyed all of it.  Hillerman comes across as the salt of the earth, a young boy from rural Oklahoma who was truly without guile.  He describes growing up in a small town and then being drafted and shipped off to war. I especially enjoyed his telling of his time as an infantryman during WWII.  I have read WWII accounts by officers like Patton but never by a grunt. It was a new and enlightening perspective that I appreciated. It is always interesting to see/read how successful people become a success in their chosen fields, and Hillerman's account is interesting.   In it he shares much history of the southwest.   He does not share about writing his novels until he is well into his memoir.  This is the story of his life and not just about writing.  He eventually does share how he made the leap from journalist and college professor to novelist. This is a lighthearted tale of the life of a truly American writer.  It requires patience and rewards it with an honest, entertaining story.
