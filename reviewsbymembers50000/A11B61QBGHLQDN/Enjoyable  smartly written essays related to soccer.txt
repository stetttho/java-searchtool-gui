 An enjoyable book that would appeal to soccer lovers and those interested in international affairs.  The book's chapters focus on separate soccer-related international issues such as hooliganism in England and Serbia, the Catholic v. protestant rival of Glasgow Rangers and Celtics, the corruption and passion of Brazilian soccer, the politics of Italian soccer, the regionalism of Spanish soccer, and soccer's role in Iran.  He also profiles a Nigerian soccer player in the Ukraine.  The chapters are individual vignettes or essays that stand on their own.  Foer addresses the soccer-related activities in these areas, but does not focus on the game itself.  He has some interviews with players, managers and fans, relates history and politics of the clubs and regions, and does thorough research on each topic.  Foer proves himself as an excellent writer that can write eloquently and intelligently about any subject but especially about soccer for which he certainly has a passion.  The one disappointment for me was the final chapter that I think is the one weak spot in the book.  The concluding chapter is about the culture of soccer in America. Unfortunately, this is the shortest and least researched one of the book. The author relies on anecdotal and personal experience here.  Rather than the substance found in other chapters this one is a mere editorial on American soccer that I think misses key truths.  I can only imagine the reason for this is that he plans an entire book on the subject.  Readers should not expect grand revelations about globalization or soccer, but do expect to enjoy enlightening, stimulating reading about soccer's myriad peripherial issues and activities.
