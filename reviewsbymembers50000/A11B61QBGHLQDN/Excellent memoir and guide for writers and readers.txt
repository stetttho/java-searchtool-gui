 On Writing is a memoir more than an instructional book on writing which is what makes it an enjoyable, as well as informative read.  Stephen King shows through stories about his life how he has become a great and successful writer.  His stories show writers what is required to polish writing skills and to become successful.  This book shows that his success came after grueling hours, sacrifice and many failures.  It shows the lifestyle of a famous and prolific writer.  He also does offer advice and instruction to writers on skills, techniques and attitudes. I don't think anyone would be disappointed with this book, since it is entertaining and instructional.  I think it would appeal to writers and to any fans of Stephen King.
