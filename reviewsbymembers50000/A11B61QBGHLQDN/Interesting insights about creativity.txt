 I found Rothenberg's insights about the characteristics of creativity the most meaningful ideas in the book.  He has learned several methods of those who are creative, and these are helpful anyone wanting to be creative or help someone else like a child become creative.  He does a good job debunking some of the myths that associate creativity with mental illness by showing several cases of mentally ill creators.  He shows that their creative times did not coincide with the severe bouts of mental illness.  He profiles a few artists, Sylvia Plath, Emily Dickinson, Eugene O'Neil, and JOhn Cheever among others.  It is interesting to read how these successful people dealt effectively or ineffectively with mental illness.  The author offers his conclusions about creativity and its association with mental illness.  Whether they are ultimately conclusive, the reader can decide.  He is a thorough researcher and writer, so this is a book worth reading if you are interested in the subject matter.
