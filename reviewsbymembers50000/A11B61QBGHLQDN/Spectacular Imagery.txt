 This book captures some of the breathtaking images from the movie "The Passion."  Combined with relevant scriptures, both from the gospel and Old Testament prophecies of Christ, the images allow one to really meditate on the suffering of Christ, each step of the way.  The pictures follow his ordeal that began in the garden, as he prays to the Father.  Each step is captured in a stunning picture or two.  That ends with his death on the cross and then a visual image indicating his resurrection.  This is akin to a visual tool to follow the stations of the cross and allow their significance to sink in.  In that way, this book becomes interactive as a prayer and devotional tool.  There are also some pictures of the filming of the movie that provide a glimpse of Mel Gibson and the actors setting the stage for the movie.  I think this book is a must-have for anyone who appreciated the movie The Passion or for anyone who is a Christian but was not willing to endure watching the suffering of Christ in the movie.   Although I strongly recommend the movie and the book, the book offers a more bearable way to see what he endured and to appreciate his sacrifice for those who avoided the movie.
