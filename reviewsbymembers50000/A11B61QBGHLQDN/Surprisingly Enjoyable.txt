 For a movie based on a mom and daughter switching bodies, this was very entertaining for the whole family.  It was enjoyable to see the mother going to high school in her daughter's body, just as it was hilarious to watch the daughter counsel people while in her mother's body. The events that occur and the script provide for many laughs.  Of course, you can't expect it all to be realistic, due to the premise, but once over that, it is funny throughout. The mother and daughter both learn their lessons after walking in the other's shoes.   this is a good wholesome fun-filled movie that parents, teens and young children can all watch together.
