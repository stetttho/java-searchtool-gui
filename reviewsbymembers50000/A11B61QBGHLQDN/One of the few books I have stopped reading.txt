 I even finished Brothers Karamazov and Bleak House, but this one I quit.  I felt like I was wasting my time trying to remember the characters and their relations and what in the world is occuring in this make believe town of Macondo.  Marquez may be a skilled writer and storyteller, but this book confused, bored and frustrated me without offering entertainment or insight.  So what if Oprah picked it and if it has been labled a classic...it is not enjoyable or remarkable to me.  I think I made it to about page 150 or so.  With so many books to read, why waste time trying to decipher this one?
