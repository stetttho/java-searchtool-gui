 Campbell's vast breadth of knowledge of world myths, religions, literature and history is impressively conveyed in this book.  He seems to be an expert in several arenas that combine to offer the reader a panorama of insights in humanity's and individuals' journeys.  He adroitly relates many mythological or true stories and uses them as examples to discuss points about the human experience similar to how Jung would use archetypes to describe a person's psychological profile.  This is a helpful and interesting book.  A couple of times I became weary of the details of some obscure myths and sped along to the next point of Campbell.  It offers a plethora of information.  Any interest in myth, religions, philosphy, psychology or human development will be rewarded here.
