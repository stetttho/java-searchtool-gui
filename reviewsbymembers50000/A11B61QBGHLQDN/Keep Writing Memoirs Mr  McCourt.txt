 Teacher Man, McCourt's third memoir, focuses on his career as a teacher in New York City but he also touches on his "Miserable Irish Childhood," finding his way in New York, and some family issues.    McCourt's gifted style of writing creates a pleasurable experience for readers of all of his books.  Like Angela's Ashes, Teacher Man offers eloquently, sometimes playfully written narratives that highlight a 30 year teaching career.  Teacher Man tells classroom stories that include the full range of emotions from tragic to hilarious.  His writing always includes introspective comments that reveal his struggles to gain self-esteem and self-worth.  Teacher Man only relates limited stories of his family in Ireland and New York.  i would have enjoyed hearing more about his life outside the classroom in New York City, but "Tis" covered some of that while this book is about his teaching.  The highlights of his teaching career make for interesting and entertaining reading.  Readers who enjoyed Angela's Ashes and 'Tis won't be disappointed.  McCourt has a beautiful voice on the written page and i hope he does not stop writing.
