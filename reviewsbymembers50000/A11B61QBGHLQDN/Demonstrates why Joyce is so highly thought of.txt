 This is my first Joyce book to read.  I had high expectations.  It was difficult to get a feel for his writing initially, but I finally got into the rythm of it and it started to flow. The book does not have much action; it is introspection and dialogue and remembrances that all run together.  It is unique and exhilirating to read, but is not a page turner as many top-rated books of today are.  It reads more like a memoir than a novel, and according to accounts I read, it is a story similar to Joyce's own. I was able to relate to the tension between living a secular versus a religious life. I think for serious readers, this book has to be on the must-read list.
