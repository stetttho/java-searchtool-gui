 The Rule of Four is not a bad book.  The writing is exceptional for its intelligence, breadth of topics, and creativity, but the book itself gets bogged down with lengthy tangents that include the pedestrian activities of four college seniors and their relationships.  The meat of the story centers on an ancient text that promises to reveal astounding mysteries.  The process that two of the Princeton seniors follow to crack the code of this book is suspenseful and enjoyable.  They also have to deal with conniving professors attempting to steal their work and the potential breakthrough.  I ended up skimming through the last 100 pages to skip the thorough descriptions of Princeton life and the streams of consciousness of the narrator in order to get through with the story.    Throughout this story there are scenes that remind me of the keystone cops as the students seem to play games with the campus police when in fact they are in life or death scenarios apparently.  The story never convinces me of the importance of the events or characters despite its efforts to paint a world revolving around four Princeton seniors.  Overall this is a good effort to combine suspense and mystery with substance such as character development and philosophy coming through the narrator's reflections about his past, present and future--these include some memorable insights by the authors, but I found this nearly poetic writing often just interfered with a good mystery.  The authors can be forgiven and cut some slack for that, since the book shapes up nicely in the conclusion.
