 I loved the musical of Les Miserables and immediately bought the book by Hugo.  It sat on my shelf for about 3 years before I finally became motivated to read it. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it.  It is like no other book I have read, except maybe a Dickens novel.  Hugo indulges in such in depth character development that I felt like I personally knew all the characters involved. This is a story of grace, mercy, redemption, virture and vanity.  Hugo leads the reader on a spiritual journey of self-discovery.  The journey includes illustrations of the best of humanity and the worst.  You see the image of how you want to live your life and also of those people you want to be nothing like and want to avoid at all costs. The only downside to the book was the extensive cultural and geographical descriptions that Hugo provides, but though they are strenuous when reading them, they make the action that follows more understandable and meaningful. This is an entertaining and moving story built on moving and meaningful plots and themes. To me, while on the shelf, it was large and intimidating, but as soon as I started page one, I felt like I was coming home to a significant awakening. I think every book lover should commit to reading this.  I bought the paperback and the Modern Libray hardcover of the Wilbour translation and reviewed both, and I chose to read the more classic Wilbour translation which I thought captured the traditional language better.  I think it is just a personal preference which version one likes--both tell the same story and are verbatim translations.
