 Hecht is an entertaining, intriguing writer.  This is his second novel I have read (Skull Session is the first).  He delves into interesting topics that create psychological thrillers.  This book, in addition to being a book I couldn't put down, focuses on deeply philosophical and even spiritual issues that strike the heart of human behavior and responsibility. The only shortcoming in this book is the role of a religious-zealot-wacko who plays a prominent part.  Although probably a realistic type of character, I just was not able to logically connect his mission and what would motivate him to kidnap a scientist.  It seems incongruent that such a zealot would ever consider little knows scientific evidence to actually threaten his empire of mind numb followers.   Otherwise, the characters are interesting and the story creative and intelligent.  If you like this, I recommend Skull Session too.
