 De Becker offers in The Gift of Fear a gift of insight and wisdom to his readers.  This book is a true must-read, not just for women but all people.  It shares important lessons that De Becker has learned from his experience and his training.  The knowledge he shares about dangerous people is priceless, as is what he shares about listening to our own intuition that warns us of danger.  The examples he shares in the book drive the points home. This book has helped me to become a wiser more prudent person, father and husband.  In addition to being helpful, it is also eye-opening and interesting.  Although non-fiction, it is a page turner that keeps your attention. You will learn how some people become threats to you and your loved ones and how to protect yourself from them.  It is especially startling when discussing people dangerous to children. After reading this one, if you are a parent or have involvement with children, then definitely read the Gift of Fear. It is about protecting children from the many dangers that face them. Thank You Mr. De Becker.
