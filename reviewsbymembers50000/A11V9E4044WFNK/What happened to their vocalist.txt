 The Rev's previous album "All is Dream" always comes to mind when I'm asked what my favorite music is.  This 1991 album, which still gets a lot of airplay in my car, featured vocalist Mary Gavazzi Fridmann on most of the tracks.  Although she's listed as an "additional musician" on "Secret Migration", I don't hear her at all.   Too bad - REALLY too bad.  What a disappointment.  The Rev's musical style really lends itself to a female voice, and Ms. Fridmann handled the job with excellence, her delivery and her plaintive voice wonderfully complimenting the style of the music.    On the new album all the vocals are by a male vocalist, presumably one of the band's male musicians.  He doesn't come close to matching Fridmann's ability to fill-out the emotional impact of the Rev's music.  I agree with some of the previous reviews on why this album does not live up to "Dream".  The song writing is not the same quality.  But what I miss most is the great singing.  If you're considering your first Mercury Rev purchase, get All is Dream.  You'll like it better.
