 I checked the 3 reviews that preceeded mine, and I see that I was lucky to have discovered Ms. Kortes before these three fans did.  The previous two reviewers remarked on the fine quality of Mary Lee's voice.  Well, they outhta hear "One Thousand Promises Later" on a previous album "True Lovers of Adventure", where she really cranks up that great voice of hers and really pours the passion into it.   She can do this and still keep her expression honest and heartfelt.  Which is what she's about -- honesty and heart.  In comparison, this album is more sytlistically consistent than "True Lovers" -- not as stylistically varied; not as musically intense, but more personal.  "True Lovers" is a little old fashioned, this new album is very contemporary.   She can perform this kind of range, plus dazzle hard core Dylan fans with a cover of his songs.   She has the versality to do this -- talent to put a lot of heart into whatever she does; and this album is a testament to that.   Makes ya' wonder what she'll do next.
