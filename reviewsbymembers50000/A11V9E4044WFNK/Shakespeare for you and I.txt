 This book is brought to you by the same folks who publish all the ". . . For Dummies" books for learning computer programs.  I have been known to snicker at these books, as I'm rather computer-dweebic, and don't  need computer-dummy books.   It turns out that my next screenplay  involves Shakespeare, and before I started writing, I needed to do some  research on the bloke and his works.  At the local library, I found  "Shakespeare for Dummies."  I scanned the book, then nearly  choked on swallowing a dollop of pride as I toted the book through the  checkout. It's not easy to be expert at something and at the same time to  be able to explain it clearly to beginners (or dummies).  These authors  definitely do have that talent. Open the cover, and first thing, there's  a listing of all of the dude's plays with a one or two sentence summary --  the lay of the land!   The book goes on to cover the life and times of  William; explanations of his brand of English, the theatrical world he  worked in, etc.  Deeper into the book, there are two- to three-page  summaries of each play, with recommendations for videos of each play. The  authors' wholistic approach is very informative, and they take a  good-natured approach to a topic that could be oh-so-scholarly. My  screenplay, by the way, is titled Learning Shakespeare. The irony of it  all.
