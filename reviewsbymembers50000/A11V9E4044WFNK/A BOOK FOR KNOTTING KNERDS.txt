 Clifford Ashley takes you to the heart and soul of knotting.   The magic of the intertwining of line was a passion to this man -- and that passion can infect you, if you're susceptible.   In the course of his  descriptions of knots, he takes us through some of the history of knotting  -- his references go back to the 1700's.  Mainly, this art is descended  from the square-rigger seafaring trade.  Mr. Ashley knows the language of  these sailors. Although written in the first half of the 20th century,  this is still THE authoratative book on knots. Thousands of knots,  thousands of pictures.  Knots, from practical hard-working specimens, to  purely decorative; to even a few useless knots.  Self-illustrated with  occasional bytes of humor. This is "the" book if you have a  love of knotting; if knotting is a part of who you are. However, if all  you want is to quickly learn a few knots for very practical reasons, you'd  probably be better off with one of the more modern knotting books, which  usually have clearer explanations for the layman, replete with pretty color  photos.  Newer texts would also have recently-invented knots, such as the  amazing icicle knot.
