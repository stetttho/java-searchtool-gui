 Amazon's editorial review states that the lyrics in this album won't win a Whitman Prize -- then the he goes on to quote the begining lyircs of "Wishful Thinking" as his example.  I would expect an editorial review to come from a place of intimate knowledge of the style of music under question:  In the case of this song, a retro-twenties style.    The opening lyrics are meant as a playful, teasing entry into the song -- in keeping with the STYLE here.  If the reviewer contemplated the song as a whole, he would see a "message" evolve from this playful skit -- the message being about a girl who's habit it is to keep her love "in a box" (to quote Abby), and her struggle to open herself up to a new friend.  Sounds like a serious burdonsome theme -- but not the way the 'Bops do it -- they make it fun.    The reason I preach so is to make a point about something I love about the 'Bops music:  There's their fun side and there's their thoughtful side -- and they mix the two seamlessly throughout the album in their own quirky fashion.    Fun and thoughtfulness -- something for everybody.    The lovers of any artform are forever yearning for something new and fresh -- a new angle; that's why the 'Bops are headed for the big time.
