 I'm a sort of "Our Town" junkie -- I've seen many filmed/taped versions. I was real lucky in that the kind folks at Brandman Productions kindly lent me a tape of this version for copying, back before they released it to the general public. This is my fave play of all time, and I say this is an excellent version, maybe the best.  If you like Our Town, get this one, even if you have to fork out some of your Yankee dollars!
