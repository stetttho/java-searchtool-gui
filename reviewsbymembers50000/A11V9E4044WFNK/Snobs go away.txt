 The female voice is the most beautiful sound in the world; and Ms. Brightman's is one of the more beautiful.  Her style with the classics is to temper the usual classical/operatic style.  I like it.  Outside of the opera house, hardcore opera style is a bit much.  While fighting traffic in my car, I love the way Sarah's voice relaxes me to the bone.  My fave on the CD is the first song, Ave Maria.  I've always thought of this song as a prayer put to music; but with Brightman's take the song seems to transcend prayer n' religion for the more spiritual, becoming more of an ode to the sacred feminine.
