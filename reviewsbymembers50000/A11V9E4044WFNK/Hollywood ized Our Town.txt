 Our Town is a play that brings a simple message in a very compelling way; one of my favorite stories of all time.  I can say that the people behind this motion picture version  trivialized the ending of the story, and took back some of what the story gives.  But that's Hollywood.  Despite the ending, this still manages to be a wonderful sensitive rendition of Our Town.   Technically, the print is poor quality, but the depth of the story made me forget about the print quality while I was watching it.
