 I'm new at the fascinating skill of knotting.  The only other knotting book I've read is Day's Art of Knotting & Splicing.  That book and this one complement each other very well, the former written from a seafarer's  perspective, reads like a manual for a sailor.  The latter has the  advantages of a modern book, colored photos of knots, and descriptions of  recently-invented knots. It is my best guess that the title of this book  was chosen by the publisher as a marketing ploy, -- not by the author.  An  "Ultimate Encyclopedia" of knots would have to be many volumes to  cover all known knots from all the known cultures, all their history, and  all the modern mathematical analysis.  (Somebody should publish such a  book!) Though not "Ultimate", I do like this book, especially  for the new knots that the Day and Ashley books do not cover.
