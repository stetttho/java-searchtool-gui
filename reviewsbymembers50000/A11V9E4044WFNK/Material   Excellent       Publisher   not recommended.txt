 I agree whole-heartedly with reader Matt Leo's enthusiastic review of the book.  However, I have a problem with this paperback edition.  In the back of the book is a diagram of a sailing ship with all the rigging described  -- an important featrue, as the names of the various components of the  rigging are constantly refered to in the text.    But the diagram is  blurred to the point that it is difficult to impossible to read the  descriptions of the components. Amazon should not offer this publisher's  product because of this defect.
