 You never know where you'll find good humor.  One of the reviews panned this book because it would not help him wrtie movies like "Terminator".                               THANK GOD!  I have  found that it's beneficial for me to read a variety of screenplay books, to  get different perspectives on the craft.  The great thing about Mr.  Horton's book is that it offers a very unique perspective of screenwriting,  differentfrom anything else I've read.  If you're concerned with depth of  character and variety of character, the perspective that Horton offers is  invaluable.
