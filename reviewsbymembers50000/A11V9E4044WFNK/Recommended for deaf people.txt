 I bought this because I like analog clocks, and this was the only clock radio I could find with an analog clock.  That part is nice, but the sound quality for music is very poor, very tinny.  It's fairly good for talk radio, but not for music.  It has some nice features, if you don't mind futzing around with learning the controls on yet another electronic device.
