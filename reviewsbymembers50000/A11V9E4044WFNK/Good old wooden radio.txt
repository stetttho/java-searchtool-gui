 I bought this radio on the word of "An Electronics Fan From Santa Rosa" (below).  I too have poor reception in my home.  There are three FM stations that I alternate between, and it's been a nuisance trying to tune between them with the reception so bad here. I either end up receiving two stations simultaneously, or I get lots-a static.   Well, I received this Sony today, and immediately tried it out, and found that it pulls in the stations very well, with no problem at all.  It has a decent sound, and I appreciate the retro appearance.  A lot of the modern electronics with their ever-glowing digits are unsightly.  This radio is very unassuming in appearance, simple to operate, and it has the heavy feel of solid construction, as the cabinet is wood instead of plastic.  I'm buying another one for the kitchen.
