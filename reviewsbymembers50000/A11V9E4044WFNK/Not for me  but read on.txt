 I found the book very much on the "preachy" side.  I like the idea of using story to share one's spiritual beliefs with the world; but for it to work well, the concepts need to be subtle.   On the other hand,  Christians, particularly Catholics, who like to see concepts of their faith  put to story, this could be very rewarding. Despite my misgivings, I do  see a beauty in the author's story-telling style.  I would like to someday  read other works of his.
