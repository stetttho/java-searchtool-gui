 Although THE EVIL DEAD is my all-time favorite horror movie, the original NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is a monumental horror movie to this very day! "They're coming to get you, Barbara!" NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD changed everything with its social commentary on the Vietnam War, racism, and dysfunctional families among other things that were rampant in 1968. Also, those gore scenes with the dead chowin' down can still induce cringes and stomach cramps with the best of 'em, even in black-and-white! I saw this on A&E in edited form in 1999 and bought the Millenium Edition in 2002. While I can't say much about NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD that hasn't been said already, I will say that everybody NEEDS to see this movie if they haven't already! A CLASSIC! Last year, I met several people from NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD at the HorrorFind Convention in Maryland. A weekend to remember! I met John A. Russo, Russell Streiner (Johnny), Karl Hardman (Harry Cooper), Marilyn Eastman (Helen Cooper), Kyra Schon (Karen Cooper), Bill Hinzman (the first zombie), and Judith O'Dea (Barbara). They were all wonderful people in real life and they graciously signed my Millennium Edition DVD cover! This year, I'm going to meet the director himself, George A. Romero, at this year's HorrorFind convention! George A. Romero is my favorite horror director because he ingegrates social and political satire and horror with such skill and craft (see THE CRAZIES and his other DEAD films). Remember, take the time to watch the original NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and see how horror is really done!
