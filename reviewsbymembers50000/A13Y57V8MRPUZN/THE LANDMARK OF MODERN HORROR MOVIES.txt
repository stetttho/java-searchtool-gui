 What more can be said about Alfred Hitchcock's classic horror movie PSYCHO that hasn't been said already? By now everybody knows what this movie's all about, so why go into it? Because without PSYCHO, the horror movie genre would be a whole lot different if this wasn't made! Just think about the different kinds of horror movies that have come out in the forty-four years since PSYCHO scared the hell out of audiences: the giallo in Italy (Mario Bava's BLOOD AND BLACK LACE, Dario Argento's BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE and DEEP RED just to name a few, Lucio Fulci's DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING, the list goes on), the slasher movie (John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN and Sean S. Cunningham's FRIDAY THE 13TH among many others), and all kinds of murder-mystery films. PSYCHO did for horror movies what The Beatles' appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show four years later did for rock music! I remember the first time I ever saw PSYCHO. I was 16 and just entering the 10th grade when I watched PSYCHO on my personal black-and-white TV on Channel 17. Man, that blew my mind out of the water! To this very day, that shower scene is ten times scarier than any gore scene in any horror movie (ironically, the shower scene wasn't that very graphic). Now I have it on DVD and I saw it a few days ago and it's still terrifying! And to the Unbiased Movie Critic, an Unbiased Correction: The 1998 version IS a remake! The original PSYCHO came out in 1960, THIRTY-EIGHT YEARS BEFORE GUS VAN SANT EVEN APPROACHED THIS STORY! It's fine if you prefer the 1998 version, some people do, but please get your facts straight. Anyway, this DVD offers PSYCHO in its original aspect ratio of 1.85:1, along with a truckload of extras! So check into the Bates Motel and be careful in the shower! And remember, "We all go a little mad sometimes."
