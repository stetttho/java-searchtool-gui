 Oh My God! RE-ANIMATOR is the kind of movie that totally strips you of your ability to turn away or stop the movie! I popped in the DVD only to watch a few minutes and found myself watching the film all the way through, only stopping to rewind scenes that I missed! RE-ANIMATOR is the funniest and goriest horror-comedy ever made! Awesome gore effects and hilarious one-liners; my favorite is "You'll never get credit for my discovery; whose gonna believe a talking head? Get a job in a sideshow." I also liked the performances in this movie, especially Jeffery Combs' as Dr. West, although Dr. West comes off as a jerk. Plus, RE-ANIMATOR is scary too! You must get the Millennium Edition while you can. This 2-disc treatment is the best that this movie has gotten in years since the 10th Anniversary Laserdisc! Awesome picture and sound quality! Also, you get the original trailer and several TV-spots; alternate and extended scenes (for the R-rated video release); documentaries; and the isolated score! If you're a fan of '80s horror, RE-ANIMATOR is required viewing if you haven't seen it already. Tell 'em Dr. Herbert West sent 'ya!
