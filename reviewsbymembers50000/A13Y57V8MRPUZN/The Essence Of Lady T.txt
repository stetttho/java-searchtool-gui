 IT MUST BE MAGIC, Teena Marie's fourth album, and last album with Motown, is definetly one of her greatest accomplishments in her career! For me, the highlights of this album are "Revolution," on which she vents about the murder of John Lennon, "Square Biz," which was used as the theme song for the last two years of "Hollywood Squares" and is a funky little number on its own, and "Portugese Love," a sensual slow jam beautifully done. This reissue is the real deal because it includes the 12-inch version of "Square Biz" as well as an instrumental version. It also has a live performance of Teena singing a tribute to Donny Hathaway, "Someday We'll All Be Free," and "Deja Vu (I've Been Here Before)," which proves that the power of Teena Marie and her voice is even better live! If you're a fan of Teena Marie, then it's inconceivable for you not to own this CD!
