 CYCLE OF THE WEREWOLF was the first Stephen King novel that I ever read. I read it when I was 13 or 14 years old and found it to be quite scary. Just recently, my little brother read this book and loved it. And he also saw the film SILVER BULLET, the film King made out of the book. So I decided to get this book again and was thrilled with how great it is!  CYCLE OF THE WEREWOLF is a story laid out over one year with each chapter covering a month. During each month, citizens of Tarker's Mills, a sleepy Maine town, are falling prey to something terrifying, something almost human. And only a wheelchair-bound young boy survives and can stop the carnage!  The book is terrifying and smartly-written. The werewolf attacks are described with such precision that you don't want to put the book down. And the illustrations by Bernie Wrightson go along beautifully with the text! One day, I would love to make a TV-movie out of this book (most likely for TNT) and make it faithful to the book!
