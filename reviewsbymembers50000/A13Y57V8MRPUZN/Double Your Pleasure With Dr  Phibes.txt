 Now, the fine folks at MGM have packaged the two greatest films to star the late, great Vincent Price together on a 2-sided disc: THE ABOMIMABLE DR. PHIBES and DR. PHIBES RISES AGAIN! These two movies were the high point of Price's illustrious career in horror movies. As the scarred doctor out to exact revenge on the surgical team he believes is responsible for his wife's death (ABOMINABLE) and goes to Egypt to seek out the River of Life to resurrect his wife (RISES), Price revels in the pure evil and dementia of this character. And there's his lovely assistant Vulnavia, played by Virginia North (ABOMINABLE) and Valli Kemp (RISES), who provides music for each murder among other things. And you can't forget those bumbling Scotland Yard Inspectors Trout (not Pike) and Waverly bumbling and bantering their way through the mayhem. And the witty dialogue is also what makes the DR. PHIBES movies fun, black comedy done right.  There's much to love about each movie, as each one has its own virtues and memorable moments. My favorite part in ABOMINABLE was when the surgeon winds up impaled by a brass unicorn catapulted across the street and the inspectors (I kid you not) must unscrew him from the wall! And in RISES, the one where Biederbeck's friend winds up in a giant gin bottle! And another thing, both DR. PHIBES films have a gambit for each nemesis of Phibes: the head surgeon must surgically remove a key from his son's heart to unlock the chains six minutes before acid pours on his face from above, while Biederbeck (Count Yorga himself) must free his fiancee from chicken wire three minutes before a ceiling with snake daggers descends. I think the makers of SAW were huge fans of these movies, because I immediately thought of this movie while wathing these suspenseful moments.  I can't stress it enough, you need this DVD. It's affordable and will provide constant hours of fun and scares!
