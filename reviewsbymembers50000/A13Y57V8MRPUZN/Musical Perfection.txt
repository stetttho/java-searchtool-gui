 IRONS IN THE FIRE was the first album that Teena Marie wrote, produced, and arranged by herself. It's also one of her greatest albums in her career. The first song alone, "I Need Your Lovin'," is proof that Teena is a master at what she does best! Plus, Teena knows how to sing a great ballad, and "Young Love," the title cut, and "Tune In Tommorow" are among her greatest. She puts a lot of emotion into these ballads and you can hear it in her singing, something that the music industry has sadly lost sight of. IRONS IN THE FIRE is required listening for music lovers getting into Teena Marie and longtime fans alike!
