 I remember watching TERROR TRAIN on television at various points in my childhood. I even taped it off of FX five years ago. And now TERROR TRAIN is finally out on DVD and looks better than ever! This movie is just too cool! Jamie Lee Curtis, one of the best actresses ever to appear in horror movies, is a member of a fraternity of pre-med students who are celebrating a New Year's Eve costume party on board an old-fashioned steam train with Ben Johnson as the conductor. But the party is crashed by a pledge that was subjected to a humiliating prank three years prior. He kills each pledge involved in the prank and disguises himself with the victim's costume. Oh, and David Copperfield is on hand to provide magic to the guests with help from Vanity (aka D.D. Winters). TERROR TRAIN is terrifying without being overly gruesome, relying on the aftermaths of the killings for any blood. The opening prank alone has the impact of any of Tom Savini's fine effects in FRIDAY THE 13TH. Curtis is great as usual, but Johnson steals the show as the conductor that gets caught in the middle of the mayhem. The highlight of TERROR TRAIN, showcased in the widescreen version, is the camera work from John Alcott who is best known for his work with my favorite director, Stanley Kubrick; Alcott adds the right level of tension and suspense to this film, especially during the climax! TERROR TRAIN is required viewing for slasher fans and Kubrick buffs alike!
