 ALL THE COLORS OF THE DARK is one of the finest giallo efforts ever made. When watching this, one seriously has to wonder why Sergio Martino is not any better regarded than he is. He's right up there with Mario Bava and Dario Argento in terms of serving up effective gialli! This film is an effective hybrid of BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE and ROSEMARY'S BABY!  Jane (the uber-gorgeous Edwidge French) is haunted by recurring nightmares supposedly stemming from a miscarriage and a car accident two years ago. But unbeknownst to her boyfriend Richard (George Hilton), her psychosis stems from the memory of her mother's murder, and she keeps seeing the killer (Ivan Rassimov) with weird blue eyes everywhere she turns. So on the advice of a new neighbor (Marina Malfatti of SEVEN BLOOD-STAINED ORCHIDS), she attends a Black Sabbath ceremony in hopes of curing herself of these delusions.  To examine the movie further would be totally unfair, since this movie requires as very little foreknowledge as possible. However I will add that there is a great twist toward the end, one that could only be conceived in the giallo world. Of course, the hypnotic beauty of French should be sufficient enough to consider a viewing! And don't forget Bruno Nicolai's gorgeous and haunting music score; it prefigures Goblin's finest music scores!  Once again, Shriek Show continues to outdo themselves in presenting obscurities to the digital medium. The anamorphic widescreen transfer on this film is truly a sight to behold (enhancing French's beauty even)! They include U.S. title sequence, trailer, and radio spots (as THEY'RE COMING TO GET YOU), interviews with Martino and Hilton, and a great photo gallery (WARNING! Watch after the movie, for it is kind of spoilerish). Giallo buffs, consider this a priority purchase!
