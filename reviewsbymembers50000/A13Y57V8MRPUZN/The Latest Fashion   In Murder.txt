 DRESSED TO KILL (1980) is definetly one of Brian De Palma's masterpieces (the other is CARRIE) for sure! As much as this movie is compared to the great Alfred Hitchcock's best movies (PSYCHO, VERTIGO), this movie also reminds me of Dario Argento's DEEP RED and Mario Bava's BLOOD AND BLACK LACE! The visual style is just awesome with its camerawork, especially in the museum scene and the subway chase! The music by Pino Donnagio (THE HOWLING, TWO EVIL EYES) is perfect and creates the appropriate atmosphere, especially during the elevator scene! But the acting by all involved, especially Michael Caine, Nancy Allen, Angie Dickinson (brilliantly playing against type), Dennis Franz, and Keith Gordon, is truly what makes this film so much fun! A real standout in the slasher wave of 1980! MGM truly gave us the definitive release of DRESSED TO KILL on DVD! First off, you get the option of watching it in the theatrical version or the UNRATED version, both in 16x9 widescreen and looking fabulous (I saw the unrated version, which is what I always vouch for)! Secondly, there are some great documentaries on the making of this movie, including the way it was censored to earn theatrical release; they even go as far as to compare scenes from the theatrical, unrated and the NETWORK TELEVISION versions! There's also an animated photo gallery with the music from the museum scene in the background and an enlightening advertising gallery. Note that I haven't summarized this movie because DRESSED TO KILL is that good; you simply have to see it for yourself if you haven't seen it already! Make sure you see it unrated, and tell 'em Bobbi sent ya!
