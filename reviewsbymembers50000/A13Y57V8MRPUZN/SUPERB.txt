 SEVEN BLOOD-STAINED ORCHIDS is a close second to Argento's excellent DEEP RED as my favorite giallo! Directed with flair and tension by Umberto Lenzi, who was best known for CANNIBAL FEROX/MAKE THEM DIE SLOWLY, EATEN ALIVE, and NIGHTMARE CITY, ORCHIDS tells the story of a killer who murders women in all kinds of gruesome ways (bludgeoning, drowning, strangling, and power-drilling) and leaves a silver half-moon locket in their hands. One victim (Uschi Glass) survives her attack and, together with her husband (Antonio Sabato), she finds a connection between herself and the other victims: They were all at the seaside hotel that she once managed. And the locket belonged to a guest that was also there one day.  To reveal anymore about SEVEN BLOOD-STAINED ORCHIDS would be unfair, as this film requires very little foreknowledge as possible. The story is engrossing from beginning to end, the performances are great, and the murder sequences rank up there with anything Bava or Argento (or even Fulci) has ever done. The power-drill sequence is the highlight for me; it was the inspiration for Abel Ferrara's DRILLER KILLER and murders with power drills were featured in THE TOOLBOX MURDERS and DePalma's BODY DOUBLE. And the music by Riz Ortilani is among the best music scores in EuroHorror history; it's right up there with the works of Ennio Morricone, Goblin, and even Bernard Herrmann. I'll even go as far as to say that ORCHIDS reaces the levels of Hitchcock!  Yes, Lenzi's film was more infulential than its obscurity might lead you to believe. I highly recommend this film to any horror or thriller buff!
