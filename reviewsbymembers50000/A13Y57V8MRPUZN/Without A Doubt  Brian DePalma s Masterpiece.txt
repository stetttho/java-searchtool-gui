 Not only is Brian DePalma's adaptation of Stephen King's first novel CARRIE one of the greatest American horror movies ever made, but it is one of the most beautiful horror movies ever created. Everything about this movie (the writing, the camerawork, the music score, the performances, and the production design) comes together like the greatest works of art ever created, mainly from the Renaissance. I just fell in love with this movie and the way it was executed by all involved. With CARRIE, Brian DePalma, a man constantly compared to Alfred Hitchcock in various extremes, is in a class all his own; he's right up there with Dario Argento and Mario Bava in visual style and camerawork. I almost cried at certain points, but was on the edge of my seat most of the time! This Special Edition has everything for the diehard fan of DePalma, King, or CARRIE. Two brilliant documentaries provide a wealth of enlightening trivia, one on the actors and the other on the production. There's also a great animated photo gallery with the gorgeous score playing in the background, a bit on the musical, and comprehensive notes on the differences between the novel and the movie, differences that Stephen King even liked! I am so happy I bought this DVD for my first viewing of CARRIE in its entirety (I saw it on TV a few times). Have you noticed that there is no plot synopsis in my review, like there was none in my review for DRESSED TO KILL? Well, that's because I find that Brian DePalma does these movies in such a way that I don't even want to give away any of what happens in these movies. I only want to tell you about how gorgeous and how scary these movies end up being because DePalma does them so lovingly every time. If you haven't seen CARRIE (whether you read the novel or not is irrelevant), then please kick yourself, run out and rent this movie on video or DVD, and then feel free to add it to your collection! You won't regret it!
