 I used to watch THE TOMORROW PEOPLE when it ran on New Jersey Network (a public access station) on Saturday evenings. This is an intriguing show, kind of like "X-Men" for the DOCTOR WHO crowd. The psychedelic opening and theme song stuck with me for the next decade. So imagine my shock when I found that THE TOMORROW PEOPLE on DVD today at Best Buy while I was looking for THE STRANGE VICE OF MS. WARDH and THE CASE OF THE SCORPION'S TAIL! I couldn't resist, even though it set me back about $52!  The first two seasons of this fine series are collected here in Set 1. From "The Slaves of Jedikiah," which introduces Stephen to the group of powerful children that try to save the world, to "The Doomsday Men," where the kids try to prevent Armageddon, THE TOMORROW PEOPLE is as much fun as you remember whether you caught it during its first run or saw the reruns on Nickelodeon (which revived it for a time in the early 1990's) or public access (like me). So "jaunt" your way to your video retailer and get this set!
