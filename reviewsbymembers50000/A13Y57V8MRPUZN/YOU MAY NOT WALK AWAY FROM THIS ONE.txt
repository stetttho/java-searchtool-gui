 Mario Bava's movies are like songs by The Beatles: every one of them is a mini-masterpiece that in one way or another changed the way music was made (or in this case, horror movies). With BLOOD AND BLACK LACE, Bava singlehandedly created the giallo, probably THE greatest facet in Italian horror next to the Zombie Holocaust subgenre. But TWITCH OF THE DEATH NERVE (aka A BAY OF BLOOD, CARNAGE, LAST HOUSE-PART 2, REAZIONE A CATENA (CHAIN REACTION), ECOLOGIA DEL DELITTO (THE ECOLOGY OF MURDER) and ANTEFATTO (BEFORE THE FACT)) is by far the most revolutionary of Mario Bava's horror films. Made in 1972, a banner year for the giallo (Fulci's excellent DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING and Argento's FOUR FLIES ON GREY VELVET, just to name a few), TWITCH OF THE DEATH NERVE was the blueprint for the tidal wave of slasher movies in the late '70s and early '80s (e.g., the FRIDAY THE 13TH series, THE PROWLER, MADMAN, THE BURNING). In fact, FRIDAY THE 13TH producer/director Sean S. Cunningham even confirms the fact that all these slasher movies owe a debt to Bava (according to Tim Lucas, the leading expert on Bava, in his commentary for BLOOD AND BLACK LACE)! But on its own, TWITCH OF THE DEATH NERVE is a darkly funny commentary on greed and the preservation of nature and mostly murder! There are no likeable characters in TWITCH OF THE DEATH NERVE. Everybody, from Countess Frederica to those four teenagers, is so dire and self-centered that it's damn near impossible to identify with any of them. But that's what makes it so damn good. Their eventual killings are not so much fueled by greed as by karma. As with a good EC Comic, those who refuse to play nice are gonna get what's coming to them, and boy do these people have it coming to them! Those awesome gore effects, like the spearing and the decapitation, come from none other than Carlo Rambaldi, who did the effects for E.T., ALIEN, POSSESSION, and Argento's DEEP RED, just to name a few. I like the humorously ironic ending; that ending makes TWITCH OF THE DEATH NERVE the DR. STRANGELOVE of horror movies, but I wouldn't dream of giving away the joke. Yes, TWITCH OF THE DEATH NERVE is so evocative and scary (what else would you expect from Bava?) that I can forgive the sound quality for being a little off. I hope Bill Lustig's Blue Underground can secure the rights to Mario Bava's work because this company always does such an excellent job with their DVD releases. I bet that they can clean up and remaster the soundtrack with at least a 2.0 stereo surround mix (or maybe an EX surround and a DTS mix), maybe add a commentary from Lucas among a few extras. They could even give anamorphic enhancement to BLOOD AND BLACK LACE, THE WHIP AND THE BODY, LISA AND THE DEVIL, and HOUSE OF EXORCISM; I'm speculating but I sure hope this will happen in the foreseeable future. But for now, Image Entertainment's DVD, with a glorious anamorphic transfer and trailers for this and other Bava goodies like the aforementioned LISA and EXORCISM, does the trick. In any case, TWITCH OF THE DEATH NERVE, the most influential movie from the founding father of Italian horror, is a definite must-watch for slasher buffs!
