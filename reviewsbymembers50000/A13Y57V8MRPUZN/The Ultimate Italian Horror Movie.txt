 Two weeks ago, at 5:30 in the morning, I watched SUSPIRIA for the first time. No wonder why this is the most popular horror movie from Italy; this movie is not just a horror movie, it's an entirely new experience! SUSPIRIA is about an American ballet student attending the Tanz Academy in Germany and the weirdness she encounters. I won't go into the plot too deeply, or anything else about it, because it really doesn't matter and it doesn't make much sense anyway. But I will say that the effect of SUSPIRIA is akin to a nightmare; it's as if Dario Argento went into somebody's mind as a nightmare was happening and captured it all on film! The sets, the lighting, the photography, the special effects, and that music score all make the expeirence unforgettable! The Limited Edition is the best way to own SUSPIRIA. Along with the beautifully remastered movie (THX-certified no less), the Limited Edition includes a 25th Anniversary documentary with interviews and anecdotes from Argento; co-writer Daria Nicolodi; stars Jessica Harper, Stefania Casini, Udo Kier; the band Goblin, who made that awesome score among others such as Argento's DEEP RED; and others. It also includes the CD soundtrack, the ultimate bonus; now you get to listen to Goblin's awesome compositions on your stereo or CD Walkman and get chills! Also in the Limited Edition are 9 lobby cards, the Chapter listings, and a great booklet including a Jessica Harper interview. As an Argento fan (or a SUSPIRIA fan), it would be inconceivable not to own this awesome DVD release of this incredible movie!
