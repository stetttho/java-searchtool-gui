 I had the incredible fortune of buying HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME five days before its release date at FYE in Dover Mall. And this movie is one of the best slasher movies ever made! J. Lee Thompson, best known for directing war movies like THE GUNS OF NAVARONE and MISSING IN ACTION and by far the best PLANET OF THE APES sequel (CONQUEST OF...), proves suprisingly adept in staging suspensful set-pieces and shocking murder sequences like the shishkabob murder spotlighted in the original poster (replicated for the insert). The best thing about HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME is that this is the closest to the slasher genre's Italian ancestor, the giallo, that a slasher movie has ever come. The psychological thriller angle is executed brilliantly and gives the film an edge over all other entries in the slasher sweepstakes of 1980. Plus, the story actually provides character development in between the murder and mayhem, which is always appreciated. Melissa Sue Anderson of LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE fame is excellent as the put-upon heroine who must endure returning memories of the traumatic car accident that killed her mother and the circumstances that lead to that tragedy, as well as the murders of her friends. And despite being percieved as a major nadir in an illustrious career, Glenn Ford adds a touch of class as the  doctor who tries to help our heroine. And let's not forget future YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS star Tracy Bergman's debut performance as Anderson's best friend, or the last 10 minutes of this movie. In short, HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME is more in league with Brian De Palma's DRESSED TO KILL than FRIDAY THE 13TH. The 1.85:1 hi-def anamorphic widescreen transfer of this movie alone is worth the price of the DVD; it makes the film look like it was made in 2000, not 1980! There's trailers for I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, IDENTITY, and RESIDENT EVIL: APOCALYPSE accompanying the disc. If you're a fan of slasher movies, then it's inconcievable for you not to own this movie.
