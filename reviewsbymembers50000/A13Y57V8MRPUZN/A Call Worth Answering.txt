 Between HALLOWEEN and FRIDAY THE 13TH, there was WHEN A STRANGER CALLS. Directed by Fred Walton, this movie looks like an episode of ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS. Those first moments with Jill (Carol Kane) receiving those phone calls ("Have you checked the children?") are the scariest since Argento's SUSPIRIA, except that STRANGER relies on good-old-fashioned mood, tension and atmosphere. And the editing and visual trickery add to the fear factor! Personally, I don't see what all the fuss is about concerning the middle section; I think fleshing out the villain Curt Duncan (Tony Beckeley) and the cop John Clifford (the always-excellent Charles Durning) was extremely important to the story. In fact, showing how crazy Curt Duncan really was pre-dated MANIAC and DON'T GO IN THE HOUSE of a year later. And the final act, with Jill, now a wife and mother, forced to face the terror again, is a brilliant capper. Forget the lame remake, the original WHEN A STRANGER CALLS is among the finest suspense thrillers ever made!
