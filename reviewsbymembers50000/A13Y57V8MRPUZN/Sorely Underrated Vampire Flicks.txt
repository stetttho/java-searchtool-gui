 Wow! These movies are amazing! COUNT YORGA, VAMPIRE was one of the best modern-day vampire movies ever made! Robert Quarry is excellent as the bloodsucker who uses hypnosis, a dry wit, and a harem of female vampires. And woe be unto those who try to get in his way! The humor in this film is another asset, with lines like "I'm the 47th nut to report a vampire." RETURN OF COUNT YORGA is even better, with more witty dialogue and even scarier moments than the original. And Mariette Hartley, as the prospective bride, is superb!  I've noticed that Count Yorga is kind of like Charles Manson. Watch the scene in RETURN where his harem slaughter Hartley's family. It reminds me of the murder of Sharon Tate in the way that the female followers kill under the influence of the Count. Yorga more or less brainwashes his victims in the same vein of Manson's influence on his "flower children." And both films end with a real jolt! I really can't go into detail about the endings, just watch it! Obviously a major influence on Joss Whedon. And best of all, you get both movies on a 2-sided disc! Go seek out the Count for yourself!
