 As a router, no problem at all. Style - is nice, comes with a vertical stand so it looks like a PS2 in some ways. Functionality - does what it's suppose to.  Works great as a router.  Wireless, I can't say much since I live in a 1 bedroom apartment and I only use the wireless functionality in 2 rooms next to eachother.  Seems to be good =). Control Panel - Can be a little more user friendly, had problems finding things at times, but not bad.
