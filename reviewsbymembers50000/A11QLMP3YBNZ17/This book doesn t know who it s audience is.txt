 This book goes through 4 examples of real webpages and how they might be done.  The book is written by four people and that's probably where the issue is.    It sounds like the book is aimed towards beginners, but touches on some advanced topics.  It touches a little on CSS, a little on PHP/mysql, a little on design in general, etc  It just sounds like the four authors didn't coordinate well.  If you are an advanced user, this book may be good in finding out how to do certain functionalities easier with dreamweaver, but still too much writing to read for that use.  You may consider just getting a Dreamweaver reference manual by somebody else in that case.
