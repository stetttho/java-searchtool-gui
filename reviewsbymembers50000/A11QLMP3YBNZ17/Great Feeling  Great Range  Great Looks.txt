 Pros - Looks great!  Blue see-through keyboard and the bluetooth receiver glowing blue makes my workstation look futuristic. - Feels Great!  I've been through many Logitech/Microsoft mouses, this mouse feels great in my hands. - Quiet Keys!  The keys are very quiet as I type.  Can type away even with someone in the room sleeping.  Cons - Doesn't work outside of Windows!  My PC's Bluetooth Keyboard does not work until I get into Windows.  Meaning, any setup I want to do right when the PC starts, I cannot do it with the Bluetooth keyboard.  It may just be my computer - Batteries - Requires 2 AA each for the keyboard and mouse.  I thought by now, all mouse/keyboards had a charger+rechargable batteries.  At least there is a battery life indicator in Windows. - Delay - There is always a delay (about a good 5 seconds) when I start using it after not using it for about 20 minutes.  Overall, I'm happy with my purchase.  Works great.
