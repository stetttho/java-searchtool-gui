 Pros - Excellent story teller.  Slow when needed, Fast when needed, Quiet when needed, Loud when needed. - Perfect type of music played at the right time. - Really recommended for teachers to play in an elementary school during Halloween.   Cons - When playing CD, sometimes hard to tell when a track ends or starts.  You can't tell whether the new story is part of the previous story or not.   Just a Note - One of the things that made the book scary were the creepy drawings.  The audio CD attempts to be creepy without the drawings.   - Has nothing to do with the audio, but the story itself is somewhat on the cheesy side.  It will only scare kids younger than.. say 13.
