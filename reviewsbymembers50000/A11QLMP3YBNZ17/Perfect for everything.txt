 I am a long time Windows user and I finally decided to try out a mac to see what all the fuss was about.  After two days of use, I am in love.  I also have some relatives that were only Windows user but drueled over my laptop.  Some Points I love about it - when I turn off the room light, the laptop LCD dims and keys light up (AWESOME!) - when I press FN+F9, I can see ALL the windows that are open.  F11 and I can hide everything on my screen (very smooth and very useful).  If I'm playing a game, I can hide it from my boss with one F11 button press. - Do spywares not exist for the mac?  I seem to get no popups - Doesn't seem to crash as much as Windows.  After a week, I have never had to force quit a software or reboot. - everything is just so much more simpler (not too much going on on the screen.  Bad Point - not many use it so hard to get any help or suggestions on it (only online). - won't run many of my favorite programs like (Doom3, Robodemo, etc.)
