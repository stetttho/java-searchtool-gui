 Does what it's suppose to do.    Windows 2K, 98SE, won't recognize some USB sticks out there, but this memory stick worked perfectly with anything.  So far, I always carry this unit without a cap in my pocket almost everyday, have never lost data yet.  Not as slim as some of the latest USB sticks, but the blue definitely looks cool.  Does what it promises.  I like it!
