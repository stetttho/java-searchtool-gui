 The movie is a true story about "Brandon Link/Lang" and his experience with sports gambling.  Pros - Acting is great.  Love watching Al Pacino and McConaughey acting in this one. - Bonus with the interview with the real Brandon Link is worth watching. - Movie is exciting half way through and educational to watch. - Gamblers can probably relate a lot to this movie.  Con - As someone else said, 2nd half of the movie was pretty dull and repetitive. - The ending did not work.  They tried to make it dramatic, but it just didn't work.  Overall - Rent it.
