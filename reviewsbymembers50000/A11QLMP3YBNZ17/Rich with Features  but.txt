 - FEATURES - I like it!  From the beginning, gave me a screen on what I would like to make and had a simple template for everything.  Movie sizes were smaller and liked how I can preview movies in another tab. - COMPATIBILITY (HEADACHE)- If you want to use their latest components or library, be prepared for users to install Flash Player 7.0+.  This part is giving me a headache since my users are very novice with these things. - UNSTABLE - This has to be the biggest flaw of this software.  Now I'm use to saving after every change because of how unstable it is.  I get the annoying "Windows cannot recover Flash MX 2004" and it crashes out. - OVERALL - NICE, if it worked the way it's suppose to be.  I would NOT recommend it to other buyers.  Develope in Flash MX until Flash Player 7.0 has gone around the world.  Remember to save frequently.  I wish I can get my money back =(.
