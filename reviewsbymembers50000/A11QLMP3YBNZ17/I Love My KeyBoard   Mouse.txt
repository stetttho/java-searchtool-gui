 Definitely worth getting.  I love all the short-cut buttons.  Looks great and works great. Microsoft's customer support has been incredibly well.  I called regarding the mouse breaking and in a week, I had a brand new mouse. I would recommend this package to anyone who's looking for a mouse/keyboard.  If you have a big hand, look into their Microsoft Optical Explorer Mouse.
