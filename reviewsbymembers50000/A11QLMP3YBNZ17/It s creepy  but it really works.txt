 I was not a believer.  I've tried using this with many friends, but it never worked or it would "slowly" move (someone in the group is fooling around).  When it works, it will move very fast and smoothly.  I tried once with a friend at night and it moved in circles really fast and stopped at an answer.  It was creepy, but it worked.  We were talking to some spirit.
