 I purchased this so me and my gf can talk when we go to some event.  She's a little embarrassed to be talking on it, but definitely does help.  Never had one before so can't compare to anything else.  I can easily talk about 2 blocks away. Sometimes fun to start sending out messages and talking to someone random.  I don't think that's what it's suppose to be used for, but oh well.
