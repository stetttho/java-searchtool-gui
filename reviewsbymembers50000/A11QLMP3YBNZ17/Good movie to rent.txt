 If you watched this movie at the theater and want to see the alternate endings, please don't bother.  The 4 alternate endings are done very poorly and not worth renting/buying just for this.  As for the people that have never watched this movie, it's a good renter.  If you have watched and liked "Secret Window", you will like this.  At the same time, if you didn't like it, this will be a disappointment.  Acting is great and movie does give you a good thrill.
