 I love the back/forward button so I can navigate easier/faster.  The mouse has a nice and round back that fits nicely into your palms.   My first one stopped responding.  Microsoft sent me a new one within a week (no hassle at all).  The second one is still being used.. it has been with me for over 2 years now. Excellent customer service, excellent product.
