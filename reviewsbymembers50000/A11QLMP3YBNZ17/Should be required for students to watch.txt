 This movie was not entertaining to watch like some action movie, but definitely kept me from sleeping.  I had no regrets about watching the movie.  Probably saved me from having a heart problem.  McDonalds, the store that is located almost anywhere was my choice to eat whenever I needed to rush.  Probably is the choice for many of us.  This movie will change and save you from it.
