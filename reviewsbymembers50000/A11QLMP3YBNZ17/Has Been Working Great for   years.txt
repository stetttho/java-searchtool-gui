 I originally got this monitor because it was just cheap and it was a 19".  4 years later, people'll come to my monitor and say that it's nice. Some things to nit-pick about would be that it's not flat-panel and it's very heavy.  It's a 19" so can't complain. No regrets at all.  If you want to save money, and want a reliable 19", get it!
