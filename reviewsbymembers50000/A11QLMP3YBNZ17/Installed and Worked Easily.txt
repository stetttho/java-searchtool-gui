 I used this with my Netgear wireless router.  Installation - Very Good -Plugged it in and was automatically detected on Windows XP.  Was able to use it right away after some basic configuration on the router.  Nit-picking - Looks bad and don't know where to put If anything, I don't like the way this unit looks.  Looks very cheap and it's hard to come up where to put it.  It has a little clip on it, but it's useless.  I just taped it onto the wall, but does not look good.
