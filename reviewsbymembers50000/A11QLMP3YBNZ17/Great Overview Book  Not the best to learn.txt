 This book does cover a lot of material for Flash MX.  By reading through this book, you will see what Flash can do, but not really know how to do it.  There were many times I would look up XXXXX and the book will say  "Flash MX can also do XXXXX, this really helps." But it is VERY brief on how to do it.  So 5 if you just want to see what Flash can do or have experience with it and need to refresh your mind.  1 if you don't know anything about Flash and using it to learn.
