 Did you know Google can find you best prices, do translations, or even fill out online forms for you? "How to Do Everything with Google" by Fritz Schneider goes over everything from how to enter a query all the way to configuring your Google toolbar.  Whether you are a complete beginner or an advanced web browser, Google will help you use Google to it's fullest capability.  The book is very friendly.  Has plenty of pictures with notes and does not use technical terms.  The chapters were straight to the point and kept short. To nitpick, the book could have shown examples on some advanced topic such as "advanced operators" to give a better understanding of how to use it.  This was probably not included to keep the book beginner friendly. Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone that thinks Google is just another good search engine.
