 It's fun slashing, breaking, stomping skeleton warriors, but I feel there's something missing. Capcom made it so, you can't continue unlimited times which makes the game tougher for novice players.  Game was a bit tough. I don't feel like there's any replay value.  I think many feel this way because on auction sites, you will find many copies of Maximo. So overall, fun at first, no more fun in about a month.
