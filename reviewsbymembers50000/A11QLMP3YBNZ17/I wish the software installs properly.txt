 I installed Norton Systemworks 2006 on two systems.  Both failed and I cannot get it work on either.  Avoid it.  2004 and 2005 were more stable.  1 of them, for some reason deleted the hard disk partition.  I lost everything in two partitions (images, music).  Still in middle of having someone recover what they can.  Other one installed and then everytime the computer restarts, it opens Norton Systemworks at startup and locks up.  Could do nothing but to uninstall to avoid the annoying lock up screen.
