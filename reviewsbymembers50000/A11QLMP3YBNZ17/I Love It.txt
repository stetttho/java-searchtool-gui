 I just wanted a digital camera I can fit in my pocket and walk around with everyday.  This did the job.  Not only that, the camera's pictures amazed me.  I can even take short videos with sound!  The first day I used it in public, people around me were amazed how tiny this camera is.  I use to own a HP315, but the S200 beats it 100%.   If there are anything to nit-pick about... I wish the camera can record videos longer than 10-20 seconds.  Regardless of your Compact Flash size, it can only take videos that long.  You need to keep recording after the 10-20 seconds.  Also, if you want to Zoom more than 2x, try the Canon S330 or I believe the S230 has it as well.
