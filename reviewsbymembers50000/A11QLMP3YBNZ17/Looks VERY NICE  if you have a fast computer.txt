 - SLOW - compared to MX, many new features such as showing width/height size of pictures/tables when you click on them, but this made it hard to make simple edits.  I'm running on an Athlon XP 2000, it should be a decent CPU for a HTML editor. - UNSTABLE - This has to be the biggest flaw of this software.  Now I'm use to saving after every change because of how unstable it is.  I get the annoying "Windows cannot recover Dreamweaver" and it crashes out. - OVERALL - NICE, if it worked the way it's suppose to.  I would NOT recommend it to other buyers.  I wish I can get my money back =(.
