 I use to own a Canon S200 and an old HP digicam. The Canon S200 lacks in pixels and the S400 is just overkill and overpriced.  Canon S230 sits right in between and everything is right. POSITIVE - it's small, carry it in your pocket - durable, I had no case, hit it around a couple of times, still no problem - takes up to around 2 minutes of film. - the price is awesome ... - rechargable battery and charger - lasts a long time. NEGATIVE - if anything, I wish the video quality was a bit better.
