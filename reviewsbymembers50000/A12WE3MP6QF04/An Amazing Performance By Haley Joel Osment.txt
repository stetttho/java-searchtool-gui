 The Sixth Sense was definitely one of the most satisfying movies of this past year.  Nominated for several Academy Awards this year including the coveted Best Picture as well as Best Director, Best Original Screenplay,  Best Original Score, Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress.   All the performances are impressive in the movie, especially that of  11-year old Haley Joel Osment who is the youngest Oscar-nominee this year.   I have to admit, this kid has got talent.  More talent than a lot of other  actors 4 times his age.  Bruce Willis may have been the so-called star of  this movie but the kid definitely stole the show.  I was very pleased to  see that Toni Collette (Muriel's Wedding) was nominated in this year's  Oscar race.  She was completed ignored at the Golden Globe and Screen  Actors Guild Awards.  Her final scene in the movie is one of my favourites.   Osment talks to his mother, played by Collette about her deceased  Grandmother.  He assures that she continues to watch over her and that she  has made her very proud as her grand-daughter.  The breakdown scene in the  car was so beautifully acted.  As for the movie's Oscar chances come this  March, l definitely know that it won't win Best Picture, but it does have a  good chance at snagging Best Original Screenplay and l don't care what  anyone says, l'm rooting for the kid to win on Oscar night.  See this movie  if you haven't already.  The surprising plot twists and amazing  performances are all worth it.
