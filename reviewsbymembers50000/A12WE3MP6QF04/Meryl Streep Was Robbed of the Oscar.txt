 Meryl Streep continues to amaze me by adding another performance to her gallery of great roles. Being a guy l have to be honest to say that l cried throughout the film, especially near the end.  The whole issue of cancer is  a very challening topic to present on film.  "One True Thing"  does a fantastic job at addressing one family's struggle with the  life-threatening illness.  Although the film starts off very slowly, l was  intrigued with the struggle and friction that exists within a family.   Meryl Streep earned her 11th Oscar nomination for this performance and she  is amazing.  I have to say that she was robbed of the Best Actress Oscar.   Gwyneth Paltrow for "Shakespeare In Love" ?  Pleeeease.  The  bathroom scene where Renee Zellwegger helps Meryl out of the bathtub is  heartbreaking to watch.  And when Meryl asks her daughter to help her out  of her pain is the point of the movie where l'm sobbing like a baby.  I was  totally blown away by the power and raw emotion of that scene.  I don't  want to spoil the whole movie for you but if you're a fan of Meryl Streep's  work, then you won't be disappointed.  And forget about getting the tissue  out, bring a whole roll of toilet paper cause you're gonna need it.  This  movie is 5 star weeper.
