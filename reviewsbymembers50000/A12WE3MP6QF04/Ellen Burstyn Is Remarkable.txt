 What can l say that's already been said about this dark and harrowing film ?  I can blab all day about the superb direction but what l really want to bring to your attention is the Oscar-nominated performance of Ellen Burstyn.  She has already racked up a slew of Best Actress awards from the Chicago, Las Vegas, Boston and Florida Film Critics.  Her Independent Spirit, Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild nominations are strong indications that she has an excellent chance at winning her second Best Actress Oscar statuette come this March 2001.  Her character's decent into drug addiction is so harrowing and heartbreaking to watch that you are literally glued to the screen.  The supporting cast all do wonderful jobs with regards to showing their emotional vulnerability on screen.  One of my favourite scenes is in the apartment of Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) where she imagines her refridgerator coming alive, threatening to eat her.  In that one scene alone, the musical score, acting, visual effects and direction are all at their best.  And the scene of Sarah's talk with her son about being old and alone is so heartbreaking.  Acting at it's best, in my opinion.  I bet they will use that very scene as her "Oscar clip" at this years Academy Awards ceremony.  The film is also very dark and sometimes graphic so beware if you're someone who watches only PG movies.  I love the musical score as well.  One of the best of this past year.  It truly effected to mood of the entire film and made it all the more enjoyable for me as a viewer.  Don't miss this film if you want to see one of the top ten films of this past year.
