 The reason why l love this film so much is the performance of Academy Award-winner, Whoopi Goldberg.  People tend to label her a gifted comedienne but that`s not all she is, as this film proves.  In the role of  Clara Mayfield, Whoopi Goldberg recaptures the spirit and beauty of her  award-winning portrayal of Celie from "The Colour Purple".  As l  sat watching this film, l was mesmerized by her.  And newcomer, Neil  Patrick Harris` Golden Globe-nominated performance as David is equally  powerful.  The dramatic score is another plus.  Sweeping notes from the  piano, flute and mandolin are enchanting to listen to and they only add  more beautiful textures to the film.  Now that l`ve explained what l love  about the actors and score, l should tell you a little bit about the story.   The film is basically about Jamaican housekeeper, Clara Mayfield (Whoopi  Goldberg), who comes into the life of a troubled young boy named David  (Neil Patrick Harris).  David is a young man caught in the middle of his  parents` messy divorce.  I'm sure a lot of people out there can relate to  this story.  Clara is the one who helps David confront his pain, and in  turn the two develop a strong bond of friendship and love.  I highly  recommend this film which is filled with terrific performances, especially  by the talented Whoopi Goldberg.  This woman can make me laugh and cry.
