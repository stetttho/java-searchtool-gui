 This DVD is something great.  Not only do you get commentary from writer/director Kevin Smith ("Clerks", "Mallrats") but also Ben Affleck and some of the producers.  In the commentary I was intrigued with what Kevin Smith had to say about his favourite scenes, the score, why he cut certain scenes and each of the actor's performances.  The Criterion Edition of this DVD is packed with extras which include trailers, commentary, deleted scenes & outtakes, an introduction by Kevin Smith, etc. Ones of my favourite scenes is the emotional blowout between Holden (Affleck) and Amy (Adams) in the arena parking lot.  Joey Laura Adams is simply exceptional.  In the commentary Kevin Smith can't stop blabbing over Joey Lauren Adams' performance being a "tour-de-force" and it definitely is.  In this scene she gives every ounce of energy into her performance.  I would have to agree with Kevin Smith in saying that the most powerful line is that scene was "No !  I used them !!"  You have to watch it to know what I'm talking about. Ben Affleck and Jason Lee were very good as well.  Ben Affleck's performance had some many powerful subtlties.  Jason Lee was very effective as his comical bestfriend who holds in a lot of deep hostility, jealousy and anger due to his own personal issues that he has trouble facing.  Jason Lee won the Independent Spirit award as Best Supporting Male for his performance.  Joey Lauren Adams performance was nominated for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical at the Golden Globes that year.  She certainly derserved it.  Be sure not to miss this very important movie that tackles deep issues about love, friendship and self-discovery.
