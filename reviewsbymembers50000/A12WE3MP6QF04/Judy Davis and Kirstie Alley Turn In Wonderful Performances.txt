 Even though the movie was a little bit of a bore, l found that Judy Davis and Kirstie Alley turned in two of that year's best supporting performances.  Yet, neither of them weren't even nominated for an Oscar  that year.  One of my favourite scenes in the film is between Kirstie Alley  and Woody Allen when she confronts him about his cheating in the past.   Kirstie Alley's rage on the brink of insanity is hilarious the watch.  I  was almost crying from laughter when l first watched it on video.  Judy  Davis is practically in every one of Woody Allen's movies and she yet again  proves her comedic talents.  Her flip out scene in the beginning of the  film is fun to watch.  I am not really a fan of Woody Allen's work.  I just  like it when l see great performances from people who get the right part to  truly shine on the big screen.  Sometimes when people tear through the  scenery in a movie it is really fun to watch.  I suggest this movie just  for the performances from Judy Davis and Kirstie Alley.
