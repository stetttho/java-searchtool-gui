 This movie has got to be one of Martin Scorsese's best.  It ranks right up there with "Taxi Driver" and "Raging Bull".  I have always thought of Martin Scorsese as of the best directors we have today.  He always seems to a have a great attention to detail and always directs his actors/actresses into giving tour-de-force performances.  The film won both Best Picture and Best Director awards from the New York Film Critics as well as numerous Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Supporting Actor (Pesci) and Best Supporting Actress (Bracco). The entire cast is exceptional, including Joe Pesci in his Oscar-winning role.  I was very surprised that Ray Liotta never received an Oscar nomination for his performance.  I thought he turned in one the best performances of that year.  And Robert DeNiro.......what can I say except that he's Robert DeNiro, one of the finest actors working today.  He has such a great scene towards the end of the film where he just finds out that Joe Pesci's character has been killed.  He is devastated and in such pain that he tries to hold it all inside.  Watching him try not to cry in that scene is remarkable.  And Oscar-nominee Lorraine Bracco has many great moments in the film including angrily confronting her husband's mistress through an apartment lobby phone and holding a loaded gun to her husband's face over his infidelity.  The soundtrack is another wonderful aspect of the film.  Every single song was probably specifically chosen for a particular scene in the film.  One of the disappointing things about this DVD is that it's not packed with extra's such as documentaries, director's commentary, deleted scenes, etc.  It hardly has anything.  In the future I hope they produce a Special Collector's Edition.  If you haven't seen this film then you don't know what you're missing.  It is a must-see !!
