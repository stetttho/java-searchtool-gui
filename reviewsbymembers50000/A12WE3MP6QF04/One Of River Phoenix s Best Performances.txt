 What is so remarkable about this film is the performance of River Phoenix.  The issue of gay hustling is something a lot of people shy away from because they're scared of what they don't know or they're uncomfortable in  dealing with their own inadequacies about the subject.  But if you can step  through that issue then you won't be disappointed with this film.  River  Phoenix won the Best Actor Award from the National Society of Film Critics  for his performance in this film and he certainly deserved it.  The whole  film is mainly about acceptance and just wanting to be loved.  It's as  simple as that.  A few notable scenes are around the campfire between River  Phoenix and Keanu Reeves and in the trailer home between River's character  and his estranged father.  Please don't shy away from this powerful and  provocative film by Academy Award-nominated director, Gus Van Sant (Good  Will Hunting).
