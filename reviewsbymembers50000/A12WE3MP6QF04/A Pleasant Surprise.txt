 "Trick" was definitely worth the money to rent on home video.  I just recently watched it and was surprised at how much l enjoyed it.  Christian Campbell turns in a wonderful, vunerable performance as the main  character, Gabe, who is having trouble with writer's block and facing his  own inadequacies about being a young, gay man.  One wonderful scene that l  enjoyed in the movie was between the characters Gabe and Mark at the subway  entrance.  After an argument, Gabe runs after Mark to give him his keys as  Mark stands below the steps waiting for some kind of answer or apology.   But Gabe doesn't answer and Mark leaves. You feel crushed and then all of  sudden Gabe blurts out, "Are you hungry ?" but no one answers.  You're left thinking, could this possibly be the end and then all of sudden  Mark appears from around the corner with a small smile on his face.  That  was one of the favourite scenes in the entire movie.  John Paul Pitoc does  a fantastic job at portraying Mark, Gabe's object of desire.  Although l've  never heard of the two main actors, l truly believe that we will definitely  see more of their talent in future projects.  Tori Spelling finally does  some credible work as Gabe's bestfriend, a struggling wannabe  singer-actress.  Although the film tends to drag on too long in some scenes  (ie. Tori Spelling's song and dance number), the overall dialogue and  energy is refreshing to watch.  Some great comedic highlights in the film  are between Gabriel and a drag queen in the washroom of a dance club and  Tori Spelling's emotional outburst in a resturant. Both Christian Campbell  and John Paul Pitoc do a great job at keeping the sexual attraction strong  and sparkling throughout the film and by the end you're left feeling warm  and happy, wanting to see more. I heard about this film through the  Sundance Film Festival and am glad that l got the chance to see it.  I  highly recommend it to anyone with any open heart for a sweet romance.
