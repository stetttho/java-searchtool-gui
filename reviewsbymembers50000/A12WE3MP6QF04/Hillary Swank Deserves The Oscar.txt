 "Boys Don't Cry" was one of the most emotionally gripping films of this past year.  Hillary Swank has already won the Golden Globe and every other major film critics award for Best Actress (i.e. New York, L.A.  and Chicago Film Critics, etc.) and she certainly deserves all the  recognition she's receiving.  Her performance as the doomed Brandon Teena  is riveting.  Combining a sweet akwardness and shy vunerability is what  makes Swank's performance so compelling.  She is definitely my favourite to  win on Oscar night.  And if she does win l would just like to say to all  those skeptics out there who doubted her talent, "I told you so."  Equally compelling is her co-star, Chloe Sevigny, who portrays Brandon  Teena's girlfriend.  The two have some amazing scenes together which  display the raw talent of each of their award-winning performances.  Even  though this is a small, independent film, l believe it needs to be seen by  a larger audience.  Go see the film if you haven't already.  Be warned that  the film does take a dark, violent turn near the end but l guarantee you  you will most definitely be left feeling the powerful impact of this  true-life story.
