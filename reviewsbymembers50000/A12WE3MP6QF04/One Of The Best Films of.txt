 "That Piano" was definitely one of the best films of 1993.  The performances from the cast were spellbinding.  Holly Hunter certainly deserved the Best Actress Ocsar she earned for this performance.  It was a  while since l had seen her really fit a character like a glove since her  role in 1987 as a slightly cuckoo network television producer in  "Broadcast News".  Even though she doesn't speak a work  throughout the entire movie, l got every emotion from her hands, face and  her playing of the piano.  Not many people know that Holly Hunter actually  did a portion of her own piano playing in the film.  Not all of it was done  by the composer, Michael Nyman.  Which leads my into the film's dramatic  score which was both haunting and dream-like.  Another point l would also  like to make is that director Jane Campion is the first and only  woman-director to be nominated for an Academy Award for this film. That is  quite the feat in itself if you ask me.  Newcomer Anna Paquin is  mesmorizing as the young daughter who finds out about her mother's extra  cirricular activities, if you know what l mean.  Anna Paquin would go one  to win the Oscar for best supporting actress at only the tender age of 11.   Wow !  I highly recommend this tale of love, sex, betrayal and  consequences.
