 Asana is a brilliant collection of hindu-techo inspired tracks by genius Bill Laswell.  Played heavily at the Jivamukti Yoga Studio in NYC, this cd is a wonderful background to any cardio intensive yogic practice, as in  Ashtanga.  We play this cd heavily in the studio I attend.  Mystical and  joyful, a great cd!
