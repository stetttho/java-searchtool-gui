 As a newcomer to Krisha Das, this was my first taste of his music, and i've been told by other friends who have his other CD's that is is by far the best work he's done to date.  As the other reviewer mentions, it is  totally accessable to the western listener and you will find yourself  chanting aloud in your car and swaying and dancing estatically if you don't  watch yourself...please..do yourself a favor and get this exceptional CD  set, you will feel so blessed that you did...Hari Om and Namaste all!
