 When you stop to consider that all of this animation was created without the use of modern animation luxuries such as computers, the imagery will boggle your mind!  This film is a treat and a collectable for any lover of  fine and unique animation, whether it be claymation, pen and ink, puppetry  or any other....feast your eyes and ears on some wonderful animation and  fantastic music from the 30's and 40's!!!
