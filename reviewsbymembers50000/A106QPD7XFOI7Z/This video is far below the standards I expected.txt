 Too much style and not enough substance.  As an intermediate/advanced level Ashtanga student, I can safely say that Mr. Kest has a huge ego problem as the video puts way too much attention on him and his bad boy  good looks with gauzey shots and hard body close ups and not enough time on  the actual work, I was very dissapointed.  Also the tape runs 36 minutes  long, not the advertised 54 minutes, a rip off.
