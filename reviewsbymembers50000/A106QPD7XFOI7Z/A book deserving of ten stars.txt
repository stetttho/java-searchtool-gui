 I mourned at the loss of Shel Silverstein, a brillant talent who died last year. It brought back memories of this book, "The Giving Tree" which was given to me when I was around five or so. As a grown woman, I can  say without any hesitation, that this tender book still makes me cry to  this very day.  How such love can be expressed in the simplest of words and  drawings is truly remarkable. I have given a copy of this book to all of my  close friends and family who've had babies with a message to hold on to it  for their children and to read and reflect upon it's message often. It is  Shel's gift to the world.
