 Dr.Taylor puts forth an informative, intelligent and easy to read book on this controversial subject. He does not bore us with all the "new age jargon" or "arrogant ramblings" that most authors do on  Astral Travel. He is straightforward, honest, and "down to earth"  (no pun intended). I found his experiences have helped me immensely in my  own quest to soul travel. His background as a NASA Engineer only gives more  validity to his writings. If you want a book that is complicated, overly  technical, and slathering in arrogance this is NOT the one. If you want a  book that is easily understood, interesting, excellently written, with a  little humor, THIS IS DEFINITELY THE BOOK. I read this book in one sitting.  Excellent Job Dr. Taylor!
