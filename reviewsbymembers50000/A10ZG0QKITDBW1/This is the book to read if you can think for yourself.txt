 This was an excellent book about a man that is courageous enough to take on his own "faith", question it with an un-fearing mind, and see it with an unbiased eye. Hooray for you sir ! I implore all to read this  book. It is excellent for those seeking to escape the Cult of Christianity.  This book should be able to give you the strength you need.
