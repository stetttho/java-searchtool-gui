 I read this book in ONE SITTING ! I could not put it down. It is easy to read, interesting, and inspirational. If you are interested in Astral Travel, Life after Death,or Reincarnation, you absolutely MUST have this  book in your library. If you are a NON-BELIEVER, this book is still a  "must read", it is presented in a non-religious, and purely  scientific manner. Even the NON-Believer can appreciate it.
