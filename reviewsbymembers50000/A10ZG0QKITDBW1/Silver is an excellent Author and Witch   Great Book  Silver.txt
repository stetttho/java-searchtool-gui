 This book is the very best so far ! I read "To Ride a Silver Broomstick! To Ride...was my very first book on Wicca and it helped me tremendously. Now after 2 years in the Craft I am ready to move on to  intermediate study, and "To Stir a Magick Cauldron is by far the best  book for intermediate study of the Craft. Silver is obviously a talented  Writer and Wiccan Witch. Make sure you pay attention to her  "unique" perspective on the Elementals in this book ! And make  sure to buy Llewellyn's Yearly Almanacs because Silver is regular  contributor to it and always writes excellent articles on everything  Wiccan. Some people complain that she writes like a MOM, or she writes like  she is talking to children. Please understand that Silver IS A MOM ! and  obviously dedicated to her family, and once a mom, always a mom no matter  who you are talking to. In short, buy the book ! You won't regret  it! P.S. Its too bad Christians have nothing better to do with their time  than to come in here, and pretend they are Pagans and give bad book reviews  to our most celebrated authors. Its so easy to tell when a christian is  "Pretending". If you want an idea of what I am talking about,  check out the two reviews titled , "stir, stir," Blessed Be  Silver !
