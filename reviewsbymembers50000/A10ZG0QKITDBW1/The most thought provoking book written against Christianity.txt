 Christianity is a farce. And Mr. Russell proves it without a doubt. I left Christianity 11 years ago. It was the best decision I have ever made. My life finally has hope and meaning. I actually want to get up in the  morning, since I threw Christianity away. Thanks to all people like Mr.  Bertrand Russell, that helped me get through that trying time, when one  first leaves a very strong delusion. This book is for all those who need to  "re-load" their defense against the fanatical Christian zealot.  And its for those who are trying to leave the "Cult" of  Christianity, and need a little help. Please read this book, it is worth  everything.
