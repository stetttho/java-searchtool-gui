 I am greatly disappointed in this book.Its starts off very fascinating. The first chapters gives us the impression that this book is going to be a clear concise scientific look at the occult. I immediately became  suspicious when in recounting the story of the Fox Sisters, who became  famous at the beginning of the Spiritualist Movement, she failed to mention  that they (the Fox's) were found to be frauds,and had perpetuated a great  hoax. I figured out that the first few chapters were used to  "lure" us into believing the pure "bunk" of the last  few chapters dealing with an entity (probably of Ms. Gonzales imagination)  named Kirkudian. Kirkudian is suppose to have been incarnated as many of  the great scientists and religious leaders in our history, including  ST.  FRANCIS OF ASSISI! Ms Gonzales just gives non-believers another reason to  think that we new-agers are flakes and phoneys, which is not true. I  believe in reincarnation, but I find this book very hard to swallow. Save  your money, by pass this one. The only good thing I have to say for her is:  Ms. Gonzales does not lack for an imagination.
