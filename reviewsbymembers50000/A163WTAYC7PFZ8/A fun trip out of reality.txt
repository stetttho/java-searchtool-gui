 I first saw this movie in the theater when i thought i was losing my mind. Maybe that is why i did pick up on the basic elements of the plot the first time round.  It isn't reality, but then again mniether is "Under  Seige" and this movie has the virtue of not piling up a high body  count. I think the only obvious death is the girl in the beginning, and no  blood spilled either. This ranks as a rewatchable movie, but the film  studio have obviousl caught on to its audience- video rental tapes feature  an ad about various movie heroes.  Anybody want to explain why this is an  action movie that appeals to women?
