 I have loved this book, and the rest of the series since my 4th grade librarian recommended this book to my class in the mid 80's.  I am glad to see that others have found it, as it doesn't seem to stay on bookstore  shelves for long.  Alanna is still one of my favorite fictional characters.   The first book is excellent by itself or as part of the series. There is a  larger picture to the entire series, that does not become obvious until the  4th book but is rooted in earlier incidents. I am just waiting for the  movie version.
