 These are wonderful books, i like the way Davies makes each of them a stand alone novel in its own right, as well as part of a series- and i should know, having read the Lyre of Orpheus first, then What's Bred in the  Bone, and finishing with the first.  The stories don't always go where you  expect, which is one of the best parts, but they are fascinating views.
