 This series appears to inspire fanaticism in those of us lucky enough to read them as children.  Included with a bunch of Enid Blytons from my grandmother this was one of my favorite books of childhood and has become  an odd literary touchstone in my older friendships.   An interesting  adventure story that remains rooted in reality yet gives life to the  childrens' fantasies this is a book I can always retreat into.  I only wish  my vacations had been like those of the Walkers and Blacketts. Their  camping and sailing adventures in the English Lake District are not overly  dated(considering they were written in the 1930's) and probably the least  sexist childrens books from that era and from today- the girls and boys  have equal responsibilities and the most charismatic character is Nancy  Blackett, captain of the Amazons.  I don't understand how these books have  remained in such relative obscurity for so long.
