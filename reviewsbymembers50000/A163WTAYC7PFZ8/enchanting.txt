 This is one of those books that keeps reappearing in my life, a pleasant surprise each time.  I still have vivid memories of my second grade teacher taking my copy away from me because i insisted on reading it under my desk  while she was trying to teach another subject.  I forgot the name and the  title and only rmembered bits of the stroy until i ran across it in another  town in another state and reaquainted myself with Maria and everybody else.   There are strong Christian messages underlying the story, but they are not  overly preachy, something that can be extremely annoying.  The fantasy in  here is not overwhelming and definetely not a Tolkien rip off. This is a  good "comfort book", to return to frequently. Another of this  author's books is "Linnets and Valerians", it seems to have  slipped into obscurity.
