 I loved this movie, but the firsst half hour is incredibly confusingf and unclear, and fairly inaccurate with regards to the play.  Although I enjoyed the whole movie, those who started watching it with me soon  left(this was a college dorm) those who came in later, once it picked up  were fascinated as well.  It definitely rewards rewatching, as much becomes  clearer the second or third time round.  I haunted video stores hoping for  a cheap second hand version to buy, as i couldn't find it anywhere else.  The acting is good, cineamatography beautiful,  a fun movie.
