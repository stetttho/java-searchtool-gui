 A sequel to "Winter of Magic's Return" this book deals with King Arthur's return to England, with the aid of a very young Merlin and his companions.  Set in a nuclear winter where technology barely exists and  magic is staging a comeback this is a highly amusing book. Merlin (for  reasons explained in the prior book) is in his late teens and his two  companions are also teens of that era.  The three of them, plus Arthur are  attempting to reunite the various duchis, kingdoms and principalities that  England has become, against Arthur's old enemy Morgan Le Fay.  While not as  fascinating as the book that preceded it, this is still a servicable  sequel, although i wish there were one to this as well.
