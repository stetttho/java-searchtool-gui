 Good book, picking up from the earlier Dido and Simon pieces.  Is is Dido's younger half sister, first mentioned, i beleive in Dido and Pa.  Did sends her to stay with thier mutual sister Penelope but obviously she is a younger version of Dido, and gets into equally interesting adventures.  The  consequences of the ending of this book are rather heavy for Dido's friend  Simon as becomes clearer in a later work.
