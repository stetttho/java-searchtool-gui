 And of course therein lies the problem.  This book is a very compelling read, as is the second, even though the idea is a little cliched.  The story of 5 talents meeting and being drawn into a group is interesting, and  I managed to ignore most of the writing problems in this first book(the sex  scenes were pretty bad though)I even dashed off to the bookstore after  reading the first 2(from the library) in order to get the next 3. The  author's habit of telling the variations of each character's tests is  interesting at first, but will become repetitive by the end of the series.   And you can't just read one of these books, they each have an interesting  cliffhanger that almost compells you to get to the next one.  I really did  enjoy the story, and there are some unexpected twists, i just think it  could have been told in 3 books , not 5.  In the end it is rather like  eating 6 bowls of ice cream at one sitting- the first ones taste pretty  good, by the last one you feel unwell.
