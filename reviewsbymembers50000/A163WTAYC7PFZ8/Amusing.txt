 This one of Tom Holt's better books, and very good.  The plot concerns a writer and her um characters.  If you have ever wondered what happens to characters when the writer knocks off for the day, here is one man's idea  of their habits.  It gets a little more complicated than that though...  Jane Armitage, the writer of a fantasy series, is contacted by an  unfortunate western writer who has been stuck in his books for 30 years.   He begs for her help and the assitance of her hero.  She sends him off to  help and unwittingly helps set in motion the end of the world.  This is  very funny and invades several clssic works of literature, but many of Tom  Holt's stock incidental characters seem to have gone missing.  Danny Bennet  does not make an appearance, nor does the bounty hunter.
