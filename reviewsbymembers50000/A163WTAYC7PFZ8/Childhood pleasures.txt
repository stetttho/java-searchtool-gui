 These books(the whole World's End series) have been hovering in my head for years, despite the fact i have been able to find no trace of their existence for nearly a decade.  They are not about the world's end, but  rather a family that comes to live at the World's Inn, a delapidated old  inn, referred to as "World's End" by the locals.  With their  parents out of the picture the four children must learn to survive on their  own, and later with their changed parents.  They must hide from the world  their unsupervised status and figure out how to live normally, getting jobs  and such.  If you can find a copy these books are efinitely worth it.
