 Another childhood treasure, this is the sequel to "The Golden Name Day" "The Little Silver House"  The crystal tree is somehow connected to a former resident of the little silver house and the children  spend most of the book trying to figure it out.  While not a dramatic  mystery this book is a charming representation of life in a small (New  Hampshire?) village, with wonderful descriptions of Swedish  traditions,small town rituals and farm traditions.  It offers a satisfying  conclusion to the trilogy, but is equally able to stand on its own as a  story.
