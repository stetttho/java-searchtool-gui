 I first saw this on a Canadian Airlines flight to London.  i wasn't expecting much from it- after all it was an airplane movie.  I was amazed that anyone would show it on an airplane and after i got back to the US  spent months telling my friends to go and find this movie in the vido  stores and watch it, i loved it so much.  This was, some 4 months before  its theatrical release in the US, so it was a fruitless reccommendation,  but now they can buyu it and watch on and on.  I really enjoyed the  interplay between french and english, as i understood both languagues, and  the more pieces started to fit together as the movie moved along.
