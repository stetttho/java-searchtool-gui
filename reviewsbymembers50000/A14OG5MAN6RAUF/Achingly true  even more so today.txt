 I grew up in a small town in Iowa, and this book captures so well the experience of small towns, whether they be in Iowa or Angola. The frustrations and triumphs of Carol are universal and unending, and perhaps even more timely today than they were when this book was first published. "Main Street" is not so much about a woman in a repressive patriarchal society as it is about any independent spirit trapped by circumstance in a well-meaning but banal social structure composed of individuals too bound by convention to breathe free. This is a gently told cautionary tale that should be on every reading list in every high school in the nation.
