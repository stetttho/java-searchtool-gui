 I couldn't get very excited about this book. The whole genre of "pricing guides" is tacky and depressing (it takes all the fun out of junking - both from a buying and selling standpoint) but this one didn't even try to be informative.  It wasn't well researched, nor was it very comprehensive. I would suggest ignoring these guides and just going with your instinct. If you like it, buy it. Don't let these silly guides decide your taste for you.  If you're a dealer, get to know your stuff and your customers and price accordingly.
