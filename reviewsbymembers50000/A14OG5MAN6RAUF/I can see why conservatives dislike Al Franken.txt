 Because he tells the truth in an engaing and witty way.   "The Truth (with jokes)", while not as funny as his previous books, lives up to it's title. Once again, Franken exposes the right wing establishment for what it is: corruption wrapped in the flag, with a nice big Bible bow on top.  As a former Republican, who left the party when the sell out to corporate interests and fake Christians became too much to stomach, I appreciate the informed, civilizied and witty approach Franken brings to the serious issues facing this country.   Of particular interest to me were the chapters on the propogation of fear by the conservative media and administration in the months leading up to the election, and the farcial nutcase circus that was the tragic death of Terri Schaivo. I lost my father to a sad and ugly struggle with lung cancer about a month after Ms. Schaivo's death, and that experience really brought home to me what a cruel joke the GOP had become. Franken captures the essence of the Bush hypocricy masterfully.   "The Truth (with jokes)" belongs on everyone's reading list. America needs to grow up and face the truth about the leadership in this country, and people like Franken are courageously making that happen.
