 A very fun, enjoyable movie - a little dated by today's standards, but still a good solid script performed by some great actors.  The classic tale of three girls who come to the big city is told in a much classier,  sopphisticated way than other attempts (i.e. Valley of the Dolls and it's  ilk) Fans of 50's furniture will be in seventh heaven in this film,  especially as the office that the majority of the characters work in has a  lot of the furniture that the Eame's designed for Herman Miller.  And if  you love scenery chewing (like I do) there's the wonderful Miss Crawford as  the bitter carreer woman. The only slightly bad thing about this movie is  the somewhat hackneyed theme song - although it's sort of fun to listen to  all of it's different variations throughout the film.
