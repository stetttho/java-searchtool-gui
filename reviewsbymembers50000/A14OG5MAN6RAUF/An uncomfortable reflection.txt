 Lots has been said about this movie that I won't rehash here. I'll just say that I thought it was an interesting fable of materialism run amuck, and the consequences of such lives.  This movie has some dumb parts (the plastic bag) and can be a bit heavy-handed at times(How many saw the Marine's secret from a mile away?) but overall it was enjoyable. There's something dark lurking behind the McMansions and the SUVs and the overprogrammed families that comprise so much of our middle class in the US. This film comes close to articulating that darkness.
