 Why do hacks always try to write "sequels" to wildly successful, well-crafted novels? They never hold up in comparison, and end up a disappointment for everyone involved. "Mrs. Dewinter" is a classic example of this phenomena. If you haven't read "Rebecca" I won't give the secrets away, but in this pallid sequel Maxim is still brooding, the still un-named wife is still biting her nails and agonizing, and even good old Mrs Danvers is still wondering around being creepy. The characters have no character and the plot is thin. Despite this, it rambles on for a good 350 or so pages, most of which seems to be descriptions of English gardens and whatnot. I found myself skipping over large chunks of pages hoping to find something of interest.  Alas, it wasn't meant to be, and by the time I got to the rather banal ending, I was ready to hurl the book out the window.  Do yourself a favor. Read (or re-read) the original "Rebecca" or go see the classic Hitchcock movie. Just stay the heck away from "Mrs. Dewinter"
