 This movie is too campy to be earnest, but too earnest to be campy. I was expecting some sort of Annette/Frankie kind of romp, but instead got a sad sack movie that tried way to hard to pound home some dubious points. Sandra  Dee's mother is a tiny bit of fun as the evil queen type, and the scenes  where Sandra is being subjected to various cruelties to assure her virtue  stays intact were sort of amusing, but other than that and some beautiful  scenery (and that fantastic theme song), I was pretty unimpressed. For  those people who like 50's architecture there is a great house towards the  end that is supposedly a Frank Lloyd Wright design.
