 From the stylish cartoon opening with the peppy Mancini Song, you know you're in for a fluffy treat.  The sets are wonderful (particularly if you are a fan of Mid-Century Modern, as I am) the dialog is sparkling, the characters are fun and the movie doesn't overstay its welcome. The plot stays true to Bob Hope movie formulas, so you know what's going to happen, but there are plenty of wacky hijinks along the way (the oversudsing washing machine, the trip to the supermarket) to divert you.  All in all, it's a fun trip back to a time when movie people could get drunk without the audience getting beat over the head with a moral message, and movie kids were just kids, without having to be either overly cutesy or annoyingly smartass.  Definitely an asset to anyone's movie collection.
