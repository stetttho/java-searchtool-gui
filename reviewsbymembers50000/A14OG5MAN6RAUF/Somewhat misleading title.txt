 This is an OK book, but the title is somewhat misleading to the casual reader. This book deals very specificly with the "Directional Designs" line produced by Paul McCobb - not all of Paul McCobb's "Fifties Furniture"  If you are looking for information on the Paul McCobb Planner Group, as I was, you are not going to find it in this book.   Apart from that, it has some great pictures of some very high-end furniture.
