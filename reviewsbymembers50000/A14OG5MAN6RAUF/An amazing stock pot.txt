 One of my most cherished possessions is my mom's 6 quart Le Creuset turquoise dutch oven that she got when she married my dad in 1952.  When I needed a bigger pot, I went to Le Creuset, but was worried that the newer product would never equal the quality of the vintage stuff.  Boy, was I wrong. This pot is amazing! The quality is evident from the look and heft of the pot, and it's performance is equal to or better than my vintage pot. I'm no gourmet, but if you cook soups, stews or pasta for crowds, this one is for you.
