 Susannah McCorkle was one of the best voices of her generation, and this album represents the power of her talent.  She brings a fresh voice and intelligent interpretation to old standards, and does a good job with new material, weak as it is (especially the odious yuppie anthem "Quality Time" - a song so banal and vapid that it calls for skipping every time I play this disc) All in all, this album is a fitting tribute to a great talent who should have had years ahead of her.
