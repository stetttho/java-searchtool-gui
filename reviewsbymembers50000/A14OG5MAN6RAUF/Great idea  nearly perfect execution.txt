 This is a really neat, albeit somewhat pricey, coffeemaker. The only flaws I can find are: 1.) The height - it's just a hair too tall to fit under my somewhat standard cabinets and 2.) While the resevoir keeps the coffee fairly warm, it doesn't keep it hot, and there is no way (that I can tell at least) to turn the heater on to reheat the coffee.   But other than that, great machine. Definitely worth the cash.
