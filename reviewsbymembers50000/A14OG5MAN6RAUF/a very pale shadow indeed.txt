 Jacqueline Susann wasn't Milton, but she told a good story. She also set us up at the end of "Valley of the Dolls" (New Year's Eve 1964, If I remember correctly) for a great sequel. Unfortunately, this wasn't it.  The prospect of Neely and Anne leaving their marks on the women's movement and the sexual revolution could have been fascinating and fun,(Think Neely in a group therapy session or Anne burning her maidenform in front of Gillian Cosmetics) but Rae Lawrence opts to move our girls to the vapid 90's, where she subsitutes plot and character for boring name-dropping, which makes this book about as exciting as a back issue of Town & Country.  There's a whole new cast of inance characters, all of whom I think would make Jackie wince. They are all so similar and one-dimensional that before long you can't tell one Waspy boyfriend of Anne's from another. And loads of bratty children, all of whom are annoying in their own right.  The ending is particularly idiotic. I won't give away the plot (such as it is) but suffice to say that where they end up is just about as stupid as where they began. I bought this book as a light read on a cross country rail trip, and it was a strugle to finish. Do yourself a favor and re-read the original. This one just doesn't cut it.
