 I was really very pleased by this version of Gypsy. This movie had all the old time production values one expects from a musical of this caliber, and good acting all around.  Karl Maulden is a great Herbie, and Natalie Wood handles Louise's metamorphis from awkward teenager to sex symbol magnificiently.  For what it's worth, I think that Rosiland Russel was the best of the Mama Roses I've experienced. Ethel was probably great on Broadway, but judging from the soundtrack, she would have been too stagey on screen for my taste, and Bette's version was just a little too psychotic for me. For my money, Rosiland really captured the essence of Rose: The frustrated almost-ran who lived her life vicariously through her children. The fact that she wasn't a singer just added to that image for me.  All in all, this is a great movie that is well worth the money.
