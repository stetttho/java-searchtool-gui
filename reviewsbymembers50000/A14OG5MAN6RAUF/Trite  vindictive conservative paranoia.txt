 Whatever happened to intellectual conservatism? This is just another fuzzy-minded, angry "expose" that only seems to show how effective Franken's radio program is becoming.   I would welcome an intelligent conservative book, along the lines of William F. Buckley in his prime. Something that challenges my mindset and stands on it's own merits, but this is yet another juvenile piece of sludge that is written at the approximate level of a college Freshman's english term paper.  It attempts to be an answer to Franken's provactive and witty writing style, but fails miserably. There is no class, so assumption of intelligence on the part of the reader and - worst of all - seemingly none of the interest in the well-being of the nation that is evident in Franken's work. You may not agree with him, but no one can argue he isn't thinking about the country, and what is best for it.    I fear that the Coulter's, O'Reilly's, Hannitty et al stamp is indelibly on an entire generation of conservative writers, and we are stuck with this sort of angry, petty  bilge from the right for the forseeable future.
