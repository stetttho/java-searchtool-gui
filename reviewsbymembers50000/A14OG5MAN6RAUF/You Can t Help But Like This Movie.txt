 A wonderful film about a subject that is still all too controversial today. Some of the earnest upper middle class white liberal talk sounds sort of silly now, but the sentiment is right on and the acting (at least  Hepburn and Tracy) is superb. Sidney Poitier grimaces and emotes a bit too  much and luckily Katharine Houghton never really went on to anything else,  but other than that, a good supporting cast. Little bits of silly '60's  camp (the go-go dancing delivery boy) make for unexpected fun.
