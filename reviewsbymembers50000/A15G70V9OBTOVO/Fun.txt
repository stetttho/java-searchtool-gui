 I wanted to see Red Eye but before I got the chance it got knocked out of the theatres by the rather grim Flightplan.  Besides fine direction and plotting, Red Eye has a key element that's missing from many action movies: the actors are not well known.  Not that Red Eye has lots of surprises but at least the screen "personalities" of the actors cannot be anticipated.  They seem like real people, in a very bad situation.  A great flight.  Short and sweet!
