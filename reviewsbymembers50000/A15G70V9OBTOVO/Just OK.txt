 The problem with this set is that it was a made-for-TV production and they just didn't have the money to do it right.  The sets are mostly dull, the actors drive back and forth over the same stretch of road and in the early episodes the night scenes are obviously shot during the day.  Noir experts will note that many props are not from the correct era.  The later episodes are a bit better than the earlier ones, however.  If you're looking for modern/retro noir there is some.  Farewell My Lovely with Robert Mitchum is wonderful, as are Cast A Deadly Spell and Witchunt.  Modern semi-noir films for those weary of happy endings include The Two Jakes and The Hot Spot.    But why not just get a copy of Out Of The Past and see the real thing?
