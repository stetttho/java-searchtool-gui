 The comedian Paul Lynde was once asked: What famous person said "Truth is the glue that holds us all together."  The answer was Gerald Ford but Lynde said "I thought we were all screwed together."  And this, I think is the point Ms. Kamenetz misses.  We have put ourselves on a path towards a declining quality of life.  That's a given.    And employers will never do what's right unless they are forced to.  Of course some people will do well and call the rest of us lazy as they watch from gated communities.  It may be that this has fallen disproportionally on the younger generation but corporate America is laying off employees of all ages, as fast as they can.  The difference is, if you're 24 and forced to take a job at Target, you can at least get one!  Try and do that when you're in your 50s.  Employers will not touch you, and why should they when there are 24-year olds available?
