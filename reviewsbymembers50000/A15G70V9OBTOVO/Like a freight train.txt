 You can watch The Narrow Margin faster than you can read some of these reviews and that's the point.  They simply don't make movies like this anymore.  Forget about what can be done in 3 hours with $200 million dollars.  This is about creating and sustaining real suspense and in this task, not a second is wasted.  Even the credits move along.  Nor are the actors wasted.  Charles McGraw, who was about as good an actor as Ronald Reagan, is perfect for his no nonsense role.  Unless you like boring movies (and some people undeniably, do) you will not be dissapointed. This is both a cop drama and a sort of Film Noir, but file it under "Action".
