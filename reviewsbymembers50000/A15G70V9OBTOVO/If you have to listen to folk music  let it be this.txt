 I'm delighted to see there aren't a string of 1 star reviews from people who don't get A Mighty Wind. If it has a weakness, its that its played so dryly, its almost like non-fiction that just happens to be funny.  Thank god for Fred Willard who adds some vitally important crassness to these "serious" proceedings.  I share a sentiment expressed by some of the characters.  I've never liked folk music.  But somehow this movie manages to poke fun at those less cynical times, without being too cynical itself.  My one dissapointment is that we don't get to see Ed Begley Jr. sing How's It Hangin' Grandma? in Swedish.  Talk about a missed opportunity!
