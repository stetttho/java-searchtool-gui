 It hurts me to give anything Frank does less than 5 stars but I have to say  this was a bit of a dissapointment. This is a string of very long jams where Frank runs though everything he knows and sometimes even seems to run out of licks.  And while a lot of this would have been jaw dropping 15 years ago, in these days of Steve Vai and Eric Johnson, I found it a little dull.    Part of this has to do with the fact that he's not really a jazz player.  Sure, he knows a few jazz licks like we all do but when he goes on for awhile he sounds more like Robby Kreiger than John Scofield.    Also missing are his classics like Strange Dreams, Dragonfly and Midnight Highway.  I'm sure Frank is damn tired of playing them but they remain killers.  Still, he's a fine rock player and this set is impressive, for stamina alone.    If you're not familiar and want to crank up the Frank, get Mahogany Rush Live (which is almost as good as UFO Live) and check out his devastating performance of The Things I Used To Do, on Tribute To SRV.  WOW!  Also be on the lookout for an improved reissue of Juggernaut, which lives up to its title, some time next year.
