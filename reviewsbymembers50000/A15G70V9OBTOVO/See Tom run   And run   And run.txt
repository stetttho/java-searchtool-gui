 I'm still thinking about that great shot at the beginning of Mission Impossible II where Tom Cruise is rock climbing.  Nothing in this movie is in that league; even the music is a boring rendition.  Even the titles are dull.   This time, we begin with a long, noisy, dark scene where (I think) a truck is shooting at a building, but who can tell.  All of this is at odds with the original Mission Impossible concept which was to outsmart the bad guys instead of nuking them.  And speaking of bad guys, what a waste of Phillip Seymour Hoffman.  Three stars because its an action movie but didn't they blow up that bridge in True Lies?  And, at the same time, pull Arnold out of a moving car?  Guess I'm just imagining things.
