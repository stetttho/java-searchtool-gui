 I agree with the other reviewers that, on his worst day, Eric Johnson turns out better music than the other guitar gods.  (And one can only guess at what guys like Clapton make of EJ's rendition of stuff like Crossroads).  But Bloom is all over the map.  Its not a totally ripping guitar album like Ah Via Musicom and as a super complex concept album it falls way short of his gorgeous Venus Isle.  The playing is superb and flawless, the vocals ok, the lyrics insipid (as always) but I didn't find one tune that knocked me out.  He destroys My Back Pages, sounding even worse than Bob Dylan.  He plays it like he's late for an appointment.  (Check out Carl Verheyen's version of My Back Pages if you think the Byrds didn't handle it well enough).  Your Sweet Eyes sounds like Fleetwood Mac, harmless and good for the "soft and warm" stations.  So yeah, from anyone else it would be pretty darned good.  But I know what he can do!  Before they shut Napster down I got several bootlegs of Eric playing Cliffs Of Dover to screaming audiences.  People who could not believe what they were hearing; so much beauty, fire and skill.  Compared to that, Bloom just doesn't stack up.  Sorry.
