 Its nice to see someone cut through all the nonsense about a "flexible" workplace.  And I guess one could argue whether its better to have a country where some people have job security or a country where no one does.  But there is something unworkable about a situation where employers demand 110%  while reserving the right to fire at the drop of a hat.    I think the best and fairest solution would be to charge healthy companies a tax for dumping their workers.  After all, these people won't be going to restaurants or the dry cleaner (or even the doctor) so we all suffer and as a taxpayer I don't want to subsidize more firing.
