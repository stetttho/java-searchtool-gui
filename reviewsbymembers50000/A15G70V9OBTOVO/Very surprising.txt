 It seems most complaints about this revolve around the flat ending.  But if you recall the 50's "masterpiece" with Gene Barry--a truly terrible actor--that's the way the story goes.  The aliens come here, cause a lot of special effects and just when things seem hopeless the get the flu and fall over.  The end.    Its not Mr. Spielberg's fault that the story is front-loaded; what is impressive is that its still pretty darned exciting even when you know the ending.  I had forgotten how skilled Spielberg is and then I saw that scene when the Martians search the basement where Tom and Dakota are hiding.  I reminded me of that crop circle picture by M. Knight Schlemiel which had none of the human touches or humor WTW has.  Spielberg also makes Tom Cruise seem sympathetic and if that's not movie magic I don't know what is.  Dakota Fanning is simply terrific.    And finally I would like to thank Mr. Spielberg for blowing up the Pulaski Skyway.  Not that it isn't lovely but here on the west coast we've had the Golden Gate blown up so many times, its only fair.
