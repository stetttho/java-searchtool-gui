 I was just thinking how few attempts have been made to mix "guitar god" playing with humor.  Joe Walsh & Paul Gilbert are the only ones who come to mind.    Greg Koch seems to have both.  He's good enough to never be heard on the radio and he just happens to be a funny guy, too.  BTW, his instructional videos are excellent and yes, very funny.  I agree, The Grip is a bit more focused but there's still a lot of meat on Radio Free Gristle.
