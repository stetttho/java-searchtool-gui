 A glorious documentary that brings back memories of a world, not so long ago, that's gone forever.  As someone who grew up with the Beatles there is one thing I find just a little annoying; their complaints that Beatlemania was so tough on them and basicly stole their lives for a few years.  At a time when a lot of guys their age had to worry about  the draft (and being sent to a bloodbath worse than Iraq), the Beatles' biggest problem was being locked in hotel suites while adoring young girls screamed outside.  Maybe I'm missing something but this doesn't sound so bad to me, especially given the pay.
