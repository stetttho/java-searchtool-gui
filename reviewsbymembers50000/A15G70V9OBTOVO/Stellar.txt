 I had heard a lot about Serenity but I guess I was too burned out by long, boring, corny Star Wars movies.  (And asinine pronouncements about the nature of good and evil from George Lucas).  But now I've seen Serenity and it is much like the early Star Wars.  A little short on special effects but long on characters, excitement, realistic dialog and even laughs.  A bit like real life, actually.  I wonder what George Lucas makes of Serenity since it is so, so much better than anything he has done in the last 20 years.
