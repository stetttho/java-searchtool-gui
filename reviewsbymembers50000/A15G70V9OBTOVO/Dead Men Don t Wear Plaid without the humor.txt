 I have to chuckle when I see a review of this saying its full of twists and turns.  In fact, its 100% predictable and can be explained in one sentence..."Paralyzed man imagines fantasy where he is private dectective".  Care to guess the "trick" ending?    Anyhow its a low budget movie where everything is just a bit off.  The characters dress and talk, more or less for the 1940s.  But they drive a 1959 Caddy.  And when the detective enters the blond's house, there's a modern motion detector for the burglar alarm, right over his head.  Whoops.     But its not terrible.  BillyBob is in fine form and the others would probably be fine too if the script was better.  The blond is built but you won't mistake her for Lana Turner.    So, if you want to see Film Noir, for heaven's sake, get Out Of The Past.  If for some reason you want a modern slant, try Cast A Deadly Spell or Witch Hunt.  But if you've already seen these and want to see some actors smoking a lot of cigarettes and trying very hard to be cool, its fairly entertaining.
