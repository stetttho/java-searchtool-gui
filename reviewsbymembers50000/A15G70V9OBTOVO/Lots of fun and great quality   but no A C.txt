 Wow...not only do we get to go back in time; the picture quality is so good, I almost got up to adjust the rabbit ears.  Of all the Irwin Allen stuff, this was my favorite and its still quite enjoyable.  Its no Outer Limits but as with all science fiction from the era, its fun, both for what works and what doesn't.  One thing these high quality DVDs reveal, and I'm not quite sure why, is that everybody seems to be sweating(!)  Was film that much slower that more lights were required?  I guess the Time Tunnel's big power supply generated a lot of heat.
