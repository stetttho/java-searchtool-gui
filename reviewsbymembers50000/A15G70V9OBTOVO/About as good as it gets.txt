 I usually tell people who wonder about Film Noir to see Out Of The Past.  Pickup On South Street didn't change my opinion but its still very good.  This time, Richard Widmark skirts the line between the psycho he played in earlier films and the good guy he would become.  This seems just right because it gives him the dangerous edge he needs.  The movie is tough and politically incorrect but like the anti-Commie business, a product of its time.    No need to say more.  Performances are great as are scenes of a New York long gone.
