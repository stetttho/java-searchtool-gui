 The problem here is that the audience this movie is aimed at doesn't have the life experience--or the attention span--to get it.  And anyone old enough to get it probably won't see it.  You might as well show Two Lane Blacktop to people who came to see Two Fast, Two Furious.  Still, with a bit of judicious editing, N.D. could have been tailored to the right audience.  Napoleon comes home and, tired of being picked on, heads for dad's gun cabinet.    Locked 'n loaded, its back to school for some serious detention.  Before going down in a hail of bullets Napoleon whacks most of the football team, narrowly missing a cheerleader in a low cut, tight-fitting top and a teacher, in a low cut, tight-fitting top.  Soundtrack by Fear Factory; direction by Oliver Stone (who lays down some nonsense about it being a serious commentary on the state of American society).  This could be HUGE.  Then again, I found it pretty funny just the way it is.
