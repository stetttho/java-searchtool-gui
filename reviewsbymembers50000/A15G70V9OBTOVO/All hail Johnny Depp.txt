 How many movies can you think of that are (a) exciting, (b) well acted, (c) well written, (d) funny, (e) loaded with special effects but still have a recognizable story, (f) in English and (g) suitable for all but the youngest children?    If I had a gripe it would be that no one seems to notice how good Geoffrey Rush is.  Of course its Johnny Depp's movie.
