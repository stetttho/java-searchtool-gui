 I like a good dirty joke as much as anybody but when I see a movie where the actors are having more fun than I am, I question why I should be paying them instead of the other way around.  In this film the division between what's really funny and what's un-funny, like being thrown up on, isn't clear.  The people who made this know what is funny but they don't know what isn't.  Strange.  Oh heck, I guess it was worth the money to see a guy who looks like Jamie Farr having sex with Katherine Keener.
