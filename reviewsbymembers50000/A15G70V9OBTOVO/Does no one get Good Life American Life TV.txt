 I loved MFA as a kid.  Our local cable system has a channel, American Life, which is running all the episodes, more or less in order.  Hook up your DVD recorder, delete the infomercials, and you're done.  Not only is the price right; when you see all the episodes you'll realize things got pretty goofy after the first 2 seasons so you might not want to buy a 100+ episode box even if one was available.
