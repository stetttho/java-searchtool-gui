 I can see I am very much in the minority but I found this film completely lacking in sympathetic characters and thus having no point.    Barbara Stanwyck is a rich, arrogant, manipulative invalid.  Any attempt to make her sympathetic is blown away by the revelation she's not even an invalid but that comes later.  Stanwyck's creepy character marries Burt Lancaster.  Burt's no prize either and marries for money.  In short, he's a creep.  Babs and Burt live with Stanwyck's wealthy, arrogant father (a creep).  Having had enough, Burt conspires with a coworker to steal from Stanwyck's father's company.  He finds an accomplice who is very easily persuaded, a creep.  The two men hookup with a mobster.  Burt gets in trouble with the mob guy (who's a creep, BTW) and plans to 86 the misses for her money.  Stanwyck launches into a fit of overacting the likes of which I cannot describe.  In the end we have the scene where the invalid, through shear force of will, walks, but not Barbara (even though we know she can).    Technically, this is all very well done but who, my friends are we to root for?  My vote goes to the unnamed gentleman who, at the end says (quite cheerfully) "Sorry, wrong number!"
