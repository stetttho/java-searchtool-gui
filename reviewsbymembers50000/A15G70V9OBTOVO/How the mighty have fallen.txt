 This was the record that introduced many of us to the Les Paul + overdriven Marshall sound.  But there's even more here.  The solos, notes, phrasing, slight bends are simply perfect.  This was the sort of playing that earned EC the high ranking he enjoys to this day.  How, I ask, can someone listen to this passionate, intense playing and reconcile it with You Look Wonderful Tonight or I Shot The Sheriff?  Of course artists need to evolve but what he does now is to me, inexcusable.  My friends say he's still got it and I hear an occasional flash of brilliance but not often.  So enjoy it for what it was--but these days, Eric Johnson sounds more like Eric Clapton, than Eric Clapton.
