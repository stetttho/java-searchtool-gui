 If you need a shot of rhythm and blues, this is the record for you.  Its not arena rock; just a hot little band with a really hot guitar player.  The first Ten Years After album went pretty much unnoticed in the US.  But when Undead was released, oh boy...  The initial reaction was shock at the fast guitar playing.  But what really made Undead such a hot date was the swing.  Its still one of the greatest live albums ever; check it out and see what I mean.  With Undead, Alvin Lee cast himself as a descendant of Chuck Berry and T-Bone Walker, very different from Ritchie Blackmore or Jeff Beck.  Then came Woodstock and super stardom.  To those who say Alvin plays the same licks he played back then, I say, so does Santana and I have yet to hear a solo from Santana that made makes jaw drop.   Now, at long last, Alvin gets back to his roots.  And he is definitely Goin' Home, playing the music he loves, with a band that's right in the pocket.
