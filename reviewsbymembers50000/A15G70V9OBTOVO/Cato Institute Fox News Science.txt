 This is the sort of guy who sees a woman win a big settlement for spilling coffee in her lap and concludes that all lawsuits against corporations are frivolous.  As for Al Gore, he's no more a scientist than Milloy and no thinking person should take either too seriously.  They both tell people what they want to hear.  But would you rather err on the side of side of caution or go with a guy who thinks DDT got a bum rap?  Mr. Milloy is playing a sucker's game.  Pick anything that's happens slowly, then deny, deny, deny, figuring, if you're wrong, you won't be around, so who cares?
