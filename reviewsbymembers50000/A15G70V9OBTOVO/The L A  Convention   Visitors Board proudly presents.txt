 Sure, Crash is brilliant but after awhile the device of pushing everyone to the brink--and then pulling most of them back--gets to be a bit much.  Its manipulative, like an Oliver Stone movie.    Same for the interlocking stories.  Rediculously clever but a distraction.  This made me think of the movie "Go" which ends at the beginning, begins at the end, etc.    I guess the lesson is, in the end we are all tied to each other by our common humanity and the fact that we're all so damned angry.  I'd like to see Crash on a double bill with Falling Down.
