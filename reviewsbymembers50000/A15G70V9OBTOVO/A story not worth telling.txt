 Maybe its my lifelong aversion to horror movies but this is 2+ hours of distilled upleasantness. Anyone who has ever lived in NY or NJ knows guys like this, but so what.   The one thing that might have redeemed Raging Bull would be if there was any light at all on why he was the way he was. And if that's too much to ask, I'd settle for why anybody would make a movie about him.  In the end its really just a brilliant portrayal of an angry lowlife.
