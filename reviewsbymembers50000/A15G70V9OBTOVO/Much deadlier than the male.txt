 Here's the premise.  A couple is parked in their convertable, the top down.  Along comes a speeding car and the driver throws a big bag of money into the couple's convertable.  Neat, huh?  What would YOU do if a bag of money was thrown into your car by accident?  Hint:  Something's gonna happen.  And its gonna be bad.  Very bad.  A killer movie.  Literally.  I had no idea Lizbeth Scott could be so naughty but here she is, along with equally underrated Dan Duryea in a noir classic.    Four stars because, alas, the DVD is just loaded with splices.
