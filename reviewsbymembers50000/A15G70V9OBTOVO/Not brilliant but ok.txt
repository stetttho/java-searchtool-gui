 Inside Man is slick and well played.  But its cleverness is its only real payoff.  Bad guys who don't get caught for a crime that's not committed.  The exchanges between Denzel and Clive are terrific, but brief.  I left the theatre wondering why its necessary to dig a hole in the floor when what you want is a hole in the wall.    Still, you get to see the wonderful banking room at #20 Exchange Place which like most things in lower Manhattan, is off limits for security reasons.  Of course, with enough money, you can bring in a whole film crew.
