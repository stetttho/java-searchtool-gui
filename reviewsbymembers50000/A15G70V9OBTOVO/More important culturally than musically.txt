 Being a rock icon in the 60s or 70s was very different from what it is today.  Here is Jimi, smart, funny, humble and articulate.  More inspiration in his little finger than a truckload of angry rappers.    Even his playing came from a different place than today's super guitarists.  Nowadays, to play in Jimi's league means spectacular technique--as if someone is giving a test.  But Jimi's ability was intrinsic; all he had to do was play what he heard and felt.  And what he heard and felt was as cool as it gets.
