 We always want what we cannot have and perhaps this accounts for the rave reviews of this film.  I confess, all I know about Tyrone Power is that he must be the last white guy to be  named Tyrone.  No doubt he was type cast due to his looks but if this was his most brilliant performance he wasn't exactly Laurence Olivier.  I was also troubled by what appeared to be black eye makeup(?) but what do I know.  The story is indeed dark and I found the first, carnival, section pretty slow.  There is some wonderful noir lighting but other than that just a bunch of stereotypes.  After that, things turn into a sort of upscale version of Racket Squad but except for Helen Walker's remarkable (and completely unexpected) turn its mostly predictable.  There's even the usual stuff about trying to play god (oy vey).  The scene where The Great Stanton raises the dead is really pretty inept and would never have fooled anybody.  In the end, whether Stan is a despicable loser due to his circumstances or just a despicable loser, who cares?  Perhaps the problem is that the movie, like Stan, tries too hard.  Or maybe its that, in a movie that's so intensely cynical its impossible to accept that someone so handsome and charismatic could come to such a bad end.
