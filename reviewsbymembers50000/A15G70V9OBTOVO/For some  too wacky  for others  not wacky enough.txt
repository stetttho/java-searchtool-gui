 If you were expecting a light hearted romp from the 1940s, you'll be dissapointed.  But this isn't the 1940s and taken for what it is, its hillarious.    From the first bit where Geoffrey Rush is troubled by his wife getting a service call from the pool repairman (it seems they don't have a pool), to the divorce game show at the end, its a hoot.    Not the Coen's best movie but much better than some have made it out to be.
