 The photos are undeniably great.  All that is missing is the Cloud Club.  But I'm still trying to figure out who David Stravitz is.  Certainly not the author.  Not one of the photographs is his.  By his own admission he stumbled across this work. The firm actually responsible, Peyser & Patzig does merit a few mentions but not on the cover or the title page.  Of course none of this detracts from the photos but as a photographer himself, Mr. Stravitz might be a little sensitive about taking credit for the work of others.  Even Christopher Gray, who contributes a lot more than Mr. Stravitz gets low billing.
