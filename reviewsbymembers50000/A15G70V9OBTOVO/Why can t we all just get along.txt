 I know that life is tough for younger people but what makes the author think its different for older people?  Example.  If you got a college degree in the 1970s, sure, it cost a fraction of what it does now.  But unless you are in medicine or law, you will be laid off.  Why? Partly because technology changes so fast that today's college-level skills will be common knowledge in a few years.  And partly because all those reports of "improved productivity" mean employers can fire more people and still get by.  The Democrats solution to this is to "reinvent" yourself.  The Republicans suggest tough love, compassionate conservatism and getting rid of those Mexicans who pick strawberries.  None of these "ideas" is worth commenting on.  I think the biggest loss is one of opportunity.  The opportunity to choose one's education and work based on what actually interests you.  In this respect I agree with the conservatives; from a strictly financial point of view a college education may not be worth it.  The solution--if there is one--is not to pit one generation against another.  As I write this, the French are in the streets, protesting a law that gives employers the right to fire without so much as an explanation.  At least they are putting up a fight.
