 This isn't just an excellent book, its an excellent piece of work.  I've used Photoshop since v.2.5 and while there have obviously been hundreds of enhancements & improvements, Photoshop's complexity has increased dramaticly as well.  Its really not fair to criticize RWPS for being such a brick.  You'll learn an important lesson just by picking it up.  Photoshop is many things but simple and user-friendly are not among them.  And with each new version of Photoshop, Adobe moves things around just to keep you guessing.    So yes, its a bit of a slog (and don't forget the even better Real World Color Management) but in this user-friendly, digital age we just have to get used to thick books.
