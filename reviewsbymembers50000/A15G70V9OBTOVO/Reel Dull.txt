 OK, the authors are literate and clever but I was suprised at how unfunny this book is.  Perhaps this can be excused, given the difficulty of the task (making funny remarks about incredibly bad movies) but somehow this comes off as mostly smug and sarcastic.    There are lots of fun books on B movies and part of the fun is the photos of those cheap sets and wacky costumes.  Incredibly, Reel Shame has no illustrations at all.  Not one.
