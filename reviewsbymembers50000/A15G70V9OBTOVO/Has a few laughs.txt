 This movie has some funny moments but alas, it also has Jim Carey who as usual, gives a performance that makes Jerry Lewis seem restrained.  I saw this on a plane and when Carey started singing "I believe I can fly" the emergency exit started looking pretty good.  Still, its hard not to laugh when Carey goes on an interview for the one decent job he has come across...only to find there are a hundred guys in line.  This makes more of a statement about our current business climate than the Alec Baldwin/Bernie Ebbers thing they have going.    It reminded me of Lost In America and I would have loved to see Albert Brooks (or Nick Cage) pull off those robberies!
