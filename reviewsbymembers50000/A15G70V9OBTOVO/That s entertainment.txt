 This is an interesting premise and Burt Lancaster is as usual, superb.  That said, this film is monutmentally depressing, made all the more so by the fact that as things progress they go steadily downhill.    Add to this schlockmeister supreme Martin HAMlisch's overpowering score and, well, things can't get much grimmer.    What can I say?  Fire up the popcorn and remember things  always appear darkest before going entirely black.
