 Have you ever read a "study" that contains tiny bits of truth (usually things that are obvious) but the rest is false?  That's the case with Generations At Work.    If you remove the stereotypes all that remains is stuff that ought to be obvious.  It may be that some CEOs with large numbers of disgruntled employees are unaware of even the most blantant trends and conflicts in the workplace but the lesson there is to fix the workplace, not the employees.  All generations will be cynical if they are contstantly in danger of being laid off.    From my own experience, 3 examples that are completely the opposite of what this book describes.  (1) People in my age group are supposed to be driven overachievers.  How I wish that were true.  Must have come from astrology or something.  (2) I worked for a company that hired two young "golden collar" tech experts.  These kids were outstanding.  There were no personality conflicts.  There were no generational conflicts.  And the fact that they were so knowlegable made us worship them!  So what if they preferred rock climbing to golf?  (3) Speaking of stereotypes, the company shut down and we all got laid off.  According to this book, young IT professionals can write their own ticket, right?  False, again.  Four months have passed and one of our young geniuses has a boring job with a long commute and big pay cut.  The other has refused to take a crummy job and remains unemployed.  The book is not without humor, perhaps unintentional.  Apparently Lucent is a good example of how waring generations can make peace.  But I wonder how many managers want their company to perform as Lucent has.    In the end, the key to a productive harmonious workplace is for people to have jobs they enjoy, pay well and are reasonably secure.  In a lesser work environment all managers can hope for is to tap into the stereotypes in this book to try to keep the dust down.
