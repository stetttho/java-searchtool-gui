 This new KK is fun and mostly exciting.  But it really is too long (because everyone already knows the story) and the entire movie belongs to Naomi Watts and Kong.  Nothing wrong with that--as soon as I heard they had Naomi Watts I knew this movie would be a cut above.  But over the course of 3 hours there should be some other memorable characters and there aren't.  Jack Black and the others are ok but anybody could have been substituted and it wouldn't have made any difference.    That's why, when its over, everybody remembers the Anne, Kong and the special effects.  The rest is pretty much filler.  My guess is, its Peter Jackson's ego and he has to embellish everything from the original, just to show that more is better.
