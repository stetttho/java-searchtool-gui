 Apparently there is a patron saint of lost causes and I guess she wasn't on the set this time.  This long, slow, slick, sad movie has its moments but you've seen it all before and in under 90 minutes.  I'd like to say Denzel Washington's performance helps but since you already know the story, it doesn't matter much.  Christopher Walken is wasted and Mickey Rourke sure looks wasted.  I tought the end was missing the big payoff, too.  Everybody gets what's coming to them but Denzel never gets to meet bad guy #1.    There is one great line--the kind that real people never say:  "His art is killing and he's about to paint his masterpiece!"  Can you imagine, having to say that with a straight face?   Its ok if you've got time to kill.
