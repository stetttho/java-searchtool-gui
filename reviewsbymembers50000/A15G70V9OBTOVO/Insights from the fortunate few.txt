 Its hard to argue with the notion that life is more fulfilling if you do something you like.  So, if you are just starting out in life and have wealthy, supportive parents or you don't mind starving, by all means, go for it.  But the bottom line is that these people are exceptions to the rule.  And they were lucky.  If all it took was hard work and a dream there wouldn't be a dentist or a tax preparer in America.  Honestly, I don't know what the answer is.  But I have noticed that many people who end up with dream jobs are folks who came from the wrong side of the tracks and thus had nothing to lose.  If this describes you, well, you have nothing to lose.  So 3 stars for the entertainment but as a wise man once said "If you think you can't, you can't.  If you think you can, you might."
