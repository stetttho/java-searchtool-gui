Besides being inferior to 52 Pickup in every way, there is no chemistry and Jennifer Anniston comes off colder than Chicago in January.  And yes, the big plot twist is 100% predictable.  Even if its a surprise, so what?   If you like this sort of ugly little story (blackmail - revenge) by all means, see 52 Pickup.
