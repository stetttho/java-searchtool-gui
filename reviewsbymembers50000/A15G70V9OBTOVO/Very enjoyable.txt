 Borderline is a fun, early 50s crime drama, played with some humor.  The chase across Mexico plotline is similar to Robert Mitchum's The Big Steal.    In addition to moving along nicely, Borderline has three other special qualities.  First, as always, Claire Trevor is great.  Second, you get to see Fred McMurray and Raymond Burr play bad guys and third, this seems to be one of the only oldies.com DVDs with good quality.
