 While not as well known (and to be honest, not quite as good) as Flash Gordon there is much to like about Buck Rogers, especially the Art Deco sets.  Add this to your collection along with Metropolis and Things To Come and you've pretty much covered the Art Deco/Science Fiction connection that began in the 1930s and continues to this day.  One person who obviously liked Buck Rogers was George Lucas.  The story line and visuals of Buck Rogers and Star Wars are so similar its almost copyright infringement.
