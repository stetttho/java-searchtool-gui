 Honestly, I really like action movies but this was so slow, so badly plotted and so gruesome I barely made it to the end.  The movie begins with the entirely predictable scene where Bruce loses the hostages  and has to cope with his guilt, redeem himself, etc.  Of course its no wonder he loses the hostages with dialog like "Relax!" and "Take it easy!"  Truly fine script writing.  This cliche behind us, Bruce launches into an absolutely rediculous hostage within a hostage story where almost nothing happens for an hour and half until he drives his truck through the house gates.  Just when you think he's gonna wrap things up...nothing happens. In a later scene with a helicopter, nothing happens either.  Instead, the focus is on how upset Bruce is, and who goes to an action picture for that?    The plot, as far as I can tell has to do with comedian Kevin Pollack trying to steal a DVD from himself.  When this fails, it turns out he has the contents memorized.  None of the plot makes any sense, but it gets worse toward the end when Bruce begs Kevin not to kill his (Bruce's) family, saying "they haven't seen your face" but calling him by name.  Kevin had better hope Bruce's family is deaf!  If the above wasn't enough, the movie really focuses in on some ugly deaths. Do you really want to see somebody portayed fairly sympatheticly, only to be thrown over a balcony?  If any of this was real and the characters had to witness these awful closeups, they'd probably be better off dead.
