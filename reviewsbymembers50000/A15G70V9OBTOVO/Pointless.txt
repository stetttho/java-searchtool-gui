 Let's forget about the violence; this dog is nothing but a comic book and movies like Sin City have more violence while still having a point.    There are some good things like the use of flashbacks and some good dialog.  No doubt Tarrintino thinks he wrote another Glengarry Glenross but no.  Steve Buscemi must have thought he was at a sales meeting with all that talk about professionalism.   As for the acting, read a little about Lawrence Tierney.  Asking him and Harvey Keitel to pretend they're angry psychos is like asking Robert DiNiro to pretend he's Italian.  The biggest acting "stretch" is the guy who's been shot in the stomach, looses all his blood and still lasts through the entire movie.   Originality?  Well the "Mr. Blue" stuff comes from that great old movie, The Taking Of Pelham 1,2,3.  And thanks for the Madonna explanation, Quentin, you're a classy guy.    This movie is to film noir what Jim Carey is to comedy.  You swat a fly with a sledgehammer and still you miss.  And hey, where is Ray Liotta in all this?  He wouldn't even need a script.
