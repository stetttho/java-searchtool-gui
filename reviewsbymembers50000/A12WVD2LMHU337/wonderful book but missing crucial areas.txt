 i recently purchased this book after finding out about it on the taschen website. i have seen several of their books and knew that this book would be of good quality. overall i am happy with the book and the quality of the paper and the layout of the book. i am a graphic designer first and a video game enthusiast second. i find myself playing less and less but i still find time to keep track of the newest games. the book is divided into 10 sections some of which are strange. a few samples of the categories are "funny heroes, legends of video games, sexy heroes, fighting heroes, strange heroes, licensed heroes, and fearless heroes" to name some of them. upon looking through the categories, i found that some games were missing or could have be included for the substitution of the mentioned games in the book. "resident evil", "wolfenstein", "ultima",  "metroid" (but featured as part of  "smash bros"), "contra", "street fighter", pitfall harry are just some games and characters missing from this book which i believe are worth mentioning. the capcom universe of characters and many from the squaresoft universes could have been be shown. there are some games mentioned in here that i vaguely remember due to bad concept or gameplay. i think that the book as a whole is a wonderful compilation. boasting "1000" heroes is quite a selling point. while some characters were given several page spreads (tekken), some were only given a page spread despite their influence (case in point, castlevania). there may have been reasons behind the conceptualization of this book for why certain games are less prominent in this book so i realize i must be understanding toward that point. while many great games are mentioned, many go unnoticed especially in the area of classic games. but from a design standpoint, this book is a great attempt at gathering many well-known heroes (and some unknown ones) into one nice book. a nice gift to the designer or video game enthuasist.
