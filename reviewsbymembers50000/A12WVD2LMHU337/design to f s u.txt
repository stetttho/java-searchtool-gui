 I came across this book while on vacation in Taiwan. I rarely buy design books since they are usually very pricy. The use of high-contrast imagery  combined with beautiful typefaces such as Clarendon make for a wonderful  combination. Like much of Tomato's other books, "Bareback" and "Process,"  there is very little informative text in regards to what those lads in  Tomato are thinking as they do their stuff. Instead, concepts and hidden  messages dive in and out of pages of pure black and white. The forms are  strange yet familiar. You feel that the forms from the typography are  recognizible, but turning to the next page, you are hit with a completely  new set of surroundings.     I am happy that this book has seen more than  two printings. There are a lot of wonderful design books out now with great  use of inks and paper, but is nice to see something like this book still  out and around on bookshelves to equally amaze readers.
