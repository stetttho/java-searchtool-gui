 I really enjoy British design. With numerous books from designer(s) like  the Attik, Tomato, and the people at Buro Destruct, I was glad to see that  Why Not Associates were able to join the list.     The book is set up in  chronological order from early design school work to the most recent works  consisting of postage stamp concepts and environmental design. Design  magazines and books show only a handful of the Why Not Associates' work.  With this book, I got to see more examples of what makes their style and  design so influential in my eyes. The photography is great and the overall  layout is stunning. Look at the cover image and you can see why. The cover  conveys the overall feeling throughout the entire book.     The only  thing that I wish this book had was more insightful information like  sketches and opinions from the designers themselves. The beginning of the  book talks a little bit about their history over the years but after that,  there is very little beyond project descriptions. This, to me, is something  that I wish more design books did. but perhaps not knowing is more  intriguing. Let the reader and viewer wondering and guessing.
