 I know many people prefer either a mouse or a trackball. Sometimes both. This review is mainly helpful for those accustomed to the trackball especially the older Expert Mouse Trackball (K64215). I recently bought this trackball for use on my G4 Macintosh at work. Since the trackball is USB-ready, there is no need for an adapter. The Expert Mouse Pro is just a larger version of the older model with many, newly added features. The six buttons at the top act as shortcuts linking you to files, applications, and/or websites. This is extremely handy. Adding and editing these features is easily done through the control panel for the Expert Mouse Pro. The location of the buttons is a bit awkward because you have to move your hand up from your working position to push the buttons. The scroll knob is handy for moving up and down the window. My only problem with the scrollling knob is that the trackball just below it makes it hard for you to access it since it elevates your hand a bit too high. The trackball, itself, glides without any problems. It's smooth and responsive. The color of the device (grey) may not be to some people's liking. The large size and shape of the Expert Mouse Pro may not appeal to those who like small, more aerodynamical input devices. Overall, this is a wonderful device that is not without its own minor flaws. But if you are willing to overlook those details, the Expert Mouse Pro is a great input device for your computer.
