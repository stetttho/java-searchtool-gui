 i recently bought this dvd collection and i am very impressed. the footage quality for this dvd collection is much improved over all the other versions of this movie that i have seen from the theater to videotape. the packaging itself is very impressive. the additional dvd that accompanies it includes the "making of akira" documentary that was previously available on videotape. there is also additional material on the making of the music and a glossary of terms and storyboard art. for fans of this excellent example in modern-day animation, the supplemental material provided on this second disc is very in-depth. the only thing about this dvd edition that bothered was the dubbing of the movie. there is a brand new dubbing version made for this particular dvd edition. i, myself, prefer subtitles. it keeps the original language intact and more truer to the story. dubbing usually requires editing the english actors' voices to meet with the lip movements. the voice acting doesn't seem to match the movie but since this is my preference to watching this anime, it should be up to each individual. but you can still choose between english, japanese with subtitles, and japanese (for those fluent in the language) this is a wonderful edition for those who can find it. the material accompanying the movie disc has plenty of material for those wanting to learn about the production of the movie itself.
