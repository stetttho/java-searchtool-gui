 i am an admirer of haruki murakami's works. his characters are very endearing and different from the typical businessman traits that make up a majority of japan's older male population. his characters are independent and though they suffer loss or heartbreak, they venture forth and carry on. this story, to me, is a departure from his previous works. his other works were strange tales of searching for something that took the main character and reader to different realms both physical and metaphysical. but this story is a love story, plain and simple and it works well. the character here is much like murakami's other male characters, independent and easily identified with. the main character, hajime, must deal with a conflict in the form of an old love returning to him and the mysteries she hides. the story may be different from murakami's other works but the writing style is definitely there. i really like the references to music and jazz in this story especially to one particular henry mancini song. but this story has a scene in all its detail that many of his readers might or might not be put off by. i leave that up to the individual to decide without giving away too much of  the plot. this story is very sentimental and it captivated me with its overall simplicity and narrative.
