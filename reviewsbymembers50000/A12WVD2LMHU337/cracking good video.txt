 i do not always watch animation features but this one created by nick park was recommended to me by a friend. after watching all three on video, i was happy to hear that a dvd collection would come out with all three features. the stories are lighthearted yet humorous. the people responsible for "wallace and grommit" have a great deal of patience and obviously love what they do. it shows in the detail and quality of the animation. upon receiving this dvd, i was amazed to find the additional "making of" features and commentary included with the disc. it is informative to see how the features were conceived and finally produced. there are some funny moments when you watch the early sketches and animations of nick park way before wallace and grommit were ever conceived. upon finishing this dvd, i recommend this to those who haven't already been introduced to these wonderful characters or would like to find a nice gift for those young-at-heart or admirers of animation. i look forward to seeing this studio's other works available now and in the future.
