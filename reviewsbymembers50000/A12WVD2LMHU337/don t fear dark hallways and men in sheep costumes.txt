 don't fear dark hallways and men in sheep costumes. that's what i got out of haruki murakami's novel, "a wild sheep chase." this was the second book that i read by this accomplished writer. be sure you read this book before you get to "dance, dance, dance." that book is the sequel to "a wild sheep chase." i love this book out of all of murakami's finely-crafted tales for many reasons. the characters represent Japanese people who belong outside the norm of typical Japanese society, i.e. corporate business men. his characters are very independent and do what they please without any regard to others around them. they work when they want and enjoy life and hardships to the fullest. i admire murakami's ability to create interesting characters. that is the single reason why i always pick up his new books and reread all his previous ones. the story is a strange one. it begins with a divorce and carries on to a strange search for a particular sheep. sounds weird, right? don't let it discourage you from reading this book. i am sure you may get perplexed at times but that is the fun in reading this novel much like all of murakami's work. sometimes you are astonished by what takes place and sometimes you feel right at home because it's something that you would have done or considered doing yourself.
