 I picked up this book while I was traveling in Taiwan. The cover, I must say, is what captured my attention among all the other design books surrounding it. The story which consists of writings by Stephen Jones is a strange but compelling mix. It a story about a man named Jack and his observations and journeys in the course of the day. As a graphic designer, the designs and layout of the pages really compliment the writing and vice versa. Sometimes, the pages can get really overloaded with imagery and text and the next white empty space. Normally, I would be detracted from this but all this use of negative space, color, and imagery really  add more depth to the story. The buyer or reader must be aware of the story sometimes buried within the pages. Design books tend to be visual devices and I sometimes find myself flipping through pages of books like these too fast. Reading the writings in this book helps you understand the design decisions that Ded Associates made while conceiving and designing this book.
