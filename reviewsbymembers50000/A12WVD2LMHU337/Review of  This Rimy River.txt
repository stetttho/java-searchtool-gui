 This was a book that I purchased a few years back direct from the company. I heard that there is a new book on Vaughn Oliver and v23's work coming someday soon. In the meantime, I thought that I might write this  review. The book format is big with plenty of lovely photos and nice  subtle details (i.e. silver ink throughout the pages). It really makes you  see the evolution of his work over the years of v23's conception. There are  also quotes throughout the book from fellow musicians and designers who  have come to know Vaughan Oliver that make for a very nice  retrospective. The only problems with this book is that I wish that it  had more text particularly from the Vaughan Oliver himself about his  experiences and design methods. The book format is easy to damage and get  dirty, and the inks from one page sometimes rub off onto the next  page. Other than that, a good book overall.
