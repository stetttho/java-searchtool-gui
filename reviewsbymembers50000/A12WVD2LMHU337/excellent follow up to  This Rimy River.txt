 I recently purchased this book after months and months of waiting. When I heard that a book was to be published about Vaughan Oliver and his wonderful career thus far in graphic design, I just couldn't wait. After all the wait, I am happy to say that I am quite pleased with the content of this book. Unlike the last book, 'This Rimy River' which was a catalogue of all his work 1988-1994, this book contains a good balance of text and pictures. The text, which was lacking in other books, gives an in-depth look at Vaughan Oliver and his history of design. The pictures are beautiful especially the new ones that were made especially for this book. Many designers will enjoy all the older pieces found throughout the book while there are many samples of his more recent work. This book is a definite must since many of his previous books are hard to find and out of print.
