 I am not much of a reader in mystery books. In fact, I'm not much of a reader in general. But a friend who reads nothing but mysteries mentioned this book and I picked up on it after that. I must say that it is a wonderful mystery. It provides several interesting insights. It makes you realize the complexity a detective of any type must face, especially this one. It also makes you admire the person he's assigned to find from the available clues and unknowns to all the trails the detective must follow and reexamine. Several times, I was amazed at all things a detective has to remember when he's presented with new clues and information. This book also showed me a lot about Japanese culture from basic everyday living to financial history. From her book, I learned a lot about the hardships of ordinary people in that country just to make ends meet. After reading this book, you realize the complexity of the whole entire case. I am not an expert of mystery novels but I enjoyed reading it through the entire time. I see why mystery novels can be so compelling to read for some.
