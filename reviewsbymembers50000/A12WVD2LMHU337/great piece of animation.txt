 i am not an expert on animation but i remember this movie from many years ago. with so many dvds coming out now, i was surprised to find this movie to add to my growing dvd collection. reading the book was a joy and seeing this movie again was a nice trip down memory lane. the story is very engrossing touching upon the subject of medical testing using animals and the results of such experiments. the characters also make this movie wonderful to watch. i can't forget the first time i saw the great owl and his frightening appearance. this mixture of mature storyline and memorable character is good because it appeals to kids and adults alike. the dvd itself has no special features other than subtitles and the original trailer but it neither adds or detracts from the viewing enjoyment. the small booklet included with the package has facts for young kids to read and learn about the animation process behind the movie. one caution, the final conflict between two rats may be a bit graphic especially for very young children but i saw it at a very young age and did not think too much of it. i think it was good that the makers of this film kept to the original story rather than modifying it for strictly a younger audience. for those who would like to add this to their dvd collection and perserve it for many repeated viewings, i highly recommend this dvd.
