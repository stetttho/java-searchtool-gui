 In the third grade i had a 12+ grade reading level, as a result I havent read many childrens books since about second grade due to the lack of enjoyment, and intalectual stimulation. When my mother brought Harry Potter  and the Sorcerer's Stone for my younger brother I read it to keep from  being bored. I was Immediatley hooked. The writing style is simple and easy  to read, which gives the younger people who read this a boost in  confedence, not many kids can say that they read and liked a 300+ page  book!  Even though the book is written for kids, its good for all ages,  dont believe me? just look at the wide variety of people who have reviewed  this. Theres people anywhere from 7 years old to in the 60+ range.  Dont  let the size of the book deter you though, this book teaches good morals  like: sharing, kindness, and curiousity, duty and several others. This is  an imagination stimulating book, you wont be able to stay away from it.  If  there is a book that you would let your kids read then this is it. You wont  find anything better.
