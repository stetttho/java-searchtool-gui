 I'm fifteen and this book has helped me alot on a few things that I was worried about. I especially liked the section on how to ask out a girl, something that I had no clue on how to do before I read this. It has all  kinds of practical advice that is a must need for guys in their teens, and  girls should get a copy of this also. The author has a somewhat corny  aproach, like an adult trying to be cool; but the author pulls it off  through most of it, he writes in a way that makes it easy and comftorable  to read without coming across like a scientist.
