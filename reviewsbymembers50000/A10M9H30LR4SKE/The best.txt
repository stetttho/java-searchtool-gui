 I'm 15 and I recently started learning Tae Kwon Do and found that i wasnt even near flexible, I had a hard time getting my front kicks to my waist. I couldnt even think about knockin someone in the chin with it, so after a lot of recommendation from my father (a martial artist also) I bought this book. Within a few months my flexibility increased dramatically. I am now able to kick over my head and can nearly do front and side splits. The pictures are kinda crappy and you have to read the book a few times in order to really comprehend what he's talking about. But other than those few and miniscule things this book is excellent.  This is an excellent book and I would reccomend it for all martial artists along with anyone involved with sports of anykind.
