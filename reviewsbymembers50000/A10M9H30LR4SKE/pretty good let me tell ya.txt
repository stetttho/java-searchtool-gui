 This book is great, since i bought this book it has helped my game tremoundsly. I've learned how to completly see the board and how each piece relates to the greater goal; checkmate. While i do really love this book i wouldnt however reccomend this to the barebones begginner. It'd probably be best for the chessplayer who has played a few games and understands a little how the game is played. i also dont think that this book is great as a standalone, if you are serious about improving your game you should pair this book with a few other basic beginning books that other more experienced reviewers have recommended and any books written by Yasser Seirawan + the chessmaster 8000 software plus this book to help your game.
