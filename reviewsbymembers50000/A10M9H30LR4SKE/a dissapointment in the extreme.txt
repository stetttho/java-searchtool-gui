 this game is kinda cool, for the first 15 min. After that its pretty darn boring. Its nothing like GTA3, the graphics are more comic bookish and the missions are just plain stupid and uncool. I wouldnt buy this brand new, you'd be better off buying this one used. in fact i've got one if you want to buy it.
