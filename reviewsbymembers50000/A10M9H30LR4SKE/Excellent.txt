 This was the first book that I ever bought on runes. and it is still one of the best that i have read. The author gives you a good introduction with a style that reminds me of Scott Cunningham, its easy to read and has room  for individuality. All at the same time remaining for the most part  historically accurate, I think that the only thing that isnt accurate is  the blank rune, which has little to none signifigance to the Elder Futhark  and i would reccomend getting rid of it (like another reviewer said,  "tear it out! ".  Otherwise this book is one of the best  introduction books on runes that i own. And i would reccomend this to  anyone interested in runes.
