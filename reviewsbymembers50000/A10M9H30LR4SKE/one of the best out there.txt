 When i first saw this book at my local bookstore i thought that it was one of those Darth Vader rip offs. Boy was i wrong, this book is a prime example on the old saying "Never judge a book by its cover."  This book is about a mercanary group called the Black Company who are pretty much the best soldiers out there. Its a pretty dark book, not like the other books out there where you find really good guys versus very evil bad guys. In this book there is no totally good or totally evil person. You have bad guys versus badder bad guys, basically there is no line between good and evil. The characters are original, the plot is original, and overall this book is a refreshing dose of something new. This is an excellent read, and i would reccomend it to anybody whos looking for something that isnt stretched or wornout like the mainstreem epic fantasy where there are only slight variations of plot and characters.
