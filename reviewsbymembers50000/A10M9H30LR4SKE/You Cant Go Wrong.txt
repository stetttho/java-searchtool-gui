 This book is excellent, it is part two of volume three of Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn. With this series in your collection you cant go wrong. Tad Williams gets you into the characters so much that you become them,  literally.. This man takes the high road when it comes to writing fantasy,  he never slacks off and is always throwing some kind of suprise that keeps  you on your toes throughout the series. A good point about this book is  that you can actually read it all without skipping a chapter of two because  you dont want to read about an annoying character, here you WANT to get to  the next character. Granted it does have its slow parts, but what series  doesnt? This overshadows everything by Jordan and Goodkind. Trust me if you  buy this book you will not be dissapointed, it is worthy to be put into  anyones library.
