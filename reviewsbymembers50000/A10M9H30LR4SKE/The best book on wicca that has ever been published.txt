 This book is the best book on wicca that i own. In fact it was my introduction to wicca. Scott Cunningham goes over all of the basics of the wiccan philisophies, beliefs, tools, magick and gives an explanation on why  everything is the way it is. Its written in a straight forward, easy manner  which makes it easy to read and stresses imagination and individuality.  This is the ultimate book for the beginner, if you are interested in wicca  whether you want to practice it or if you just want to learn about it then  this is the book for you. Dont let the size fool you (compared to other  books by Llewellyn its tiny.) This book has more information than any other  book that i have ever found. And is an invaluable aid in learning wicca. It  is definitaly worth ten times its weight in gold!
