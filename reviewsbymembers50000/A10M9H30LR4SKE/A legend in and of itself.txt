 This book is probably the best I have ever read. The characters are not that well defined, the story is confusing in the begginning, and it jumps  from character to character without warning adding to the confusion. The  main thing that sticks out in my mind is that Rek and Virae hate each other  and then within an hour and some sex they pledge their undying love. But if  you like fighting then this is the book for you, it consists of mostly  fighting and the author goes into alarming detail. Gemmel includes just the  right amount of honor and hopelessness to make this book worthwhile.  Despite its earlier flaws this book is more than worth the money it costs  and the time it takes to read. I certainly intend to read this again and  again. It is almost impossible to tell people about how good this book  really is in the thousand word limit that is given us, so if you are  considering buying this book, read the other reviews and they should make  up your mind. Gemmel is not an International Bestseller for nothing!
