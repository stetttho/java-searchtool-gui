 An Excellent read! The characters are very realistic, so realistic that after a while you get to thinking that they are real people, not just  characters in a book.  This book is told from Christopher's point of  view. Christopher and his companions (David, April, and Jalil) travel to  the land of the Aztecs with a Viking army on a mission to kill the Aztecs  main god. There is a huge battle and the vikings end up losing to the  Aztecs. When you think that its all over our hero's inspire the vikings  that the fight isnt over. They route the Aztecs and injure the Aztec god  and manage to get out of there more or less intact. This is an excellent  read but i wouldnt reccomend this to anyone younger than 13 because the  characters use mild swear words. I would have given this five stars but i  have problems relating to Christopher.
