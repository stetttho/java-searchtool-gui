 i was very dissapointed with this...thing. its definatly not as cool as what it looks like. first of all the screen scratches up way to easily, you cant see the pieces and the controls are kinda hard to figure out. so hard that you have to carry around the instructions for the first week until you get it memorized. if you are looking for a decent handheld chess computer i'd go with the lcd touch chess. its about as powerful as this thing, and its the same size of a PDA, and you use it the same way as a PDA, just grab your stylus and start playing.
