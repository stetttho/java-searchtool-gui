 This book has its good points but I'm afraid that it doesnt really stand up to the all of the hype. Probably the one good thing about this book is that its good for people who come from very religious familys that are  opposed to to wicca. This book is not good for those who are serious about  wicca. It's not even wicca, just folk magick (the use of everyday items in  magic). On page 106 in Living Wicca, Scott Cunningham says that all Wiccan  traditions should utilize most if not all of the tools because the tools  are among the outer aspects of Wicca by which we define our religion, if  you practice wicca without ever utilizing any of the tools it probably  wouldnt be wicca. If you dont use the tools you've most likley created a  new religion. This book doesnt include any of the essential tools which  means that what this book teaches isnt wicca. I could be wrong but that is  my point of view. Also this book doesnt teach you any kind of  visualization, which is essential to practicing magick, without it you  weaken the effectiveness to your magic, and lessens the chance that it will  work at all. And wheres the spiritual side of wicca in this book? Wicca is  a religion, the author doesnt tell you that and doesnt explain any of the  spiritual side of wicca, without that all you have is a book on cheap  magick which has little to do with actual wicca. I would listen to the  advise of experienced wiccans, otherwise you are just being mislead.  Ultimatly this book has the smell of an author who is interested in only  making money. Stick with the older books by the Same author, such as To  Ride a Silver Broomstick, or to Stir a Magic Cauldron. They are more  factual,and reliable. and anything by Scott Cunningham would be a good  learning influence.
