 This book is a one of a kind fantasy novel, there are few who can match its simplicity and its brilliance at the same time. In this book Peirs Anthony has created a realm of magic that exists unseen in our own world.  The story revolves around a charcter (bink) who is searching for his magic  talent so he wont be exiled to mundania. The characters are wonderfully  enjoyable and usually have nothing to do with the plot, and pretty much  only exists to accompany Bink (the main character) on his quest. This book  is an exciting and worthy edition to anyones library. I warn you though  that if you do read this you'll most likely be tempted to read the millions  of sequels in this series. Of which only the first few are really good.
