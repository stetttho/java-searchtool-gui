 I usually stay away from books that Silver Ravenwolf writes but this book was an exception. It surpasses all of her other books that i have read (teen witch, to ride a silver broomstick and so forth.) It doesnt give much  practical information concerning wicca and in some areas is very  exghagerated (sorry about the spelling). I started this book thinking that  it was just another cheap rip off written to make money, by the end of the  book i was completley entralled. The story line is a classic but changed  enough to make it wonderful. Adding the practice of the craft to the story  line made it well worth reading. I related to the characters perfectly. I  got the feeling that MamaSilver put a lot of herself into one of the  characters. Take my word for it, once you start this book you wont be able  to stop. There was just one flaw, she got rid of all of the guys to fast. I  dont mind reading a few books from a girls point of view but i was really  looking forward to a book in this series with a guy as the character who  tells the story. Other than that its great, BUY it!
