 This is a fine release! I have this and also another winner.The BSO/Munch/Primrose 1958 RCA release. This offers a different coupling,"Symphony on a French Mountain Air" by D'Indy with the pianist Nicole Henriot Schweitzer. Both cd's will earn their keep. This music would be a good place for the newcomer to start exploring Berlioz, one of the most fascinating composers who ever lived, how his life has escaped Hollywoods notice is beyond me.                                                           His music is so individual that after a few years of exposure it is easily identified by it's sound. orchestration, and use of modulation. In the old days there were two conductors who knew their way around Berlioz: Beecham and Munch. You can't go wrong fifty years later than to go with either of them.
