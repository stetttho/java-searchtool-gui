 I find myself agreeing in many ways with every reviewer. This is an uneven release; I think it's not up to Archiv standards in the matter of balance for one thing. I have a large system and I had to back off the bass some and emphasize the treble some and still found the lack of sibilants interfered with the choral sound. The words are committed to memory by now but I still want to hear those words clearly. I rarely have to move tone controls from the flat position and this is odd to find in Archive. Otherwise this is a huge pice of work!. I especially enjoyed the "Agnus Dei" opening; the chorus sounds like they truly are calling a lamb to come to them and I found the idea endearing. Paul Mac Creesh has a flair for these epic productions; I think of his reconstruction of the "Coronation of the Doge" in Venice with music from Gabrielli. Gigantic proportions well done. I play these things about once a year, they tend to overwhelm.
