 This review belongs below Bob Ziedlers essay because it simply says "amen" to his praises of this music and of the book by Lewis Thomas. I bought the book at it's publication because it has some of thbe most cogent reasoning about the Cold War, then at it's scary height. His words about the last movement of this symphony made me so sad that I had trouble seeing and swallowing. The feeling of shared understanding between two   people, author and reader, often come as a shock to the reader; as if the author read your mind and found something there even though you hadn't been aware of it until you read his words. So it was with that little book of thoughtful essays. I still read it, still am moved by it and will forever carry one of his most profound thoughts, that one of the greatest mysteries of all is this; "Why do humans treat each other the way they do?". To those seeking sanctuary from the madness of the last weeks I urge the reading of this book, still in print, and this music of the most transcendant beauty in the midst of pain and suffering. We need to be reminded of our potential for being fully human even in the presence of loss. I sing the praises of Mr. Ziedlers analysis and of the aptness of his mention of Dr. Thomas' beautiful book.
