 Like your other reviewer I heard Ziehrer first on one of those early, appallingly cheap, vinyl discs in the fifties and sixties. Through the surface noise I heard the most extraordinary lilting music!. Again, like the first reviewer I searched in vain for more with slight success. When I saw this one I hardly dared to hope it would meet expectations. It did meet and surpass expectations. Brilliantly played and recorded it never fails to dazzle me anew. I have about 2000 cd's and I love them all, but this one and volume one are rare. I pinch myself when I realise how many things had to come together to make this project come true; remarkable when you realise that record producers are rarely adventurous enoough to touch other than the Strauss'. So three cheers for Marco Polo. My favorite? That's easy. "Herrienspaziert" or simply,"Come on in". It is physically impossible for me to not react bodily to the introduction to this piece, it's that visceral. The orchestra and its leader are unknown to me but I bet they could play this stuff with their hands behind their backs. Ist Wonderbar!!!
