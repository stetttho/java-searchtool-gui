 This is just the sort of collection I had been looking for and even though it lacks some that I'd hoped for I'm happy with it. I must offer my sympathy to the audience; the orchestra is defunct so I understand, and a fine group it was. Berlioz is not the easiest composer to negotiate in matters of tempi; this band romps through the "Overture to Bennevuto Cellini" with precision and dash. The brass sounds properly Berliozan as do the winds. Back in the fifties there was a Columbia release on the Epic Label of these overtures played by the City of Birmingham SO and this cd reminds me of that recording, taut and brilliant playing with "elan". Highly recommended.
