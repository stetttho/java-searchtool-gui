 I am so glad to run across Corboz again that I am ordering this release "sound unheard". Corboz was for years one of the stars of the French label, Erato. He has a way of coaxing the most balanced, refined singing from large choral groups that I have ever heard. He is to choral ensemble music what Neville Marriner was to chamber orchestral music. They are contemporaries. I have tried for years to locate cd's of his Erato recordings with limited success. The music of Charpentier has always impressed me with it's profound spirituality; I would give an arm and a leg for a good version of his "Occuli Omnium", choral music of transcendant beauty. I literally wore out an old vinyl lp of it. The "Te Deum" has been recorded many times. Corboz did it up as befits a Baroque staple, profound, with the power and bite of brass and thoroughly rehearsed voices. He was also unsurpassed in choral music of Vivaldi and Mendelssohn, no mean feat.
