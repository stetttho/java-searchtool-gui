 Like many my age I cut my musical teeth on Toscanni. A piece by him when heard determined forever what it should sound like. I grew out of that mindset eventually but, all in all, it served me well. One time when I was in The Liberty Music Shop in Ann Arbor(a memorable place in an equally memorable city) I asked one of their knowledgeable clerks that, given my Toscanni bent what would be a good stero version and without a moments hesitation she said, "George Szell". She picked out a two lp album that included the Prelude to act one of Lohengrin. When I played it I knew the lady was right. Like Toscanni, Szell makes sparks with Wagner. I must have had a dozen versions of this music but none to compare with this. That album was one I treasured and when cd's came along Columbia reissued it but didn't include the first act prelude so it was a case of searching for something that came close. Over ten years later I found this cd and it is wonderful to hear the glorious Cleveland Orchestra in all it's power: the grail theme with cymbals exploding over the strings, brass with real bite, the whole thing is almost organic in the way it develops, blooms and becomes still. I find myself , when listening to this music, hitting the pause button because to follow it with anything is to destroy a sense of miracle. One of your reviewers said that something he had heard had, among other things, made him thank God that he had ears. This recording makes me glad I have a sound system that recreates music close to the original but even more glad that there is a recording in the first place and musicians to make it and producers to decide to put it all together. This cd is one of my "miracle recordings" that fill me with gratitude. It is simply superb.
