 If ever a recording was made that demonstrated the ability to reproduce a certain quality of sound this is one of them. I never fail to be impressed by the capture of the sound of the DSO in this "Grand Canyon". I think it way ahead of the competition in evoking the vastness of the scene. You need a good speaker system to do justice to it. The Porgy and Bess" is excellent; here is a big orchestra that knows how to count and so they sound perfectly at home with the music. I cringe when I hear an orchestra of hundreds playing something with a heavy handed drummer leading them on. All in all, a great recording!.
