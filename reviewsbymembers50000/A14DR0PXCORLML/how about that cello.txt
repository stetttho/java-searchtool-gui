 I agree totally with everyone else that this is one of those miracles in recordings. It leaves a perfect feeling at the end of what Germans call "Gemutlichkeit" a word with no English equivalent. The feeling of fulfillment, of contentment that comes from having participated in something perfect. The cello obligato at the start of the third movement is peerless. The dialogue with the piano throughout the movement is just spellbinding. There is nothing left to say.
