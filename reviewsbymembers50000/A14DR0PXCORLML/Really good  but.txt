 This release is very rich in what the English choir does so well namely clear intonation and blended ensemble. It's well recorded with a nice sense of reverberant church acoustics. I find it to be too long for one sitting; after awhile I felt like I had  polished off a huge serving of hot fudge brownie and ice cream. I have always been fond of English choirs but maybe I am sated on them for now. It happens. With forty tracks you should be able to have much moods from Choral Moods. The title is unfortunate, how about "Sunset Gems"?. Or "Trinity Triumphs"?. But that's to cavil, the Mozart "Ave Verum" is properly reverent, the diction faultless.The Poulenc "Videntes Stellam" is worth the price of the set. Toss your "White Christmas" back in the box and play this instead, it's very beautiful music for reflection at any time.
