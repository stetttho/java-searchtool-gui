 I can only agree with the other reviewers; this music is sublime, the second movement is breathtaking. When I contemplate my own mortality I hope the last music in my mind is that slow movement or else the slow movement from Bachs concerto for two violins. No adjective could be wasted in trying to capture, in words, this music. But I think it's wasted effort nonetheless; there are no such words in any language. Surely a composer must have an angel sitting on his shoulder when he comes up with music like this. After a few listenings you may find one sitting on yours.
