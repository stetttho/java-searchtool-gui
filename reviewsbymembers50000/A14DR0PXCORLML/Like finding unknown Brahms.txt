 Your reviewer is right, if you like Brahms you'll likely enjoy this release. The simplest way I can put it is that this is like Brahms only muscular. I selected it because I was curious, for one thing I'm really impressed by what Jarvi chooses to record. On Chandos he has explored really unfamiliar music which is rare in the business. His orchestras are large ensembles that are unusally tight and incisive. His Chandos release of symphony #5 by Shostakovich is astonishing and that same release has as filler, balllet music from "The Bolt" This piece is recorded and played so perfectly that I can't help but sit there smiling like a chessie cat almost as if I were somehow sharing in the skill of the musicians and was not just sittling there. The Fibich has some equally stunning moments, and just as involving. I'm getting so I buy Neeme Jarvi releases without needing to have heard them first; I trust the man; what a nice feeling.
