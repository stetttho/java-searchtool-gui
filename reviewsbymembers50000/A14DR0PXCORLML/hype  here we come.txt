 I only have some of these individually but as soon as I'm done with this I'm going to check for used sets. This fantastic project from days gone by just fascinates me, all the work is mind boggling but the ones I have are so utterly gorgeous in sound, in performance, in engineering as to qualify for the "legendary" label we see so much of. Make no mistake, this set is the stuff of legends. I can't say that the early Haydn symphonies were the equal of the later ones but, my God, they are still great to have like this, and lead you on to the later opuses educated by Dorati. I have never felt that I could afford the whole thing but after recently getting a copy of the  'Oxford" among others, I think I gotta get it all!!!. I regret I didn't listen to H.C. Robbins Landon back in the seventies.
