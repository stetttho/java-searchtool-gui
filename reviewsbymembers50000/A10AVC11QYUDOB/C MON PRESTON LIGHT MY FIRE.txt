 I HAVE READ ALL THE MONTAUK BOOKS (THERE WILL BE MORE) AND THIS WAS THE LAST. THE MONTAUK STORY COULD WELL BE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT, PROFOUND STORYS EVER. I MYSELF AM A ROCKER AND NEEDLESS TO SAY I WAS BLOWN AWAY. PRESTON DOES IT AGAIN. JUST WHEN YOU THINK YOU KNOW THE GUY HE BLOWS THAT IDEA OUT OF THE WATER. ALL THOSE WHO THINK THE REPTILIAN IDEA IS A LAUGH NEED TO TAKE A DEEP BREATH, HERE WE HAVE A GENIUS OF UNFATHOMABLE EXPERIENCE TALKING ABOUT OUR SCALY FRIENDS. THEY ARE HERE MY BROTHERS, PRESTON KNOWS ALL ABOUT THE SHAPE-SHIFTERS ETC. HELL, THE GUY HAS BEEN TO THE PLEIADES. IF ONLY HE COULD TELL US ALL THE DIRTY DETAILS OF CELEBRITYS, THE BOOK WOULD HAVE MADE THE TABLOIDS LOOK LIKE KINDERGARTEN.
