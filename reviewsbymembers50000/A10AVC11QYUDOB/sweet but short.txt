 If this "book"(it has no hard cover at all) was longer it would have got five stars.I read $250(Australian) worth of commander X in one week. Reality of the... is only a about 70 pages long and the price itself is a conspiracy,never the less,GET IT! Ive read hundreds of books about UFO's and ALIENS,I own countless of video's with amazing footage(like that UFO being shot at from Australia, the footage was taken during a live Nasa transmission, after that incident no more live footage was allowed.)The impications of such footage is that STAR WARS is up and running,where firing at alien space vehicle and the people(us good folk)are none the wiser!! Then I received some commander X and David Icke and to my horror i knew, this has some truth dudes. At first i would have laughed at the idea that we share this planet with a reptilian species who has infiltrated our great countrys and are seeking to keep us slaves of a lie.I went back to my study after reading this and was amazed at all the quotes I found:ROBERT O DEAN "there's a reptilian species who have a vertical pupil" JOHN LEAR "they're eating us" PHIL SCHNIEDER(spelling may be wrong)said some amazing things and I for one believe the guy.I want anyone who has not read Phil Schnieder's last words to go to a search engine, type in this brave souls name and hold on. Amongst many things he said that these reptilians have satanic rituals and sacrifices in wich they bring in little kids, shape shift in front of them and get them so scared that "adrenlin chrome" biulds in their blood, when at the right level they kill the kids and drink their blood. I didnt believe this at first but it all leads to the "horrible truth". Finally I turned to the greatest book on earth...THE BIBLE.Now I know who and what the serpent is(SATANS little helpers) Please people what do YOU reckon it means in Genesis when it says "NOW THE SERPENT WAS MORE CUNNING THAN ANY BEAST OF THE FIELD" Its saying these barstards are really smart. We must open our minds people "truth is stranger than fiction". I will finish with a quote from this shocking book- "BRANTON IS CONVINCED THAT THERE IS AN ANCIENT CONFLICT IN PROGRESS BETWEEN THE FORCES OF SPIRITUAL HARMONY AND THOSE OF MATERIAL CHAOS, AND THAT THE BATTLEGROUND IN THIS 'COSMIC CONFLICT' IS THE HUMAN MIND AND SOUL ITSELF. THE FORCES OF CHAOS USE DECEPTION AND OPPRESSION AS THEIR WEAPONS, WHEREAS THE FORCES OF LIGHT USE TRUTH AND MERCY." This is exactly what's happening,THE TIME HAS COME, look after each other people,love ya's!
