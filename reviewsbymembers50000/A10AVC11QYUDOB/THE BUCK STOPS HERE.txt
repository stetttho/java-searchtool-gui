 THIS BOOK IS PHENOMINAL,TRUELY AN AMAZING BOOK,TOP THREE BEST BOOKS ON THE SUBJECT.I DONT KNOW WHAT TO WRITE EXCEPT THAT STEWART SWERDLOW IS SOMETHING ELSE(HE IS A "21",DUNCAN CAMERON IS A "14" AND MOST OF US ARE "7") HIS STORY OF IMMANUEL(JESUS) IS EXTREMELY FASCINATING.IN THE BOOK "THE PLIEADIAN MISSION" YOU HAVE ALMOST THE EXACT SAME STORY,BILLY MEIER WAS TOLD THE TRUTH UNLIKE US HUMANS WHO NEED TO HEAR SECOND HAND FROM PAULY BOY AND OTHERS,I FIND IT REALLY HUMOROUS AND IM 99% SURE GOOD OLD JMMANUEL HAD THE LAST LAUGH AND LIVED TO A RIPE OLD AGE IN INDIA!!! I INTUITIVELY KNEW THAT SOMETHING HAD TO HAVE HAPPENED AROUND THE TIME OF CHRIST,I KNEW DAVID ICKE WAS OFF A BIT ON THE WHOLE JESUS THING,I JUST KNEW "SOMEONE MUST HAVE REALLY BEEN THERE AND INFLUENCED THIS PLANET IN SUCH A PROFOUND WAY."UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE NOT ALL GOT THE MESSAGE.I'D LIKE ICKE TO READ 'CELESTIAL TEACHINGS' AND TELL US WHAT HE RECKONS(TWO OF MY TOP THREE BOOKS LIST GO TO BIG DAVE) OH MY GOD WHAT ABOUT:THE DRACO EMPIRE ON ITS WAY!THE MOONS A SPACESHIP!FIRST HAND ACCOUNT OF WHAT TAKES PLACE AT THESE DISCRACEFUL CEREMONIES!FIRST HAND ACCOUNT OF REPTILIANS AND THIER SHAPE-SHIFTING PUPPETS!THE BEST RUNDOWN OF EARTHS HISTORY INCLUDING WHICH "ALIENS" WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR CERTAIN CULTURES AND RACES!ALL SORTS OF WIERD STUFF LIKE THE ORIGINS OF THE DOMESTICATED PIG,GALACTIC WAR STORIES AND MUCH,MUCH MORE!!! GOD I WISH PEOPLE COULD KNOW THIS.EVEN MY SCEPTICAL BROTHER SAID "ITS CRAZY,INSANE BUT IT JUST FITS." EITHER WAY WE ARE ALL IN FOR ONE HELL OF A RIDE,HOLD ON DUDES!
