 This 1978 British television production is one of the better English-language adapatations of Les Miserables.  Unfortunately, the DVD release is missing 30 minutes of footage.  Originally shown in two parts at a length of 150 minutes, the DVD edit has been chopped down to 120.  (The VHS tape edition plays complete.)  Had I known this disc was an incomplete version I would not have purchased it.  If you want to see the complete film --- and it's well worth it --- you'll need to buy the VHS tape.
