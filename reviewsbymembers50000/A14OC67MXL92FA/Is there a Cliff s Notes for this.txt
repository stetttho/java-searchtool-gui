 Bottom line, folks:  I started reading this over ten days ago, and I'd rather be writing this review than facing the chore of getting through 300 more pages of the book.  This is what Donald Rumsfeld might call "a long, hard slog."   It's not BAD.  It's just not... compelling.  Fitfully absorbing, perhaps; that is, the story heats up temporarily and then subsides into tedium.  I'm still holding out hope that the pace will pick up in those last 300 pages I can't bring myself to face yet... but Steverino seems to be going in so many different directions here it's hard to get excited about it. I absolutely loved the first four books in the Dark Tower series, particularly "Wizard and Glass", which I feel is one of King's finest works, a full-bodied fantasy novel remarkably free of some of Steverino's more irritating idiosyncracies.  So I looked forward eagerly to "Wolves of the Calla." I realize I'm being premature as I still haven't finished it.  But frankly, folks, I wish someone would just tell me what happens so I don't have to bother.  Anyone by chance have the Cliff's Notes for this book? A novel of this kind should demand your attention, and "Wolves of the Calla" never quite does that.  There are a couple of scenes where Roland makes a gesture with his finger signifying "Get on with it", and that's how I feel about much of this book.   Hard-core King fans will probably go easier on the Master than I do. I love some of his books and stories; others, less so.  But so far this is a story that just smolders and never catches fire.  A major disappointment.
