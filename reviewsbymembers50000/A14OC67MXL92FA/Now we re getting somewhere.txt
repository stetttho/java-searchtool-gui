 As someone who is watching the show for the first time, I've felt it's been in something of a slump ever since Victoria returned from 1795 and the Adam storyline began.  Robert Rodan did what he could with the Adam character but the Frankenstein plot bordered on the ridiculous at times.  This sequence was rescued primarily by the performance of Humbert Allen Astredo, one of the better actors to appear on the show, as Nicholas Blair.  Now things are picking up again, with the journey back to 1897 just around the corner and the surprisingly complex Quentin Collins plot.  I have mixed feelings about Don Briscoe, who plays Chris Jennings, and the less we see of Roger Davis the better... but the show is finally getting back to that "can't put it down" pace that keeps me watching three to six episodes at a sitting.    And it gets even better in the next set!
