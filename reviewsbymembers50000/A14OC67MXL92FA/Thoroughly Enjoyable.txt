 In spite of the sometimes insipid writing, I found this book difficult to put down.  From the first few pages I was engrossed in the story, and even before the heroine is whisked off to ancient Carnuntum I was staying up past my bedtime. From a literary standpoint this can hardly be compared to "I, Claudius"; but then, Robert Graves was one of the foremost English stylists of all time, and comparing anyone to him is somewhat like comparing them to Shakespeare or Tolstoy.  Turtledove and Tarr are nowhere near that territory, but they're not kidding you about that: stylistic shortcomings aside, the storytelling is solid, and this is one of the most believable, palpable reconstructions of ancient Rome that I've read.  At the end I found myself missing the characters and wanting to know more about them (at least, those in ancient Carnuntum). I'd have to rank this as one of the best books to carry Turtledove's byline.  Tarr's style blends well with Turtledove's vanilla prose and while this is still light reading, the writing is more solid than in the World War and Great War series.  A very entertaining and thought-provoking historical fantasy.
