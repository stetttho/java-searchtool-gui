 This is the third and longest installment in George R. R. Martin's mammoth fantasy epic, and it's as enjoyable and engrossing as the first two volumes.  Martin is a brilliant author, whose sparkling prose brings a scene vividly to life. This is the kind of book that gets you thinking about the characters as if they were real people.  Virtually every fantasy series claims to present a "fully realized imaginary world" but this is the only one that has done it for me, and that includes Tolkien.   There are some legitimate criticisms.  The torrent of names can become overwhelming at times, especially with the large number of minor characters and the way allegiances can change abruptly.  Arya Stark's wanderings become meanderings for a while, and some passages seem to have just a bit too much description.  Perhaps the narrative could have been trimmed a bit. However, my reaction to any confusion as to who's who is to go back and re-read the first two books.  It's going to be a long wait until the next volume! There's still a lot of story to be told here.  Although major changes occur in the lives of all major characters (and most of the minor ones), one can't help wishing the next installment were already on the shelves, so that we could continue with this marvelous story.  Still, if Martin had telescoped it down to one or two volumes it certainly wouldn't have the texture and richness that it does. There's real storytelling magic at work here.
