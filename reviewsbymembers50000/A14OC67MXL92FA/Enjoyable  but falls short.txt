 This novel is almost two stories in one.  A scientist invents a "Super-EEG" scanning device that clearly shows an electrical field leaving a human body after death.  This is quickly dubbed "the soulwave" and is widely accepted as proof of the existence of a soul and life after death.  Robert Sawyer delves into meaty philosophical questions... and then veers off into a tepid murder-thriller. Rather than explore the dramatic impact on society that we could expect from the discovery of the "soulwave", the scientist hero, Peter Hobson, decides to explore life after death by setting up a computer simulation of himself, with the biological sensations edited out.  He also creates a simulation of immortality (knowledge of death is edited out) and a control.  One of them becomes a killer, and Hobson ultimately has to race to the rescue to solve the mystery. It's all very briskly told and enjoyable, but I can't help wondering what a writer like Robert Silverberg would have done with the "soulwave" issue.  Sawyer raises the questions and then drops them in favor of the much less interesting artificial intelligence mystery. Some of the characterizations are believable, if not complex; the central character remains somewhat wooden.  On the plus side, Sawyer's fast-paced narrative and his willingness to raise hot-button moral issues make this a worthwhile read.  I'd recommend this, but I can't help wishing it had taken the initial premise further. The original title "Hobson's Choice" was better; but the publishers, rather than the author, are likely responsible for the change.
