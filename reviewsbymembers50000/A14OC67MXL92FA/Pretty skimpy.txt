 This booklet --- almost a pamphlet, really --- is so brief as to be almost useless.  There is far more detailed information about the pulp markets and Dent's career in Philip Jose Farmer's "Doc Savage an Apocalyptic Life".  Much of the text quotes from two sources:  Ron Goulart's "Cheap Thrills" and Will Murray's "The Secret Kenneth Robeson".  Ron Goulart is a pulp historian and award-winning SF author; Murray is a long time Doc Savage scholar and author of several Doc Savage books.    Since so much of the information in this booklet is drawn from these two sources, I think my money would have been better spent hunting down copies of the Goulart and Murray books, rather than spending my money on this one.  In any case, what you get is very skimpy --- 89 pages of very large print and very wide margins, plus a brief bibliography and index.  Hardly worth the price.
