 I watched the original Japanese film "Ringu" and watched "The Ring" later the same day.  I enjoyed "The Ring", but I doubt if I would have been as impressed if I had not seen "Ringu" first.  In the original, the story makes more sense.  The remake attempts to add more detail but winds up being more confusing in the end.   While I didn't find this one too scary, it really shook up my dog.  He reacts strongly to loud sub woofer noises (things blowing up usually upset him), and there must have been something in the audio on this one, because he refused to sit still.  I had to shut the movie off halfway through and take him for a walk before he would calm down.  His behavior scared me a lot more than anything in the movie. I strongly recommend seeing "Ringu".  It's more subtle and more interesting.
