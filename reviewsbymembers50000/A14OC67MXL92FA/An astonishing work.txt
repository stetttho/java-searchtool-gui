 In 40 years of reading, no book has had as much influence on me as Sexus, part one of Henry Miller's ribald, rambling autobiographical trilogy, based on his relationship with his wife June (here called Mara, then Mona).  The  events of the book center around his original meeting with Mara/Mona and  from there spiral outwards in many directions, gathering in a wide variety  of bizarre and loveable characters, and showcasing Miller's unparalleled  ear for language and gift for description. Yes, there is plenty of sex in  Sexus, more so in fact than in any other Miller work.  Yes, much of it can  be dismissed as misogynistic chest-beating.  The sexual passages are not  sensuous or romantic or even erotic; they are satirical and in most cases  hysterically funny.  While some readers will of course be put off by  graphic sex of any kind, those with flexible tastes are in for some good  laughs, as well as virtuoso displays of first rate writing  talent. "Dirty parts" aside, this vast ocean of a book tells a  powerful story that is compulsively readable throughout.  It is more  accessible than the "Tropics" pieces, which are more surrealist  and abstract; here Miller employs a much more straightforward  narrative. This is probably one of the four or five most important works  in English to be published in the 20th century (and is in many respects a  repudiation of 19th century literature). Highly recommended for anyone with  a halfway-open mind.
