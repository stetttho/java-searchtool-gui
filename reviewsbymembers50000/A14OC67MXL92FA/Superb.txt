 Everyone knows the Dead were a live experience, and that their studio albums are generally thought to be a pale reflection of their concert glory.  Well, I never saw the Dead live, but this first album struck a chord with me when I heard it back in 1967, and it's remained one of the most enduring albums to come out of San Francisco during that heady psychedelic era. Until this reissue was available, the only CD I'd heard was a pale-sounding 1989 release.  While adequate, it certainly wasn't up to modern standards, and was way overdue to be remastered. The new disc sounds incredibly good, particularly when you remember how long it's been since these recordings were made.  Not only do the original tracks sound fuller and richer, more alive, but there's some additional material that's actually worth the purchase price.  A lot of CD reissues have extra tracks that are mere filler, but these newly issued songs sound good enough to have merited inclusion on the original record.  I have some mixed feelings about the long live version of "Viola Lee Blues," which runs more than 22 minutes and is obviously an attempt to capture the famed Live Dead experience.  To me, it sounds like you really had to be there.  Either there are mistakes by the band, or it's poor editing, but it doesn't add up to a great jam.  (Compare it to Fleetwood Mac's live renditions of "Rattlesnake Shake" on the Boston Live discs and you'll see what I mean by a great jam.) Four of the tracks are extended; instead of fading out as in the original edits.  After listening to this record for the past 36 years it's a bit jarring, but the extra minute on "Goodbye Little School Girl" is worth listening to, as is the pyrotechnic close to "Cream Puff War." It's great to have one of my all-time favorite records brought up to date, sounding fresher and more powerful than ever.  Too bad I never caught one of their shows...
