 The first thing you should know is that this disc contains 15 selections from the two-disc tribute "Rattlesnake Guitar" which was released about six years ago and is still available.  The only difference is that the selections are presented here in Super Audio CD (SACD) format.  Contrary to the listing here, it is dual layer; that is, it will play on a conventional CD player. "Rattlesnake Guitar" is about as good as it gets.  If you already have that set, you don't need this one.  Had the advertisement here mentioned it, I wouldn't have purchased material I have --- the difference in audio between CD and SACD is not always worth the extra money.  (I could have looked more closely at the track listing, of course.)  (Also, the back cover of the disc clearly indicates that it's "adapted" from "Rattlesnake Guitar."  One of the risks of shopping on-line as opposed to looking at a disc in a store.) If you're at all a fan of Peter Green, or British Blues in general (Cream, John Mayall, early Jethro Tull, etc.)  by all means buy "Rattlesnake Guitar."  It's the best tribute album of any kind I've ever heard --- performances are almost uniformly excellent and complement the originals. The only reason for buying this SACD is if you absolutely have to have these tracks in Super Audio.  Even so, you're only getting half the album.
