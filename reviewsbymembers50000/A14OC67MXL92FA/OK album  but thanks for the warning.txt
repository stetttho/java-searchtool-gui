 I'm glad I read the reviews here before putting this disc into my computer.  I've dealt with copy protection schemes on VHS, DVD, and computer software, and I have yet to see one that doesn't cause major technical glitches, to say the least.  However, what I'm reading here is going way beyond that.  Hopefully the backlash on this will be strong enough so that Sony and the other manufacturers will back off on this sort of nonsense.  (For details, see other reviews.)  I doubt if Carlos Santana or any of his musicians are responsible for this.  I'd wager that the decision was made after the album was delivered and that Santana personally has no control over it.    As for the record... this is another attempt to recapture the magic of Santana's big comeback hit, "Supernatural", and like its predecessor, "Shaman", it falls short.  There are some interesting songs, but it lacks that Spanish feel that made the diverse offerings of "Supernatural" fit together.  It's smooth and mostly enjoyable music, but nothing special.  It's worthwhile for an old fogey like me, who grew up on Santana's earliest records, to get some exposure to newer performers, even if I'm only getting a taste.  "Supernatural" got me listening to Everlast, and I'm now a big fan.    Note: I have an old stand-alone CD copying deck and had no problems burning a copy of this disc.  Perhaps CD-ROMs are so widely used that this type of deck is no longer being manufactured, but in any case the copy protection scheme is clearly doing more harm than good.  Based on what I've read here, I wouldn't take the chance of installing this on your computer.  Fortunately the album is not that great, so you can pass it up without missing too much.
