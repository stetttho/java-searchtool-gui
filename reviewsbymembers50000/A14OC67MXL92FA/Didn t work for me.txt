 This picture has everything going for it:  spectacular, atmospheric photography; stunning set pieces, striking characterizations, gritty performances and yet, there's some vital ingredient missing, something that keeps it from coming to life.  It's always interesting, but never really absorbing.  Watching this film, I could easily have turned it off and picked up a book at any time.  There was never a moment at which I was compelled to keep watching.  Sure, I could look at the lighting and the camera angles and think, Wow!  Thats a great camera angle!  But where's the story? I realize the film's many fans (including most critics) who revere this classic will be howling for my blood.  Sorry, folks; this one just didn't grab me.  Maybe it was the mood I was in.  I guess I was hoping for something with a dash of James Ellroy, a soupcon of Chinatown, or James M. Cain.  I love noir, I love stories of police corruption, and theres the beginnings of one in Touch of Evil, but we never get to know enough about Welles's cop; he's simply not on screen enough.   It's a shame Universal didn't include the original version; it would be interesting to compare it with this "restored" cut to see if it had a bit more zip.  Perhaps this was true to what Welles wanted, but it dragged.
