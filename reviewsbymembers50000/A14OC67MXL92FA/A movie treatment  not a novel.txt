 Omerta reads more like a synopsis than a fully realized novel.  As always, Puzo creates fascinating characters, but this story is so brief that few of these characters have the opportunity to come to life.  This book is really a movie treatment, and I won't be surprised if the movie is more enjoyable than the book, which is redeemed only by Puzo's gift for description and his talent for delightfully cynical aphorisms.   We'll never know if Puzo intended to do more with this story.  It would be easy to believe that Omerta was a first draft and that if Puzo's health had been better he might have breathed more life into it.  As it stands, it's a predictable, fairly bland story, with familiar plot elements that fans of Puzo's earlier Mafia works are accustomed to.   It's become more difficult to believe in Puzo's mythological wiseguys, after films like "Goodfellas", "Donnie Brasco" and the TV series "The Sopranos" have given us a more realistic view of what these people are like.  Puzo himself expressed contempt for his own myth, saying of the Godfather, "I made it all up", and "I wrote it to make money."  This lack of respect for his own material was evident in The Godfather and even more so in The Last Don; however Puzo's talent for character development and ear for dialogue made these novels compelling in spite of their pulp origins. However, Omerta didn't have enough substance in it to hold my interest.  I enjoyed bits and pieces of it, but I expect the movie will be more fun.
