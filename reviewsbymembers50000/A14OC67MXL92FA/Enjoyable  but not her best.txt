 "Grasshopper" may not be one of Barbara Vine's best novels (and I have read all of them), but I just got over the flu, and spent the last two days riveted to this book.  I kept intending to go back to bed and sleep, but couldn't put this down.  So much for it being boring. Still, I could say the same about virtually any of Rendell/Vine's work.  "Grasshopper" features rich characterizations and a fine narrative that carries the story rattling forward.  Where it falls short of her earlier achievements is in the plot, which is contrived in places.  Elements from previous works ("A Fatal Inversion," "King Solomon's Carpet", and "The Tree of Hands") are recycled here, less effectively than in the earlier works.  Rendell always drops subtle hints about what is to come and makes extensive use of foreshadowing, but here the payoff is less than what her readers have come to expect.  Usually she succeeds in delivering at least one jaw-dropping surprise per book, and puts in a vicious twist of the knife at the end.  Unfortunately, she does not do that in "Grasshopper." In spite of these shortcomings, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  The central character in particular is believable and appealing, and as always the narrative is peppered with Rendell's keen observations of human behavior.  I would recommend this book for those familiar with her work; however for those who are not, "A Fatal Inversion" or "A Dark-Adapted Eye" are better places to start.  (For a very fast read, try "The Tree of Hands", or "Going Wrong.")
