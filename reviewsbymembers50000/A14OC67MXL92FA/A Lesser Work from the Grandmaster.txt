 Jack Vance is now almost 80 years old, and has been writing and publishing  fiction for 55 years.  (His first story was published in 1945).  So it's  hardly surprising that this routine space adventure story, while still rich  with the inimitable Vance prose and dialogue, is somewhat languid and  plotless.  The premise is appealing enough, with the standard Vance hero  journeying from one exotic locale to another.  Unfortunately, this is  territory that Vance has explored many times, and it isn't long before the  plot runs out of steam, and trails off without any resolution.  I'm hoping  that Vance's health will allow him to write a sequel that will tie up the  loose ends; but Vance has a history of losing interest in some of his  stories and either letting them go, or tying them up in a perfunctory  manner. Still, Vance is one of the four or five best writers of SF and  fantasy, and long time fans will enjoy this one for what it does have to  offer.  Those who are not familiar with Vance's work I would advise to try  the Planet of Adventure series or the Demon Princes novels, two of Vance's  most enjoyable works.
