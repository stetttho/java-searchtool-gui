 Most action/adventure films have plot holes.  "Escape from New York" has huge, gaping craters in its logic.  Why would New York City turn into the one prison for the entire country?  Wouldn't you need more than one? Part of the plot hinges on Brain (Harry Dean Stanton) having a map that shows where the mines are on the 69th street bridge.  He got it from a guy who made it all the way across... before he was shot.  So how did Brain get the map from him?  (Never mind how the guy got mine-finding equipment in the first place.) And that's just for starters. Well, never mind about all that.  This film has a certain nutty charm of its own which has maintained its status as a cult film after almost 20 years.  While it lacks the slam-bang action sequences modern filmgoers have come to expect, and it never really explores the potential of the scenario it creates, Kurt Russell's star-making performance, the moody photography, and the delicious twist at the end, make this film worth watching.  I'm still enjoying it, after seeing it at least 20 times, if not more. The DVD is enhanced for widescreen TVs, and the video transfer is very good for a movie of this vintage.  The audio is not Dolby 5.1 but is first-rate for a 2.0 soundtrack, with a very strong rear-channel presence.   Other than a theatrical trailer, there are no extras.  This is a bit puzzling, since the last laserdisc and tape releases contained additional footage and a featurette with John Carpenter, including deleted scenes.  Let's not be too shocked if this gets re-released down the pike in a Special Edition. Hopefully, the sequel, Escape from L.A.  (which is more a remake than a sequel) will be re-issued in the 16x9 format, but I won't hold my breath.
