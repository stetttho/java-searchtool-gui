 TIME has long been increasingly superficial in its news coverage, and recent years have only accelerated this trend.  In the 60s and 70s, it was a somewhat serious magazine with a centrist bend (originally it was considered quite conservative), but as the years go by it's degenerated into more and more pop-culture fluff with little substance.  As for its being part of the "liberal" media, this is inaccurate.  Recent coverage of the (2004) election has attempted to reduce the Democratic candidate to the status of a non-person.  The first debate between John Kerry and George W. Bush was not even covered, except for one very brief article listing a few "fact check" points.  Instead, the cover story wa about new products and movies, a kind of Sharper Image catalog Lite.  TIME also gave no coverage whatsoever to the election in Afghanistan.  It was mentioned in passing in another article about the U.S. election, but I would imagine that conservatives would object to the magazine's ignoring a signficant world event that George W. Bush has pointed to as one of his accomplishments in office.  In my view neither candidate received adequate and fair treatment.  The bias seems to be in favor of Mr. Bush, but it's still mostly bland and superficial.  Your money is better spent on the British magazine "The Economist" which is far more substantive.  While its editorial viewpoint is conservative, it's sound fiscal conservatism rather than the tent-revivalism that currently substitutes for conservatism in U.S. politics.  "The Economist" also provides a liberal viewpoint and is the closest I've found to a (dare I say it) fair-and-balanced approach to the news.  TIME can still be entertaining to read, but I wouldn't take what they say too seriously.  They tend to bend with the political wind.
