 Uneven attempt to adapt James Ellroy's first novel.  Features an excellent cast --- William Sasso's portrayal of Fat Dog Baker is worth the price of admission --- but Michael Rooker in the starring role seems badly miscast for an Ellroy-style "hero."  Brown's relationships with Jane Baker and Walter are never developed; these characters appear only briefly so it's difficult to feel much emotional resonance (in the novel these relationships are crucial to Brown's motivations and why he acts as he does).  A worthwhile entertainment for hard-core mystery fans, but it does make one yearn for the depth and complexity of the novel.   Nothing special about the DVD.  The audio is two-channel Dolby and the transfer is letterboxed but not enhanced for 16x9 TVs.  Extra features are limited to a trailer and cast and crew bios, although there is an audio commentary by the director.
