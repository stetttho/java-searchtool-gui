 I've seen "Midnight Express" several times since it opened its first theatrical run.  When I saw it in the theater I was so caught up in the story that I didn't pay too much attention to its bargain-basement racism.  Today, it's so heavy handed and obvious I'm amazed I could have missed it. This story of a young American caught smuggling Hashish out of Istanbul goes out of its way to depict Turkey as a brutal, corrupt country, full of "furriners."  Oliver Stone's script is embarrassing in places, particularly when Billy Hayes gives his big speech in court, calling Turkey "a nation of pigs."  Talk about begging the question!  I would be surprised if anyone of Turkish descent were not deeply offended by this. As long as you don't take it too seriously, Midnight Express can be an enjoyable non-think action movie.  John Hurt and Randy Quaid contribute superb performances, and Paul Smith does a convincing job of portraying the sadistic prison warden.  (It's a safe bet that no actual Turks were used in the making of this film, which was shot in Malta.)  Giorgio Moroder's disco soundtrack has dated badly, but is still catchy. The DVD features an anamorphic transfer (enhanced for 16x9 TVs)with an excellent picture.  The soundtrack, unfortunately, is Dolby 2.0 and does not seem to have been remastered; much of the music sounds tinny and thin.
