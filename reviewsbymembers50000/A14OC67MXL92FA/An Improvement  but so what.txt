 The idea of remaking a hokey 70s relict like "Battlestar Galactica" seems pointless.  The original, meant to cash in on the success of "Star Wars", was "The Partridge Family" in outer space, with cardboard characters and nonsensical plots that pretty much scraped out the bottom of the barrel.  Apparently enough people liked the show enough to make the effort of bringing it up to date and using the basis of the original concept to make a more thoughtful and serious production.  After watching most of this miniseries, all I can say is, "Nice try."  Sure, there are some good actors, and it's all been re-thought in more intelligent way, but it's still not much more worthwhile than "Buck Rogers" with Gil Gerard (which at least featured Erin Gray).  By-the-numbers plotting and leaden acting combine for a very long haul (I bailed after 2+ hours).  My SF fan friends have all been telling me this is a good series.  Well, maybe it gets better after this, but I'm not impressed.  Fortunately I rented this rather than purchasing it.
