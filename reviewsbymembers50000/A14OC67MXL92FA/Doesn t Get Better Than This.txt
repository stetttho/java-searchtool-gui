 In 1970, shortly before they were banned from performing in the U.S., the Doors recorded several concerts in their entirety.  Selections taken from these shows surfaced on the 2-disc LP "Absolutely Live", and later on the CD compilation "The Doors in Concert", which also included songs from other tours.    As is so often the case with the cut & paste jobs put together by the record companies (as with the official Stones live releases) you just don't get the impact of the entire show, and the best performances are left out.    At long last, the Doors have issued the entire concerts, including audience response and chit-chat between songs, on their specialty label, Bright Midnight.  This one, recorded in Detroit, is the best of the bunch, and if you've only listened to the older releases, this will knock your socks off.  "Light My Fire" is blistering (that's the only word for it) and the band has never sounded better.  This isn't a disc for the casual fan; if you want the greatest hits then the Legacy compilation is for you.  But if you want to see, hear, feel, and taste just how good the Doors could be in concert, you need this CD in your collection.  ...and if you ever thought the Doors weren't all they were cracked up to be --- listening to this will change your mind.
