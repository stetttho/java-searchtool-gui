 "Disraeli Gears" is one of the best rock albums.  However, this two-disc "expanded edition" offers very little in the way of previously unreleased material.  What's on it?  First, naturally, is the original album.  Disc one is filled out with a take of "Lawdy Mama" (previously issued on "Live Cream" and the "Those Were the Days" boxed set); a previously unreleased take of "Blue Condition" with Clapton singing lead, and five demo songs, all of which appear on the box set.  Disc Two features the mono version of the original album, along with mono versions of "Lawdy Mama" and the alternate version of "Blue Condition", and adds nine selections from the BBC Recordings (in mono), all of which appear on the "BBC Sessions" disc.  If you own the box set and the "BBC Sessions", all you'll get by purchasing this edition is the mono mix of "Disraeli Gears", and mono and stereo versions of the alternate "Blue Condition."  Oh, and you get a nice booklet along with some snazzy new photos.  Hard-core fans probably have the previously issued material, making this a rather pricey investment.  Casual fans will be satisfied with the far less spendy original album.    OK, so I bought it.  Yes, I'm one of those hard-core Cream fans who has to have every note they played.  I'm actually interested in listening to the mono mix.  But most people don't need to go that far.  The most recent remaster of the single-disc original is all you really need.
