 This new mix of Bowie's legendary "farewell" concert in 1973 is in every way an improvement on the Rykodisc release. I originally owned the album on a two-record vinyl LP set, and for the first time, it sounds like a concert rather than a live recording. The balance between the ambient noise of the crowd and the performance is much more realistic, the bass and piano have more punch, the guitar is jackhammer solid, and Bowie's vocals sound better than ever. In contrast to previous audio releases on vinyl and CD, this contains the soundtrack as presented in the film.  The original 2-disc vinyl release, and subsequent CD reissues, not only have a mix that's markedly different from what you hear in the movie, but some of the performances are different.  For example: In the older issues, on "Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud" Bowie hits a spectacular high note on the last word ("free") and holds it for several seconds as the band segues into "All the Young Dudes". It's a spine tingling moment, one of the high points of the recording... but it's not here --- and it's not in the movie. Bowie sings an ordinary low note at the transition.  I saw the movie in a theater and again on VHS and laserdisc, and recently watched the new DVD release.  I'd forgotten how strong these differences were!  Some of them can be attributed to the difference in the mix, but others must have been taken from a previous performance. This new mix is a dramatic improvement in every way; but I'm going to hang on to my old Ryko CD; I miss that high note.  It really makes a difference!
