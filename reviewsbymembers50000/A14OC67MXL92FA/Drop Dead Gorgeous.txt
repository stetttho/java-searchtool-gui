 I admit I was disappointed when this CD came out.  Since Peter Green had returned to performing and recording in 1996, I was hoping for new songs from him.  A whole album of Robert Johnson covers?  Why? After listening to this, however, I began to appreciate it more and more.  Nigel Watson and Peter Green manage to be respectful without being overly reverent, well aware that they're updating Johnson's classic songs for contemporary audiences.  (It's worth noting that the only Peter Green compositions to appear on any Splinter Group CD are re-arrangements of ... old Peter Green songs.)  Peter's voice is getting pretty creaky, but on this record it's warm and husky, just hoarse enough to give you the feeling of someone who's lived the blues.  The piano and rhythm work are excellent, as are Nigel Watson's singing.  And a special word for the Street Angels backup singers, whose performance on some tracks gives them a gospel feel that's entirely appropriate to the material. There's no point in comparing this to Robert Johnson's originals.  However, you can compare it to Eric Clapton's new release, by contrast a rather dry, lifeless exercise that goes in one ear and out the other.  If you're a Clapton fan, you can string me up and call for the executioner, but first... listen to this CD.  It's a must for any blues fan. (And don't forget to buy "Hot Foot Powder", the follow-up album with more delicious blues!)
