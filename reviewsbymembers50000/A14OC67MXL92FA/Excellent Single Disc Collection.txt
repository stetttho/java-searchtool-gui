 The only disadvantage of the two-disc set of blues master Robert Johnson's complete recordings is that it includes all the alternate takes of his 29 songs.  For guitarists and serious fans, the Complete Recordings is the one  to buy.  However, this single-disc set includes 24 of the 29 tracks, and is  recommended for the more casual listener. Johnson did not compose many of  these tunes, but rewrote existing songs with his own lyrics.  These  recordings stand out for Johnson's spine-chilling vocals and trail-blazing  guitar work. If you have to have it all, and don't object to having  almost every song repeated, the 2-disc box set is for you.  However, if a  less expensive but thorough compilation of Robert Johnson will do, this is  the one to get.
