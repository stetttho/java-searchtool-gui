 For those who are only familiar with Philip K. Dick's writings, this collage of interviews is a good introduction to the bizarre and controversial events of the author's later life.  The film combines interview clips of Dick's friends with selections from tape recordings of PKD, shown with a cartoon figure of Phil miming the words.   For those who have read the Lawrence Sutin biography (Divine Invasions) or any of the extensive biographical material that has been published since Dick's death, there isn't much that's new in this film.  However, Robert Anton Wilson (author of the Illuminati Trilogy), Ray Nelson (SF author, best known for the story on which "They Live" is based) and Paul Williams, former Rolling Stone writer and literary executor of Dick's estate, are especially fascinating to listen to, and the material is compelling even though it may be familiar. For those interested in more details of Dick's life, the Lawrence Sutin biography is by far the best resource, but this film is an excellent place to start.
