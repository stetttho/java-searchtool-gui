 Here's something different: a Dracula movie with no vampires!  Based on the life and legends of Vlad Tepes, the Wallachian prince known as Vlad the Impaler, this film is a lavish historical spectacle with strong production values.  Unfortunately, the full-frame presentation robs the DVD transfer of some of the impact it might have had in widescreen.  As for the story, it falls just short of the kind of rousing dark epic the producers were aiming for.  The character of Dracula is almost sympathetic, and the film doesn't try to explain away his brutality with simplistic rationalizations, but the end result lacks real impact.  However it's worth watching for hard-core Dracula fans, and Roger Daltrey's portrayal of the King of Hungary is striking to say the least (I never would have guessed it was him!).  If you're looking for a real horror movie, this probably won't fit the bill for you, but the film makers deserve a few points for trying something off beat.
