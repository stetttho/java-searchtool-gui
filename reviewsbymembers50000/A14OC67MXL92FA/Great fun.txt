 I hadn't read Agatha Christie in some 30 years before I picked this up, inspired by watching DVDs of the fine "Poirot" TV series starring David Suchet.  Yes, Christie's story is formulaic and contrived, and not particularly believable.  This follows the same pattern you'll find in "Death on the Nile", "Evil Under the Sun," and many other popular titles.  A murder occurs among a group of people in a closed environment (here it's an archeological dig in Iraq).  One of the group must be the killer.  Of course Poirot figures it out, in time to give his usual long-winded presentation before the group, in which he delves into the entire history of all the participants before revealing the killer's identity with a grand flourish.  Yes, it's formulaic and contrived.  But what a great formula!    Christie's writing sparkles, and it's the clarity and energy of her prose that makes her stories so enjoyable.  Modern mysteries, such as those of Ruth Rendell and P. D. James, are much more sophisticated and realistic.  Christie is much more a light read.  But she's so much fun that it almost doesn't matter how much it stretches credulity.  Poirot is a constantly delightful and charming character, the setting is well described, and Christie's writing keeps the plot humming along nicely.  After finishing this one, I read "Murder at the Vicarage", even though I had just watched two TV productions of the story.  Although I knew "who dunnit", it was still a delightful read. These stories can be fun even if you know how they turn out.
