 After returning from obscurity with the 1977 hit Sleepwalker, The Kinks released this more-of-the-same follow-up in 1978.  While it may have been more successful commercially than its predecessor, overall it lacks the charm and wit that make Sleepwalker so enjoyable.  "Rock and Roll Fantasy", the hit single, is a strong piece, and the musical arrangements are flawless, but there's something of a negative attitude here, most notably in "Black Messiah", a bizarre screed, presumably a kind of "angry white male" rant against black supremacy movements.  As is so often true, it's hard to pin down exactly what Ray Davies is complaining about here, but there's an annoying quality to it.  However, it does have a bouncy reggae-ish groove.  The other tracks are pleasant enough but don't have the kind of emotional pull that you find on Sleepwalker.  The new 2004 SACD remaster is stunning.  The back cover is mislabeled, indicating a 5.1 surround sound mix; however, this is a stereo mix.  This series of reissues, which includes most of the Kinks albums from Muswell Hillbillies through Word of Mouth, all sound better than these recordings have ever sounded before, with clearer stereo separation, a soundstage that's almost palpable, rich bass tones and sharp, crisp highs.  (Note:  Everybody's in Show Biz and Low Budget have been issued in SACD hybrid by another label.)  Strongly recommended for hard-core Kinks fans.  The casual fan may want to choose the Come Dancing compilation of singles instead, which has most of the band's later hit singles.
