 I was fortunate enough to get a copy of this in the 1980s, at an affordable price.  It's worth searching out if you can afford it, and if you're a fan of the novel.  This screenplay was commissioned by a French film maker and is written by PKD; to my knowledge this is the only screenplay Philip K. Dick ever wrote.  As such it's probably not filmable, particularly for today's limited-attention audience, but it's as readable as any of Dick's prose, and a creditable effort for someone with no background in screenwriting.  In addition to follow his novel closely, Dick takes the opportunity to add some new twists to his original story, making it somewhat less ambiguous and more linear.    UBIK is still my favorite PKD novel, and I enjoyed this different version of Dick's vision.  If there is a movie in the works, it won't look anything like this.  A shame; while this might not be viable for a film, it would certainly be a good place to start.
