 Babylon 5 is unique among television series because it is a complete story with a beginning, middle, and an end.  Characters change, die, grow older, and the status quo is not automatically restored at the end of each  episode. The quality of the writing varies from first-rate to mediocre,  as one might expect from a series of 110 episodes.  The two episodes  featured here are not among the best but like almost all the installments  in the story contain important events and information that become  significant later on. The big question is, why has Warner Brothers  stopped releasing the series?  Seasons 1 and 5 were issued, followed by the  first half of Season 2 and the first six episodes of season 4.  Then they  stopped.   In Britain, the entire story has been available for some time,  along with the four movies (only one has been released in the  US). Hopefully this will situation will be corrected soon.  Otherwise,  those who follow the series up to this point will not be able to find out  what happens next, unless they watch the re-runs on TNT.
