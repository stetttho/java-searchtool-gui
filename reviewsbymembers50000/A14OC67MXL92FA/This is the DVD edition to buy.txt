 Please note that some of the reviews below refer to the two previous DVD releases, both of which are low-priced (one is the double-feature that also includes "Journey to the Center of the Sun").  Picture and sound quality on these other releases is poor; however the Image release, priced at around ..., features a new transfer that boasts a clear sharp picture through most of the movie and an improved soundtrack (on the cheap editions, the dialogue was frequently unintelligible).  If you are a fan of this movie, this is the DVD version you should buy. I agree with some reviewers that Wells's vision of the future is fascist in some respects.  The vaulting ambition of human PRO-gress depicted in this movie is inspiring to a degree, but is laid on pretty thick.  Viewed in the context in which it was made, this is a very enjoyable film, featuring some first-rate production design and visual effects, particularly for the time, along with a lantern-jawed performance by Raymond Massey that is stirring if not always believable.   This is a worthwhile film for all science fiction fans, in my opinion, and should be seen at least once.  If you're going to buy it on DVD, though, I recommend you spend the extra bucks and buy the IMAGE version.
