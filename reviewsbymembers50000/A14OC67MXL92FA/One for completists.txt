 Previously issued as three separate discs, this set covers Bowie's career through 1987.  This ignores the last 20 years, in which Bowie released eight albums.    If you're a casual fan, the 2-disc "Best of Bowie" is a better bet.  It includes all the hits and features selections from the later albums such as "Tin Machine", "Outside", and "Hours".  The four disc box set "Sound and Vision" covers the whole of Bowie's career (so far) but leaves off "Fame" and "Let's Dance", while including two or three rarities.    This leaves "The Platinum Collection" squarely in the middle. All the hits are here, although many of them are radio edits, which may be jarring if you're used to the full-length cuts.  (The edit on "Young Americans" is particularly weird, and to my knowledge has never appeared on CD before.)    For the completist, this set includes a handful of rarities, some of which are unavailable elsewhere ("John, I'm Only Dancing Again 1975," for example).    This may be an ideal one-stop solution for a casual fan, if you're not interested in the last 20 years.  However, the 2-disc "Best of Bowie" is still a better choice, because it's more comprehensive and the full-length edits are all there.
