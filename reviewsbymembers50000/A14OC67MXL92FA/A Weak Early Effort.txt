 This tale of a Hollywood film producer in the 1920s is one of Sanders's slightest novels, lacking the complex plotting and rich characterizations found in his later works.  This was a paperback original, originally published several years before Sanders became popular with hard-hitting detective fiction such as "The First Deadly Sin" and "The Anderson Tapes."  The story is enjoyable but never compelling.  Both fans of the frothy McNally books and Sanders's darker works such as the "Sins" books will most likely be disappointed.  True Sanders fans won't want to pass this up, but don't expect too much.
