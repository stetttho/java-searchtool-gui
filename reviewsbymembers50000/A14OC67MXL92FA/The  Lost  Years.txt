 Between the peaks of their major hits "Sunny Afternoon" (1966) and "Lola" (1970) the Kinks were recording great music, most of which went virtually unheard, particularly in the United States.  In 1966 the band was barred from performing in the U.S., and this situation wasn't rectified until 1970.  In addition, their sound became more distinctly British and less commercial, although "Dead End Street" and "Victoria" did get some airplay stateside.  This two-disc set contains these hits, album tracks from "Face to Face", "Something Else by the Kinks", "The Kinks are the Village Green Preservation Society", "Arthur," and the comeback "Lola vs. Powerman and the Money-go-round," along with a number of single-only tracks that until very recently were available nowhere else.  Of the "British Invasion" bands the Kinks are unique in that their sound is fundamentally English rather than American.  The Beatles were inspired by Elvis, Little Richard and Chuck Berry; the Rolling Stones drew their sound (and their name) from Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf.  Ray Davies' songs, with their focus on "simple people" and "ordinary lives", their nostalgia for the village green and small-town England, are rooted in the traditions of English music-hall pop and British folk music.    Most of the songs here are not in the hard-rock tradition of the early Kinks ("You Really Got Me", "Tired of Waiting for You",) or the later Kinks ("Low Budget", "Rock and Roll Fantasy") but have a softer touch.  The satirical trend evident in "A Well Respected Man" and "A Dedicated Follower of Fashion", which skewered contemporary English life, give way to longing for the village green and the old steam-powered trains.  Ray Davies's brilliant, catchy melodies and superb lyrics are something unique in music.  This set is the best way to get acquainted with the Kinks.  Once you get to know these songs you may want to buy all five albums, but you'll want the singles anyway.
