 Sometimes hokey, sometimes eerily effective, this adaptation of H. P. Lovecraft's "The Shadow Over Innsmouth" is directed by Stuart Gordon, who did the popular "Re-Animator" films.  If you're looking for a truly faithful adaptation of Lovecraft's work, you won't find it here.  For that, you should check out Lurker Films' "The Call of Cthulhu" and the three volumes of the H. P. Lovecraft Film Festival available on DVD (all can be ordered from Amazon).  "Dagon", like most commercial Lovecraft-based films, mixes a the basic story concepts of "Shadow" --- with a nod to the story of the title, "Dagon", and it's a reasonably entertaining film.    My major objection is that there are one or two scenes of truly stomach-turning gore that not only go way beyond what's needed to tell a story, but are at odds with the mood and atmosphere Gordon has established in the film.  Just as Lovecraft himself sometimes attempted to bury his readers in a torrent of adjectives and adverbs in an attempt to create overwhelming horror, Gordon goes way over the top and succeeds only in disgusting the audience rather than horrifying it.  Of course, if extreme gore is your thing, you won't object to these sequences, but to me it's just disgusting.  On the plus side, the eerie village is beautifully designed (with fairly good CGI), the story clips along at a good pace, and the ending is satisfying.  Certainly not a great piece of cinema, but Lovecraft fans should check it out.  Just be prepared for one really repulsive scene.  (I fast-forwarded through it.)
