 Hardly an adapatation of Bram Stoker's Dracula, this low budget Hammer film is a halfway decent vampire flick, considering the time it was made.  Christopher Lee is an ideal choice for Dracula; his dominant screen presence more than compensates for the slapdash plot.  Peter Cushing is perfect as this film's version of Van Helsing.   The film benefits from a brisk pace and its economical running time (1 hr 20 mins).  Unfortunately it drops much of what makes the opening sequences of Stoker's story so effective.  In this movie there is no midnight ride with the mad coachman (Harker makes the final journey to Castle Dracula on foot, and in broad daylight!).  Still, despite the Bela Lugosi version's greater fidelity to the story, this is a smoother film, without the leaden pacing that drags down the 1931 original. Perhaps someday Masterpiece Theatre will give Dracula the eight-hour miniseries treatment it needs... but we have yet to see a real adaptation of the novel.
