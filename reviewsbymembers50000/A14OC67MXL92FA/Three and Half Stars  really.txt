 There's an enormous amount of popular fiction being published today that's set in ancient Rome, and no one knows his Rome like John Maddox Roberts.  His SPQR mystery series is the classical equivalent of Lawrence Sanders's McNally novels --- light, humorous, but dramatically absorbing.  "Hannibal's Children" is something different.  Roberts's detailed knowledge of Roman culture, particularly its famed military science, is presented with a wealth of detail that occasionally overwhelms the story.  In the SPQR series, Roberts masterfully interweaves the historical information into the plot, but he is less successful here, perhaps because this is so clearly the first part of a series rather than a stand-alone novel.  It is less tightly plotted than the SPQR books, and is also less wry and cynical.  However, the reader does get taken on a tour of the ancient world, from Carthage to Egypt, with a battle scene that is interesting if not rousing.  (I usually find battle scenes boring, even the ones in "War and Peace", so it's not faint praise for me to call this "interesting.")  There could be more in the way of character development; the hero Marcus Scipio lacks definition.  I'm looking forward to the next book, although I will probably wait for the paperback.  Ideally, Roman fiction should inform as well as entertain; most of the books on the market today are strong on plot and romance but weaker on historical detail.  Roberts has a better grasp of the facts than anyone else I've read (except for Steven Saylor, who's about equal), so with tighter plotting and more character development he may have a masterpiece on his hands.  I suppose I could do without the submarines, though.  That seemed more like a gimmick than a genuine plot device ... but maybe Roberts has some surprises up his sleeve.
