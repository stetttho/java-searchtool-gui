 Science fiction movies, like the literature with which they have an uneasy relationship, have long suffered from stereotyping and cookie-cutter  plotting.  In the 50s, it was monster movies; in the 70s, it was "Star  Wars", "ET" and "Close Encounters"; warm and fuzzy  with lots of action.  More recently SF films such as "Demolition  Man" have become vehicles for action stars.  Real stories,  particularly thoughtful adaptations of great SF books, are extremely  rare.  This film, based on a superb novel by Walter Tevis (who also wrote  "The Hustler" and its sequel, "The Color of Money"), is  the story of an alien who comes to Earth to obtain water for his planet.   By introducing superior technology he amasses a large fortune and develops  a huge international corporation --- but develops addictions to both TV and  alcohol and struggles with the isolation of living on a world where he  doesn't belong.  Roeg's film is by no means as straightforward a narrative  as the novel it's based on, and is definitely not for all viewers.  There  are virtually no special effects, keeping the focus where it belongs --- on  the characters and story.  However, some may be put off by the film's  abstract approach; it does require several viewings to appreciate some of  the subtle details Roeg packs into it.  Like "Blade Runner",  this is a dense movie, although it doesn't have the visual flash.  David  Bowie's performance is astonishing (for the record, I was not a Bowie fan  when I first saw this movie).  Rip Torn, Buck Henry, and Candy Clark are  equally superb in supporting roles.  If you're looking for dazzling visual  effects and space battles, you won't find them here.  However, if you enjoy  great acting and a unique approach to storytelling, you'll find this movie  easily rewards multiple viewings --- and gets better each time you watch  it.
