 This made-for-cable movie is an honest attempt to boil down Jimi Hendrix's life and music down to less than two hours.  Unfortunately the producers were unable to obtain the rights to any of Jimi's songs, so the musical score is entirely made of up his covers (Hey Joe, All Along the Watchtower, Wild Thing, etc.) plus some unattributed jamming.  You get the typical 60s montages (JFK, Malcom X, the Beatles, Dylan, etc.) along with the cookie-cutter dialogue and vastly oversimplified story. Despite some good performances, the script doesn't really offer the scope to examine why Hendrix's music was so revolutionary, or the problems that led to his early death.   There's not much fire here, either, as the film suffers from wooden pacing and is never especially absorbing. The documentary film "Jimi Hendrix", also available on DVD, is a far better way to gain an appreciation of this artist.
