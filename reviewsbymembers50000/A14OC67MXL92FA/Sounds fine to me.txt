 Maybe I've got a tin ear.  Or maybe I've got low end equipment.  Or maybe I just don't know my posterior from a hole in the ground.  But this new remaster sounds fine to me. I had no idea there were so many people who were unhappy with the sound, but after reading all the negative reviews I thought, maybe I wasn't paying attention.  So I listened to both the CD layer and the SACD layer.  Loud. It sounds great!  The bass is rich and fat, the harmonica crisp and brilliant.  I've been listening to this album for 37 years; to be fair, this recording has some odd characteristics to the sound (particularly the drums).  This new remaster certainly doesn't sound worse than the vinyl, and while it may not provide the blow-your-socks off sonic experience of the Highway 61 remaster, I can't detect any problems.  Both layers are an improvement over the original CD release. If you're a true audiophile, maybe it would be a good idea to find a store where you can listen to the disc before buying it.  If you own the original CD, there's no urgent need to rush out and buy the hybrid.  But if for some reason you find yourself without a copy of one of the great masterpieces of popular music, this edition should do nicely.
