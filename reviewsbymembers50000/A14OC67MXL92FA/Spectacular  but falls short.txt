 This new version of the ancient story of Jason's quest for the golden fleece appears to have everything going for it: spectacular production design, gorgeous set decoration and costumes, and a cast of first rate actors, including Frank Langella, Adrian Lester, Derek Jacobi, Dennis Hopper, and many others. Unfortunately, Jason London is cast in the title role, and appears to have absolutely no acting ability whatsoever.  He delivers his lines in a lifeless monotone, and his closet approximation to real emotion could be charitably called "looking Concerned."  True, he is hampered by a tepid script, but it's interesting to note how almost every other performer manages to inject some note of drama into his/her performance, whereas Our Hero wanders about like a zombie in a daze.  You wonder why anyone would get on a boat with this guy, and when he does perform a heroic feat, it's hard to believe that he would be capable of such acts of valor.   Ultimately, in spite of impressive visuals and some very enjoyable performances by the supporting players, London's listless, zombie-like trance drags the production down, and this rather long movie (close to 3 hours) is flat and uninvolving.  (I got through the first two hours; long enough to see the Golden Fleece recovered.  I decided to pass on the voyage home --- another 45 minutes.)
