 I bought the DVD the moment it came out, but I still haven't watched all the episodes.  Although earlier shows such as "Twilight Zone" and "The Outer Limits" still hold up for me, Night Gallery does not.  The pilot episode is the strongest, but it goes downhill from there.  The themes that had been thoroughly worked over in Twilight Zone are rehashed with the heavy hand of a tired Rod Serling, hands tied by a paltry budget and a network that didn't really want the show to succeed.  There are a few good moments, but Serling himself was very unhappy with the results (according to Marc S. Zicree's "Twilight Zone Companion").  It's not hard to see why.  Even a highly praised episode like "Tearing Down Riley's Bar" is heavy-handed and overly theatrical.  The DVD quality is mediocre.  The picture is flat and lifeless, the audio equally one-dimensional, and there are no extras to speak of.  I may not love the show as I did back in the day, but it deserves to be presented in the best possible format, and assessed on its own merits.  Fans of the show will strongly disagree with me about the quality of the stories; but I think everyone's disappointed with the DVD.    At least they finally did Twilight Zone right.  That's some consolation...
