 By-the-numbers thriller wastes Ashley Judd as a woman framed for her husband's murder, and Tommy Lee Jones as a crusty-old-salt parole officer who chases her across the country.  Laughable claptrap throws credibility  out the window after the first 10 minutes: Judd is tried and convicted in  no time at all; her son hasn't aged by the time of the trial.  In reality  it would take at least two years before a trial was held.  Also, the  scriptwriters aren't aware that Washington State abolished the parole  system about ten years ago. It gets sillier by the minute, with car crash  chase scenes reminiscent of the Blues Brothers.  Of course all is well at  the end, but you knew that, right? Not a bad rental if you're in the mood  for some slickly photographed silliness, but otherwise a waste of time.
