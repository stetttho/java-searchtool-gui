 Disappointing adaptation of Lawrence Sanders' breakthrough bestseller squashes the story down to an under-two-hour format, leaching out the characterizations and offering only a few bare facts.  The result is a flat, tepid thriller without much suspense. In his final dramatic film role, Sinatra shows why he was so highly regarded as a screen performer.  Despite a poor script and limp direction, his charisma is sufficient to make this watchable.  He conveys genuine emotion and makes it possible for us to empathize with an underwritten character. Faye Dunaway, unfortunately, is limited to a few scenes, all of which take place in a hospital bed, as she plays Sinatra's dying wife.  In the novel, Mrs. Delaney's scenes served as a poignant counterpoint to his search for the killer.  He discusses the case with her, sharing all the details, and Sanders paints a powerful portrait of a cop who defeats the killer, but it powerless against the disease that is killing his wife.  In the movie this does not come off at all, and viewers not familiar with the book may wonder why these scenes were included. The DVD is a bare bones, full-screen transfer, with no extras.   Sinatra fans may enjoy this film, but I'd recommend reading Sanders' novel instead if you're looking for a gripping hunt-for-the-killer mystery.
