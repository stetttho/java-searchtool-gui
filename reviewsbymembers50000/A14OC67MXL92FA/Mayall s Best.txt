 This remarkable album featured something new in blues-rock music. Mayall formed a band with no drums and no electric lead guitar, relying on the bass of Steven Thompson to keep the rhythm, and substituting acoustic "finger-style" guitar in place of the blistering electric licks that had been a prominent feature of Mayall's style. The format was not new to Mayall; the liner notes to the "Room to Move" compilation state that he got the idea from another, less well-known band. Regardless, Mayall's sound on Turning Point was unique; the use of woodwinds and acoustic guitar, combined with Mayall's harmonica, flirted around the outermost fringes of jazz, and the live tracks presented here are smooth and flowing, reaching a peak in the magnificent "California" which became a staple of FM radio for a time. "Room to Move" was the closest Mayall would ever come to a bona fide hit in the U.S. Unfortunately, this was a turning point for John Mayall, commercially and artistically. Shortly after this release, blues went out of fashion, and the quality of Mayall's work plummeted. The no-drums format became increasingly difficult to work with in large, noisy concert halls and was eventually scrapped.  Mayall has returned to produce fine work in the 1980s and 1990s; his most recent release, "Stories", is one of his best; and he released first-rate albums such as "Chicago Line" and "A sense of Place" in the 80s. At close to 70, he is still recording and performing new work, but "The Turning Point" remains the high watermark of his career. This is one of the great albums of the 1960s, and one not to be missed. This version has three "extra" tracks, and I'm happy to say that they're excellent and well worth the price of the disc, even if you own a copy of the original CD.  I wish there was more of this stuff!
