 I have no idea how many Doors "greatest hits" collections have been issued over the years, but this is as good as it's likely to get without simply buying all six albums.    The previous "Best of the Doors" was 2-cd set but was a transfer from a two-LP set and didn't take advantage of the longer CD running time, each disc running under 45 mins.  This set not only includes all the Doors' most popular songs but puts them in chronological order, and adds the live track "Gloria" and the previously unissued studio version of "The Celebration of the Lizard."  "Lizard" is a curio item that seems to have been tacked on to force people like me (who already own all the Doors albums) to buy this one too.  While "Lizard" is a great poem, the line about "a different steeple" being a notable exception, most of the music doesn't work that well, except for "Not to Touch the Earth."  The live versions of "Lizard" are equally frustrating, running hot and cold but never having quite the impact the Doors were shooting for.  This is clearly still a work in progress; perhaps if the Doors had continued to perform it they would have found a solid groove for it.  (Ray Manzarek has said that he was never competely satisfied with live performances of "The End", either; but at least they nailed the studio version.)  IMPORTANT:  Both "The End" and "Break on Through" include minor alterations from their original versions.  There is some different vocalization by Jim on both songs, some of which you hear on the version of "The End" that was used in the film "Apocalypse Now."  There's nothing inherently wrong with offering these alternative mixes but it does detract from the collection's claim to be definitive.
