 This engrossing history of the Los Angeles Police Department is well worth reading, not only as a study of what is good and bad about the development of modern American police methods, but as a detailed view of the history of Los Angeles.  This is one non-fiction book that is hard to put down.  A great read! My impression, contrary to some of the reviews posted here, is that Joe Domanick has focused on the facts and is not pursuing a political agenda.  Much of what he says has been proven by recent events and makes sense in the light of the Rodney King case and its aftermath, as well as the O.J. case.  His criticism is focused on the leadership and structure of the LAPD, rather than on characterizing individual officers as inherently bad.  Ignore the right-wing screeds and give this book a try.
