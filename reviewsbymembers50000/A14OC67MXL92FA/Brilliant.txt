 It's easy to underestimate Barrington Bayley at first glance.  His prose is a straightforward pulp style, without literary pretensions or stylistic experiments.  No SF writer, however, is better at launching you into a weird universe within a few sentences and weaving a torrent of madcap ideas into full-throttle, action-packed plots.  If you like the writing of Philip K. Dick, Alfred Bester, or Robert Sheckley, you're almost certain to be a Bayley fan, and this collection of superb stories is a good place to start.  Bayley's work combines the social concerns of Dick, Bester, Sheckley, and Frederik Pohl with some of the more philosophical issues of "hard" SF writers such as Heinlein and Poul Anderson.  Pure entertainment brimming with thought-provoking ideas --- what more can you ask from a book of science fiction stories?
