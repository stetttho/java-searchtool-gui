 I was never a fan of this show, although I watched it occasionally back in the day.  I bought this set from sheer nostalgia, curious to see how the show has aged. My initial impression, after watching the first two episodes, is that TV has gotten a heck of a lot better in the last 30 years!  Sure we've got the reality shows and other mindless dreck, but we've also had inventive drama like "The Shield", "The Sopranos", "Hill Street Blues", and "NYPD Blue".  Compared to these more involving dramas, the cookie-cutter plots and formulaic caricatures of "Starsky and Hutch" are cartoonish.  Like "Charlie's Angels", (also produced by Spelling & Goldberg) this show was never meant to be taken seriously. Like most 70s shows, there's a certain dowdiness hanging over the proceedings.  It's not the tacky fashions and haircuts --- those are half the fun!  It's the overall flatness of the performances, the limpness of the editing, the lack of realism, and a certain plodding pace that contrasts wildly with modern-day "edge" shows such as "The Shield." Having said all that, there's nostalgic fun to be had here.  Almost every show I saw in the 70s had the same stylistic limitations.  Glaser and Soul are appealing, likeable leads; the sporty Gran Turino is a character in itself, the car chases are fun, the fashions and hairstyles are amusing, and of course Antonio Fargas, the blaxploitation character brought in to provide an ersatz "hip" factor, is perhaps the most talented actor on board (his subsequent career in films seems to have been more successful that Soul's or Glaser's).  If nothing else, "Huggy Bear's" unique facial features and remarkable nose are worth at least part of the admission price. This is a beautifully mastered DVD set, and should please fans of the series.  This is highly recommended for those who did enjoy the show in the 70s, but will probably seem tame and corny to anyone under the age of 35.
