 Quiet Days in Clichy was the first Henry Miller book I read, at the impressionable age of 17.  While traveling through Europe, I bought the Grove Press movie tie-in edition, featuring numerous stills from this picture.  I read the book several dozen times, and as a result the images from the movie formed part of my memory along with Miller's words. Now, more than 31 years later, the film is available at last, and I finally got to see those pictures come to life.   For me, watching this was a wonderful experience.  It was one of those rare films that transported me completely to another time and place.  For a brief 90+ minutes, I was my younger self again. The story hasn't changed, but I have.  I no longer find Miller's caustic sexism charming; in fact it seems childish to me.  The explicit sex in the movie (there are a few bits that could be considered hard-core porn) is no longer shocking, and the freewheeling lifestyle depicted is, I now understand, something that was, and is, almost wholly imaginary.   For all the sexist attitudes of the two male leads, the female characters are brilliantly portrayed.  Country Joe McDonald's brilliant music brings more surrealistic magic out of the picture, giving it not only a contemporary feel (the original story was set in the 1930s) but an atmosphere that helps it transcend the limitations of its low budget.   This is a faithful adaptation of Miller's book, which is good news for Miller's fans.  If graphic sex makes you at all uncomfortable, by all means avoid this film.  But if Miller's erotic work appeals to you at all, you owe it to yourself to give this one a chance.
