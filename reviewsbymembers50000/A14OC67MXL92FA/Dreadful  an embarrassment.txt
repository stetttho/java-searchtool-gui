 Simpering, moronic, confused attempt to jettison H. G. Wells's magnificent story (which has remained in print continuously for more than 105 years) and replace it with a nonsensical plot, almost nonexistent characterizations, and laughable dialogue.  (Yes, I really did burst out laughing when watching this movie in the theater.)   The 1960 George Pal film, with Rod Taylor, has always been criticized for reducing Wells's story to the comic book level.  While there is some justice in this accusation, this new movie makes the 1960 version look like a faithful, Masterpiece Theater style adaptation. Taken solely on its own merits, this is a weak film, without any intelligible motivation by the major characters, and is redeemed solely by a freakish imitation of Edgar Winter by Jeremy Irons, who single-handedly prevents the film from being a complete waste of time and money. Still, the is not the worst "adaptation" of The Time Machine; there was a made-for-TV movie shown in the 80s, starring John Beck.  No CGI in that one, folks; hadn't been invented yet ("Tron" was state of the art at the time). Fans of the book will almost universally be disappointed, but those who care only about flashy visuals and big noises will probably enjoy this half-hearted piece of dreck.  My advice: stick to the George Pal version until somebody with talent decides to adapt Time Machine for British TV and gets it right.
