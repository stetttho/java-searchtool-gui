 I'll be honest --- I sat through about 45 minutes of this documentary [...].  It's not that the photos aren't interesting; but I'd rather have them in a coffee table book so I could look at them at my leisure.  What I saw of this film is mostly zooming in and out of Barry Feinstein's photographs.  Not only is there no footage of Dylan performing, but there are almost no photos of Dylan performing, either.  In fact, Feinstein states that he was only interested in photographing Bob's personal side, and that if you want to see performances, you should go to a show.  So you see a lot of pictures of Bob talking to kids in the street in England, and so on.    Interviewing is an art, and the director who interviews Feinstein doesn't have the talent.  His style is leaden and ponderous and Feinstein seems a very dull interview subject.  A skilled interviewer might have drawn out more interesting stories, but Feinstein talks about himself and his views on photography and has very little to say about Bob Dylan.  This disc is for hard, hard-core Dylan fans only.  In my opinion, you're better off buying one of the numerous biographies or checking out "Don't Look Back" or several of the other videos that actually have musical performances.  A book of these photographs would be much more interesting [...].
