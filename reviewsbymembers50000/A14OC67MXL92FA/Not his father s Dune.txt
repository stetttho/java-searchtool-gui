 I actually enjoyed this fast-paced pulp novel, based on Frank Herbert's Dune.  There was just enough story here to keep me reading, in spite of the cardboard characters and juvenile writing.   Although this book is atrociously written --- painfully inept metaphors and similes, scant descriptions that fall flat, and an overall tone that hovers somewhere between Doc Savage and Superman comics of the mid-sixties --- Herbert's notes provide a strong basis for the plot, which is engrossing at a pulp-fiction level.  It's been more than 25 years since I read the original novel, so I wasn't bothered by the inconsistencies that would be apparent to a hard-core Dune fan.     It's a shame that a good editor didn't intervene and clean up all the unnecessary modifiers and given the text some polish.  Still, that hasn't stopped the book from selling, so it's not hard to guess why nobody at Bantam cared. Kevin J. Anderson has been nominated for Nebula awards and Bram Stoker awards.  Either his other books are infinitely better written than this one, or the Science Fiction Writers of America have drastically lowered their standards. If you're not a true-blue Dune fan, you may enjoy this as a light read with a few interesting ideas.  But be ready for some really, really bad prose.  These clowns make Michael Crichton look like Hemingway.  Even Jackie Collins's writing doesn't contain basic mistakes such as you'll find here.   Nevertheless, it's only fair to tell you that I'm more than halfway through the second volume, and having a good time (although wincing every so often).  Not only that, but it's whetted my appetite to go back to Frank Herbert's original books (which are stylistically sophisticated and far more imaginative); so Anderson and B. Herbert must be doing something right.
