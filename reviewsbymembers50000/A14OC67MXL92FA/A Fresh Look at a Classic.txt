 Listening to this DVD Audio was enough to make me shell out $5,000 for a SACD/DVD Audio player, new amp and speakers.  The Dolby 5.1 mix --- which is what you'll hear if you play this disc on a standard DVD video player with a Dolby Digital amp -- is a dazzling reinterpretation of this classic album.  Remixed by Bruce Botnick, who produced the original recording, this version uses the rear channels creatively, and isn't afraid to push the envelope, using panpot effects in a way that hasn't been heard since Jimi Hendrix was alive.  There are enough differences in the new mix so that you wouldn't want to set aside your copy of the original two track mix, but this really shows off the potential of multi-track digital recording.  Quadrophonic sound promised this back in the 1970s but could never settle on a standard, and the technology never lived up to the hype.  Now DVD-audio and SACD are here... and my credit card balance will never be the same! (Sigh) Buy this disc at your peril...
