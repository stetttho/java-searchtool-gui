 This has long been on my "want list" for DVD release, and finally, it's available.  Unfortunately, it's a cheaply produced edition, with a 4x3 letterbox transfer instead of the 16x9 anamorphic widescreen that is now the standard.  If you have a conventional TV, you won't notice the difference, but if you have a widescreen set, you have to use the "Zoom" mode and the picture is consequently grainier.  Overall, the picture is adequate to good, but way below the current standard.  The soundtrack is in Dolby 2.0, but this is to be expected for a film of this vintage, as Dolby 5.1 didn't become common until the 1990s.  So much for the DVD.  This is still a solid, satisfying action adventure film.  It's hardly the capstone of Richard Burton's distinguished career, but it's still a strong performance.  Burton, Richard Harris, and Roger Moore make a terrific team, and the supporting cast is uniformly excellent.  Stewart Granger is superb as the villain loathsome enough to make Darth Vader look like a choirboy.  If you're in the mood for meaty, combat-oriented adventure (with just a dab of social commentary), this is a film you'll enjoy.
