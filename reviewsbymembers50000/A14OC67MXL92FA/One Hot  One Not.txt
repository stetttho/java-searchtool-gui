 e-publisher Blackmask continues with its republication of the Doc Savage adventure series, following the chronology of the original pulp magazines from the 30s and 40s.  About twenty volumes have been printed so far; Blackmask plans to reissue all the tales.  This volume features the third and fourth Doc novels.  "Quest of the Spider" is a rather listless tale, without much of interest other than a few spectacular feats by Doc.  Most of the action takes place in New Orleans and the surrounding bayou, but there's nothing exotic in the action or the premise.  The Gray Spider is gaining control of lumber companies in the South.  Who is the Gray Spider?  That's about the only mystery in the story, and since there are only a couple of suspects, it's not much of a surprise.  It's still fun, but far below the standard of the first two stories.  "The Polar Treasure" is a solid adventure, with Doc following two competing gangs into the frozen north in search of a marooned ship with a valuable treasure.  On the way, he kills a polar bear with his bare hands and later rips steaks out of the bear (again, with his hands) for a quick snack.  There's enough of a mystery blended into the action to keep the story crackling, and the ending has some surprises for you.  Lester Dent, faced with the challenge of cranking out a 50,000 word manuscript each month --- in addition to the other writing he was doing --- again manages, mostly, to provide us with enjoyable, if sometimes silly, adventure fiction.
