 I read this book cover to cover when I was 17, something I felt to be an accomplishment.  There's a narrative (sometimes) and striking, vivid language that you won't find anywhere else, but at times the fold-in method  of writing, a technique designed to subvert the rational process of  thought, yields paragraphs that are not merely irrational but garbled.   They're just clumps of words pasted together at random (as far as I can  tell).  This is not a novel in any sense of the term, nor it is a story,  but there are themes and images that perhaps could not be conveyed in a  conventional framework.   Nova Express was extremely influential for me  and has stayed with me for the last 30 years.  I don't pretend to  understand everything that Burroughs was trying to accomplish with this  kind of writing, but if affected me in ways that are hard to explain. If  you are interested in experimental writing, surrealism, or non-linear  narrative, you may want to give Burroughs a try.  However if you're looking  for a good, comfortable read, this isn't the place to get it.
