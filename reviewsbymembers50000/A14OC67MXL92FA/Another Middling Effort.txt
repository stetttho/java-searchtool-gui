 This is the third studio album by Splinter Group, featuring Peter Green and Nigel Watson.  As with previous Splinter Group releases, Peter Green sings and plays guitar, but contributes  no new material. The last new compositions Green recorded were in the 1979 sessions that produced the "In the Skies" album.  Since then, if he's written any songs, he hasn't liked them enough to record them.  Now his compositions are restricted to new arrangements of his old songs, and covers of blues standards. The other members of the Splinter Group are quite active, however, and contribute another collection of decent tunes.  It's hard to get around the fact, however, that the new recording of "Black Magic Woman" is easily the best track on the album.  Green has absorbed some of the Latin idiom that Carlos Santana injected into the song and reclaimed it as his own; this version could be called definitive.  The remakes of "Green Manalishi" and "Albatross" should make clear to the newcomer why Green was so popular in the heyday of Fleetwood Mac.  His ear for music went far beyond his considerable guitar skills.  After all this time, his old 60s tunes are still head and shoulders above anything that his new bandmates can produce.   This is not so much a criticism of the other band members as it is a comment on how sad it is that Green has not been able to return to composing.  He would only be competing with himself. "Cold 100" is a solid effort, with deft, virtuoso playing from everyone.  The bottom line, however, is that the "remakes" of Peter Green's old 60s tunes (particularly "Black Magic Woman")are what make the album an essential purchase.
