 In the interest of full disclosure, let me say that this is only the second rap record I've ever bought, the first being Everlast's "Whitey Ford Sings the Blues."  I'm a 47-year-old rock fan who grew up on the Stones, Cream, and Hendrix, and know very little about hip-hop.  I heard of Everlast through his guest spot on Santana's album, and after seeing him open for Santana, decided to try one of his records. That said, this is one of the most enjoyable new albums I've come across in years.  I literally can't get enough of it, and have gone so far as to buy a second copy, so I can have it available in the car as well as at home.   True, this is mostly a rock record.  The tracks "I Can't Move," "Black Coffee", "Babylon Feeling" and "Graves to Dig" are worth the purchase price, featuring lush arrangements, great lyrics, and powerful themes.   Having been drawn in by the songs, I've discovered at my advanced age that there's a lot to be said for driving down the highway with some thundering rap vibrating the windows and annoying neighbors.
