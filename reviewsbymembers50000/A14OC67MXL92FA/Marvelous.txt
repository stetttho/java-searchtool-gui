 Like "Time After Time," this three-part British TV miniseries features a fictional H. G. Wells embroiled in several fascinating SF adventures.  Each segment runs 90 minutes and contains two stories; the entire show runs 4 hrs. 30 mins.    This is one of the best films I've seen this year.  Each story (loosely based on Wells's fiction) is well told and the lead characters are utterly charming.  If you're in the mood for some quality science fiction this is the best bargain you'll find.  Great acting, dialogue, story, sets, costumes --- thoroughly enjoyable!
