 The Kinks continually reinvented themselves.  After the international success of "Lola" in 1970 (their first komeback) the Kinks promptly went underground again, producing a series of quirky koncept albums, some excellent, some less so; these went virtually unheard in the United States.  In 1977, the Kinks once again became a straight rock band.  Dave Davies got a chance to be a guitar hero.  And, improbably, the band engineered another comeback, becoming arena rockers.  Sleepwalker was a minor hit, but it propelled the band back into the limelight.  The follow-up, "Misfits", produced a huge hit (Rock and Roll Fantasy) and sold better, but "Sleepwalker" is the best LP of the Kinks' Arista years.  There's not a false note on the nine tracks (although "Brother" is just a trifle slow for my taste).  The rollicking self-satire of "Life on the Road" leads into the heart-breaking, beautifully written "Mr. Big Man", then to the lush and bizarre title cut.  Every track sparkles with Ray Davies's brilliant lyrics and wry, knowing wit.  Having dispensed with the elaborate horn arrangements of their koncept period, the band brings the attention back to the core of rock music:  good songs.  These are songs you can dance to, sing along with, hum, and dream to.  Great guitar playing by Dave, too!  Very highly recommended.
