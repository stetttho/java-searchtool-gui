 Like the wretched "Stigmata", this Schwarzenegger vehicle is a gorefest of truly stomach churning violence, masquerading as a religious fable.  It's something of an improvement over the pretentious  "Stigmata"; however, its use of religious imagery as a means for  grotesque violence (people being crucified to a ceiling, having their  tongues cut out, etc.) is likely to offend atheists as well as Christians.    I found this film annoying enough to hit "scan" for the last  20-25 minutes.  I've sat through equally unpleasant films  ("Seven" comes to mind) but "End of Days" is  predictable and boring. There are some pluses, however.  The soundtrack  is the best Dolby Digital 5.1 I've heard in a long time, making excellent  use of the split surrounds for some very enjoyable sound effects.  Picture  quality is superb, and the lighting and makeup are effective without being  garish. Schwarzenegger's performance is fairly close to convincing, given  that he's got a cookie-cutter role to deal with.  His sidekick, nicely  played by Kevin Pollack, provides some much-needed comic relief.  And  Gabriel Byrne as the Prince of Lies is good as usual; although after this  film and "Stigmata" I bet he's telling his agent not to send him  any more scripts for pseudo-religious trash. Apparently Schwarzenegger's  fans enjoy this one, although he's not really the straight up action hero  of the type he plays in "True Lies" and "Commando."   However, I'd only recommend this movie if you're in the mood for more flash  than substance --- and if you've got a cast iron stomach.
