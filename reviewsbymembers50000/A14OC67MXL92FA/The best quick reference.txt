 I only agree with the reviews about 55% of the time, but the team that assembles this guide does a superb job of writing brief capsule descriptions of a wide variety of films.  The reference information --- stars, directors, dates, widescreen processes --- may all be available elsewhere, but it's often a lot easier to pick up the book then it is to get up out of your easy chair, boot up the computer, go to the imdb, type in the info you're looking for...    It's true that this edition, formatted to fit into a mass-market paperback, has very small print.  As an AARP member who needs trifocals, this can sometimes be an issue.  However, Maltin's does publish the book in a larger-type edition (a "trade" paperback) which is published about three months after this smaller sized version.  (Why don't they publish both simultaneously?  Who knows...)  P.S.  This book is also very handy for working crossword puzzles.
