 Rock operas are generally pretentious affairs, and Pink Floyd's hugely popular "The Wall" is no exception.  A handful of standout songs are loosely cobbled together with a stretches of forgettable filler.  The  story --- such as it is --- is narcissistic and depressing, and it's best  not to take it too seriously. Having said all that --- which will earn me  the wrath of the Wall's many devoted fans --- I must concede that the  classic tracks (Comfortably Numb, Hey You, Run Like Hell, Another Brick in  the Wall Part 2, Young Lust) are worth the purchase price of the 2-disc  set. I bought this album when it was released in 1979, and was  disappointed in it then.  Over the years I have listened to it on and off  and it has improved with age; however for me it simply doesn't sustain the  quality level that its legions of fans find in it.
