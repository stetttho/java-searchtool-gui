 These brawn-and-sandal classics are, unfortunately, presented here in so-called "full" frame, 1.33:1.  Since they were shot in a Cinemascope-like format, 2.35:1, more than half the original image is lost.  This is not an acceptable way to view an epic.  Purchase not recommended. Eventually someone will release a widescreen version; all the more reason to send the message to labels like this one:  No widescreen, no sale!
