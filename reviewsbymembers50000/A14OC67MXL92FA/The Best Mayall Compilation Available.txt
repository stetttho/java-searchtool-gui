 John Mayall is still performing and recording in his late sixties, but he is not very well known in the US.  His greatest claim to fame is perhaps his featuring Eric Clapton, Peter Green, and Mick Taylor as lead guitarists before each of them went on to greater fame.  However, Mayall has his strengths as a songwriter and arranger, and the sincerity of his crusade to bring the blues to a wider audience is undeniable. If you are at all curious about Mayall, or are simply interested in hearing examples of Eric Clapton's best early work, this two disc set is the place to begin.  Mayall's major achievements were recorded in the 60s, and his most enjoyable songs are included here, with the exception of the tracks on "The Turning Point". Stones fans, those who like Clapton's blues work, and anyone familiar with the original Fleetwood Mac with Peter Green, will likely enjoy this set.  First rate blues guitar, strong melodies, creative blues arrangments with extensive use of horns as well as guitar, keyboards, and harmonica --- you'll find them all here.  A throughly satisfying disc from beginning to end.
