 This is one of my favorite movies, and normally I'd give it 5 stars.  However, the new edition from Buena Vista (the third DVD release and the second "Special Edition") says that the film is in anamorphic widescreen.  I owned the previous DVD release from a couple of years ago, but unfortunately, this is the same transfer.  Not only is the transfer letterboxed rather than anamorphic, it looks little better than the VHS, and is also missing some dialogue (where Tom says, "I need to get laid".)  This line was also missing from the laserdisc print.  Too bad I didn't keep my old VHS tape.  Both DVD versions are labelled "special edition" but the extras are different.  The Buena Vista edition (released December 2005) includes a new audio commentary in addition to the one featured on the 2nd release.  Other than that, the only real difference between the two Special Editions is the cover art.    Bottom line --- if you already own the disc, you don't need to buy this reissue, unless you've just got to have the extra audio commentary.  And if you don't own it already, it doesn't make any difference which one you buy.  (The older edition  features the original poster artwork on the cover, and may be less expensive, but both editions are low-priced.)
