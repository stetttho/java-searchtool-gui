 It's hard for me to believe I've given this record so much time over the years.  In the 70s, it sounded novel and appealing, in spite of the infestation of bleeps and bloops created by the numerous new synthesizers that were in vogue at the time.  I overlooked its many weaknesses for the occasional flashes of melodic brilliance that periodically threaten to materalize, before sinking once again into the ocean of electronic noise.   I've made excuses for this album, but I can't do it anymore.  There is some good material here (I have a special fondness for "The Hilltop", and parts of "Spanish Fantasy" are compelling), but there's too much junk to make it worthwhile.  Corea is an extraordinarily gifted pianist, but at this point in his career he was squandering his talent on sound rather than music.   A quaint relic of the 70s; jazz fans will do better to pick up Corea's acoustic stuff (either from earlier in his career, or from the 80s), and jazz-rock enthusiasts should look up the first four "Return to Forever" albums, particularly "Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy."   This edition is a newly remastered reissue, with an extra track, but I no longer like this album enough to replace my existing copy.
