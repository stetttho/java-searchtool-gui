 This sequel to "Sorcerers of Majipoor" has to rank as one of Silverberg's weakest efforts.  "Sorcerers" was a simple enough story but it was reasonably compelling; however, in "Lord Prestimion" not much happens.  The Coronal and his lieutenants traipse about the globe for several hundred pages unitl it's time to wrap things up.  Even Silverberg's luminous prose can't make up for the fact that there isn't much of a story to be told.   Fundamentally, Majipoor makes no sense.  The larger a planet, the less unified it would be and the more unstable the politics.  On Majipoor, we are asked to believe, not only is there one language and culture but the same political system has existed without change for thousands of years.  With a sufficiently vigorous plot, one can overlook this and suspend one's disbelief, but there's not enough going on here to distract you from the man behind the curtain (so to speak). Jack Vance's Big Planet, by contrast, depicts a giant-size world as it probably would be --- a thousand contentious cultures, no central political control of any kind, technology limited only by the lack of metals.  Surely Silverberg is familiar with this venerable work (in many ways, one of Vance's best); but Majipoor is fantasy, not SF.  Still, we know Silverberg can do much better.
