 The critics have always been hard on this album, and no one more so than David Bowie himself.  "That album!  I've never played it! ... it must sound like a vampire's teeth coming down on you.  And that picture on the cover ... like I've just stepped out of the grave... that's actually how I felt at the time."  Clearly, Bowie was not at his best during this time, and when his manager informed the band at the last minute that they would be paid nothing extra for appearing on the album, they refused to go on stage.  Bowie defused the situation by paying the difference out of his own pocket, but the damage was done and the band turned in a mediocre performance.  Still, these are very talented musicians, and their B-game is pretty darned good.  This new remaster (including the three extra tracks) is well worth the purchase for fans of the album.  I listened to this a lot on vinyl and no, it's not like being bitten by a vampire.  Some of the arrangements are strained and I don't care for some of the backing vocals, but Garson's piano is razor sharp, Earl Slick does some great guitar work, and while Bowie's voice is not at his best it gets the job done.  I like this record because it features the best live treatments we have of the "Diamond Dogs" material.  It's not a must have for casual fans, who would probably prefer the 2-disc "Best of Bowie" greatest hits, but for real fans it's worth a listen.  Bowie's artier fans prefer "Stage", which is a smoother album but features mostly instrumental tracks from "Low" and "Heroes" which differ very little from the studio versions.  "David Live" is in some ways a stronger record if only because he's playing hard rock, while perhaps staggering under the pressure of his fame.
