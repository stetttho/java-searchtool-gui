 This was the first Patricia Cornwell I've read, and although it was reasonably engrossing I can't share the enthusiasm of her fans.  Her narrative is good and the dialogue is sharp, but her descriptive passages are frequently awkward (just what do "shadowy deer" look like?). Overall, I found the characters more interesting than the plot, although you certainly won't guess the identity of the killer.  I didn't care for the occasional snide potshots at liberals, as if only people who share Cornwell's conservative views are capable of sharing her moral outrage at the brutal murder of a child.  These asides contribute nothing to the plot and are distracting; however, judging from the other reviews posted here, Cornwell's readers are a pretty conservative bunch anyway. I'd recommend this book as a light read for those with a special interest in forensic pathology (Cornwell's research is quite good).  As a crime novel, it's hardly in the top rank, but you won't be bored.
