 This double feature DVD includes one of the best science fiction films, an adaptation of H.G. Wells' story "The Shape of Things to Come."  This melodramatic tale, released in 1936, foresees a second World War beginning in 1940 and continuing into the 1970s, devastating the Earth.  Eventually, mankind rebuilds, constructing a new and better civilization, culminating in the beginning of space travel in 2036.  The film's striking production design, first rate photography, literate, intelligent script, and fine performances (especially by Raymond Massey) make this an essential film for science fiction fans. Unfortunately this DVD is a low-budget, no-frills disc, made from a smudgy print.  The audio has not been cleaned up; it's scratchy and dialogue is not always intelligible.  Hopefully a remastered version will be released someday, with perhaps a few extras. The less said about the second film, "Journey to the Center of Time", the better; it's worthwhile only as an example of how not to make a movie.   This DVD is worth buying for "Things To Come"; at least until a remastered version is available.
