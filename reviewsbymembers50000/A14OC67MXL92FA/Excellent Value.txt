 This package contains four films either produced or directed by Dan Curtis, creator of TV's "Dark Shadows."  The most successful piece is "The Picture of Dorian Gray", featuring a moodier, more atmospheric interpretation than the classic film starring George Sanders (not yet on DVD, alas).  The Dracula adaptation stars Jack Palance as the nefarious Count, and follows the novel much more closely than the Lugosi or Christopher Lee versions.  Still, it's not as gripping as it could be. Palance also stars as Jekyll/Hyde, and this film is easily the weakest of the bunch.  Overlong and plodding, it never catches fire.  Palance's understated performance is a plus, and there are several strong sequences, especially at the beginning, but towards the end it starts to drag.   The Turn of the Screw is excellent, a definitive adaptation of the Henry James novel.  (The review below mentions an audio problem on this disc, but I didn't experience anything like that.)  It's not often that I find a horror flick genuinely scary, but this one does the trick.   These films were (I believe) made for TV, so the video quality isn't great and the audio is mono.  The films are also sold separately, so you're not forced to buy them all.  But this package is the better value.
