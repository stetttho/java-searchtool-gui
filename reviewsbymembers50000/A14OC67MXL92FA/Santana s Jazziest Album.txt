 Santana's fifth LP in 1973, this recording has finally been issued on compact disc in the United States (various import versions of it have been available since the late 80s).  The newly remastered version also restores most of the original LP artwork.  It's nice to have a decent remaster of this; for Santana's more devoted fans, this contains some of his most sophisticated music. With "Caravanserai", Santana's previous effort, the band had stepped away from rock and turned in a record with no singles (and virtually no vocals).  On "Welcome", Santana moved even more in the direction of jazz fusion.  Although there are more vocals here than on "Caranvanserai", the arrangements have more jazz inflections.  "Flame-Sky" is a fiery duet between Santana and John McLaughlin, while the title track is a John Coltrane piece, given a somewhat radical reinterpretation here. This is less coherent work than Caravanserai, covering more ground musically but less focused.  Still it's one of Santana's six or seven best achievements.
