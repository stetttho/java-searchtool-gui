 Not as cerebral as "The Prisoner", nor nearly as simplistic as James Bond, Man from U.N.C.L.E., or any of the dozens of spy shows that were popular in the late sixties, "Danger Man" (Secret Agent in the U.S.) is a fine example of how British drama is often more subtle and ambiguous than anything you're likely to see on American TV. Modern viewers may scratch their heads, wondering why this show was so wildly popular.  At its worst, the pacing is glacial, the narrative larded with long chunks of exposition.  At its best, this is chilling, thought provoking drama with plenty of gray areas, reminiscent of the Le Carre adaptions (Tinker, Tailor, etc.) that were produced in the 70s and 80s.  These shows are surprisingly cerebral for a TV series; while some episodes are too deliberately paced to work as thrillers, McGoohan is always worth watching, the black and white DVD transfers are gorgeous, and the endings are often startling.   If you're not a McGoohan fan, you'll probably find "The Prisoner" more accessible.  If you've already discovered "The Prisoner", and enjoy John Le Carre-style gritty, realistic espionage stories, give this box a try.  (The episodes in Volume 2 are generally more absorbing and darker than those included in the first DVD set.)
