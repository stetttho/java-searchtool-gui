 The packaging leaves a lot to be desired, and most of this material has long been available on the standard CDs.  If you want to hear the songs in the U.S. running order, a CD burner will do the job for you.  So why purchase this set?  Answer:  these are the original mixes.  George Martin remixed all the Beatles's songs for the 80s releases, which are still on the market.  For this reissue, he's gone back to the original stereo and mono mixes and in the process, taken advantage of technical advances to produce Beatles CDs that sound better and brighter than ever before.  Most of us suffered through the soundtrack version of "Help!".  We wanted Beatles songs, not instrumental leftovers from the movie.  But after all these years, and with the improved sound, it's great fun to hear the James Bond-esque intro (never before available on CD); and even some of the instrumental tracks are fun, now that you can hear them clearly.    Obviously this is a purchase for Beatles fans (as in fanatics).  Casual fans will be satisifed with Beatles 1 or any of the countless greatest hits compilations.  But if you have all the Beatles albums and want to hear these recordings as they originally appeared, this is a must-buy.  The original run (now apparently deleted by Amazon and available through third-party sellers) contains some mono mixes that are different from the originals on Beatles VI and Rubber Soul.  Capitol is correcting this issue and a second edition should be on its way to stores.  Frankly I'm satisified with these discs as they are; but more discriminating listeners will want to wait for the replacements.
