 These films are still tremendously enjoyable, although I've seen the first one more than 20 times since it premiered way back in 1985 (and I've seen II and III several times too).  It's rare that science fiction and humor are blended so deftly, so that this story works both as suspense and as satire. As for the DVD, be sure to check the label for a small "V2".  There was a major mix-up with the matting of II and III; replacement discs are being shipped as of April 2003.  The V2, with the correct transfers of II and III, should be on the barcoding on the package, and also on the discs themselves.  If you bought the original version and want the corrected dics, MCA has a toll free number you can call (see the official Back to the Future web site for details).
