 I enjoyed the first two books in this series, but I was unable to finish this one, even after I started skimming about 150 pages into it.  Very few writers can sustain a work of this length --- taken together, the three volumes run about 1,800 pages --- and the pacing wasn't lively enough to keep me interested.   The series has some compelling concepts, and even the battle scenes in the first two were vivid enough to keep me interested, in spite of the mostly two-dimensional characters, but after a while it got very tedious for me.  Stephen Vincent Benet, a great American story writer, once said that "writing is the art of abbrevation."  Unfortunately, Stirling doesn't get to the point too often, and the plot is weighed down with long, windy descriptive passages that don't advance the story. Looks like most readers who liked the first two will enjoy this one as well, but it was too much for me.
