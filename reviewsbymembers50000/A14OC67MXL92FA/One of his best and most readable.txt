 Unlike "VALIS" and "The Divine Invasion", this novel dispenses with science fiction apparatus in its examination of religious and philosophical issues.  Based on the life of controversial Episcopal Bishop James Pike, who was a close friend of the author's, this is one of Dick's best written novels.  Many of his earlier works were produced at a blisteringly fast pace, without much time for revision; some of them are essentially first drafts.  Here, in Dick's last work, he slows down enough to polish his prose and put events in their proper context.  The result is a fascinating and deeply moving story.   Although this novel is usually billed as part of a trilogy or series, its sole connection with "VALIS" and "Divine Invasion" is that the story has a religious theme.  Otherwise there is no connection.
