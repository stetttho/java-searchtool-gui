 For those of us who own widescreen televisions, the release of this fifth X-Files box is an event. This was the first season of X-File to be filmed in HDTV (High Definition TV), so widescreen prints are available, and the DVD box presents the episodes in this format. This turns out to be something of a mixed blessing.  The HD masters appear to have lopped off the top and bottom of the picture, so that in many close up scenes, you don't see the top of Skinner's and Mulder's heads.  Also, the picture is marginally less crisp than in previous releases; it looks somewhat grainier. On the plus side, it does fill your screen... and X-Files is still fun, even if you feel the third, or fourth, or second seasons were the show's peak.   If you have a "regular" TV set, you should see black bars at the top and bottom.   No particular comments on the quality of season five.  Any TV show that stretches to five seasons is going to sacrifice some quality somewhere; and the fact that X-Files has stumbled into Season Nine before finally running out of steam altogether says a lot about the talent behind this series.  If you're an X-Files fan, you'll want this set, unless you're still saving to buy Seasons 1, 2, 3, and 4 first.
