 I hadn't heard of this series until it was released on DVD, and I bought it before I had the chance to read some of the negative reviews here and on the Internet Movie Database.  Since I already had the package, I figured it was worth a try.  And, boy am I glad I gave it a chance.    I'm mystified as to what seems to have rubbed people the wrong way.  This is a very well-done series.  Good production values, good stories, strong performances.  Of course there are a couple of clunkers in the set --- but Serling's original series had its share of stinkers, particularly towards the end.  (Check out Season 5's "Probe 7 Over and Out" for an example of the most overdone cliche in SF.  Serling said he was getting so tired towards the end that he was losing his ability to distinguish between good and bad writing, and this proves it.)  The Amazon reviewer says this series will appeal more to younger viewers.  I was born in the 50s and grew up with the original TZ, and I thought this series was great, so draw your own conclusions.  I have purchased the 80s TZ Season 1, and this gets much better reviews.  Again, I'm not sure why, but I've only seen the first couple of episodes of the 80s set, and I wasn't bowled over.    Of course Serling's original series is in a class by itself, particularly during the first three seasons, produced by Buck Houghton.  No remake can equal it, but this set proves that there are new stories to be told within the TZ framework, and it deserves to be more widely seen.  If you haven't seen it, I suggest you try it and draw your own conclusions.  You may be pleasantly surprised.
