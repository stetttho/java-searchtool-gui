 Dylan's long awaited memoir isn't so much an autobiography as a collage.  This is probably as it should be.  Dylan's biography has been written many times and the basic facts of his life are familiar to fans.    Dylan writes well enough --- surprisingly so --- and in places, Chronicles Vol. 1 reads like part of a Kerouac or Salinger novel.  However, there's nothing to connect the various parts, so it's only fitfully compelling.  Dylan jumps around from one subject to another almost at random, and while he offers an interesting insight or a quotable moment from time to time, the material could be better organized.    Still, most readers will argue that by its nature, Chronicles should be more or less random, just as so many Dylan songs are (on the surface) stream-of-consciousness and surrealistic.  Perhaps.  But I found this a little repetitious and difficult to stick with.
