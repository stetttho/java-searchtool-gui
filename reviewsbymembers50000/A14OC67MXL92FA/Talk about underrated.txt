 I've been waiting for this one to come out on CD for 16 years!  In fact, I still have the LP, the one vinyl album I've kept, out of nostalgic reasons.   The Selecter were part of the 1980s ska revival that included Madness, the Specials, and Bad Manners.  Their first album, Too Much Pressure (also long unavailable in its original form) was straightforward dance music, and is one of the highly rated albums of this genre.  Their second album, Celebrate the Bullet, described by lead singer Pauline Black as "our blue period" featured a wider range of sound, some of it fast-paced dance music, some of it thoughtful and contemplative.  It didn't meet with the success of the first record, and no doubt had something to do with the band's temporary demise. Don't believe the critics, though.  In fact, don't believe the current Selecter members, who ignored these songs entirely when they regrouped in the 1990s.  Cool Blue Lady, Deep Water, and Bombscare feature Pauline Black's most haunting vocals, combined with emotionally intense, compelling melodies. Most of these songs have been released on CD, scattered across three or four compilations.  But at last, the original album is available.  If you like ska music, this is a rarity you shouldn't overlook!  I'm ordering my copy right now, and so should you.
