 Where did people get the idea for silly movies like these?  Who knows.  Both flicks are about putting two heads on one body.  Why is this an important scientific advance that will benefit humanity?  You tell me and we'll both know.  "The Incredible Two-Headed Transplant", despite the idiocy of its premise, is actually a fairly well-made bit of cinema, with a plot that clips along nicely, with plenty of cheesy action and melodrama.  The point, of course, is for mad scientist Bruce Dern to sew the head of a psycopathic killer onto the body of a retarded farm hand.  Why?  Well, because it's there, I guess.  Naturally, things get even more ridiculous after the surgery, but the movie ends before you get two fed up with it.  "The Thing with Two Heads," on the other hand, is basically a bore.  It has a nice idea for the setup.  Racist doctor Ray Milland is dying and needs a new body.  Convict Rosy Grier is taken from death row so that Milland's head can be sewn onto Grier's body.  The plan is for Milland to take over the body and lop off Grier's head at some point.    Of course, Milland is in a coma and doesn't know who the subject is, so he wakes up to find himself attached to a black man's body.  Horrors!  It's all played for laughs, of course, but it just isn't funny.  Ray Milland has rescued more than one movie from absurdity, but he can't pull it off with this one.  It gets old fast.  These two features certainly qualify as "midnite" movies.  If you're in the mood for something utterly ridiculous, this will certainly fill the bill.
