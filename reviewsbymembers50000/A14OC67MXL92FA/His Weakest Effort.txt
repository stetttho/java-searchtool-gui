 There's almost no such thing as a bad Bowie album, but "Tonight" comes close.  Recorded very hastily (reportedly the sessions concluded in less than a week), Bowie was clearly not that interested in the record, tossing it off as a quickie follow-up to "Let's Dance."  Unlike the hit album, however, the production here sounds limp and lifeless, and the overall tone of the album is flat and dull.  The title track has a provocative concept, one that you don't notice unless you listen closely to the lyrics.  However, it fails due to understated delivery.  "Loving the Alien" is the one strong tune, while "Blue Jean" is worth including on the various greatest hits package, but which sounds more like a "Let's Dance" outtake than a full-fledged effort.  The most interesting aspect of the song --- the 20 minute video --- has never been made available and is not included on the two-disc DVD which collects almost all of Bowie's videos.    Fortunately, Bowie never got worse than this.  His next album was not a stellar effort but it was less formulaic, and by the end of the 1980s Bowie had gone back to basics with the formidable Tin Machine lineup.  He hasn't made a bad record since.  I can forgive him this one.  In fact, since "Loving the Alien" and "Blue Jean" are on the greatest hits packages, I don't own a copy.
