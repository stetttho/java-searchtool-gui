 Recorded long after the breakup of the original group, this recording finds McLaughlin at something of a loss.  The bold new directions established by the original band's recordings (Inner mounting flame, Birds  of Fire) seem to have led into a dead end.  (McLaughlin abandoned the  fusion approach not long after Inner Worlds was issued.) Most of this  album is standard issue 70s funk/jazz that is unmemorable at best (and  annoying at times, with a vocal that chants insistently:  "are you  ready to be ... a planetary citizen"?) I bought this CD because of  "Lotus Feet", the one gem on this otherwise lackluster set.  It's  worth it for that, but discs like this one are what CD burners were  invented for. My apologies to my old friend Stu Goldberg, who plays the  keyboards on this album.
