 Although Amigos is a strong album, you can hear, in the weaker tracks, the beginnings of Santana's decline.  Having followed his classic trilogy of Latin Rock albums with three quasi-jazz-fusion albums, Santana wanted to come back down to Earth and rediscover his pop roots.  He was mostly successful on Amigos, but subsequent albums fell off dramatically in quality as he continued to flounder in search of the right middle-of-the-road groove. However, on Amigos, the superb material is more than worth the purchase price of the CD.  Dance Sister Dance and Gitano showcase a new facet of Santana's Latin roots, and Europa is probably Santana's finest composition, featuring his most powerful and moving guitar work. Let It Shine is an OK rhythm & blues pop song that became the minor hit Santana was looking for.  Tell me are you tired is the worst track on the album, a dopey "lecture" song that, regrettably, was a harbinger of things to come.   It's worth buying this record for "Europa" alone, since none of the live performances I've heard come close to matching the studio original for shimmering, sparkling beauty and emotional resonance.  As a whole this is a solid piece of work and at the current budget price is well worth it for any Santana fan.
