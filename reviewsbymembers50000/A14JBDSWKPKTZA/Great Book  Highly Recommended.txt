 I built an addition onto my home, and what I learned from that is, it is easier than you think. A friend of mine just had extensive work done remodeling an older home that he just bought. New electric, plumbing, heating, landscaping, garage-shop addition etc. What he learned from that is the General Contractor he hired was busier making everything more expensive, rather than running the job. Now he is finishing the job himself, and doing a good job of being his own GC. This book gives you step by step instructions> great hand holding every step of the way. With checklists for each stage of the game: What to look out for, what is needed, and what works. This book can save you a bundle, and keep you on top of what is going on. Definitely worth every penny. Highly recommended.
