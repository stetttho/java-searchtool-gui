 I bought this set at the same time I bought the DowelMax system. Their is really no comparison between the two. If you are looking to make the occasional dowel, and don't mind doing extra steps to get the registration into the ball park, then this kit gives you a lot for a little bit of money. With the included brad point bits, the drill guides, and the dowel jig itself, gives you a volume of gear. It comes on a cardboard card with a shrink wrap plastic holding it on. If you are serious about woodwork, and want to create precision joinery, I highly recommend you to get the Dowelmax system.
