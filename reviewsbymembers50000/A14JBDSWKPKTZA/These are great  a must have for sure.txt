 These clamps are great. I got this one, the 24 inch clamp and tool guide, and I also purchased the 48 inch (total 50 some inches) Pro guide with T Slots. I first saw the 24 inch clamp and tool on Norm Abrams New Yankee workshop, and he used them for a router edge guide. Then I saw him make a quick mortising jig, out of two of them for the router. These Griset clamps are a dream. They meet the criteria of being easy, quick, and accurate to set up and use. The list of possible uses is enourmous.   For example, I needed to trim the ends of some MDF. I used one of these clamps, with a square, grabbed the rear attaching brace, snugged it up to the rear of the piece, and then gave the front lever a push, and it easily clamped firmly to the piece. I took out my Bosch Jig Saw, and the guide was so accurate, that it enabled me to make a smooth cut. Finally I used a long board, with some medium grit, gave it a light sanding, and it was indistinguishable from the factory cut.  I find these to be so accurate, and easy to use, I could see a contractor using the 4 foot and 8 foot models to cut 4x8 sheets of plywood on the job.  I plan on buying more of these. I want to get another of the clamp and tool guide, so I can mate two of these up, for different operations, and I defintely want a pair of the back to back clamps for a quick way to secure pieces of sanding, and even gluing up.  It sounds expensive, for clamp and edge guides, when you think of buying several of them. Once you buy one or two, and start to use them, you will definitely be back for more.
