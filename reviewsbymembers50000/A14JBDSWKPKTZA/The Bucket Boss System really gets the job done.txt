 The best way to get into the Bucket Boss Super Chutes is to explain it is part of a system. The super chutes handles the misc parts. The other part of the system is the Bucket Boss 56, which handles the tools. Each one, can also be used to do a little of the other.    Super Chutes is great. I no longer find myself looking for that box of screws, or having to run back out to get things out of the vehicle. Also, if I am low on something, it is immediately apparent. The material, it is made out of, is super durable, and I am sure it will last, for a long,long time. Pick up one or more of these, and a 56 Organizer for your tools. The organization will pay for itself in no time. Get the Boss and watch your productivity zoom!
