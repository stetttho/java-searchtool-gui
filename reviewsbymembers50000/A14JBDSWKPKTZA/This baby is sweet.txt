 Once in a while, you run across a kitchen utensil that is not only handy, but makes a task a joy. This is one of those items. It is fun to take ice cold water out of the Brita Water Filter-Pitcher that is in the refrig, and pour it into the Vitesse High Speed Kettle. No sooner do you flick the button on, in what seems like an instant, you hear it working. The next moment you hear the rolling boil, and the top on button pops indicating it is done, which automatically shuts it off. Takes only a minute. Saves a lot of time when you want to make a cup of tea.  This makes short of a lot of work.   It has a 7 cup capacity, but I have never used it for that much. Two cups, doesn't seem to take additional time, although with a stop watch, I'm sure it does. Additionally, it is really nice to have the base stay on the counter, and the pitcher be able to be removed. No switch, or button to push. It just sits there by gravity, and effortlessly lifts off by simply picking it up.   You can use the pitcher on your counter top, or table because the bottom does not get hot on the outside. The plastic outer shell extends down to a lip that runs all around the outside. Like if you put a cup upside down, only the outside would be touching the counter.  Convenience, price, great engineering, all make the Vitesse High Speed Kettle a winner to buy. It is almost as much fun as the Black and Decker cordless can opener. Hope this was helpful.
