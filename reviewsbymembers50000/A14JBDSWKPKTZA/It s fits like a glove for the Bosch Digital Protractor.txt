 I know this is a smart tool carrying case, and as such, very well made for that purpose. What I thought was interesting, is that this fills a need for those of us who own the Bosch Digital Protractor. It fits like a glove for that as well. Just the right size to protect it. It is longer than the Bosch Protactor, which is 18", but fits so well it doesn't slide around. Since Bosch does not produce a carrying case for the protractor at the present time, this Macklanburg Duncan case is just what the doctor ordered.
