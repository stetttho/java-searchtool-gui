 The advantage to this Goodyear hose is that it is made out of industrial grade rubber instead of vinyl. What that means is that when you are using it instead of being stiff like vinyl it remains soft and flexible, so it lays flat on the floor. This is especially a problem in colder temperatures. It's great for coiling as well, it doesn't fight you.    The real frustration of using a vinyl hose is that it can stand up while moving across the floor, high enough to snag on things, or even pull something onto the floor. The hose is in a coil, then instead of simply uncoiling, the vinyl has a memory and wants to look more like hoops moving over the floor.    This hose comes in 3/8" which is the most popular size. The 1/4" hoses restrict air flow, which is especially important over a 50 foot run.    All in all highly recommended. The advantages are worth it even if it was twice the price.
