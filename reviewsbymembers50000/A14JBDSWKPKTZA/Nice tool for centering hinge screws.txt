 Since this Self Centering Bit has a tapered tip on it, you are assured of getting a hole drilled for hinge screws that are exactly on center. The problem of a less than centered screw on a hinge results in the head of the screw sitting "high" on the hinge causing a bind. This tool is inexpensive, and will make your work shine. Highly recommended.
