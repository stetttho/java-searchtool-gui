 A 35mm carbide forstner bit is just what you need to install the European style hinges. Those are best for kitchen cabinets becasue of their 4 way adjustability, and design for frequent use. This creates the hole the door side of the hinge sits in. You can substitute a close equivalent in the English standard size bits, but that is a loose fit.     This version of Freuds 35mm comes with a 1/2" shank. It is more money than their 3/8" shaft model, which is the one to get if you are sporting a 3/8" chuck drill.     This is the proper tool for the proper job, and with Freuds industrial grade carbide, it is sure to last a long long time. With the outside extended scoring blade, you are sure to have clean edges, no tearing out. Well thought out. Definitely a 5 star deal.
