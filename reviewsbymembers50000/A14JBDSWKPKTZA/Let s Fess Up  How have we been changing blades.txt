 I must admit, I have been using a screwdriver to lock one of the teeth on the table saw blade. All the time I am exerting pressure, I am thinking, "This has got to be bad for the blade. I hope I don't slip and chip a carbide tooth." I was lucky, no chips, but the process was capable of at least a ever so slighty, bending the blade. The other alternative was to use 2x4 and let the blade bite into it. The problem is that works only one way.  I did the vise grip on the blade, without touching the teeth method as well.  I am sure their are as many ingenious ways, people have come up with locking the blade, as their are different types of blades.   So now here comes Bench Dog, with an ideal solution. Why not make a hard plastic holder, that sits on top of the blade, protecting you, and the blade in one step. It holds the blade both ways, and still allows you to use a wrench on the locking nut. Bench Dog wins a lot of awards, for their superior engineering. Ok, so it is made out of plastic. I don't know what else would do, surely not metal, against metal carbide teeth. I'm glad to give them most of the purchase price for the design, and leave a little left over for the cost of the material.   This Blade Loc is ideal for blade changes. Highly recommended for your safety, and the blades.
