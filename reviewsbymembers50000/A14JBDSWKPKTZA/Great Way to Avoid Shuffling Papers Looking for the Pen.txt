 Most of the time my desk is cluttered with one job on top of the other. I keep thinking a credenza would solve that problem but it doesn't. The frustration is when you need a letter opener or a pen, and they are buried in the pile. Or I need the mini razor that slides back in the plastic holder. That baby really lays flat, and can get lost under most anything.   This Mug Boss is great for all of those problem. Pens, pencils, letter opener, and whatever else you may use on your desk, are always at the ready. It looks really cool. Has a handy look to it and hints that things are under control. Great material, sure to last a long time, and fits a standard size coffee mug.   It's cheap. Buy a few and give them out to your friends. It's an upfront desk reminder of you. Great conversation piece. I really don't see any down side to it. Makes a great compliment to the Bucket Boss, and the rest of the line. Highly recommended.
