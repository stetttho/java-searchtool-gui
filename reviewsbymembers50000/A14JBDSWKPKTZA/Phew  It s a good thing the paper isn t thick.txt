 This book is a whopping 896 pages. Crammed with pricing of collectibles. For the most part, since it covers such a vast array of items, it is a worded listing of the object, and a price. Sprinkled on the bottom of the page, are a few of the more renouned items in a black and white photo. If you are an experienced antique dealer, trader, or rummager, this book is something to take along when you are "finding". It has the price list of everything out there, as long as you can figure out what those things are called.   The nice thing is that the price for this book, considering the size of the volume, you can't help but want it. Even if you only use it once, it will pay for itself, in knowing what market value is on the object.   In the car business they have NADA, in antiques they have the Kovell's price list. If you are into antiquing, this is a must have.
