 You can download from Calculated Industries a free full blown version of their PC Software version of Construction Master Pro Calculator. It works for 30 days without any restrictions. That is what got me hooked. Once I saw what you could do for calculating board feet, and lots of other calculations, I knew I had to have more than the trial version. With C Industries Construction Master Pro, you are currently receiving the software version (a 30 some dollar value in itself) for free with the purchase of the calculator. It is included in the box. Considering the Pro is only going for a few more dollars than the IV version, it makes it a no brainer to buy that model instead.    Since I bought the pro, I am going to go over and write a review on that one instead. It has all of the features of the IV and then some. It comes in a great looking case, and has a front cover that mounts on the back when not in use. It looks great, and is even greater for its usefulness. Hope this helps.
