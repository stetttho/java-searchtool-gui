 I know they tell you in the description that it is 3/8" and 3/4" blades but they come in this little tiny pouch. Save these for your super small jobs. Combining the small blades with the Fein Multimasters variable speed, and you have the capability of doing some pretty "fine" work. Great for the boat in a jar project, or anything else in wood or metal, that requires a small cut.
