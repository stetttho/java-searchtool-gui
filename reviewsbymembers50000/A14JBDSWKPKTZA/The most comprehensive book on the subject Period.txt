 I spent a lot of time, as a budding author, researching material on how to publish, write and promote a book. It was frustrating, trying to find good resources. Many books are written on the subject, but seems to be a graveyard of information because it is relevant to every writer. This book is different. It not only goes into every possible area of information you will come across, it covers it from those who have been involved in every aspect of writing, publishing and promoting. It even covers the new e-publishing field. At 512 pages their is plenty of room for thorough coverage. Dare I say this is the bible in the industry for publishing. Sure! If you are a writer, it's a must have. Defintely ten stars, if you could give it that much. Comprehensive, well thought out, revised, edited, polished, and finalized. Buy it, you won't be sorry.
