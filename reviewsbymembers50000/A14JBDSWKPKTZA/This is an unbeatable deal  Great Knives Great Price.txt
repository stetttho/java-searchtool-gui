 Years ago, I had started a Henkels 4 Star collection, and found joy in using them. They are the kind of item that you sharpen, polish, and use caringly, the way you would treat something you plan on using for a lifetime. Well I don't live alone, and when they started getting sharpened on the face as well as the edge, I decided it was time to save them for special uses, rather than everyday. So when I saw these Henkels, especially at the Amazon.com sale price, I decided to give them a try. Glad I did. Since they don't need to be sharpened, I didn't have to worry about someone scarring the face with a sharpener. They are very sharp. They create their sharpeness with a minutely serrated edge. You have to be careful when cleaning these knives, because it is possible to cut yourself, when scrubbing along the very side edge of the blade, as well as the actual cutting edge. The serrations only go up a minute amount, but enough to cut yourself along the side of the blade. A little care when cleaning, to use a sponge or whatever, and avoid direct contact with your skin.  The solid wood holder is very nice. The Henkel logo emblazoned on the front is a nice touch for your kitchen.  I don't really have anything negative to say about these knives at all. They are sharp. The selection suits most every need. You can use them and not have to worry about them. They are durable. I am not a knife expert, but I understand that these are stamped, instead of forged and ground like their more expensive sets. Notwithstanding, they look good, cut great, and have sufficient durability to them to be used for a very long time.  I bought them when they were listed at the better price, and at that number, it pays to get a set just to keep as a gift.  Definitely a 5 star product considering the quality and the price. Hope this helps.
