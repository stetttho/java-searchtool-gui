 When I saw the ad with a bifocal, I thought that would solve all of the problems, and it does. I was continually popping reading glasses on and off when I had to make a setting, and then putting on regular protective eyewear for everything else, what a nuisance. These bifocals allow you to enjoy the protection while looking through clear glass. When you need to see something with some correction, the bottom of the lense has a 1.5 magnification.    I gave it four stars because the plastic lense is not secured very well to the frame. It is a snap in hold, and it frequently snaps out. Then I have to reassemble the glasses. I am tempted to get out the epoxy and make the assembly permanent. If I had to do it all over again, I would still buy these. The convenience of a bifocal outweighs the epoxy correctable assembly problem. So overall I highly recommend them.
