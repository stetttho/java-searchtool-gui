 I bought the Kreg Pocket Hole Pro Pack, which has all of the components on this set, plus the workpiece holder. You could make your own using a toggle clamp. What I wanted to share with you is that the Kreg Pocket Hole offerings made the number one spot across the board in the November 2003 issue of Better Homes and Gardens "Wood" magazine. Everything from the mini on through to the automated production machine were given the top ratings. It was a clean sweep for Kreg. They tested a lot of machines too. Some of the advantages are the flush edge joining to the workpiece prevented tearout. The case hardened steel guides didn't show wear or metal shavings. Easy to make or buy the premade plug holes out of wood. (Some were an odd shape, and wouldn't accept plugs very well)    Even though the body is made out of plastic, which is substantial and well done, the steel guides are the only thing the drill bit touches.    Pocket hole joinery is a nice addition to your arsenal. You will find yourself incorporating it more and more into your projects, and the Kreg system is the best. Highly recommended.
