 I purchased the Kreg Pro Pack unit, that comes with this bit. My feeling is that since it is the only one, if for any reason I am in the middle of a project and the tip breaks, or I have any other problem with it, I don't want to be left standing while I wait for another one. So I bought it as a backup.    This bit does a great job, and the Kreg pocket hole systems won top of class award in every category in a recent run off by one of the top woodworking magazines. They won in every size, and every model from the mini on through to the professional bench top.     I don't really anticipate having a problem with the drill bit, but when doing this for a living, you need a parachute, in the event the unusual happens. This bit is built strong, and is rather large, so breakage is not likely, but the tip that protrudes on the end is a lot smaller, and that could possibly break. Additionally, if you are pocket holing all day, the bit could dull, and that would requires a replacement.    Overall highly recommended.
