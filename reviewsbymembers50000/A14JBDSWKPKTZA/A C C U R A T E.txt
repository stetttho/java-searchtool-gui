 I had bought a standard drywall T Square at the local home center. Since the base is riveted onto the arm, I checked the square for trueness. I went through several to find one that was perfectly at a 90 degree angle. What I did not check was the accuracy of the measure. I have switched my wood working over to the "Incramental" system, (Incra TSIII-32 table saw fence- accurate to within .002", and the Incra measuring rules) that gives me a standard to judge my other rules by. The Home Center measure was off by an eighth of an inch. For drywall, that is close enough, but for finish ply it doesn't work.    So what does all of this have to do with the Johnson T-Square. Everything: Not only does the Johnson create a perfect 90 degree angle, even though you snap it into the indented groove. It also is dead on accurate for measuring. So feel free to use this for critical applications. The convenience of being able to fold it up into a single in line metal bar, makes it easy to store. Additionally, with the markings for 45 degrees etc, make it a snap for making custom cuts. You can also go over to a wall, set the T square to the angle of the wall, and easily then use it to mark your drywall.    This square is also much thicker metal (aluminum) than a typical square. All in all a 5 star piece of equipment. Highly recommended.
