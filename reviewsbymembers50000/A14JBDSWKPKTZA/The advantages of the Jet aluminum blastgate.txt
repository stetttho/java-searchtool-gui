 In addition to being a good grounding connector for a smooth metal ductwork system, and being able to seal it with aluminum tape, it also has a cleaning advantage. Think about the irony of a blast gate. If you wanted to create an ideal headache for creating, and not being able to clean out trapped dirt, a blast gate is it. You have a lot of material passing by a narrow slit in the gate, and to make matters worse, opening and closing the gate are constantly packing it in. So you have this guillotine gate packing dust debris down into a tiny crevice on a regular basis. If you have been playing with blast gates for a while, you realize that cleaning out that packed in dust is a nuisance chore.    On a plastic gate, you are stuck with having to use a sharp tool to try and dig down into the crevice and loosen the packed in debris. With this Jet aluminum gate, you have the option of being able to unscrew the gate face and do a nice job of cleaning it out. You can even do that without having to disconnect the hoses, which makes it even less work.       Another nice feature about the Jet metal gate is that it has a locking knob. With the plastic gates, if they are not mounted sideways, then tend to slip slowly into a closed position. So if the gate is mounted with the flap sitting on top, with a plastic gate, gravity and vibration creates a gate closing movement. So I purposely mount them sideways in order to prevent that. That is not always the best angle depending on the configuration of your set up. With the Jet, having a locking knob, you can set it at any angle you want, and lock it into position. Nice feature.    All in all a very nice gate. Highly recommended.
