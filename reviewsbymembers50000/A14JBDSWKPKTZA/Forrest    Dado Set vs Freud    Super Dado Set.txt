 Forrest makes a clean sweep in the awards ceremonies. Their Woodworker II took top honors in Fine Woodworking Magazines run off of blades. Close behind was the Freud at a quarter of the cost. Excellent for both blades on smoothness of cut, but the Forrest earned an excellent on tearout, whereas the Freud earned a very good. Well I bought both, and found the Freud to cut a surface so smooth that it was glass like. If I was going to put a finish on it, I would rough it up with 200 grit to improve the adhesion, it was that smooth. Also the Freud had absolutely no tear out, not even a little bit. Perfect is the word here. So why did I buy the Forrest Woodworker II also? Because everybody was raving about it. Forrest makes great products.  On the Dado set, I noticed the reviewers stating that their was a tiny ridge at the bottom of the dado cut, created with the Forrest. The Freud has similar results. Oddly enough the Freud creates a perfect edge when making finger joints and the like, even though when you look down into the pocket, their are miniscule ridges in the cut. Comments that the end result on the Forrest have me concerned, stating that the edge is not perfect. Is this an example of more expensive must be better syndrome?  I bought the Freud Super Dado set based on my earlier experience with their standard saw blade vs the Forrest. I'm glad I did. No matter what you buy, a good old fashioned sacrificial piece of scrap sandwiched to your work piece is your best guarantee against tear out when working with expensive woods.  If you look at the Amazon sales rank, the Freud outsells the Forrest 4 to 1. Of course anything that is less money, sells more quantity, but I just can't get beyond the "perfect" performance of the Freud. How do you improve on that?  This is not a dig on Forrest. They make first class products. Just something to consider. I hope this was helpful.
