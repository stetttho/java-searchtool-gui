 Doing woodwork, two of the most asked for features in building custom cabinetry, is a bullnose finish on a front edge surface, and an antiquing bit for the edges of trim. Freud makes top drawer router bits, and this one is no exception. Leaves a very smooth surface. It is great for your three quarter inch stock.   Highly recommended.
