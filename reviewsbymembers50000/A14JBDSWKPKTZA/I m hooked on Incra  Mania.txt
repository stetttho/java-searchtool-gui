 I first bought the Incra TSIII-32 table saw fence. I became indoctrinated into the Incra system. One that creates unbelievably accurate results with the least amount of effort. When I tell others that my fence-table saw is adjusted so that I can cut any size board, take out a dial caliper and it is accurate to .002", then get mad at me and tell me I'm either wrong or not telling them the truth, but it is true.    I then bought the 6" rule, and it is so accurate, I measure all of my other measuring devices by it. I wound up throwing out my far less than accurate tape measures and rules. Oh a lot of them are accurate through out the rule, but the beginning reference could be off somewhat. What else matters? Some people are not into getting totally accurate measurements. My philosophy is to strive for perfection, and settle for excellence. So onto the rule.   Since it has these tiny holes that you place the tip of a mechanical pencil into, then slide the rule along your workpiece. Thereby insuring a perfect line, exactly the distance from the edge. No holding the pencil along a rule, and sliding it along, making a varied line. If you use these rules, and gently begin your cut a hair over the line, you can tweak the workpiece up to the edge of your blade at exactly the mark line.    I use the 6" so much, that I decided to get the 12" complete set, which includes the edge-corner rule etc. I know that when I need to mark a workpiece greater than 6", I am going to be cursing myself for needing to use a ruler and a try to make the mark at the right spot method.    The thing about the Incramental system, in all of the their equipment, is that it takes less time to make a perfect cut. Some people feel that this kind of accuracy is not essential, but once you get into perfect fitting cuts, your quickly spoiled. Incra is unique. Check out all of their items. This rule set is a nice addition to your arsenal. Highly recommended.
