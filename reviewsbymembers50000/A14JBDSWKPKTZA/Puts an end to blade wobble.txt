 I am currently using this on my table saw. It lays up against the side of your blade, and helps to keep it true. Once in awhile I need to make a deeper cut, and it can get in the way for those cuts. I made some passes 2 1/2" deep and the edge of the Forrest stiffner stopped the piece. It is the first time I have had a problem with that.    Initially I installed this stiffner on a Sears Radial Arm saw because I was getting a good deal of wobble with it. Oddly enough, when I tried mounting a blade, then testing the trueness, only to loosen the nut, spin the blade slightly to a new seat, then retighten, and after a few tries, I hit it right, and the wobble disappeared. So whenever I replace a blade on that saw, I tweak it until it is right. Oddly enough, it runs so true when I do that, that I moved the Forrest over to the table saw.    I mated this stiffner up to the Forrest Woodworker II on my table saw, and I am getting cuts so smooth, you don't even have to sand the edge. It is finish quality perfectly smooth. (The Incra TSIII-32 table saw fence helps, giving me a true exact paralell line with the blade.)   So get the stiffner, make sure your fence is perfectly true, and you can forget about having to make your cuts a little bit oversized and having to finish up the edge on the jointer.    Highly recommended. The Forrest name is synonymous with the best in quality.
