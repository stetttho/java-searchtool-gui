  I have the Tru grip 24" clamp, which is great for an edge guide. I also bought a set of the Pro FTR Series clamps by Tru Grip that enable you to use special base plates for your router or circular saw. I have the 2, 4, and 8 foot size. With the circular saw you now have a portable panel cutter. They also double as a large edge guide. Tru grip products are built substantially and are designed to last a long time. So that brings me up to the back to back clamps. These are great as an edge guide clamp, and their unique feature is that they have a second set of clamps facing topside that enable you to grip your work piece. The nice thing is that the clamps are not deep, so you can take a 3/4" piece of stock and grip it, and the clamps won't get in the way. So if you were sanding, you no longer have to clamp and change, clamp and change.  Tru grip has come up with a clamping mechanism that is great to use. No fiddling with settings. It is all pre-determined. All you have to do is snug the clamp up against the work piece at both ends, then push the lever down and it is clamped. If you push it down even further to the next stop it is really gripped tightly. So it is easy and intuitive to use.  I wish I had a downside to comment on, but I don't. The only thing I can say that is wrong with having a set of these, is that it would be better if I had a set in every size.  Overall highly recommended.
