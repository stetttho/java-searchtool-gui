 I have several routers, and this Bosch PK serves a unique purpose. I leave the fixed base mounted under the router table, and put the motor into the plunge base for hand held work. It is like having two routers. With the simple twist of the motor, it drops right out of the fixed base mounted under the table, and drops into the plunge base. The big advantage is the micro adjustable knob. You may have experienced the problem of using lesser routers whose setting is lost completely when you release the clamping mechanism. It slides to another spot, then you test the setting again in frustration. With the Bosch, you get your gross setting in order, then tweak the fine adjustment knob to zero it in perfectly. Truly a precision way of working. The power is more than substantial for any task.  I have a Bench Dog router table extension for my table saw. The clear plexiglas router plate, allows the maple handles of the fixed base to show through. It is definitely impressive.  The variable speed is a necessity when using larger bits. The soft start feature is wonderful, especially when using it as a handheld, so it doesn't torque it out of your hands.  All in all it is definitely a 5 star piece of equipment. I just wish they offered the Free Deluxe Edge Guide when I bought mine.
