 I guess their aren't a lot of reviews on these, because they couldn't be simpler. They do the job well. When you want to add dowels or mark for tenons, you just drill a hole the size you need, insert one of these, accurately align, and push your two pieces together, and the sharp point makes a mark, where the adjoining piece go together. Use a brad point bit, forstner bit, or whatever device you wish that gives you an accurate center, and you get perfectly aligned pieces. For those times when you can't get a pencil in between two mating surfaces. Not something that is used that often, but worth it's weight in Gold, I mean brass plated steel :-), when it is needed. Nicely made.
