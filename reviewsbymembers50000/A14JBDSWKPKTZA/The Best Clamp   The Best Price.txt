 If your hooking up a dust collection system, the proper clamps can make all of the difference. The standard band type clamps are not properly suited to the job. The unique thing about dust collection hoses, is that they are generally made out of smooth, slippery plastic, with a stiff wire running through them for support and/or grounding. This poses a problem for standard band clamps, because the clamp is too wide to get between the wires. Therefore you have a clamp pushing down on the wire. Since the wire is rigid and in a circle, you would have to compress the circle (ain't gonna happen). Therefore a wire clamp such as these, with twin rigid wires is just what the doctor ordered.  I tried everything from duct tape, which gets soft after a while and loses it, to band clamps. When I finally got a set of these, my hoses stay put, and they don't leak. They are easy to install, and you can put a good torque on them, and not have to worry so much about them messing the thread the way a band clamp does. With the Jet 4" wire hose clamp you are dealing with a nut and a threaded bolt instead of a screw and some sheet metal. Definitely a lot stronger with the Jet wire.  The bottom line, when attaching a 10 foot-4" vac hose to a plastic 4" fitting, you can pick up the hose, move it around, and not worry about the hose coming off, the way it does with the band clamps sometimes.  Great unit, great price, get a few extras. Hope this helps.
