 This unit fits snugly into the Slot on the fence without any play or looseness. That makes it a very accurate piece of equipment. It does not have any predrilled holes, so you can custom drill it to your specifications. Placing it closest to the fence area will give the greatest flexibility and use. You also can drill it for different routers without any problems. It basically is a large thick piece of white smooth plastic, custom formed to fit the fence guide.  Knowing the precise distance the bit takes from the fence to the innermost edge of the router bit is an advantage. One way is to do this is make measurements prior to drilling. That way you know the distance. Another method is to make up a guide block that you size to the distance. When routing an edge you simply place your guide block along the fence edge and line it up with your pencil line for the work edge.  This is a very simple device, and fortunately is one the works well for what it is designed for. Engineered to simplicity.
