 I listen to this CD all of the time. Not only because it is well written and performed, but even moreso because it was digitally mastered. The net result is that your stereo shines with it. Absolutely no distortion, the highs are crystal clear and the low really gets your sub or regular woofer kickin. Great CD across the board. Their isn't a single bad cut.    Another great album for making your stereo shine is Lee Ritenour's with Wes Montgomery's "Wes Bound"    When friends come over and you start talking sound systems, they both are great.    I first heard David Benoits CD when I visited a high end stereo store, and that is what they were using to sell their equipment. Highly recommended.
