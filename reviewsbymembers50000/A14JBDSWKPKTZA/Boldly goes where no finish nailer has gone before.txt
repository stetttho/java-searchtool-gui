 This Porter Cable upholstery stapler is as comfortable to use, as it is to buy; great price point. I did buy it with the intention of using it for attaching fabric to seat bottoms, and I have some early French provincial furniture that will need reupholstering. What I found was that it is usable for a lot of other things as well. I make cabinetry. In order to transport the finish pieces, I use the single sided corrugated cardboard, which is inexpensive to wrap it. These staples work great to attach the cardboard to the back seam of the cabinet. This stapler will take up to 5/8" staples. I didn't find them here at Amazon so I bought up to the 1/2" size. They are wider than the narrow crown staples.    The stapler fires well without any misfires since I have been using it. It doesn't have a safety plunge mechanism, as do the finish nailers. That enables you to get into tight corners whereas the tip is a lot smaller.    The only downside is that it does not come with a case, and I did not find staples for it available locally. All in all it is a very nice tool. Highly recommended.
