 I have owned both RCA and Sony Direct TV receivers for several years. I understand Sony either no longer makes them, or no longer makes the Ultimate TV Direct TV receiver. The one advantage of the Sony is that their menuing system is very intuitive. The RCA on the other hand, requires manual searching to figure out the commands=not intuitive. Does a lot of cool things though. I am a firm believer in Direct TV as being the best method of viewing. Highest resolution for the best price. Additionally, except in all but the heaviest rains, the reliability is superb. I was a cable subscriber for years, and would have blackouts that lasted for 3 days at times. My friend signed up with cable and went through 6 digital receivers in 6 weeks. (I know that is probably the exception) I find a lot of cable subscribers very happy with their service.    Anyhow, the RCA is a very nice unit, and is offered at such a good price, it makes Direct TV affordable. Works well, has relatively good reliability (I have had one problem with the Sony, and one with the RCA, after several years of usage)    Check out the Ultimate TV receivers, or TIVO. Once you experience them, their is no going back. Hope this helps.
