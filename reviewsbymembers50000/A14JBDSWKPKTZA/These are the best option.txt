 A popular competitor makes one comparable that is 34 inches high. This one is 30 or 31 depending if you leave the upper half of the top on. A comfortable work height is 34 inches. The advantage to these storehorse 10008-1's is that you can easily remove the upper half of the top cap, and neatly and snugly fit a 2x4 into the top of it, to bring it up to 34 inches. You could also make two small holes in each side of the black top cupping the two by's and add a couple of short decking screws to give it all the more stability. I have seen the competitors model at 34 inches of plastic, and unfortunately it is all chewed up due to saw blades running into it. This Storehorse, has the advantage of the 2x4 that you supply being the sacrificial, and easily replaceable work surface. You could use a 2x6, and shorten it to the exact height that you need. That is nice when you are using it to support and outfeed plank for example on your table saw.   These have the advantage of holding up to 1500 pounds per pair, which is 500 more than most of the competitors. Yet they are surprisingly light, and store away taking up only 2" of depth.   They look good, fold away very easy, and definitely deserve 5 stars.
