 I've been having a love affair with Freud blades, but now I am totally impressed with the Forrest Woodworker II. I have been getting glass smooth cuts with the Freud 60 tooth, but when I was ripping some 1" thick oak, it started to burn a little. I'm using an Incra TSIII-32 fence, so alignment is not the problem. Generally 60 tooth blades are made strictly for cross cutting. I have been getting away with using it as a general-purpose blade. The thick oak didn't quite make it. I bought the Freud, and Forrest a year ago, and have had the Forrest Woodworker II in mothballs. I put it on my Sears early (1950's) cast iron table saw. Wow, it slides through the oak like butter. I thought that being a 40-tooth blade it would do that, at the sacrifice of a smooth surface. Was I surprised; the surface was glass smooth. I did install it with the Forrest blade stabilizer. A perfectly parallel fence to the blade is essential.     Since it does so many things well, there is no need to change it. I was talking to the rep from Incra, and his Powermatic 66 never sees another blade. He mentioned that he put the Forrest on last year, and hasn't had another blade on it since.    Quite simply, this Forrest Woodworker II will give you full ripping and crosscutting capabilities, in all sorts of material, with zip tear out. (As stated in major woodworking magazine shootout of blades, it took top honors.)   It must be the pitch of the teeth, the sharpness of the blade, the balance and trueness that all add up to doing what most others don't do. In the past it was a trade off, use fewer teeth, and get some marks, or use more teeth, and get smoothness for crosscutting, but a lot of resistance for ripping.     It may cost twice the money of the other blades, but it's worth it. Now I understand what everybody was talking about. Highly recommended.
