 Danny Proulx created a book that has all the ingredients that really matter. He covers all the different types of doors and drawers, and the essential techniques required to build them. Combining this book with experience at woodworking basics, and you are on your way to making first class custom cabinets and doors. I like his tips, notes, and safety notes. Gleaning from 30 years of experience, he mentions the common pitfalls in many of the applications.     I had bought some router bits from a gentleman in Canada, who was very helpful. He referred me to someone he knew, who really knew what they were talking about. He referred me to Danny Proulx the author.I coincidentally had bought his book the week before, and was then recommended to him.  So I wrote to him about some questions I had. He was kind enough to get back to me with specific answers. I was impressed that a renowned author with many publications to his name, would take the time out to respond to my questions. The nice thing about the author is that he really cares.    This book is a keeper. One to keep at the ready to refer to again and again when developing your next project, or for reviewing the specifics of one. It's an easy read. Engineered to simplicity. All in all I give it 5 stars.
