 The saw is very accurate. With a single thumb edge on the center of the blade to keep it straight up, you can cut a perfect angle with this saw. Blade removal replacement makes it even more desireable. These are Japanese saws. The Shark company products are available in a lot of stores, so it is not a come and go product.  The thing I am really excited about is the small pry bar. I was doing a few odd jobs around the house. I removed some flaking plaster in the ceiling of one room, using the large flat although curved (fortunately) chiseling end. It did a superb job. Then I went into the kitchen and needed to replace the weatherstripping on the kitchen door. The flat part of the chisel made quick work of removing the old weatherstrip. Then the stubborn brad nails came right out using the other end with the pry-nail removal combination.  The unique thing about this tool, is that it is not anywhere near as large as the Stanley pry bar we all, or most of us use. Yet it is large enough to do the job. Makes it comfortable to keep in a belt pouch. It truly is something you will use again and again.  The price is an advantage also, if you consider the price of the individual pieces, it is quite a saving to buy them in this combo pack.  It is especially useful for someone who does trim work, but is far to useful in any number of ways, so as to recommend it too highly to any one service. Buy it, you won't be sorry. It will become one of you top favorite tools. Hope this was helpful.
