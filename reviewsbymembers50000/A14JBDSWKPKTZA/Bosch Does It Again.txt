 I was beginning to wish I had a second cordless drill. Having to change bits frequently is all the more work. With the Bosch Clic system, you just pop the bit in the holder, pull the head back, it clicks and holds your bit. To change, it is intuitive because as you pull the chuck forward it releases the bit as you pull the bit out, all in one motion. Just like putting the bit in, in one sweep. In goes the bit, and the chuck moves back to the click.    Bosch makes several clic change bit styles that work with the system, including self feeding spade bits.    The interesting thing is that the Ryobi bits fit it perfectly as well. I wound up stocking up at the local home center on other bits.    I was building a large outfeed table for the table saw out of red oak. Having to drill countersinks for the screws, and following with a phillips bit to set the screws, all the while clamping and unclamping the joint, made the clic change system the right tool. Saved all kinds of time, not to mention enlongating the battery life of the drill, not having to run it to change the bit fifty times.    The good thing is that the Bosch clic system works without a snag. No hang ups or binding, just smooth consistent changes. Highly recommended.
