 This blade is not a flat tooth design. It is rather an alternating bevel design. One with sharp little peaks on the outer edges in an alternating fashion. The listing currently states that it is a flat tooth design.    It does a decent job, but not as smooth as an older Freud 60 tooth that is no longer available. Of course a 60 tooth will give you a smoother edge than a 40 tooth, but both blades will rip a 3/4" piece of oak on an old Sears 1HP saw without a problem. The Freud TK306 in addition to not being flat toothed, also left a line about every eighth of an inch in the cut face. It was only a couple of thousandths deep, but deep enough to change the cut edge if sanded out. When their are other alternatives out there, I would rather not have to sand and alter my edge. Maybe it was just the one that I received, and others might not have that one protruding tooth, that probably is the cause of the problem.
