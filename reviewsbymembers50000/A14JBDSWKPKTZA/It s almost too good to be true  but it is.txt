 When I first looked at this I thought, "How can it know the exact corner?" But it does. When routing out a template guided area for example, leaving a rounded corner, you park this in the corner, one decent whack with the hammer, and to my surprise, a perfect corner. It is a very simple device. It's a 90 degree blade that slides along a very thin outer shell-guide.   No more chisel-chisel-chisel, and difficulty getting the exact angles. It works as advertised. Saves a lot of time, and does a superb job. Highly recommended.
