 I bought this Freud 8" Super Dado set, hoping to improve on my Sears Excalibur adjustable. Success! The adjustable Sears blade left a slight roundness at the bottom of the cut. When making finger joints, you could see a slight belly where the bottom of the groove met the flats of the adjoining finger. With the Freud Super Dado, it makes a perfectly flat mating. Not even a thousandths of a gap anywhere along the edge of it.  Critically speaking, their is a tiny ridge that is made when you look down into the groove at the bottom, but it is so small, that you have to scratch it up to a moving blade, or should I say multiple blades. It does not result in any edge imperfections whatsoever. At first notice, I was relieved to see a perfectly smooth cut. After using it multiple times, and looking too deeply, I noticed the tiniest ridges. I believe these ridges are a result of having to move the board across the blade, and all it takes is the slightest movement as to the heighth of the board, to cause it to get closer to the blade, and thereby giving you the tiniest ridge midstream. Even with that, their isn't anything less than a perfect seam along the outside edge, without having to do any sanding, filing, chiseling etc. It is perfect right off of the blade.  The dado this blade makes is perfectly flat, smooth, and at a perfect right angle. I just went into inspect a job that I just did in large sized wood, and did not notice even a slight edge imperfection in all of the joints I inspected.  In plain words, perfect joints, great price for a tool of this quality (zero tearout as well).  I haven't tried every dado blade out there, but I feel comfortable saying that if I had to do it all over again, I would buy this again. How do you improve on the best. Hope this helps.
