 Which Bessey clamp is the one most used? I guess that depends on the type of project you frequently do. This particular model fills a very frequently used niche when you want a medium size clamp, with good throat depth and size. The little 4" clamps are probably the ones that get the most frequently used, then comes these. I love my Bessey K-Body clamps, but they only come out when I am assembing or gluing a larger project.   When others say, that you can never get enough clamps, I have to agree with that. The more, and greater variety you have, the better off you are. The one thing for sure is that Bessey clamps are the top of the heap. I still have a little stumbling that I do when figuring out the proper angle to grip the bar when trying to tighten the clamp. It normally takes a little tweaking for it to bite. That is only because I haven't spent the time to get the knack of the angle to bite. It takes only a few seconds to figure it out, but what I should do is spend a few minutes with the Bessey's and let them teach me the sure shot technique to get them to lock on the bar when I want to tighten them up. These clamps are simply put, the best clamps I have ever used. I am sure that they will be in use for many many years. Highly recommended.
