 Unfortunately this book is out of circulation. I guess it didn't go back into print because most people buy windows rather than make them. That is a shame, because this book is well written. I had first heard about it when I bought a set of Freud router bits for making window sashes. They said, "Get Make your own handcrafted doors and windows by John Birchard to learn how to make them. It is chock full of ideas, pictures, and examples.    Windows are a critical application and this book will help you in both your window making and door making quests. I had been trying to find a copy for about a year, and finally found one available here at Amazon, after calling Sterling Publishing.    Highly recommended.
