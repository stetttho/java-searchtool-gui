 Mirka paper is not only the quality choice; it is also a bargain at Amazon prices. I had previously purchased a full box of Mirka paper for my 6" sander, in the most popular grades. Have since done a lot of sanding with it. This brand of sandpaper is great. It is aluminum oxide which lasts and lasts. Additionally the backing pad is made from thick material, so it holds up well, and won't bugger the edges of your sander.  I had a body shop for twenty years, and came to realize the advantage of quality sandpaper. The cheap stuff does not hold up. You will go through a zillion sheets of paper, and will actually cost you more because of it. The Mirka paper lasts so long, that I wind up with a used stack. By the time it is to change to a different grit, the existing piece isn't worn out yet, so I keep them.  I went into Home Depot and checked out the Norton paper, I wasn't impressed. It also costs less per box, but they only give you 25 sheets instead of 50 like these Mirka boxes. So you get twice as many sheets here for only half again as much money. Not only is it a bargain up front, then the paper lasts a lot longer, not to mention the superior job it produces. You can't beat that.  This is the paper deal you want. Load up. Mirka rules.
