 When installing a dust collection system, eliminating resistance to airflow is what it is all about. The ideal is as large a pipe as possible, flowing in a straight line, without any ridges in the surface. Of course in the real world at least some of these things wind up being less than ideal. What this Jet 4" Y-connector does, is give you a large pipe, that makes a gradual Y as opposed to a straight 90 degree angle T, and the sides of the connector are smooth. So when you need to divide your air source into two lines, this elbow does the nicest job.   The advantage of incorporating a Y connector into your system, is that you can take a single air source, connect this Y connector to it, a pair of gates, and no longer have to switch your hoses between two different pieces of equipment. All you do is open the gate to one, and close it to the other. All in all highly recommended.
