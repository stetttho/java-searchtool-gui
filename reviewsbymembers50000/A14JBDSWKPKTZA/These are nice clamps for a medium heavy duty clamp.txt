 These heavy duty models from Bessey are a lot beefier than the picture shows. Definitely a strong clamp. I bought a couple to hold things down on the drill press, and for general purpose work. The clamping mechanism works well without any hassles. Easy to adjust, lot's of pressure, and looks substantial. Highly recommended.
