 We all know that home made featherboards are makable. The problem is the way to clamp them down. Normally you are using clamps that are far reaching for a table top, or over the top of the fence, which may get in the way of your workpiece.  With the Blade Loc featherboards, they use the existing mitre slot of your table saw or router table (3/4" approx) for their grip. They have a tapered cut on a built in metal mitre track (that you can not see from the photograph) that the nut underneath mushrooms out, squeezing it against your mitre track.    Since those locking T-handles that you see are installed along a sliding groove (that you can see) you are able to slide-adjust the featherboard to meet with your workpiece. No far reaching clamps to deal with.   The feathering action is nice. They give in such a way as to make the grip as gentle or as tough as you want it. I find that with home made featherboards, that aspect is harder to control. If you cut the tongues too wide, or too thin, they can break. With the Bench Dog, they are more durable, never break, and are fully adjustable to the tension you want.   You can buy the mitre slot adapter, or style which is what I am talking about in this review. They also come with a T-nut style so you can use them in a track. That is simply a nut underneath that rides in your T-style track. They work even better than the mitre track method, which depending on your mitre track on your saw, may or may not grip as tightly as you would like, if it has even the slightest bit of oil, or waxy residue on the surface.  I must say that with either method, all in all a great piece of equipment. Handy, universal, and inexpensive considering how often you may get to use it.
