 I'm glad I have this blade for use with the Fein Multimaster. The only problem is that when you are doing a job like trying to cut through a 3/4" cedar wall to install an outlet box, it is hard to keep a perfect corner. I am not talking about keeping a perfect line, it is great for that, but when you are trying to cut an exact corner with a wide angled blade, it is hard to determine the edge. Consequently the edge of your cut can go a little wider than hoped for, leaving a tiny slit that can run out of the outside circumference of your edge lines.    For making those kind of cuts the straight blades, without the angled sides makes for a perfect job. Knowing where the edge of the blade is, even while it is sinking into the wood is the key to getting your corners exact. With the 2 1/2 inch E cut blade, the tip is harder to get a bearing on where the vibrating edge is going to leave its mark. I'm not saying that you can't do the job with this blade, but for that type of application, the square rectangular blades make it easy to do a perfect job.     I'm not knocking this 2 1/2 inch blade. As a matter of fact I like using it for covering a wide area. I can angle the face of the blade along a line, and as the back of the edge is sinking deep, the front edge is starting a new edge of the cut. All in all highly recommended. PS: Get a square-rectangular style blade as well.
