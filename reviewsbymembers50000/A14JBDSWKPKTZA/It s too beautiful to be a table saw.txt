 I've had the Powermatic 66 5HP for two weeks, and I hate to run a miter sled over the face, because the polished surface is too nice to scratch. Ok, so I got the wiring done, with a 40 amp circuit, and am starting to use the saw. I have a bunch of relevant information, and here it is.  Don't sweat being able to get it down the stairs, with a 600 plus pound shipping weight. After removing the crating, the table top comes off, with just 3 bolts, and the motor, comes off, with only 2 large bolts. What's left only weighs about 250 to 300 pounds.  The 100 pound motor is easily removed. With the top off, you can tilt the saw over onto a blanket, and rest the motor on it. Then just remove the two large bolts that hold it on. The only adjustment in replacing it, is the belt tensioning.  Everything is adjustable on this machine, including the fence. This one is dead on accurate at 90 degrees, measured with a digital protractor. Their are two allen bolts, which allow fine adjustments as well.  The blade cranking wheel assembly, has stops at 90 and 45 degrees, which are also adjustable with a bolt and securing nut.        The power button question: Yes the on off switch BOX protrudes out toward the front. The green on button is recessed into the box. It's flush with the face. So unless you have something protruding from your body, it won't accidentally go on. The off button on the other hand, sits proud of the box, and could be bumped off by accident. The price you pay for having an easy access off button.       Pertaining to the power cord: The service you need is 40 amp, which requires an 8 gauge wire from your circuit breaker panel to the outlet. Since the motor draws 24 amps on each leg of a 220 line, and the electrical standard allows for 20 percent headroom, you have a borderline 30 amp situation. With a 40 amp circuit, suggested by Powermatic for the 5HP model, you won't ever have a tripping circuit breaker. The 10 gauge wire is usually reserved for 30 amp circuits, but in this case PMatic suggests you use it for the cord from the saw to the outlet.  With the Powermatic, and Forrest Woodworker II 40 tooth blade, the cut is glass smooth. With a lesser saw, you can only run a 24 tooth blade, and that leaves saw marks in your work. Then you need to redress the edge, which creates straightness problems. With the 5HP motor, no matter how thick the hardwood stock, it is going to melt right through it. That is worth every penny of the purchase price.  This saw really is the finest piece of equipment out there. Right out of the box the flatness of the top measured diagonally spec's out at 4 thousandths of an inch. The blade run out was an incredible one ten thousandth of an inch.  Critically speaking, the top adjustment allows me to perfectly parallel it with the blade. The rear mounting bolt does not allow me to perfectly center it with the insert opening. I will have to ream out the opening-slot, so I can center the blade. It must be centered in order for the blade to be able to clear the insert when you tilt it to a 45 degree angle cut. Check it first before installing the fence etc. Also check that the cast iron extensions to the top are as flat and level when installed as the rest of the top. Here's a great tip. If the side extensions are within the .010" tolerance and you want to get that last tiny sliver of light out from under your straightedge, use aluminum foil for a shim. Foil is so slim, even using 4 or 8 folds of it won't show up as even the tiniest gap in the seam on your saw, but it will, due to the way the leverage magnifies over the distance to the edge, result in a perfect, perfect, perfect alignment all across the top. It was a wow when I discovered it, and it technically is an all metal tweaking. One other minor consideration is that they should spend more time getting the decals, and the Powermatic logo installed. They are not done critically, but then again, I have to stop treating this like a waxed Ferrari sitting in the garage, and realize this is an industrial grade cabinet saw, that is meant to give you incredible results effortlessly. No, let me say joyously. I smile every time I use it, or even look at it.  I can't recommend this saw enough. It really is miles ahead of the competition. Blade adjustment flies. You can easily lock your setting with a locking knob, in the center of the crank wheel. So when it seems like the blade setting is floating, or flying to a new setting, rest assured you can lock it in. Knowing you can come back to a perfect 90 degree setting effortlessly is great due to the stop. By setting it yourself, you can get the feel of how much pressure to put on the stop at the end of the crank. Rarely can you get a perfect 90 with a saw stop, but you can with the proper touch on this one.   I must say that customer support after the sale with Powermatic is second to none. They really stand behind their product. This saw is still made in the USA as of this writing. I don't think the Taiwan models are bad, I just received the 60B jointer, and the 719A hollow chisel Mortiser, and they really are built to Powermatic specifications. To be perfectly honest with you they were pre-set to perfection right out of the box, and were obviously built by someone who appreciated being given the privelege of doing so.   Powermatic is the one piece of equipment, that can last as long as the heirloom pieces, that are being created by it. A hundred years later, when they love the work, they can say, and this is the original saw that created it. Join the club, Go Powermatic.
