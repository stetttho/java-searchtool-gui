 This is a very nice polisher. Their is nothing wrong with it. The reason why I suggest the Milwaukee model 5540 polisher instead, even though it is a few more dollars, is because it polishes up to 2800 RPM's. 1750 is usable for a lot of purposes, but 2400 is where you want to be for the ultimate gloss in catalyzed urethanes or old world leaded lacquers. (They took the lead out years ago, and their went the glass like gloss, so next day polishing on catalyzed urethanes is the mile deep club)    I had a body shop for 20 years, did a lot of high-end cars. Spend a zillion hours behind a polisher. Had a multi step polishing procedure. First you wet sand the car with 600 grit or 800 grit wet dry sandpaper. Then you use a true silky smooth tie on lambs wool bonnet and Dupont 606 hand application compound. (The secret is after going over the car the first time with the 606S compound, put on a fresh lambs wool bonnet, and go over the car a second time. It is amazing how it improves the gloss. That way you have a true polished surface to build your protection on.  Then use liquid ebony to eliminate the swirl marks, then Maguire's machine glaze, and then hand glaze. People couldn't help but come over and ask you about the finish on the car. Three new bonnets are required) Anyhow, 1750 rpm's didn't do something, like warm up the finish enough to give you mind blowing gloss. The 5540 gives you up to 2800 RPM's with a speed setting dial, so you can tweak it in to the desired speed, which is 2400 for, automotive.    By the way the owners manual, which is available here at Amazon at this listing, and the listing on the 5540 as well shows you that the hook and loop pad is available as an option, with several different types of pads, depending on the application you are using.        Milwaukee makes great equipment, and no matter which model you choose, it is a nice piece for your arsenal. I just think the 5540 is worth the extra money, because of the increased capacity into an area that includes automotive level of finishing. Hope this helps.
