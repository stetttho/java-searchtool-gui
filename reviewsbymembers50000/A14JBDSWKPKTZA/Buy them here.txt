 These staples are designed to work with your us58 Porter Cable upholstery stapler. I have not been able to find these locally, so the best bet is to buy them here. The 3/8" doesn't have a deep bite, so they are ideal for those situations where you either don't want to come out the other side of thin material, or need to be able to release them at a later date. I guess you can tell that I use the PC stapler for a lot of uses that are not specifically upholstery. Great all around device. Staples work great, buy them here.
