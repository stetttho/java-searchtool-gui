 This book, unlike the others, gives you a step by step description of how to assemble the bench. I have some other books, and they go into the different types of benches very well. They also have some blueprints for specs of the different types. This book by Sam Allen makes it easy to understand, for us novice bench builders, how the whole thing comes together. Just one blow up diagram of his, instantly explains, how each section, from the top, the front edge, the tool tray, legs etc, all come together. Until now benches appeared to me to be made up from a lot of 4 inch stock. Not so, only certain areas are. Anyhow, this is a great book to get in your quest for the ultimate bench, and the price is wonderful for something so well illustrated. Buy it you won't be sorry.
