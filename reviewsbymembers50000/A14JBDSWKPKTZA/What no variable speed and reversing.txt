 I did a lot of looking around at medium right angle drills. The drawbacks on the Dewalt is no variable speed, and no reversing. So it may be prone to stripping screws, and now way to reverse them out when they do. Ouch. For straight drill of holes it is great.  If you have air around, and don't need to make large holes in 2x12s, the air driver Porter Cable is sweet. Has air pressure, to create torque and variable speed adjustments, and has reversing capabilities, and is the best price on the block.  My pick is the Makita 110 volt model. It has the largest amperage motor in the medium duty range, has variable speed, reversing, and an adjustable speed limiting dial, an LED light to illuminate your work, and is guaranteed to last the lifetime of the tool.  Next is the Bosch with a slightly weaker motor at 3.8 amps, and doesn't have the speed range of the Makita, even though it is at the same price. Nice overall tool though.  Then comes the Milwaukee 55 degree angle drill. Fine for additional leverage while drilling, but could be a problem for deeper access areas when making 90-degree applications. Especially important in crammed quarters, when you would have to swing the body out the additional 35 degrees to get a 90-degree angle.  Black and Decker makes a lightweight unit, and will suffice for the occasional weekend warrior.  The Dewalt unit, fills a niche, but is a very good example of getting what you pay for. If it were not for the no reversing, and no variable speed capabilities, and for making the paddle switch so long, that gets in the way, even when you don't want it to, makes the unit, strictly for those who are price conscious first, and tool conscious later.  Wake up and smell the Makita. :-)
