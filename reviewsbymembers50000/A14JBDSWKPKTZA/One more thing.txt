 The large review written here, really covered all of the bases. The one more thing worth mentioning, is that Freud sells the larger more popluar 1 1/2" reveal in a set, which has the 3 1/2" bit to make it, plus the stile and rail set. They come in different part numbers starting with 97-  So two of them for example are 97-100, and 97-104. Be sure your router base is at least 3 5/8" to accept them.     It does not include the glue up joint bit, or the drawer lock bit. The glue up joint bit is great for mating a number of panels. Avoids the lip of one or more boards sitting a little proud, that is frequently a problem. It is not a problem, if you have a very large sanding station, belt or drum, you can send a complete door through and get all of the surfaces even. For the rest of us, a glue up bit is just what the doctor ordered. What happens is that you run the bit in adjoining pieces. One piece is run face up, then next is run face down. Then the two mate together perfectly, as long as you have the registration set proplerly. When the boards are clamped-compressed together, they line up. The other thing is the drawer lock bit, which gives you the drawer front, by (rabbetting) the back of the drawer front, including and edge lip which is beneficial to ensure a clean close.   Freud bits are superior in the job they do. They leave a clean finish on the work, and saves a lot of time not having to sand out imperfections. All in all this is a very nice set. Highly recommended.
