 This really is a must have once you realize the job that they do, and how uniquely they do it. Like many others I have been going to my local home center and buying clear plastic throw away lenses. All to quickly they are thrown away. The problem is many fold. They fog up, they scratch up bad enough to need to be tossed after what seems like a minimum number of wipings, and are they really "safety glasses". The MSA Safety Works are OSHA approved. They never fog up, and I mean never. With the cheaper ones, I can't tell you how many times I am in the thick of it, and the glasses steam up so bad that you have to toss them aside, just to see what you are doing. These MSA's don't fog up no matter how hot and sweaty you are getting. In August heat, in the middle of a tough job, I would stop and take a paper towel to wipe the sweat off of my face because it was beginning to burn my eyes, and the glasses weren't fogging even a little bit.    Their other big benefit is when wiping the dust off of them, I have yet to see a single scratch on the surface.     I bought these at the same time I purchased a pair of the safety glasses with the 1.5 bifocal lenses for about twice the money. My eyesight for tiny details has waned, I am over forty, and they enable me to see the 32's or 64's, or even the perfect hairline on the measuring rules. That way I can see the whole shop in total clarity, and when I need a little boost for  the up close magnification, I'm there. Those are highly recommended as well.    I don't think their is anything more important, and more susceptible to damage than your eyes. Invest in the most important tool in your shop: You. Highly recommended.
