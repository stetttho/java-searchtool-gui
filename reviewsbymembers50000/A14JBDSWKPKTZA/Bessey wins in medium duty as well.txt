 The nice thing about the Bessey Tradesmen's is that they are heavier duty than the competition, in the medium duty class, and you don't have to take out a second mortgage to afford a set of them. The locking mechanism works without any hassles, and the grip is strong. All in all a nice piece of equipment. A major competitor sells this model for less money, but it is also a lighter weight clamp. I like them all. Bessey makes great stuff, you can't go wrong with these. They are a great general-purpose clamp. Highly recommended.
