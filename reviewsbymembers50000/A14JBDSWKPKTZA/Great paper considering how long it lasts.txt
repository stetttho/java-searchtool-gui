 When I first bought my Bosch 3727DVS, I bought a box of the popular grades; 80, 100, 120, 150, 180, 220, and 320. The 100, 120, and 150 are the most frequently used.To tell you the truth, I rarely use the 320. I just went through over 50 boards of 80+ inch cedar, in three grades, and I only used about 10 sheets all combined. That is about 3 for each grade. The advantage to quality paper, is that you can get in a groove with some consistency. Instead of having cheaper paper that gives you the new disc agressiveness, then quickly to the used paper smoothness, which may be a grade finer, and miss the deeper lines from the coarser grade of paper in the previous step. Additionally the backing paper is stiff enough to do the job. That way you don't wind up with a buggered edge on your sander. The 6 or 8 hole paper is nice for the dust free environment. I simply attach a 2 1/2" vac hose to the dust port on my Bosch, which is way smaller than that, so a lot of air escapes. The vacuum draw that leaks around the inlet, sucks up that last 1% of the dust coming off the paper. It is still recommended to wear a mask because the shop vacs only capture to a micron or so. So technically you have a vac system that is actually a mini-part of a micron, invisible dust manufacturing plant. Over time, even that is a consideration. A good respirator, not a paper mask is advisable. A fresh air system is even better.  I had a body shop for 20 years, and after using the cheaper paper on the random orbit sanders, and winding up with a floor full of used paper, I can attest to the savings of using quality, aluminum oxide paper. It is actually cheaper, in addition to doing a better job. Highly recommended.
