 I had a body shop for 20 years. Did a lot of high end cars, and spent a lot of time behind a polisher. Now I am doing woodwork and need to get the same kind of results. The problem is that with woodwork, most of the time, you are working on smaller, intricate surfaces, as compared to the big flat panels on a car. Consquently a 2400 RPM polisher is not what the doctor ordered. Unfortunately 2400 RPMs is where mile deep gloss arrives. So what to do. I just ordered the Milwaukee variable speed 11 amp polisher. The speed range is 0-2800 with a pre set dial for fixing a setting, so I can slow it down for the delicate areas, and still maintain the option of cranking it up for the larger flat surfaces. I also purchased the hook and loop backing pad. That is where this Porter Cable wool pad comes in. It is difficult to tell just how much nap their is on a pad when ordering from a picture online. My old favorite is a super plush 7 inch tie on lambswool bonnet. By the time you wrap it around a backing pad, it makes for a larger edge than you would normally need for the intracacies of wood projects. That is where these Porter Cable hook and loop pads come in. The texture is very fine and smooth. Very thick and dense as well. The nap is only about 1/2" deep. That makes it very manageable for tight spaces. It is good for getting a lot of control when working up close to an ajoining surface. Using this pad on a random orbit sander is ok for a gentle rubbing effect. If you are planning on building a solid layer of finish, and polishing it to a deep gloss that is glasslike by using compounds, you will need a regular polisher. The nice thing about these Porter Cable polishing pads, is that they work with either type of machine, as long as they have a hook and loop backing pad.  All in all these Porter Cable pads, with their tight yet silky smooth nap, fill a niche for polishing that is very helpful. Hope this helps.
