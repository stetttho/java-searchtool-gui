 I'm into woodworking. These Bahco scrapers come in handy. Great for getting into corners to remove glue squeeze out after it has hardened. The 1" model has a triangulated blade with three sharpened edges. (So you can spin it around to change the outer edge to a fresh side) So it has a nice point to it for getting into corners without having to rub the sides of your project. I cut a kerf of 3/4" to make a crosscut miter sled, for the runner, and needed to clean up the bottom. I turned the scraper to an angle, and it cleaned it up beautifully.    I bought the 2 1/2" as well. It acts like a cabinet scraper, and you don't have to resharpen it much. If you need to take a hair off of a surface, clean it up remove something from the surface it is a handy tool. The large plastic handle makes it easy to hold. Overall does a very nice job. I recommend the 1" and the 2 or 2 1/2" as well.
