 I wanted to add to my other review. It is important to know that the SS2875 is the same exact miter saw stand as the SS2875XL, except that the upper shelf is 9" longer on the XL. Every other part of the SS2875 is exactly the same. Same thick materials, same heavy gauge setup. The manufacturers information ... identifies some of the larger saws Delta 36-235K, Bosch 3912B/3915B, Porter-Cable 3802/3807, Makita LS1211/1212, DeWalt DW705/708 & Milwaukee 6496/6497  ... I contacted Rousseau about this, and they reassured me, that they  are both the same stand, except for the 9" difference in the shelf-platform. You could use the XL with a smaller saw, but you create a larger distance from your saws base, to the beginning of the extension wings. If you do have the XL with a 10" saw, you may choose to offset the installation to the left, bringing it to within 1/8" of the stop system. Or you could center it, then move the stop measuring system over to the right, to an eighth of an inch of your saws fence.  So the XL can work with a smaller saw, although it is best to mate it up with the proper model, to shorten the overall distance from the left and right wings.     I have to say, overall, once you set it up, and calibrate your measuring system, look forward to setting aside your tape measure, with the floppy tab on the end, and drawing a pencil line, that is difficult to decipher. Just set the hairline on your stop system, lay down your board, and cut it to the perfect length.     Rousseau seems to go the extra mile in their engineering, and this stand is a good example of that. Hope this helps.
