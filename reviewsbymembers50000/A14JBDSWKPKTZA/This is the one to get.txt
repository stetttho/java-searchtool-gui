 When reading Woodworking with a router, I noticed the author stated, that after getting a standard size router, your second router should be a laminate trim router. It is so versatile. Since it is smaller than most routers, it is more manageable. Shop made jigs using a router, are best done with one of these. Since it takes the standard 1/4" bits, it makes it a convenient, multi use tool.   If you do a lot of counter top, laminate work, their combo pack, with the different bases, is the top choice. Saves a lot of money over buying the individual bases.   I looked at some overseas, and the Ryobi model, and decided to spring for the Porter Cable. The metal base, and fine adjust feature, and metal housing, set it apart. This is a professional level piece of equipment. Should give you many years of trouble free performance.   When you are doing fine work, the lightness, and ease of visibility afforded by this router, is unmatched.   If I had to be critical of it, I would say that when changing a bit, I remove the base, which isn't that hard, for easy access. The base is designed to come on and off real easy, since it is one part of a multi base system.   All in all, definitely 5 stars. The more you use it, the more it will become your favorite one.
