 The swiss make great knives and jig saw blades! :-) These Bosch blades are swiss made. It is stamped on the side. The instructions tell you to wear gloves when changing blades. I didn't listen, and my finger glanced against the edge, and it created a shaving of my skin. Do I wear gloves when I change bits? No, but I am very careful to grab just the back of the blade.    Blades this sharp make a very clean cut, and will fly through the material. I cut an eight foot piece of MDF with one of these, using a straight waste edge of a sheet of plywood as a guide. It came out so well it looked like a factory cut edge.    Combining these blades with the Bosch jig saw, gives you the best combination in the industry. Highly recommended.
