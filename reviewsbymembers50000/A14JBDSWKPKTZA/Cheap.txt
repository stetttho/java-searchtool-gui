 I am impressed with some of the products being produced by Taiwan. These are in the junk category. They flex like crazy. More importantly, I used one to drill some holes in oak, which is wood, not metal, and they dulled after only a few drillings.    I bought these on a whim. I need some long drill bits for a job I was doing, noticed these were the only ones available here at Amazon at the moment, and they were cheap. So I got what I paid for. If you need long drill bits only once in a while, and have a drill bit sharpener handy, they are not too bad. For that reason I give it 3 stars.
