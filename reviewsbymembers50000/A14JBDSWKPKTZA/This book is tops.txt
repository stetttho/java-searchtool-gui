 I was looking for a book that would show me how to re-upholster antique French Provincial furniture. This book shows you how. It is so well illustrated, that I wouldn't hesitate to tackle the job myself. Complete instruction on how to install padding, liners or fabric, stapling the edge, then trimming the overage, then installing the braiding with brass tacks. To look at the outside, I always thought it was attached with the tacks, when in reality, the material is attached first underneath with staples. That creates an even overall attachment. Then  you can concentrate on adding the brass tacks to the brading-cover evenly.  That is just one example of the step by step instructions-something unusual in most books. A picture says a thousand words, so it is well illustrated with photographs.    It is easy to be disappointed in how to books, this is not one of them. I don't have anything negative to say about this book at all. Buy it, you won't be sorry.
