 I have to be honest with you. I have this Stanley 20-331 pull saw, as well as several of the Shark Corp Japenese made pull saws. Stanley makes a lot of nice tools, but this saw is not the one I go for when I want to make a fine cut. Exactly why the engineering and ergonomics are superior on the Shark saws I am not sure, but they are. Trying to get an even and smooth cut on a dowel, or dovetail, the Sharks work better. The Stanley snags on the workpieces more often.     I'm not saying the Stanley is a bad saw, it just isn't on the level with the Shark brand.     One item worth mentioning is that it is rather small. The object with these pull saws is to get the perfect angle and a smooth cut based on the amount of resistance you place on the workpiece. Once the flow is there, it is beneficial to have a longer draw with a longer blade. Snags are apt to happen at the beginning of the cut. So a short stroke, equals the potential for a lot of snags.    Flush cut pull saws are an art form in their use. Trying to get a perfectly clean and flush cut without scarring the work surface is a challenge. The safer way is to slightly overcut it, and use a random orbit sander to take it down to flush.    The nice thing about the flush cut saws is that they take off a good deal of material with very little effort. With coarser teeth on one side, and finer on the other, most applications are covered.    I'm not trying to bash the Stanley, it is not a bad tool, just not the feel and result of the Shark line. Hope this helps.
