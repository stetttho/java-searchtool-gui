 The Bosch clic change also has a very intuitive method of working. Inserting a new bit into it is easy. The bit goes in and in the same movement, you continue right over the bit to the head of the clic change system, seating it down and locking it. When you want to remove the bit, you pull the head outwards, and once again in a single stroke remove the bit at the same time. Leave it to Bosch to make on of the best designed systems.    The good thing about the Bosch is that it accepts 1/4" head bits from a lot of different manufacturers available locally.    I also bought the Bosch 27 piece clic change set with this one, and then discovered the wide array of 1/4" devices with the same head configuration.    All in all, the Bosch holds the bit very true and won't slip out. Yet the bits come on and off easily. Very nice unit, highly recommended.
