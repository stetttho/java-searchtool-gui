 I had just bought an Olympus C-2040 digital camera (see my review) which I totally love, and I guess I got swept up in the Olympus thing, so I bought a set of these binoculars. After reading the reviews, I was convinced that these were the best way to go. When I received them, I was shocked, and felt a little stupid for not listening to the reviewer who mentioned that they were not for the wide eyed: I could only see through one lense at a time. If I lined my one eye up, the other one was completely out of the other eyepiece. By opening both eyes, I was looking at the painted body of the lense. My head is large, but I thought that it would be in the ballpark, and for the price, it was worth a little inconvenience, but this pair of binoculars is so small that it is IMPOSSIBLE for me to see through them with both eyes, even if I cut my view on both lenses in half. I can't do it that way either. As corny as this may sound, I just went up to the mirror, with a 12" ruler, and measured my eyes, and they are exactly 2 1/2" apart. That's center of eyeball to center of eyeball. These binoculars measure 1 1/4" closed, and only 1 1/2" fully open. That once again is center of eyepiece lense, to center of eyepiece lense. I can just see everybody reading this review, going to their mirrors, and taking a measurement. :-) Hey I am serious, those are the exact measurements. It's a shame, because these things are cool looking, and look crystal clear, as long as I see through them using one eye. Hope this helps.
