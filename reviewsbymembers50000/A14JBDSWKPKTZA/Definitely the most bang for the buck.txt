 I have two NEC Multisync 95 19 inch monitors. At the time I shopped the entire store to see what the best video picture was. Hands down the Sony flat screen CRT was the best at almost twice the price of the NEC. A close second was the NEC. It was clearly a better picture than everything else in the store. It was more expensive at the time, then it is now.    In a time when everyone is going LCD flat screen, mini slim monitor crazy, I have come to realize that the CRT monitors have a huge edge on picture quality-dollar value. Mating that to the fact that they are the least expensive, and you have a winner. Personally, I don't mind that one foot of real estate being taken up by the back of the monitor, when I can buy a larger unit for less money, and a superior picture. I must admit LCDs have come along way since they were introduced. Then new NEC LCD1725 is a beautiful picture, and the Sony 19 is as well. For the most part LCD pictures are quite disappointing. Even the expensive Plasma screens at ten times the money, don't give you the clarity of the Sony, and are still tweaked out by the NEC.      The difference in size allows me to move the monitor farther away from me, so the miniscule radiation is of no effect.    The thing about the LCDs is that they have a two dimensional quality about them. Some even have a cartoon appearance. It's a fad, but clearly an inferior picture for twice the price.    What does this all have to do with this NEC monitor? Everything. This NEC is an incredible monitor for the money. You would be hard pressed to find anything else in the marketplace that can compare to it. In a Consumer Reports review of monitors, they rated Sony, NEC, and Dell the best.    NEC on their web site, have a full suite of drivers, and software downloads available 24/7.     Well enough monitor talk for now. Hope this helps.
