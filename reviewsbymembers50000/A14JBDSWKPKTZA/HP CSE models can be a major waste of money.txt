 I don't usually write reviews for items less than 4 stars, but I feel I have to say something here. I bought an HP 820CSE Professional Series, and it gave me excellent print quality, but several months after I bought it, the ink carriage froze up, and made a loud grinding noise. I called HP tech service (it was under warranty) and after going through a 15 step process, he told me it was defective, and would need to be replaced, with a refurb. I was impressed that they sent a replacement to my door, and requested that the defective one be reboxed, in the one they sent me and returned. They provided a new ink cartridge, with the refurb, so I said all is well with HP. Then 6 months later, the same exact problem came up. Loud grinding. This time I called them, and they told me it was 2 weeks out of warranty, and their was nothing they could do. Hey a one year warranty is a one year warranty agreement, but considering I used it only occassionally, and paid [a lot of money] for it, I was more than a little disapointed. (...) So take the other reviewers comments seriously. I got burnt.
