 I purchased the Bosch rear handle worm drive construction saw. I like the handle on the rear of the saw. It is ideal for cutting vertically directly away from you. A top handle saw is better for making cuts horizontally, as in across the front of you. What did Milwaukee do? They made a multi-position handle. That way you have all options open to you. No need to buy two saws. Milwaukees penchant for power is evident in this saw as well. My hat's off to Milwaukee, their engineering did it again. Highly recommended.
