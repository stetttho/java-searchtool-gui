 When I use these clamps, I adjust the pressure by how snugly I fit the foot of the clamp. If I have thicker material and want to clamp real tight, I slide the foot up tight against the edge, and then push down the lever. If I want a slightly lighter clamping pressure, then I leave a hair gap offset, before clamping it down.    If I had to get critical of working with these, I would say two things. 1) You have to be working on a relatively flat surface underneath. If you are on two horses, and you have a sheet of plywood, it tends to bow. Then the clamp can not create a flat workedge. Wherever it is low, their is a valley, or a loss of the clamp edge flat on the material. This is to be expected, of course, and is not a problem, if you have a supporting sheet, or a couple of two by's on top of the horses. 2) In order to create a square cut (90 degrees) you need to use a carpentars square to line it up. (As compared to a table saw, with large tables, which is preconfigured to be square.) Be that as it may, you can't beat these for giving you a great tool guide for lots of different purposes. These make a very good, far reaching clamp. It will not creep a setting, if you are using it for an overnight glue up.    Their lightweight, yet strong. If your careful, you can keep your saw tight against the edge. For a heftier version, check out Tru-Grips pro series. They are over 5 inches wide, and have t-tracks, and a special indentation to accomodate their router base, circular saw base, and stop. That creates error free straight lines out on the job. The come in 2, 4, and 8 foot sizes. All of them are a few inches larger than their stated size. For example the 4 foot, will handle workpieces up to 54 inches.    I highly recommend Tru-Grip products, both for their usability, engineering, and quality build.
