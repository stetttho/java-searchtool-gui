 This book covers some areas that will enable you to build some of the finest pieces of woodworking and furniture. For example a step by step explanation of how to create a flaming finial, to top off your best projects is illustrated: From the beginning of turning it on a lathe, to the first level of carving the flutes, to each successive layer. The one he creates out of walnut is the style that I like the most. Additionally making a claw foot, is well illustrated, just the same.  This book does not cover the basics, so one to add to your collection, as either a hopeful, or an advanced course of applications. It is a motivator, because he shows you the kind of work, that inspires us into higher levels in the art form.  Well illustrated, with clear photographs and descriptions. All in all a 5 star book, you will want to feature it on your book shelf, and in the works you will be motivated and instructed to create.
