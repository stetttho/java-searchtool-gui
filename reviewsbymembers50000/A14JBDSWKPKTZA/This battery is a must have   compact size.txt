 If you own the Canon Digital Elph series, you enjoy a camera that is superb at being totally portable, as in pop it in your shirt pocket, always at the ready, but small batteries have limited storage capacity. Maybe someday, technology will remedy that, but for the present, bigger is better. I bought one of these Canon battery packs for my brother as a Christmas present. His Canon digital elph 100 was capable of getting about 25 pictures, as long as he didn't use the LCD preview sceeen, or the flash. If he did, then it was further reduced. So one of these batteries is a neccessity. You trade off convenience and portability for function. The battery is not inexpensive as well.   I bought an Olympus C-240, which is almost the same width as the Canon, but significantly deeper, due to the battery storage area at one end, and the lense. Consequently I get over 150 shots, with inexpensive rechargeable AA batteries. It holds 4. Seven times the usage, and less than half of the price.    I must admit, my brother gets a lot more use out of his Canon digital elph than I get out of my Olympus. He has the luxury of carrying it with him most of the time. He pops it in his pocket at will. For me I have to lug a somewhat small, but nevertheless, a camera bag around with me. He loves his Canon, and because of the convenience, wouldn't hesitate to buy another one. As a matter of fact, he bought three altogether, so his teenage sons would have one as well.   Get the extra battery. It is the only one that will fit into the Canon cameras custom fit and enclosure. (I am not sure if a replacement mfr is available, and what that would do to the warranty) With the second battery, a fun night of picture taking is assured.
