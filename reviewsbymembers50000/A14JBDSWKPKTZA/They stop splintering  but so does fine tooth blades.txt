 I thought that since they were clear plastic, they would do the job, and not get in the way of being able to see the line. Wrong! They fog up with wood dust on the underside, right away, and the line is impossible to see. When I wanted to see where my marks were at the end of the cut, I had to guess.    In terms of getting a straight aim, Bosch put a V groove on the leading edge. If you were making a completely through cut, then the splintering inserts are a good thing to have. But when I tried to see where my cut would stop, it was buried under the insert, and couldn't see my mark. So I guessed. The net result is an inaccurate cut. When I took the insert off, I could make the cut, and come to an exact mark.    The insert blocks the blower from being able to get to the wood, so it is only cleaning off the top. Having used it both ways, it is nowhere near as good as eyeballing the blade.    I know they are inexpensive, so I shouldn't get so excited. The reason why I feel bad is that one came with the jigsaw, and instead of using it, I went ahead and bought a five pack of them.    I used a finer tooth blade, made my cuts into 3/4" oak with the splintering inserts installed. It made a very smooth cut without splintering. I removed the inserts, and used the same finer tooth blade, made my cuts, and it also made a very smooth cut without splintering.     End of story, just use a good finer tooth blade. The Bosch blades are Swiss made, and they are so sharp they are almost scary. They fly through the material, and don't create any splinters, just clean smooth edges.    My advice, put the money toward a new pack of fine tooth blades.
