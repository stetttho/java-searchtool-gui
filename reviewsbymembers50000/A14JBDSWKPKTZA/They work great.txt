 These staples are designed to work with your us58 Porter Cable upholstery stapler. The fact that they are galvanized means that they are designed to last a long time without rusting. I have not been able to find these locally, so the best bet is to buy them here. The 1/2" has a deeper bite, so they are ideal. I use the PC stapler for a lot of uses that are not specifically upholstery. Great all around device. Staples work great, buy them here.
