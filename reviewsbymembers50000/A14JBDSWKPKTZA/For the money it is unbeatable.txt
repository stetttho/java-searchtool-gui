 For the money this 3D Home Architect 4.0 can't be beat. You can easily build walls, install windows, cabinets, fixtures, doorways, etc. The impressive thing is that if you want to resize something, like a wall, it displays in a revolving manner the actual wall dimension. The full camera enables you to click on a spot and get a full view of what your design looks like in its completion. The amount of detail, like being able to put paintings on the wall, or custom effect painting is not an option. As you go up the chain of Broderbund software you gain a lot more in the way of small details. That gives you a more finished look, rather than a comic book level of realization. If you are a design professional, and need to show customers a print out of what their new design for the kitchen will look like, this is great for that. Placing cabinets, refrigerator, windows and doors, tables and chairs, windows etc, are easy to place and move around. As far as minute accuracies of wall and cabinet sizes, you gain more precision as you move up the versions. In Better Homes and Gardens version, which is a spin off of the same people who give us Chief Architect, you get more specifics.       Starting with Home Architect 4.0, then up to Better Homes and Gardens Designer Suite 6 for twice the money, and Designer Pro 6 for ten times the money, and finally Chief Architect 9.5 for twenty times the money. (These prices can vary during the life of this review, so check the product pages for current prices) Each of these programs give you more and more details. They are all usable in the upgraded program. Since they are all made by the same people, you can open a cheaper versions creation and embellish it with the additional tools. Their is some confusion over 3D Home Architect 5.0 not being compatible with 4.0 even though it is a Broderbund Product and therefore uses different tools, and is not usable for existing works in the Broderbund family. If you go to the listing on Architect 5.0 you can read a review explaining that further.           If you buy Chief Architect Deluxe 9.5 from Broderbund you get very exacting software. In Chief you can size a wall as specifically as you want, and do the same with cabinets windows etc. By double clicking on a wall for example, up comes a window and you can type in a very specific dimension like 17' 8 3/16", and it will automatically size the wall to that dimension. In 4.0 you can only resize the wall in 1" increments, and cabinets in 3" increments.  These versions come with a library of different styles of furniture, windows etc. The Chief Architect even carries specific models of some popular manufacturers with their specific dimensions. Jeld Wen windows are an example of that. (Andersen and Pella are not included??)     In Chief you getter higher quality 3D models.... With Chief you get full CAD editing and too many features than would be advisable to list in a review of 4.0. If you would like to try a free demo version of Chief Architect Deluxe 9.5, you can do so by downloading it from the Chief Architect site. It is 17 megabytes so if you are using 56K it will take quite some time. The demo version is a full version with certain limitations, not the least of which is being able to save your work or print it. In addition the libraries are limited.     Overall I like the program, the learning curve is enjoyable due to being able to just click on build, choose a wall, a cabinet, window etc, and lay it out on the screen.  All in all I highly recommend the program.. For the money, 4.0 is unbeatable.
