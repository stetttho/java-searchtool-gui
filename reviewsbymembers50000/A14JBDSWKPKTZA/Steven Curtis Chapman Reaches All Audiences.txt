 I never thought I would say this, but I love songs that touch my heart, and a little on the gentle side. That is why I really like "Love Takes You In", "Magnificent Obsession", and "Save Me" on this CD, and I know the more I listen to them, my appreciation will grow even deeper. I also know that I will be glad I bought this CD, just for those songs.  I'm of the generation, that was weaned on Eric Clapton, Hendrix, and the like. I have a 1966 Fender Telecaster, that I bought new back then, similar to the one he has on the face of the CD. Great guitar.    I feel I have a responsibility to comment that if you are not into todays younger music, you are not going to appreciate the rest of the CD. If you are into todays younger music, then you will love the whole CD.    The early songs on this CD, which generally speaking, have a lot of performers in them, have a recording quality to them, that is reminiscent of a boxy, early sound. I know from recording, that once you add 50 different microphones to a cut, you are getting 50 more people in, but you also get 50 times the noise. It is a recording basic.    I never thought I would be writing anything less than the highest praise, when it comes to him, but this is the first time I have mixed emotions.    I'm a devout SCC fan. I have turned so many people on to him. I see people a month later, they grab my arm, and say, "That is all I listen to any more." He is that great.   If your gently moving up in the years as I am, you will appreciate all of SCCs earlier CD's, and another one of his recent (1999) CD's called Speechless, all the more. I just bought all three of these CD's with "The Music of Christmas" being the third.    I listened to Speechless just once so far, and know I will be wearing out a CD player, playing that one, again and again.    I have all of SCCs CD's, and he really is a shining Dove in a sea of confusion.
