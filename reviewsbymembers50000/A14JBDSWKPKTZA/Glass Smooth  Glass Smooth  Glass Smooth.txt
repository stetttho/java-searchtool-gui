   I bought this bit as part of Freuds cabinet making set. I hooked it up to a table that I have Bosch's 3 1/4hp plunge router mounted to. I forgot about the necessity of setting the speed slower to accommodate larger bits and sent the 3/4" piece of oak sailing through at the full setting. Out came a silky smooth panel. It didn't chip, sputter, kick, wobble, or even slow down the router. I wonder what it would be like if it wasn't a brand new bit with a fresh edge on it. Anyhow, I use the bit now at a slower speed setting, and make multiple passes. Freuds cabinet making set is so well made, that their is little motivation to pick up a shaper. Shapers are known for 10,000 RPMs, thereby creating panels in a single pass that are smooth.    I have never bought a bad Freud bit. Them and Whiteside are my pride and joys. I also recommend picking up an inexpensive carbide tipped set on eBay that are imported. You can get a large selection of profiles and types for the cost of a couple of bits. When making painted moldings for example, you don't need the ultimate in sheen on the wood surface. Although with the dollar conversion and the daily monetary needs overseas, it is amazing how much quality can be produced for such a little bit of money.   Freud and Whiteside are the best, although their are several manufacturers, such as CMT and Viper that are quality bits as well. This Freud cabinet making bit is worthy of your best projects. Buy it you won't be sorry.
