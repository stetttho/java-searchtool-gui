 I have three Porter Cable finish nailers, the 18 gauge brad nailer, the 16 gauge finish nailer, and the 15 gauge angle finish nailer.   Excuse me for stating the obvious, but the 18 gauge leaves the tiniest hole, which is nice for clear finish work. The 16 gauges hole is a bit larger, but still acceptable for clear finishes on larger trim work. The new 15 gauge, actually leaves a D Shaped hole. It is kind of large, and is designed for putty and paint. The 15 gauge is a bear though. When you fire it for the first time, POW, you know it is stronger than the 16. Although I haven't had any unusual problems with the depth drives on the 16, other than knot concerns.   If I had to choose one nailer, instead of all three, I would say this 16 gauge would give you the most universal use.   This 16 gauge, has great ergonomics, fires reliably, (keep your finger off of the trigger when plunging the nose) and overall does a very nice job. Keep it oiled.
