 The Fein Multimaster is an exceptional tool. The concave cutting blade that comes with the multimaster kit, does a nice job, but it dulls rather quickly. It is not made out of the hardened steel of the Feins optional blades. They are pricey, but the quality is there. The thing this kit does for you is give you the most frequently used blades at a substantial savings over their individual prices. The professional kit that superceded this one, was for the same price, and did not include the extra blade. The price you have to pay for just a couple of the pieces, you can buy the whole kit. This super professional kit is one sweet deal. Softens the price of the tool at least a little bit.
