 When I first saw a bowl turned out of green wood, and it was so thin, you could almost see through it, it caught my attention. That is what interested me in this book. The author does an excellent job of explaining how to work green wood, and it is well illustrated in the photographs.   When I saw a bowl at the woodworking show, and the artist illuminating the inside with a light bulb, so he could determine just how thich each part of the wall was. It all made sense. This book will give you everthing you need to know, and get you started on your own translucent bowl creation. Tools, lathe settings, and choosing your wood is covered. Highly recommended, and a sure fire way for guests to ask you about your creations.
