 I'm a multi router owner person. It seems that no matter what router I am using, they all accept the Porter Cable template guides. They work in the Dewalts, Makitas, or course the Porter Cables, as the description says, but they also work in the Fein Rt-1800, and with the Bosch routers as well with the adapter.  Template guides are useful when routing out a piece of work using a template as a guide. The appropriate size guide to accomodate the size router bit, simply attaches to your plastic or metal removable center base plate, using the template guide, and a threaded metal securing ring. The gap distance between the outer edge of the template guide, and the leading edge of your router bit, is the oversize dimension you have to make your template. The template guide prevents the edge of the router bit from touching your template. The protruding nipple-collar accomplishes that. To accomplished routists that earn a duh no kidding award, but to the new guys on the block, that is key to know, and opens up a new world, and a reason to buy the kit.   The Porter Cable 42000 kit is made out of white metal. Their are some manufacturers that make them out of brass, but this kit is hard to beat. The price is right, and it does the job more than adequately. My one gripe is that they are hard to remove from the metal base plate in my Fein. No way to grip the spinninng bottom that sits perfectly flush with the plate. A huge rubber eraser might help. :-) I plan on coating them with WD-40 so that ease of removal doesn't become a problem. All in all a very nice set.
