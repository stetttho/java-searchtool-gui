 These clamps are relatively small, but that is what makes them so handy. The size belies the power. Strong enough for most tasks. Inexpensive enough to have several. It is intuitive to use. The clamp and release mechanism are goof proof. I like them very much, and are one of my favorites for many purposes.    If you are into Bessey clamps, these make a nice addition to your arsenal, or if you just need some light duty, general purpose clamps, these fill the bill nicely. Highly recommended.
