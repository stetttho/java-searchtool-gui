 The 5 piece set is what I initially bought. It includes the glue up joint bit, which is nice for gettting a lot of panels to line up properly while gluing. It also includes the door lock bit, which will turn your raised panel, into a drawer front by removing the material around the edge of the back of the door face.  I bought this set as well. Why? Because when making kitchen cabinets, the raised panel bit that they provide with the 5 piece set is too small for a large cabinet. (Unless you prefer that look) So I bought this set, to pick up the 3 1/2" panel raising bit. That requires a large opening of at least 3 5/8" on the bottom of your router, and the opening on your router table as well. The Bosch 1619EVS is even larger than that. The Fein RT-1800 allows for the the use of a 3 1/2" bit, but the casting prevents you from plunging a bit that size. Not really recommended, because you might accidently adjust it into the base. Their are others also, but most fixed base 2 HP routers won't accept such a large bit. So measure first.  Overall this is a great set of bits. They do a great job, and last a long time. Highly recommended.
