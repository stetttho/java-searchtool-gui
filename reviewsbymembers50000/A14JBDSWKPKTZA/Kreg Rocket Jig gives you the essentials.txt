 Kreg Rocket Jig gives you the essentials by including the jig, the drill bit, driver bit, and clamp. Technically that is all you need to create the pocket holes that are rated the best. So this rocket has all of the advantages, without the price, but it requires more time to set up each project. Once you get into the advantages of pocket hole joinery, you probably will want more of the complete kit.  Kreg Pocket Hole offerings made the number one spot across the board in the November 2003 issue of Better Homes and Gardens "Wood" magazine. Everything from the mini on through to the automated production machine were given the top ratings. It was a clean sweep for Kreg. They tested a lot of machines too. Some of the advantages are the flush edge joining to the workpiece prevented tearout. The case hardened steel guides didn't show wear or metal shavings. Easy to make or buy the premade plug holes out of wood. (Some were an odd shape, and wouldn't accept plugs very well)  Even though the body is made out of plastic, which is substantial and well done, the steel guides are the only thing the drill bit touches.  Pocket hole joinery is a nice addition to your arsenal. You will find yourself incorporating it more and more into your projects, and the Kreg system is the best. Highly recommended.
