 I bought the BN125A at the same time that I bought the 16 gauge. At the time I saw the price on the 18 and figured, it was a good idea to have both. At a later date, I discovered the BN200A, and that was an 18 gauge brad nailer as well, and accepted the 3/4" to 2" size nails. The BN125A accepts 5/8" to 1 1/4". For only a few dollars more, I thought I should have gotten the 200A. After all, when was I going to need a 5/8" size brad instead of a 3/4" one. Then I read a great book on cabinet making, and the author stated that he saves a lot of time, and doesn't need a million clamps, by putting a 5/8" brad in the back side of the raised panel joint between the rail and stile, then frees up his clamps for the next one. The glue sets up without movement because of the twin 5/8" brad holding them together. Most raised panels are made from 3/4" stock, so a 3/4" brad would show on the face. The brad goes in with a little countersink, so it is too large for that purpose. I guess it is a good example of, instead of saying yeah this, and boo that, say, "I like them both" Now I am starting to wonder when I will ever need an 18 gauge brad that is 2" long. Sure enough I will come across a need at some point. Maybe when I can, I will pick up one of those too.  The tool is lightweight, feels good in your hands, and is well built. Definitely does what it is supposed to do, and does it well.
