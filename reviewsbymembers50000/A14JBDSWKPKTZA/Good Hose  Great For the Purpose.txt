 This hose fits the standard 4" couplings snugly. The nice thing is that it will not get damaged by accidentally stepping on it. It springs back. It is light enough to be used as a movable hose for picking up a pile of sawdust. It isn't affected by a strong vacuum, so it is strong enough to not collapse without springing back. Nice job Jet. It is a wire reinforced hose.    The wire clamps are the best to secure it. Typical band clamps, like the type that are used for water hoses are not suggested. They spread themselves over the coiled wire. Such a wire is not meant to collapse. The wire clamps on the other hand are meant to slide down in between the wires, meeting with the plastic hose material, enabling the preferred compression directly onto the sleeve. Jet makes nice wire clamps as well.     Overall highly recommended.
