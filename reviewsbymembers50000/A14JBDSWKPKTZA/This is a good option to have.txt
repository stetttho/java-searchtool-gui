 The Dowelmax system creates perfect spacing. The one consideration is that with a system that has the capability of doweling all the way across the edge of a board for a table top, you need to realize that even with a thousandth of an inch accuracy, multiplied across such an expanse, it is advisable to have a slight variation in size of the hole the drill bit leaves. The 9.7mm drill bit gives you that luxury. If you are using only two dowels, with a single setting of the jig, then a common 3/8" drill bit is advisable. If you are doing multiple dowels, for example 5 in a row, or more with the expansion capabilities, it is advisable to use the 9.7mm bit. I bought two of them when I bought the kit. When they arrived I was glad that they were high quality, and had an adjustable depth collar on them that would not slip a setting. Overall highly recommended.
