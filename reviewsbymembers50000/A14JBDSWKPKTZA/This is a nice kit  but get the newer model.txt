 I bought this kit, because it had the popular blades, and at a substantial savings over buying the pieces individually. Then I saw the Super Professional Kit, which had everything this kit has, plus a popular e-cut blade for the same money. Get that one instead. I did.   The Fein Mulitmaster is tops. Now it is even made better because of the bargain of buying the Super Professional kit. Look that one up here at Amazon, and buy it. Highly Recommended.
