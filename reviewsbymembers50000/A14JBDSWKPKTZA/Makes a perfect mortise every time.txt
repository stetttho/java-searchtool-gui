 Being new to making mortise and tenon joinery, I gave it a shot using this bit. It turned out perfect. I made up a template out of 1/4" plywood, that was precisely oversized to allow for the distance from the outside of the collar to the edge of the bit. Using a plunge router, and the Freud 1/4" diameter flute up spiral bit with the 1/4" shank, I plunged and routed out the mortise in successively deeper plunges. In 3 passes, I had made a perfect 1 1/2" mortise. Even the walls of the mortise gave no clue as to where the first pass was. The fit was snug.  The advantage to having the spiral bit the same size as the shaft, is that you can plunge deeper. Since the shaft is the same size, you can go as deep as the length of the bit allows. On the other hand, if you had a 1/4" bit, with a 1/2" shaft, you could only plunge to the depth of the bit head. So the same rule applies to the 1/2" spiral bit, with the 1/2 shaft, and it gives you an even longer shaft, which enables you to make deeper mortises. Get both. They both remove a lot of material very quickly.  The 1/4" enables you to use smaller templates. Of course this bit is ideal for making lock mortises as well. Anything that requires a perfectly flat and smooth bottom and walls. It is easy to control, whereas it doesn't give you the "catch and pull" of a standard bit. The sharp tips and convoluted design contribute to that. Hope this was helpful.
