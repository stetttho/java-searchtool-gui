 This is the most expensive attachment you can buy for the Tormek system. It is also the most incredible. Before using it, I imagined the problem is not having enough surface area to hold a long planer blade, so it would have to be done in multiple stages, and that would result in less than a level blade. WRONG!   This thing will make your blade perfectly level and sharp no matter how long it is. It does so even if it is not a straight edge to start with. The back edge of your blade rests on a ridge in the clamp, thereby keeping an even distance from the wheel.   It is a large two part jig that slides along a set base that is fixed and not free floating. The clamp that holds your blade rides along a keyed channel. No room for an error there.    How it works: First you true up your stone with the diamond truing tool. That creates a perfectly straight and level surface along the entire surface of the stone.    The base, has mounting bars that replaces your existing ones, and is attached to the wide base platform. The bars have threads on them and each has a numbered adjusting disc. You use the adjustable numbered discs to get the entire jig, with your blade attached to it, level with the stone. Then you take the tilt adjusting knob, located on the back, and set the depth of how much metal you want to take off of your blade. It is easy to determine that by simply looking at the edge of the jig and viewing the gap setting. Then when you sharpen the blade, it keeps taking off material until it meets with the perfectly flat base plate. Then your entire blade is perfectly flat, at a perfectly even depth, and ultimately sharp.    Since the jig is a little over 12" wide, a planer with a 12" blade will be done in a single mounting. If you have a 24 inch blade it will work perfectly with that size as well. You just reinsert it into the clamp mating the back of the blade snug up to the stopping ridge which maintains the same depth setting.  Don't change your settings when you move the blade to the other half of your blade, and it will keep sharpening until it gets down to the same plane you set as the rest of your blade. Perfectly flat, smooth, and just as important exactly the same depth all along the entire surface. So your setting is referenced off of the back of the blade, rather than the leading edge. That makes a perfect depth on the finished edge.       If you want to know how exacting this jig is, when you go from one blade on your planer to the next, you will need to tweak the angle adjustments to meet up perfectly with the blade. Since a simple stone grading-surfacing, will result in a slightly smaller diameter on your stone, it shows up in your settings on the stone. Now we are talking hundreds of an inch difference.    This thing is so exact that I take it down to completely flat against the jig then I tweak the depth knob just a hair after stone grading to 1000 grit, so that I take off only a hair more with the finer grit setting.     One other thing worth mentioning is that I used to spend hours going through multi grades of sandpaper to get a beautiful finish on my wood. When you create razor sharpness, on your planer blades, you will get a surface so smooth, and perfect, that you will not need to do all of that sanding. The wood almost looks glossy. It is a good idea to go over it lightly with 220 grit to increase the adhesion qualities of the finish.         I quickly learned that any time spent sharpening blades is quickly saved in not having to over sand it. Your projects come out perfectly sculpted to size without showing the over sanding problems of valleys and dimpled edges.    I must admit it took me an hour the first time to learn how to remove the blades from my jointer and reinstall them with the depth gauge and get final settings that are perfect. Next time it will take me 15 minutes.  By getting all of your blades at the exact same depth, you are relieving the planer from having to use the one blade that sticks out a little farther, to do the whole job.     Now my planer feeds the wood completely by itself, without having to push the board through. I wiped the rubber feed drums with a little acetone to take the varnish-sap off, and combining that, with ultra sharp blades reduce resistance.    This jointer planer blade attachment is not cheap, but I will recoup the investment in not having to buy new blades very often. Once they are trued up with this jig, the next time you might be able to just polish up your edges with the 1000 grit setting and compound on the leather wheel. I expect to get at least 6 to 10 uses out of my blades since I can sharpen them so well. Then when you figure the same for the jointer knives, your making money. Additionally, you can be sure of getting the job done properly.      Their are professional sharpening services that take pride in their work, and their are those who don't really care about getting it perfect. I prefer to do it myself, no possibility of errors, and no down time waiting for the blades.    This jig is included in the Tormek complete accessory package or individually as shown here. Either way it adds up to excellence in your work, time and money saved, and saved, and saved. Highly recommended.
