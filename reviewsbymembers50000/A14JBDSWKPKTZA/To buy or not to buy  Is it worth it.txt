 This 3" spindle assembly is substantially larger, and heavier than the standard spindles which comes with the Jet Benchtop Osciallating spindle sander. The advantage to having a larger drum is that it creates a flatter surface where the crown meets with the wood. That creates a smoother surface on larger pieces. The smaller spindles that come with the unit, range from the 2" on down to the smallest ones, which are great for getting into smaller corners etc, but on a large flat or gradual curved surface they can create dimples in the surface if you don't keep the material moving.    Is the 3" spindle neccessary? Not really, with a careful technique, you can accomplish it with the smaller spindles, but it definitely makes it easier. Highly recommended.
