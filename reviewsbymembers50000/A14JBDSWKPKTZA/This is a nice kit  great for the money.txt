 I just used this kit for the first time. I was gluing some melamine sheets with Roo Glue (specially made for melamine) The set up time was 15 minutes, so I had a lot of surface area to cover in short order. This glue kit, using the glue roller did a nice job. It enabled me to cover a lot of surface area quickly. The amount of glue that is released is based on how much you squeeze the container. You can easily see the flow, so guesstimating is pretty easy.    My only dilemma is when doing biscuits and glue edge joinery; it is necessary to switch heads. When you are dealing with glue that is sure to get messy. So my quest is to find a dedicated biscuit joining glue bottle. That way I can use both at the same time without making head changes.    I think this kit is a great idea. It might be all plastic, but is ideally suited for the purpose. Highly recommended.
