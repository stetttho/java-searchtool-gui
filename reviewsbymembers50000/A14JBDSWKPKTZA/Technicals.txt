 When installing a dust collection system, eliminating resistance to airflow is what it is all about. The ideal is as large a pipe as possible, flowing in a straight line, without any ridges in the surface. Of course in the real world at least some of these things wind up being less than ideal. What this Jet 4" elbow does, is give you a large pipe, that makes a gradual turn as opposed to a straight 90 degree angle, and the sides of the elbow are smooth. So when you need to make a turn with your air flow, this elbow does the nicest job.    The fit snugs neatly inside the standard 4" flex pipe. With some 4" Jet wire clamps which are also highly recommended over standard pipe-band clamps and this Jet elbow your all set for some hassle free collecting.
