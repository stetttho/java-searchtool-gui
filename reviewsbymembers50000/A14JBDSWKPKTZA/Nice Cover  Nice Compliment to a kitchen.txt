 Being a bachelor, I know I needed a little look of the home comfort, and this quilted cover gives the kitchen a warm cozy feel. I like the idea of preventing splashes of food not being able to get on the mixer. I like to give the mixing bowl and utensils a quick rinse before I use them. What the cover prevents is the need to do a prolonged soak and scrub to get dried food off of it. The cover fits well. I haven't really bothered to put a cookbook in the pocket. I like the look with the pocket the way it comes.   I like the fact that I know my stand mixer will remain scratch free, and keep that new look for a lot of years because of the cover.
