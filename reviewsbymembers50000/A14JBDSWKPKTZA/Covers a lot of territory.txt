 Antiques and collectibles covers such a vast array of knowledge, that no one book could ever cover it all. This book is an excellent resource for someone like myself who wants to get his feet wet. I covers a lot of topics lightly. They include: Pottery and Porcelain, Glass, Bottles, Furniture and furniture construction, Lighting Devices, Silver, Pewter, Tinware and Toleware, Clocks, Needlework, Jewelry, Prints, Paintings, and Pictures to Hang, Paper Antiques, Store stuff (that is what they called that chapter), Books, Music, Toys, and other collectible items.   I was interested in learning more about French Provincial furniture, and several other furniture types were covered-briefly. I learned that if you want to get a good deal of information about any one type of item, it is best to consult a book that specializes in that area. A short paragraph, or page or two about something really scratches the surface. Most likely the specific piece you have in mind will not be covered.   This is a great book for general education. After all, you never know what you will stumble on that is of great value, and is ready to be given away. I think collecting is a matter of, if you really like it, then it is for you. It is just as well to know how much it is worth, and where it came from, and how old it is. In a general sense, this book will give that all to you. A nice read for someone like myself who is not seasoned in antiquity.   A lot of museums, historical societies, and collectors helped to provide the information that is in this book. Highly recommended.
