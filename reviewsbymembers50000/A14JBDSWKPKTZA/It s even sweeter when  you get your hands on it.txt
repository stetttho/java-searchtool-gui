 I just reported on this drill based on specifications, compared to some of the forerunners in the competition. In addition to that review, I have to say, I just received the drill, and it is truly a well built machine.    It addresses all of the other concerns reviewers were stating with the competition. The paddle on-off switch is conveniently located. The variable speed is so exact, that you can set it for off, and up a little from that, it takes 32 seconds for the chuck to turn one revolution. Not that you need that kind of crawl, but it let's you know that you can go from anywhere from a dead stop to full speed, and anywhere in between. Important when driving screw heads in delicate furniture, or cabinet making situations.    The forward-reverse switch is conveniently buried in the handle, at the tip of your fingers, but recessed enough that you will not accidentally trip it.    The 2 1/2" (approx) drill head height, is the same for the entire body of the drill. We are talking maximum clearance for those cramped quarter jobs.   The sound of the drill while it is running, smacks quality. It has that fine bearing sound.    The included removable side handle is large enough, that you might want to consider buying a buffing attachment, and using it for fine polising panels.    I'm crazy about tools that make you feel good when you use them. Nothing is worse than fighting an ill engineered tool. Quality tools equal quality work, and this tool will make you shine. Highly recommended.
