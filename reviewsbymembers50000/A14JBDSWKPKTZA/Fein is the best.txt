 Let's face it, this paper isn't cheap. But it is very well made. The advantage to the Fein paper is that the backing is made so well, that you do not wind up with buggered edges, which wastes the backing pad. Result: Clean sanding, that maintains a crisp edge for getting into tight places. Isn't that what the sander is for. All grits work well. Highly recommended.
