 I'm a big power tool buff, but I must admit, I feel an acquaintance with a time when life was simpler, and smarter, when I use this tool. It cuts so well that you don't mind putting out what little elbow grease that it requires. Since the cut is done on the pull, instead of the push, you are guaranteed a straight cut. At least as far as the blade is responsible for. With typical saws, using the push cut, caught in a mini bind, is enough for the saw to flex, and cause and uneven cut. Since metal will not stretch, by pulling it, it only has one option, and that is to stay on course. As others have commented, this tool gives you a very clean cut, without buggering the surrounding material.   With the replaceable blade, you are guaranteed a long life tool. Additionally, as a manufacturer, Shark is very popular, so replacements are available widespread, as well as here at Amazon.   Very nice saw for dovetails, and cutting plugs, or anything else that you need an accurate cut on. The hardest cuts to make are the small ones, and they tend to show the quality of your work the most. Nothing looks worse than that small corner, that was cut incorrectly. Stands out like a sore thumb. Cutting a 2x6 evenly is easy, but cutting a 1" edge on a workpiece, takes a lot more. This is the tool to make you shine. Highly recommended.
