 My first introduction into mortise and tenon joinery was with a flute up spiral bit, and a self built template, made from 1/4" plywood. I used a dial caliper, and measured the difference between the template guide collar, and the edge of the bit. Then I added that to the size of the opening-mortise, I wanted to make. After a lot of careful cutting, I made a snug fit template, which resulted in a snug fit mortise. I have since learned to use, one or a pair of Tru-Grip guides, with a stop. A lot less set up time, and the same results. Anyhow on to the bit. The beautiful thing about flute up spiral bits, is that they cut the sides of your tenon, and the bottom of the tenon perfectly smooth. Even if you are making multiple passes, you don't see a seam line. I guess perfect walls on a tenon that won't be seen when they are glued together, is not that important, but a perfect fit is. This will give you a perfectly straight even tenon. No chisel made pockets for the glue to fill. I love old world techniques, but a flute up spiral bit, is your best bet.   The 1/8" is small, and usually used for inlays and such. The shaft is 1/4" and the tip is 1/8", so you can not plunge the bit as deep as the shaft will allow. On a 1/4" bit with a 1/4" shaft, or a 1/2" bit with a 1/2" shaft, you can plunge an even cut as deep as the shaft. Good to know when making deep mortises.   Freud makes a very nice bit, and this one is very sharp, and will last a long time. Highly recommended.
