 This knob is as much an extension of your existing adjusting knob as it is an increase in the overall size of the turning head. It snaps into your existing knob. Simply put, it makes it easier to make depth adjustments. First of all it is easier to find when under the table, and secondly it makes adjusting a little easier with such a large knob.    Not much else to say other than that. Highly recommended for your Bosch 1617 or 1618 series router.
