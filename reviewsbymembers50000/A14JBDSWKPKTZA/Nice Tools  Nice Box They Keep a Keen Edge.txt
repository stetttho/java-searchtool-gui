 A seasoned turner first introduced me to wood turning chisels by explaining that for each 20 minutes of turning he does, he spends 30 minutes sharpening his tools. Half of the problem is how to sharpen them in the least amount of time, with the smallest amount of effort. The Tormek Sharpening system is the answer for that, but at a hefty price. Then the next consideration is how long they keep an edge once you get there. These Freud turning tools are the answer for that. Sharp edges equal the best work, and these chisels give you the longest edge at the best price, considering the prices of the upper level competition.
