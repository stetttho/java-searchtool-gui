 On the side of these blades is imprinted "Bosch" and "Swiss Made" (for Bosch) These blades are scary sharp. The instructions tell you to wear gloves when installing them. My ego told me different, so I skipped the gloves. One of the blades touched, or should I say just glanced lightly against my finger, and my skin immediately created a fine shred. Oops. Now I wear gloves. These things are definitely sharp. I don't have another blade in any category that are as sharp as these. Exercise caution when using them. Of course this makes for a great jig saw blade. They effortlessly go through material. With three different levels of coarseness, you can meet any task. The 30 pack has ten of each, coarse, medium and fine.  With a 4x8 leftover edge of a piece of plywood as my guide, I used the jig saw to cut an edge on a piece of MDF. It was so smooth and even, that I only touched it lightly with a sanding block and 120 grit to produce a factory edge. That is saying something for a jig saw.  I am using these on a Bosch jig saw, that I can not say enough about. These blades work well, I understand, on any jig saw that takes the T-blade style.  You can't beat the price. Everything is cheaper by the dozen. The 30 pack enables you to buy a blade that is way sharper and resilient than any other jig saw blade I have ever used, and at a price that can't be beat as well.  I bought the Bosch metal cutting blades for the jig saw as well. Jig saw blades are something that needs to be renewed due to the unusual material and positions we put them through, so you might as well buy a pack and save the money. Just be sure and wear some gloves when changing them, or concentrate on only touching the back edge.
