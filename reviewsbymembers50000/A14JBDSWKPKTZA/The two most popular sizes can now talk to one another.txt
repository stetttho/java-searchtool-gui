 This adapter is great for mating the popular 2 1/2" vacuum hose size to your 4" hoses. This 4" is a male end that will fit well into your 4" hose acting as a female, and the 2 1/2" end is a female that will receive your 2 1/2" hose as a male. :-) I don't know why that is so funny, but it strkes me that way. That is the best description I can give it. These Jet adapters fit perfectly.    To securely connect this adapter, I suggest that you buy the Jet wire connectors, instead of the standard band clamps. Since most dust collection hoses have a wire running through them, band clamps can not compress them. The Jet wire clamp goes around the wire in the hose, and it grips the material directly to the fitting. I tried using the band clamps, and after having to reattach them on a regular basis, I went to the Jet 4" wire clamps, that is why I am making such a big deal out of it. I have never had to retighten, or reinstall the hose on the adapter since. The wire clamps work perfectly.  Highly recommended.
