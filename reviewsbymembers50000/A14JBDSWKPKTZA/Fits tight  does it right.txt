 This fitting is well made, just like the rest of the Jet dust collection fittings. I am using this on a Delta Sanding station. The output port size of the sander is 3 inches. This fits in snugly. My dust collection hose is a standard flexible 2 1/2", and that falls inside this reducer snugly as well. So there you have it. This is actually a male fitting for a 3" opening, and a female fitting for a 2 1/2" opening.   Hope this helps.
