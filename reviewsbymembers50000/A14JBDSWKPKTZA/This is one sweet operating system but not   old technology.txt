 Windows XP Pro is quite arguably the most reliable operating system that Microsoft has come out with yet. Additionally it comes with the option of converting it to a Windows 98SE desktop appearance, for those who don't want to fuss with learning new instructions to get the old things done. It does so much more though.    One note of caution; do not install XP in an older machine, with older hardware. Your sound card vendor may have stopped making software drivers a long time ago for your now discontinued device. The problem is that they do not want to spend the resources to create drivers for a product that they no longer make. So if you have an old video card, audio card, modem, etc, it quite possibly won't work with XP. If you try to install XP you will get all kinds of incompatible error messages. So do yourself a favor and put old wine into old bottles, and new wine into new ones; consider getting a newer machine if you are going to upgrade to XP. You might wind up spending close to the same amount of money upgrading your components to make it work, as you would to just simply buy a new one. Check with all of your hardware manufacturers to see if they produced XP drivers for your existing hardware. Hope this helps.
