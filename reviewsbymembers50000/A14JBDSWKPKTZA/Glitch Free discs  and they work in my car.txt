 The odd thing about CD-R's is that certain manufacturers work in come players, but not in others. When a tech friend first mentioned that to me, I didn't believe it. So here's how it works. I have a regular Kenwood CD player (this does not apply to newer players who are CD-R-RW capable) My Kenwood will accept Memorex CD-R discs without any glitches. Sony's on the other hand don't work.    My brother also has a Kenwood CD in his car, and oddly enough the Memorex don't work in his car, but the Sony's do. So even within the same manufacturer, not even the same discs work. So if you have an older player, that is designed to play regular CD's find your manufacturer that works with your player, and load up on them. For me the Memorex works great.       Another interesting thing is that my older CDRW drive had a max speed of 6X. Unless I set it to record at only 2X, it would have skips. The new technology is great. I bought a Lite On CDRW which is a 52x32x52x, and it records a full speed without a single skip. So buying discs that run at 52x is a dream. I record a whole album in such a little bit of time, I can't believe it.  I never have a skip or any kind of problem with these Memorex discs, and the price here at Amazon is great. So I highly recommend them.
