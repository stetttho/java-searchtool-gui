 What can you say about Freud bits that hasn't been said already. Silky smooth cuts, no vibration due to computer balancing and long life due to high quality carbide.    I like the profile that this bit creates. You can use this bit on both sides of board to create a nice looking chair rail molding. Since it is a multi-profile type bit, it can be used in a lot of different configurations for making truly custom moldings.    Highly recommended.
