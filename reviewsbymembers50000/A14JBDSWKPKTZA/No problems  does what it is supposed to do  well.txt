 I actually bought Porter Cables BN125A 18 gauge brad nailer, which is the same unit, but accepts 5/8" to 1 1/4" brads, instead of the 3/4" to 2" brads that this BN200A accepts. I don't think I will run into a situation where I need a 5/8" brad, instead of a 3/4" one, so the 200A would be my choice, if I was doing it over again. Besides, it was practically the same price, and the 200A accepts up to 2" brads, instead of only 1 1/4".   They call these Brad nailers because the nail is so small. At 18 gauge, it makes the tiniest hole. That is great if you are doing natural-stained finishes. The 16 gauge finish nailers, take the same nail, just larger, making a larger hole, and the 15 gauge is larger still, and actually makes a D shaped hole. Fine if you are puttying, and painting over the hole. The 15 gauge is the most powerful of the three. So if you really want to nail it, that is the one to get. The 16 is strong, not like the 15 though, but will get the job done, even with 2 1/2" nails. Driven into Hickory, and hitting a knot, not, get the 15 for that.   I have not had any firing problems with the tool. I notice on the new 15 that if your finger is even touching the trigger, like any more than just laying on it, when you depress the nose, then try to fire, it gives you a misfire. The nail does not load, so you get a ding, without the nail. Have to be sure to keep your finger completely off of, or lightly touching the trigger when compressing the nose-safety feature.   I haven't had a lick of problems with my 18 gauge, and 16 gauge. The tool is lightweight, feels good in your hands, and is well built. Definitely does what it is supposed to do, and does it well.
