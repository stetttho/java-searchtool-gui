 Have you ever seen anything else in Amazon get 172 reviews, and with a 5 star rating among so many. I am honored to be writing the 173rd. This album is so amazing. It's rock, it's pop, it's thoughtful, gracious, beautiful, uplifting, and most of all it is Steven at his best. He touches perfection in that which he most loves to do.  I have been an SCC fan for a long time. He was already tops. Now he is tippy top. I don't know what else to say. I can review each song, but I think that is so well covered already.  I knew I would have "Great Expectations" of this release, but I had no idea I would be hearing the "Fingerprints of God". "Whatever" "I do believe", I know that if you "Dive" right into this CD, it will leave you "Speechless". "What I Really Want to Say", is that "With Hope", you will take "The Journey", and "Be Still and Know" this CD is "Whatever" "Great Expectations" you may have in making "The Change", in the "Next 5 Minutes", in the next hour, in the next day, in the next year when you play it, for the one thousandth time, like I will. Now that you have the song titles, get the CD also. Every song, every moment is. I didn't think that SCC could outdo his earlier albums, but I think he has with this one.
