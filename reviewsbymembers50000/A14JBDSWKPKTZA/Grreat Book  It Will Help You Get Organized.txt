 I saw Jean Chatsky on TV. Her approach to financial security was refreshing. Instead of "waiting" until you become a millionaire in order to solve all of your financial concerns, she rather teaches us that you don't have to be rich. Instead of trying to stare at the big picture, realize that the big picture is nothing more than a lot of little pictures. When you get the little pictures in order, the big picture changes. For example by observing for two weeks, where your cash in pocket goes, you can find ways to reduce annual expenses by even several thousand dollars per year. Figuring that amount of money, invested over ten years, you come up with a substantial amount of money.  By sitting down and figuring out a budget, or allotment of monies, you can help rid yourself of the irrational spending. Start to figure out what makes you incessantly spend, spend, spend. Counting your money can be fun. Instead of enjoying your new toy for only a day or two after you buy it, then on to the next buy, you rather find joy in the ongoing financial strategy that you employ.    By setting new goals and dreams, you focus your income on value pursuits, rather than buying a whole lot of junk.    This book is chock full of great advice. I'm going to work hard at the suggestions. Enjoy the freedom of knowing that your financial well being is in order.    Hey if your books all balance, even though you are not a millionaire, you can begin to enjoy life. Instead of that aching feeling in the background telling you that something is wrong. Your new value dream that replaces your nonsense spending will fulfill your need to buy.    This book will take you step by step as to how to "clean out the garage" of your personal finances. Highly recommended, and personally I think Jean Chatsky is hot, hot, hot.
