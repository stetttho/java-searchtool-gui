 Marquetry is impressive if you are making a simple flower or a project as ornate as the examples that are given in this book. Covering the art form from the early adopters in France and Italy, he explains in detail the procedures, as well as the tools that are used. When you see some of the pictures of the projects, you will think that you need a lifetime of practice to get to those levels, and maybe you do. They are so elaborate and ornate that you will appreciate what can be done in the art form.    The book is large and is something worth featuring on a shelf. It is wonderfully illustrated, and they don't short you on the full color photographs.    The chapters are; Veneer Decoration, History, The Marqueters Workshop, The Materials, The Instruments, The Drawing, Preparation, Procedures, Frisage and Jeux De Fond, The Construction of Cutting Tools, and Conclusion.    The book is 14" x 10" and every page is packed with beautiful color photographs, and at the very least a drawing. Makes for an interesting read, as well as seeing what is being explained in full color. With so many full size color photos, you can see why the book is more expensive than a standard book.    Whether you are a beginner or a seasoned practitioner in the art form, this book will capture you. See the highest forms in the art, chosen by the top museums for display. All in all a first class reference. Highly recommended.
