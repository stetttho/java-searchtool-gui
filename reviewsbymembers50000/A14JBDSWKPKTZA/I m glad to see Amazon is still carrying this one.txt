 I bought this vise from Amazon as a "one more left" item. After I checked out, the description said no longer available. Then I came back at a later date and it was being carried again. It looked good. My brother had broken my existing 5" vise, and fessed up, and coughed up the money for replacement. Then I saw this 6" Wilton. It looked good in the picture, and when I received it, it looked even better in real life. This is one beautiful piece of equipment. I know that their are better vises out there, that are rated at 60,000 pounds, instead of 25, but if you need a good vise, and you are not making horseshoes for a living :-) then this is the vise for you.    It is made in China, but that is rapidly becoming something to brag about, rather than something to shun. I know that some of the manufacturing is done in China with total cheap in mind, but especially when it is made to Wilton specifications, meaning they either have a factory rep overseeing production, or a clear understanding of the standards that are acceptable, what you get is a very nice piece of equipment. The fifty cent per hour labor rate translates into, in that case, a very nice unit for a very reasonable amount of money.     I don't know what they are replacing it with, and I know that their are some Wilton name vises out there that are less than steller, but this particular model is a beauty. It looks so good, I hesitate to use it. I went into the local Tru Value, and they had a 6 inch vise with ugly silverly black paint running down the side. This one is tightly made, and nicely done in all respects of the finish work. It is not a polished chrome Snap on Wrench, but hey it's a vise.    Overall highly recommended. If you can find one, grab it.
