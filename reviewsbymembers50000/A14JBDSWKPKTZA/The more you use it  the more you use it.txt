 This is a nice strap clamp kit. The key is the adjusting system. At first I thought, why not just use a strapping tie down assembly available at the local home center, at a third of the price. After all, it is a nylon web strap and it has a tightening and releasing system. The problem is that it gives you tighteness in a racheting fashion. So you are either at one click or the next one. No fine adjustment. Additionally, without the corner braces that comes with the Vario kit, you would be catching the corners, and creating a less than equal pressure.    All told this Bessey kit is a very nice unit, and does a good job. For the money it would be hard to beat. Highly recommended.
