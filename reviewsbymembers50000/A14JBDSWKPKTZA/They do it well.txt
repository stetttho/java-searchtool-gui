 I bought these with the Kreg Pro Pack Pocket Hole Kit. They do the job well. Other sizes are available as well. It is a good idea to stock up on this 1 1/4" size, since they are intended for use in the most popular wood size of 3/4". That way you get 1/2" bite into the joining wood. These fine threaded screws are made for hardwoods. The point is so sharp that they will go into Red Oak without having to drill a pilot hole. Even though the Kreg jig comes with a drill bit with a tip on it, that bit does not even penetrate the first piece of wood, let alone the joining piece. They depend on the sharpness of these pocket hole screws to make their way through even the hardwoods. The shaft is narrow enough so as to not cause a split.    A coarse thread is available for soft woods as well.  These Kreg screws are well made, and do the job well. Hope this helps.
