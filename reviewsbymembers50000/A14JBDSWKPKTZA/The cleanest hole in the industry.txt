 Brad bits have the advantage of a screw style tip that creates a very secure-no wobble accurracy to the hole. Normally a standard drill bit, inserted into even a drill press is subject to a wobble, in all but the most expensive presses. With the brad bit, a center balance is created first. When inserting plugs to fill screws holes a perfect hole is essential to a first class product. These bits more than adequately do the job.  I am aware that forstner bits will do the same thing, but their is a quality about forstners that makes them better suited to shallow holes. Having a large face without any follow up sides as it digs deeper into a project, makes them not the ideal choice for a deep hole. They are great for shallow holes.  The brad point bits on the other hand, have even sides that run the length of the shaft, keeping them straight for deeper holes. The price of this set, makes it a good buy for the money. They come in a plastic mounting case that looks good on the wall, with the clear plastic cover for easy viewing. They are manufactured in W.Germany. Just a nice overall set for the coin. Hope this helps.
