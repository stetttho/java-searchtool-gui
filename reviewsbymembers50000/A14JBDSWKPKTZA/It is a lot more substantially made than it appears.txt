 When I ordered the Trim Loc Casement tool, I thought it would be a flimsy lightweight unit. I was surprised when I received it that it was built out of such thick aluminum. It is protected with a baked on finish that should last. It is one of those simple tools that give you big consistent results. Trying to eyeball the casement trim offset won't give you the consistent professional results of this tool.     I have several Bench Dog tools, and not one of them is less than best in class. They are decorated in many woodworking reviews, and this one deserves five stars. Highly recommended.
