 ...way back in '87, created a little morality play called Wall Street that packs quite a punch. Some films become dated when they deal with relatively recent eras - this one is set during the 80's junk bond fueled bull market. This one doesn't suck, in fact it seems to have improved with age, somehow. Flash forward to the Enron, corportate CEO scandals, and its themes are as relevant as ever. Douglas creates one of the most memorable villans in recent film history in Gekko the Great, investment banker/robber baron.  Great script, performances, and direction - and some classic one-liners from Douglas. If you don't like Douglas, Stone, or either of the Sheens, see it anyway.  If you saw it back in the '80's it's a great film to revisit. Wall Street is a classic.
