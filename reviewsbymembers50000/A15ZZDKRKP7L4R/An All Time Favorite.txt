 L O V E - H A T E. LOL. This film is more than worth watching for the lucious black and white cinematography by Stanley Cortez. Every frame of any set-up could truly be blown up, framed, and hung on a wall in an art gallery. It's that stunning. One of the things I noticed watching this film again for the 3rd or 4th time (1st time on DVD - a real treat) is that I don't think Laughton ever moved the camera in any set up. Very hard to stage.    Mitchum is at his deranged, menacing best as the sadistic preacher, as is Shelly Winters, and the child actors. Lillian Gish is PERFECT in her role. The score is also excellent.     While some have argued that the 'sinister preacher' is cliched or 'corny', I disagree. Given the times/place the film is set, it's perfectly believable. Secondly, this character has been aped 100X based on Michum's character in the film. No one, of course, ever touching his performance.     Great flick - they don't make'm like this anymore. Had Orsen Wells or Kubrick directed this - and Laughton's direction reminds me of Wells, critics would have given it the 'halo effect' and it would reside alongside Citizen Cane and Casablanca in the (silly) debate over the best film of all time. It never, due to stupid film critcs, got past the absurd 'an actor can't be a great director' stigma and garnered the respect it deserves as an American film masterpiece.
