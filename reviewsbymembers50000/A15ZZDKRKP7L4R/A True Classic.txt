 I was exposed to Conrad when I took a course in Modern Fiction as an undergraduate, 20 years ago.  I took the course as an elective to fill a lit requirement.  It was one of the best courses I've ever taken, and of all the tremendous books that were assigned, this was my favorite.  I have read this at least 1/2 dozen times in my life.  I WAS glad, however, that I had a literary scholar walk through this one.  I doubt I would have appreciated it as much had I not.  I would therefore recommend the critical edition if you're reading this on your own. Modern Fiction - the literary period from circa 1900 to the mid-fifty's, is not everyone's cup of tea and can understand the negative reviews.  The best of these works are dense, relative to today's standards but worthwhile - at least to me. Simply, they don't make'em like this anymore.  After reading Heart of Darkness, take another look at Apocalypse Now, the best film adaptation of a novel - ever.    Dark, hypnotic, surreal - Heart of Darkness stands alone as a unique classic of american literature.
