 Very original and horrifying concept, executed quite well.  It's flaws have more to do with keeping things interesting given its minimal premise than budgetary limitations. The documentary style is appropriate and adds to the suspense. This is like a sadistic reality TV show of something significantly beyond a vacationer's worst nightmare.   If you appreciate the horror genre - and I mean really appreciate it, you will be grateful for this rare and truly original - if not entirely successful, entry. Does it live up to its hype? Not quite.  Is it worth a watch? Absolutely.
