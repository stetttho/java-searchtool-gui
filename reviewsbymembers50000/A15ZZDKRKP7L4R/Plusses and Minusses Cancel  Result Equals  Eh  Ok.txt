 I won't rehash the plot. Scroll down for that.   On the plus side: - Beautiful cinematography. Has an "old movie" quality - Offbeat, moody... - Acting and direction - Nicole Kidman is just gorgeous in this flick. She gets lots of close-ups in this film, and her face, eyes are really emphasised, she's exquisite. She should hire this cinematographer for all her films.   On the minus side - Ever get a notion in your head that wrecks the moment?  I kept thinking this was a ruse, and this clever kid was making  the whole thing up to have sex with Nicole Kidman. And could you blame him? That occured to me early on, so this artsy mood piece kinda turned into a comedy, when viewed in this context. Hey - it almost worked! A+ for effort, kid.   - Okay, pacing. No, it's not like watching paint dry, and the pacing is deliberate, intentionally and they did a nice job keeping you interested with a minimal plot. Still, like most modern movies, it could have used a little trimming, say about ten or fifteen minutes. It would have been a lot tighter.    So, whatchya get is a film where not a lot happens, moves a tad slow, beautiful to look at, especially when Kidman's on the screen. Some find the concept a little uncomfortable - I didn't. It's tastefully done. It's an "okay" film. Not the worst you've seen but no masterpiece or nothing you'll want to see more than once (except for that sex scene, perhaps. No, it ain't with the kid...) Not a lot goes on in this film, it's really an artsy mood piece with a somewhat controversial premise.   Just try not to think that the kid is making everything up to score with Nicole Kidman, or this serious moody piece turns into a comedy!   ... awww. Did I just wreck it for you? Sorry about that.   -
