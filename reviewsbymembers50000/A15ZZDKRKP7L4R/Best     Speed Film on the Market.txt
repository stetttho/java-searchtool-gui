 This is a pretty amazing film, all things considered.  It's fast with less grain than some 400 speed films, imo.  Colors are as vivid as it gets for a film this speed, and it can be used outdoors. This film is very versatile. So much so, that I generally use this now instead of 400 speed films.  It's also quite inexpensive. Don't even bother with the Kodak 800 speed films. Though more readily available, this Fuji product is /way/ superior in every respect.
