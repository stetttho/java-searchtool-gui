 Okay, so I've seen the ad on TV for the last decade. I was food shopping and looking for a quick trashy read but was disinterested in the limited formula horror and serial killer titles available.  There on the right was "Dianetics".  Jones'n for a book, I picked it up [...]   What a complete load of [...]  Clearly, this book was written by someone attempting to exploit people and start a cult. I love how he cites "scientific studies" of his finding.  What studies? Who conducted them? This might have gone over in 1950, but today it would be laughed off the shelves. There is entertainment value here - high camp and unintentional humor, and the astonishing fact that you will think to yourself repeatedly as you read - that millions of people worldwide take this nonsense seriously, as "gospel". This is the make-believe, for-profit "gospel" of a deceased, grade-b sci fi author written in the late 40's.   The only thing "Clear" about this book is...  1. Hubbard is a brade-b sci-fi writer 2. That gullibility has nothing to do with intelligence 3. You can make a lot of money starting a cult 4. State something as a fact, insist on it,  and no matter how absurd it is, a percentage of the population will buy into it.   It's a worthwhile read for it's unintentional humor and sheer lunacy.  But don't buy it.  Let the cult of scientology find seven bucks somewhere other than your wallet.
