 Ole is not generally found in (worthless) big box record stores, and is one of the somewhat more "obscure" (if there can be such a thing in regard to Trane) titles in Coltrane's prolific catalogue. As such, it is a collection that is overshadowed by albums/CDs like Giant Steps, A Love Supreme, Live at Birdland, and even Ascension. Even the local jazz stations seem to give short-shift to Ole.  However, if - like me, you enjoy Coltrane but have put off getting Ole - or are unfamiliar with it, you are in for a real treat. The hypnotic title track, Ole, ranks with Coltrane's  very best compositions. It is remeniscent of India from the Impressions CD but it's more accessible and somehow is more surreal without being full-throttle avanteguard. To Her Ladyship is simply a beautiful jazz ballad, with some unique and evocative flute solos courtesy of Eric Dolphy. Aisha - probably the most familiar track from Ole, is as another jazz ballad gem with some nice trumpet by Freddie Hubbard   Ole is powerful and hypnotic grouping of Coltrane compositions. It's pointless to "rank" collections or say one is "better than" this one or that when speaking of the true giants like Trane. For whatever reason, Ole has been somewhat overshadowed and to a degree overlooked. None-the-less, to me it's right up there with Coltrane's adknowledged masterpieces.
