 First off, ignore the review of the person who had a customer service problem who posted here. I own several Raynox conversion lenses, and they are all high-quality, well-made products and are a good value. No business in a mass-consumer market can please all its customers.   Now, about this lens. I consider it to be the best of its type out there, dollar for dollar. Its construction is solid and its optics are of high quality. It is also just the right weight. Not too light as to be cheaply constructed, but not too heavy as to put too much pressure on the camera that supports it. This is a substantial chunk of glass.   The knock on most WA converters is that they don't really buy you that much in terms of increasing the view field. However, this lens from Raynox increases the field of view by 50%. WA conversion lenses also frequently suffer from nasty barrel distortion. The Raynox 6600 does the best job at keeping barrel distortion to a minimum, at the expense - perhaps, of a little edge softness. On my camera model it will sometimes vignette slightly in the top corners but this is easily corrected with a photo editor.     Wide angle converters are great for indoor shots in cramped quarters (note, you MUST use an external flash if using this WA adapter, as the on-board flash will produce a shadow on the subject...), as well as architectural work, and landscapes. I consider it "a must" for any serious hobbiest of digital photography. They all have their limitations, but the Raynox DCR did a nice job overall with this converter, especially regarding the degree in the increase of field view, and minimizing barrel distortion. It is the best value for this type of conversion lens.
