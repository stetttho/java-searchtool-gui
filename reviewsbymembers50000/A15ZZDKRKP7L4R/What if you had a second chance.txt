 We are all haunted by ghosts from our past - memories of people whom we've deeply bonded but fate - or our own unthinking actions, takes them forever from us.  Such ghosts harbor a special meaning to the small crew aboard a vessel deep in space.  A psychologist, haunted by guilt and loss over his wife's suicide, is called to investigate a space probe studying a phenomenon, Solaris, light years from earth. He enters the space craft to find its small crew on the verge of sanity and soon learns the cause of their maladies. Solaris has to the ability to use subatomic matter to reconstruct faxcimilies of loved ones from your dreams. What if you were given a second chance?   Steven Soderstrom executed this difficult material brilliantly. It's a cerebral, intimate psychological drama that has a haunting dream-like quality. It's moody but never boring. Provocative and stylish but not heavy handed.  It asks difficult philosophical questions but is never inaccessable; deeply moving without being saccarine.  This is the third attempt to bring the challenging Russian novel by Stanislaw Lem to the screen, and it's fantatic.  I rented this on a whim with 2 other films and  watched Solaris several times instead of the other films.   An a-typical hollywood film and labor of love from an excellent filmmaker. It's a minor classic. The performances and visuals are excellent. Give its far-fetched premise some latitde, and watch without distraction -lights out, late on a rainy night.
