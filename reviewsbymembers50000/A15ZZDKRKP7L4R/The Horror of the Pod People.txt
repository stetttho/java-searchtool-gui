 ... and so the Pod People marched, believing that they had won the war on "terra" by capturing Saddam Hussein, who they thought was responsible for the September 11 attacks. And in November, the Pod People re-elected their leader.  Some of the brighter ones were concerned about the historic deficits, no WMDs (Doh!), tax breaks that blatantly benefit the wealthy, 2.5 million jobs lost (the most since the Great Depression), sharp reduction in wages, close ties to corrupt corporations like Enron (wink to "Kenny Boy"), an AWOL commander-n-chief, easement of pollution controls like arsenic levels in their water supply, draconian cuts to needed social services while plotting flights back to mars, their home planet, and - well, the fact that their leader seemed about as sharp as a Dick Cheney's head.  But Karl Rove told them what to think - and so they marched to the polls to re-elect Prince Dubya - heir to the Bush empire, none the less.  Many earthlings tried to fight the Pod People.  They armed themselves with books like this to better understand these extremely strange beings - but it was too late. Karl Rove and Scott McCleland created an army of tremendously loud and annoying androids - (known as "Hannities") who used a communications device they called, "Fox News", to assure their deranged minions that the three G's (God, guns, gays) take precedence over trifles like acute fiscal malfeasance, employment, their planet's environment, and waging a costly, brutal "preemptive war", which pre-empted nothing but a few vapid reality TV shows. So the beginning of the end occured for this once great civilization in November 2004.  The Pod People had "won".
