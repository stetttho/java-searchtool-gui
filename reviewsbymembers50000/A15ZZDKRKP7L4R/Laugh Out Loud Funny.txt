 Byron York's "Vast Left Wing Conspiracy" (...the "Untold" [<- lol...what, does this guy write headlines for Weekly World News?]... blah, blah, blah, blah, BLAH, blah, blah...) is that democrats wanted to defeat Bush and win the election. Scandalous! And ->GET THIS<- they'll try EVEN HARDER NEXT TIME! Imagine that! In a DEMOCRACY (...at least I think it still is) no less, the opposition party and its supporters will (Dun, dun, dun) TRY TO WIN THE ELECTION! HA HA HA HA!Priceless!  Keep these hysterical, hysterical conservative tomes a-rollin'! Please tell me when, exactly, did this country lose its mind?
