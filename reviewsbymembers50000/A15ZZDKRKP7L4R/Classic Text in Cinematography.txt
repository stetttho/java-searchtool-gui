 ... that filmmakers today should read!!!  See, the audience isn't supposed to be AWARE of the camera, just like magicians aren't supposed to make you aware of how the trick is performed. This - of course, goes against the grain of the MTV school of filmmaking were the the camera appears to be mounted on a pneumatic drill, and the goal of the cinematographer is to make you dizzy by zooming in and out as rapidly as possible.  The goal is to suspend disbelief, support the action - and, where possible, enhance with subtle visual metaphore on a level that truly works at the subconscious level. The best cinematography is when you're not aware of it consciously... a thankless job.  This book is a roadmap of how to do that. Many cinematographers today are hotdogs; and the equivalent of hambone actors. Didn't read this book, obviously.      In a sense, cinematography (like editing and direction) works best when you're not aware of it.  How do you tell a bad actor? When you're aware of their acting.  How do you tell bad cinematography? ...  This book has become timeless and it deserved to.  This along with the American Cinematographer Manual are the only two texts you need. I would read each 3 times apiece before I bought four other books on the subject.
