 Ignore the bonehead who blew a gasket (below) over a customer service issue, and childishly decided to flame the manufacturer on all of their listings here. Raynox products are well-made, have good optics, and are a good value.  This particular macro lens is ->extrememly<- powerful! Because of this it has a ->very<- low depth of field. If you're new to macro photography I might recommend the Nikon 6t, but if you want the most powerful macro lens in its class, go with this one. It uses a spring clip to attach to the lens, which means you don't need to buy step-up/down rings.
