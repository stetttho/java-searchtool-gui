 The downward spiral that ends this film is a visual metaphore for this film and the one that follows it. A1 and A2 were tour-de-force vehicles for two extremely talented filmmakers. Enjoy them for the modern day landmark science-horror films they are. They're classics. This one fails because its director is not in the same league as Scott or Cameron. Art Direction, Cinematography, Special Effects are on par - perhaps slightly better than, the first two. Suspense? Thrills? Chills? Fincher isn't up to task. So what's the bottom line? In fairness - it doesn't suck, it's a very pretty, watchable, well-acted film with a reasonabley literate script that is better than the unfair wretched reviews it received at the time of its release. The initial reaction to A3 was the result of the high-level of disappointment of film-goers and critics when it didn't deliver the goods in the suspense and thrills department. The bar was raised high in A1 and even higher in A2 - too high for the A3 production and creative team to match. Still, it's the last of the Alien films that's worth a watch if you're a fan of the series, even if it's a bit of a let down.
