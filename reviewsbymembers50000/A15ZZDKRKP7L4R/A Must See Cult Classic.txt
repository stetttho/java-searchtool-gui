 If you are into cult films - especially B flicks from the 50's and 60's this is a must see DVD.  It's infamous among psychotronic film fans.  Alternates between unintentionally surreal and hilarious.  Very grisly for its time, especially an inexplicably long, rather sickening scene (even by today's standards) toward the end of the film. The film is quite competently made, given its $100,000(!) budget.  Shot a few years before the first successful heart transplant in 1967, the plot involves a doctor experimenting with organ transplant surgery who - darn the luck, just can't seem to get it right. Each attempt results in horrible mutations. (I wonder if Dr. Christiaan Barnard ran into these problems...) Along the way, two 50's era strippers catfight, there's a verbose silly severed head that was once attached to the good doctor's fiance, a campy "camera club" cheesecake scene (the lengths men would go to at that time...), and a grotesque mutant kept in a broom closet - all set in that strange bygone era of the late 50's. Bizarro cult film fun.  In some ways ahead of its time - a precursor, perhaps inspiration, for Reanimator.  A true classic of its type. That "type" being extrordinarily nutty flicks.
