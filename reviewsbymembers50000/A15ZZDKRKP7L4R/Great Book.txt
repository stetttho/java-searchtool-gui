 William B. Sanders and Mark Winstanlet have put together a remarkable little book that serves as a terrific intro on connecting Flash to a database.  Clear but dense, this is no "quick read" - however, you will walk away marveling at how easily Flash can connect to a database, and wondering why it is not used more often as an application development (as opposed to graphics/animation) tool on the web.  In particular, the Flash, PHP, MySQL combo is simply awesome.     Bill Saunders, got back w/in an hour regarding a question on one of the examples.  He is my favorite "Flash" author.  Check out Flash FX and Design by Saunders as well.  Best book on ActionScript for the money.
