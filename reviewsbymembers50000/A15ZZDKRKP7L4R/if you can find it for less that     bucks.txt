 Way back in 2000 when this camera premiered its image quality compared favorably with the Kodak DC-215. Well, the going rate for a used Kodak DC-215 is around $120.  The Largan? I've seen them NIB for around $30 to $40 on the net if you can find them. Sometimes you can get a good deal with the off-brands.  This is one of them.  Largan put all the money into the lens and the Sony CCD.  There is no LCD but (oddly) includes a video cable to view your images on TV.  This camera has good 1024x768 image quality and sharpness. Sufficient resolution for small prints and plenty for web/PC/CDROM delivery. Exposure compensation and Macro mode are also nice features. Bottom line? A very good, barebones, inexpensive little digital camera with surprisingly crisp image quality. But be warned - I've seen some retailers still trying to sell this at its $200 MSRP.  Uh uh.  This should cost no more that $50. And for that price, it's quite a value. So if you're in the market for a very cheap digicam, and see this around for $30-50 bucks NIB, don't hesitate. Your question is probably the same as mine... Answer - No, it's not a worthless piece of junk (it's not a 11MP Canon digital SLR either ; ) I was pleasantly surprised with this very cheap capable point and shooter that I can lend to my six year old to take his own pics on the school trip for a nice little lesson in the fun of photography (and independence and responsibility)  : )
