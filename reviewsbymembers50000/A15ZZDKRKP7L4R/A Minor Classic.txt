 This is one of the most beautifully shot films ever made.  The black and white cinematography by Jean-Marie Dreujou is stunning. I am glad to have seen this on the big screen to appreciate it.  The photography in this film alone is worth the price of the DVD or tape.    Gabor is a 40-something professional knife-thrower, who saves Adele, a down on her luck 20-something, from a suicide attempt. She becomes his assistant. They fall in love but neither admits it. Although she and Gabor never consummate their relationship, they develop a deep - nearly mystical bond.      This film has more to say about the nature of relationships than most reviews I've read give it credit for.  Adele has sex with just about every man she meets.  However, Gabor - though he loves her, chooses not to take that path in his relationship with Adele.  He would much rather maintain his loving relationship with his assistant than ruin its purity by having sex with her. (That or he's concerned about an STD...) Knife throwing acts as a substitute for sex and, though his love for Adele is intense, he tolerates her numerous encounters with understanding rather than jealousy.  As Gabor and Adele's relationship grows, good fortune follows them. Apart, and their worlds begin to crumble.   Yet one may consider Gabor a tragic figure.  Adele is young and impetuous. She doesn't fully appreciate Gabor, nor do you get the sense she has the emotional capacity to reciprocate the intensity of Gabor's feelings toward her.   Girl on the Bridge is a little gem of a movie, and is worth seeing for its unique, provocative visuals alone.  It is a unique metaphysical - rather than physical, love story. The film makes a statement that finding a true soulmate is "literally" magical and happens through extreme good fortune.
