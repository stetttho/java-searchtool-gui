 dave thompson's book on cream is a significant improvement on his last work, which covered the story of deep purple. there 's more of an analysis of the actual music itself. conversely, thompson seemed to often lack depth in dissecting purple's songs and albums.  one may think that perhaps thompson is better at describing brief careers like cream's- as opposed to lengthy, "complicated" ones with plenty of albums and personnel changes like deep purple. thompson offers readers an engaging and interesting look at the early british jazz, r and b, and blues boom, and the musical backgrounds of all three members prior to the formation of this astounding unit. an impressive list of interviewed people like jack bruce and ginger baker themselves greatly help this book in being an enjoyable and informative read. this book adequately and intriguingly covers the career of cream, simply one of the greatest aggregations of talent from rock's greatest era..
