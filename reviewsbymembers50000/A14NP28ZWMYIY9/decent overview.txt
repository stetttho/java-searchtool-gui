 the move are one of those groups that you should just probably go out and buy their complete catalogue- they were that great. unfortunately , most americans aren't even aware of this incredibly multi- talented band- it would take way too long to describe why they're so great. as for this compilation, inevitably many will no doubt feel that tracks are being omitted in favor of inferior ones-despite the fact that the group created, in my opinion, little, if any, material that could be described that way.also, one should note that none of their brilliant singles recorded at the end of their career, as well as  anything from their excellent final album, message from the country , is included.therefore, much of the music recorded while jeff lynne was in the band is not present on this release. however, the production on this cd sounds much improved from earlier releases, for example, the songs looking on and feel to good, from their 3rd album, looking on, in particular sound much better. i prefer their album tracks from shazam, looking on, and message from the country, but their big british hits and some material from their eponymous debut is also included. i would recommend these albums to anyone curious about the group: and i would also say that there is really no reason to pick up this disc if you are a fan already, unless you are a  real die hard move fan. it would make a decent starting cd for anyone wanting a rather broad survey of the group,however. And one certainly can't argue with the sheer quality of these tracks
