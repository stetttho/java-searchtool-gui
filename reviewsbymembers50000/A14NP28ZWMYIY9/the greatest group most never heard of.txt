 my three favorite groups of the era are probably love, moby grape, and these guys.  sad to say but most contemporary american rock fans havent heard of any of them. this collection contains the majority of the move's  output, excepting the great  message from the country album and 5 brilliant  non lp tracks like tonight, do ya, and california man. nonetheless this is  an amazing collection with some rarities like vote for me( a lost proposed  b side for the withdrawn cherry blossom clinic  single in 1967), some  fine  jackie wilson and denny laine covers( few groups of the time can compete  with the excellence of the move when it comes tocover versions) and some  alternate takes. all three move albums up to this point are included as  well, the fine debut from 68, and 1970's superb shazam( which is disparaged  for some reason in the liner notes) and underrated looking on lp, maybe  their worst but still a hell of an album if you don't mind long songs. also  the something else ep is here with a longer version of sunshine help me,  the aforementioned covers, and a version of piece of my heart! the only  thing wrong with this package is pedestrian liner notes . there simply isnt  enough info  on the band that their fans wouldn't know . otherwise, a fine  job. hopefully more move material is out there waiting to be discovered,  and by the way the 2 cd idle race compilation called back to the story  should immediately be put back in print,( jeff lynne's amazing pre move  aggregation), it is more than worth tracking down...
