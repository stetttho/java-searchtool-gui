 hopefully, this isn't the best of clark ashton smith's work. this collection of 8 tales is disappointing overall. technically speaking, smith's effortless command of the language and attention to detail is impressive, but plot is often a weak point. what works in his favor is that smith does seem capable of being equally at ease with three categories of imaginative fiction horror, sci-fi, and fantasy. these tales might appeal to fans of h.p. lovecraft, but in truth, while interesting in an eerie, gothic way, smith's work is less intriguing and lacks the depth of that of his famous friend. it seems likely that this isn't really a sample of his best work, but more of a random overview of his output. i haven't given up on smith, yet i'm hoping that smith has other, better tales to justify his reputation as a talented creator of weird fiction..
