 Good look at the scene, some interesting remarks and trivia, but the section in the back that purports to be a psychedelic music buyer's guide is simply terrible. I mean, according to that part of the work, Santana is a horrible act, Cream are the most overrated band in history, The Doors were only good for the debut album, King Crimson is totally bad.. etc, etc...music is a subjective thing, true, but come on...
