   the new york rock ensemble's eponymous debut is a fine, underrated album. the band never really quite got the critical or commercial success that it deserved back in the late 60's/ early 70's...     the ensemble mixed classical music with rock , but never in a pretentious manner. the band was quite talented, and featured the soulful vocals and keyboards of michael kamen, who later went on to work with heavyweights like pink floyd, david bowie and eric clapton, as well as composing lots of film scores..essentially, the ensemble's first album includes some memorable pop/rock tunes that are catchy in a good way- poor pauline and the slightly comical/ old timey sounding pick up in the morning come to mind. began to burn and you know just what it's like are two of the stronger songs, moody, angst ridden, depressing tunes.. studeao atlantis is an eastern sounding song that is probably the closest thing to psychedelia on ( and i don't mean it in a bad way)this essentially mainstream rock album.     brian corrigan provides the band with another fine singer, and the guitar playing of clif nivison, the drumming of future x-files theme composer martin fulterman, and the various instruments played by dorian rudnytsky all point out the valuable contributions of the other members of the band...as another reviewer noted, it would be nice to also have the band's second album, faithful friends released as well.. the debut record may not be their finest achievement, i would myself probably opt for the excellent 4th album, roll over, but it's a solid debut album. i've never heard the entirety of the 3rd album, reflections which some claim is their best, but i would recommend all n.y. rock ensemble albums EXCEPT for their last, 1972's freedomburger which , apart from about 2 songs, is a terrible record in my opinion .
