 this is a fine selection of this still underrated band. personally, i woul've liked to have seen their version of dylan's 'too much of nothing" from the debut , the  david ackles cover( down river) from  the last puff, and some of their early non lp singles included. still it's  a pretty good selection that rightly has only one post last puff selection  as i believe the group was MUCH better before the initial breakup . fans of  traffic, procul harum ,and early 'heavy rock '(not metal)  stuff should  enjoy this band . it's all about, the last puff and especially spooky two  are also great , i would give sppoky two five stars, but this is certainly  a very good , if not great , intro to this band.
