 this is the strangest rolling stones record by a long shot. sometimes people ridicule the stones psychedelic music, but songs like child of the moon, have you seen your mother baby?, dandelion, etc. were actually quite special. this is not one of their best albums, but it is still very good. gomper is a rather annoying eastern styled, sitar driven cut, and the long version of sing this all together is quite boring. the rest of this works however. on with the show is the sort of thing you might hear in a casino at some resort, it has some calypso sounds and jagger puts on a humorous  club announcer voice. the lantern is a pretty good ballad. she's a rainbow and 2,000 light years from home, the two best known numbers are both psychedelic classics. the eerie and surreal in another land is a bill wyman sung tune, it's nice to hear his voice instead of mick's for a change of pace. and the song is another fine psychedelic track. as is 2000 man, a witty futuristic cut (in terms of subject matter, not so much in terms of the actual music) with strong lyrics from jagger, who i feel is sometimes overlooked and compared unfavorably to some of his contemporaries when it comes to songwriting. this album is flawed in places, but it still should be in every stones fan's  or 60's rock fan's collection. it can't compare with their awesome 1968-1972 lp's , but it is still fine.
