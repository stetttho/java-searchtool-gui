 this is easily the worst of the 6 albums love released from 1966 to this one in late 1970.  there are a few gems- the everlasting first in particular.this brief (29 minutes) album isn't anywhere as good as four sail ( probably their most underrated album in my opinion) and out here, never mind the 3 classics they put out earlier.its very disjointed and lacks the first rate songwriting that arthur lee was so capable of in earlier works. this is not a bad album: just bad by love's standards.
