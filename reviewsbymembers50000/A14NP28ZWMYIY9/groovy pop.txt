 this might remind you of spooky tooth's mike harrison-the lead singer, graham bell, had a rather similar voice. skip bifferty were kind of like a poppier version of that band. overall, most of this record is light psych and proto power pop, and also there is plenty of whimsical tunes -the type of stuff that is sometimes known as 'toytown'. some of the harmony vocals are kind of annoying, and none of this is really outstanding but there are some fine cuts like COME AROUND, PRINCE GERMANY THE FIRST, ORANGE MAN, and JEREMY CARABINE, among others. the band is pretty decent, as well. recommended for those who like bands like the idle race, tomorrow, the small faces and kaleidoscope (the british band, not the u.s. one)
