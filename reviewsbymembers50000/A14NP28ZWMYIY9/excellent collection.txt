 what always staggers me about hardin is the breathtaking beauty  and simplicity of his recordings. he was a remarkable songwriter and vocalist, his arrangements are wonderful too. my only complaint about this anthology is that it is too short. it left me craving more and i'll definitely look into more by this unfortunately relatively obscure singer. still, this is a fine introduction to his work. if you like folk/rock/blues/country etc.songwriters of the 60's you'll love tim hardin. just about all of these tracks are first rate.
