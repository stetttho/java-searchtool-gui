 this best of early fleetwood mac will not satisfy music fans looking for deep album tracks ( there's quite a lot of great early mac not on this disc) or many fans of the later incarnations of this band, but it is a fine beginning disc for those interested in exploring the early fleetwood mac. with the exception of cream, this is almost inarguably the greatest aggregation in the entire late 60's" british blues boom." in addition to two guys who survived into the band's wildly successful mid/late 70's/ smooth west coast sound era, drummer mick fleetwood and bassist john mcvie, fleetwood mac were blessed with  not 1, not 2, but THREE ultimately doomed guitarists, the great peter green, the comical jeremy spencer, and the talented danny kirwan, ALL of whom left the band due to drug and mental problems...  as for the music on this disc- well, it's awesome stuff for the most part...in addition to monster british hits like the # 1 u.k. hit, the beautiful, hawaiian influenced instrumental albatross, the original version of black magic woman, a huge hit for santana in 1970, the sad peter green ballad man of the world, kirwan's obscure, somewhat late period psychedelic dragonfly, the incredibly powerful and beautifully complex oh well, the fierce blues/ rock of rattleshake snake, and the harrowing original version of green's haunting, demonic tour de force: the green manalishi ( with the 2 prong crown). this, the spiritually and mentally tortured green's last fleetwood mac hit, blows judas priest's late 70's cover away...this is a fine ( if not perfect) introduction to early fleetwood mac, but it's rather brief, and certainly not the whole story: albums like the mighty THEN PLAY ON from '69 also merit investigation...
