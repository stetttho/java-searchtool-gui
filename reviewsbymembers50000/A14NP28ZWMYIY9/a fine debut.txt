 this is a fine start. cocker is helped out on this debut album by an impressive list of british rock luminaries-jimmy page and steve winwood are certainly the best known, but also guys from bands like spooky tooth and procol harum, among others. cocker's band from the period is, of course, also excellent on this disc. cocker is probably the finest male white soul singer period, with the possible exception of the aforementioned winwood.there's a few decent originals, such as the hippieish sandpaper cadillac and the soulful ballad change in louise. the minor british hit marjorine is ok. everyone knows the versions of feelin' alright and with a little help from my friends. there's also good covers of the standard blackbird, nina simone's don't let be be misunderstood, and dylan's i shall be released and just like a woman. for me though, the masterpiece on this album is an incredible tour de force called do i still figure in your life? this is a cover of a song by an obscure british late 60's aggregation known as the honeybus. it's an excellent , sad track with great organ work by winwood and superb vocals by cocker and the female backup singers. i'm surprised that this isn't a well known cut by cocker, and that it wasn't released as a single. this is a fine debut record , most of the tracks are first rate, and cocker's 2nd album, simply called joe cocker! is another worthy addition to one's record collection.
