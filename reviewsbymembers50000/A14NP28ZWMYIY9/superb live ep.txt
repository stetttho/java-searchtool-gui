 this is an excellent live mini album of the move . this features some interesting and great covers by legends like love, the byrds, and spooky tooth. the version of piece of my heart is also good. this shows what an amazing, powerful, and versatile band the move were, as well as their great taste in other people's material. i strongly recommend this to move enthusiasts and fans of the period.
