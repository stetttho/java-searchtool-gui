 jerry lucky's psychedelic guide is, overall, a mixed bag... while lucky seems quite passionate about the topic, the work has some factual errors in it. it includes a decent historical overview, and it is able to present a fairly good look at the regions that produced the various bands that comprised local scenes of psychedelic rock in the u.s.a. and abroad. it is also helpful if you want to know what band was playing where during the 1965-1971 period. it's not an exhaustive look at tour dates and venues. that being said, it's still pretty useful. the section devoted to the bands themselves contains only a very brief and incomplete summary of the bands. it's a decent enough book for beginners, but people who desire more info will probably be disappointed in the work.
