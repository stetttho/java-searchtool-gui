 i wish that the author had concentrated more on his career in boston and less on his time spent in australia , but overall this is a superb book for those unfamiliar with o'reilly. o'reilly was way ahead of his time in his social views and in his regard for oppressed groups and should definitely be remembered for that. the author has done a fine job. i greatly admire o'reilly -though i must admit i have a bias as i am related to him indirectly through his wife.
