 this is a compilation of tracks from love's albums for blue thumb records out here and false start. while a quibble could be made over some of the tracks, i believe that the post forever changes band is quite good in its own right. sometimes its written as if the band became lousy or mediocre after forever changes and it is simply not true. the later stuff is not as good as the earlier stuff but dont ignore the later band, for one thing it was a lot harder and louder. for example, i think the version of signed d.c. on out here is actually better than the one on their debut album. of the two albums compiled here , both are patchy and out here is the better of the two, if you're not a huge fan of love like i am you probably won't want to hear all their stuff so i'd suggest comes in colors if you don't think you need their excellent 2 cd set love story . if you are , and can't find out here and false start, i'd suggest getting this compilation. love were one of america's greatest bands of the era  in my opinion along with the velvet underground and moby grape.
