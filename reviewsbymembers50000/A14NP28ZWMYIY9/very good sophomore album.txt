 half of this album is bluesy and the other half is 60's rock. dear mary is a  slow,beautiful number that is very reminiscent of the beatles. boz scaggs'songs are quite good, although dime a dance romance uses the well worn stones' "satisfaction" riff. living in the u.s.a. is a classic cut, and probably the only one casual miller fans will know. quicksilver girl, apparently written for or about the girlfriend of david freiberg of the quicksilver messenger service is another fine track. there's a few rather good covers of blues standards,and a weird opening " instrumental"  called song for our ancestors which consists of a foghorn blowing over and over and little else. i could do without that, but this is a fine record worth purchasing for miller fans or 60's rock enthusiasts. warning: those expecting something along the lines of miller's  70's early 80's period, when he was a huge star, may be disappointed: this material is quite different. nothing on this is all that commercial, but hey at least you don't have to hear overplayed tunes, such as the execrable swingtown, the one miller hit i truly loathe...
