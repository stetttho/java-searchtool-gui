 this duo created music that was way ahead of the time in 1968-69. not everything on this album is exceptional, but it is very intriguing nonetheless. the music ranges from amusing to eerie. the songs are strange and mystical,yet often very catchy, rythmic, and ethereal.  i would say that the 1st album is the better of the two, but contact contains what may very well be the silver apples' finest accomplishment , the superb " A pox on you", a truly incredible and ominous sounding track that is done with great emotion and excellent percussion. fans of psychedelic rock of the 60's as well as techno-industrial bands( which i normally loathe) will enjoy this prophetic release. for example,if you like, say, (the band not the country!) the united states of america , you'll probably like this also.a  highly recommended release, especially if you're interested in the roots of electronic music in rock
