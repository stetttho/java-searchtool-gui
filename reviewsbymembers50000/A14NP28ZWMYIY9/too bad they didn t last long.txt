 this album , along with the debuts of blood, sweat and tears and chicago transit authority, are sort of the holy trinity of jazz rock or horn rock. i actually think that this is the weakest of the three, but nevertheless, it is a very fine debut. i think that this and child is father to the man came out around the same time. perhaps there was too much talent in the band- the other guys , for the most part, went on to  some continued successalong with the famous bloomfield and miles. a very wide range of genres are explored in detail on this disc, most notably: soul, blues, jazz, and psychedelia . bloomfield's guitar work is always impressive, the horn section meshes well with the other instruments, barry goldberg's organ work is fine, harvey brooks' bass work is subtly good, and miles' drumming is very powerful and provides a steady , excellent drive to the recordings. his voice is also a nice contrast to front man nick gravenites on tunes like the nice short soulful cut called over lovin' you. other highlights include a great version of the blues classic killin' floor, the very catchy 60'sish number groovin' is easy, sittin' in circles, the politically themed another country, and their heartfelt, soulful, and moving tribute to otis redding ( who'd recently died in a plane crash) and steve cropper called you don't realize. in short , this is a wonderful debut.  bloomfield left after this first album, but the band managed to record a follow up. unfortunately, this was a far weaker disc. one of the few highlights was a rendition of bobby hebb's classic and touching song sunny. the first album is the one to get, it is a cornerstone of jazz/ rock, (if one has to categorize it, it's really just a blend of numerous styles) and one of the better discs of that often maligned genre.
