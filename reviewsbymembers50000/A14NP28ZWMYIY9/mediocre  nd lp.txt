 This second album from 1969 is inferior to the debut of the year before. Only Jon Pierson and Wyatt Day were still around from the first album. While there is a variety of styles explored on the album, from jazz to folk rock, ballads to pop, the songs aren't as consistently intriguing. It isn't an awful album, the title track is pretty good for instance. However, like the first it was commercially unsuccessful, and it's easy to see why as this is a bland release for the most part.
