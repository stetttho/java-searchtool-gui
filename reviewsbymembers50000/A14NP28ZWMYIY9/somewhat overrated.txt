 i have to say i'm rather disappointed in this disc, gibbons' playing is good but the album as a whole is quite derivative- you can tell the band were just kids. there's an interesting non-lp version of i want to hold your hand included.pluto september 31st is also good , though it rips off jimi hendrix's fire. there's some competent vocals from gibbons, and the second part of flashback is fine, but overall the album is just not that impressive. zz top fans might enjoy some of this since gibbons is a really fine blues guitarist but other than that it is really just a curio from the late 60's-and an overrated one at that.
