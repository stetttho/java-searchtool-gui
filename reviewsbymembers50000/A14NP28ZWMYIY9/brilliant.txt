 their greatest work. only bad thing on it is vagabond virgin, for some reason i've always hated that song . everything else on the original album is a first rate, classic track,i think they should just leave it with the 10 tracks as it was originally intended, although shanghai noodle factory , for example, is a fine song.one of the top notch records from its time (though of course there were literally dozens and dozens of classic albums around in 1968). this is a classic.
