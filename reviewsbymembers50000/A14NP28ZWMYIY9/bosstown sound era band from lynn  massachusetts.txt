 this band hailed from lynn, a moderately large city to the north of boston. i guess they can be considered part of the bosstown sound , but i could be wrong. musically, this is mostly so-so psychedelia and sixties pop that i believe has been quite overrated. their version of the wilson pickett classic in the midnight hour is utterly dreadful beyond comprehension. the stand out track here is the first one, entitled feelin' much better. to me, this is the only truly solid number that the flat earth society put out on this, their sole album.  of greater interest may be the space kids material, which features backing music from the seminal boston 60's outfit called the lost. this was apparently never released, it was done for a local pbs station. this fine band, whose recordings i recommend, featured future members of bands such as ultimate spinach, listening, bagatelle, and even the latest, much derided, version of the velvet underground! names like walter powers , lee mason, kyle garrahan, and willie alexander. the last is still very well known in boston today. the storyline which accompanies their music involves a couple of boys who take off into outer space by accident. it's unintentionally hilarious to listen to today. overall, i would only recommend this disc to bosstown sound completists or true weirdos. little of this disc is really memorable.
