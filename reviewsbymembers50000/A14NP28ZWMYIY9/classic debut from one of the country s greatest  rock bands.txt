 an excellent debut, nearly every song is a classic.not as good as DA CAPO or FOREVER CHANGES, but an excellent debut. there's folk rock, ballads, nascent psychedelia, r & b, blues, and many other genres to be found here. for example, the instrumental EMOTIONS sounds like it belongs in a clint eastwood western. it popped up on the soundtrack to the cult film MEDIUM COOL. SIGNED D.C. is a brilliant track with great lyrics about drug addiction that could've been done by the velvet underground. their version of MY LITTLE RED BOOK is much better than manfred mann's, and they also do a fine cover of HEY JOE. A MESSAGE TO PRETTY, THE STONES-LIKE CAN'T EXPLAIN, MUSHROOM CLOUDS, GAZING, YOU I'LL BE FOLLOWING,SOFTLY TO ME, and MY FLASH ON YOU ( WHICH HAS THE SAME ARRANGEMENT AS THEIR RENDITION OF HEY JOE!)are all first rate songslove was among the most diverse bands of the era. lee's vocals and songwriting were top notch, and bryan mclean also contributes some lead vocals to this recording. a fine debut indeed.
