 a wonderful improvement on their 1st lp, which is also good. i'd give this 4.5 stars, to their earlier  quite bizarre and sometimes discordant psychedelic material( reminiscent of country joe and the fish, the  youngbloods, and quicksilver) , which is still evident in tunes such as  academy cemetary, they add a heavy dose of 'americana ' reminiscent of  creedence, the band, etc. the title track is an absolute country rock gem  with incredible lyrics. also of note is ' they brought  sadness',revolution's in my pockets, cherokee queen, and just about  everything else. the band featured two fine vocalists in guitarist lawrence  hammond and  drummer greg dewey.  the band veers from off kilter  almost  deranged bluegrass stuff to gentle, understated country ballads, with doses  of angular acid rock guitar thrown in for good measure and parts that are  kind of jazzy but not quite. mad river were/are very obscure compared to  other bay area aggregations,but their lyrics are as imaginative as any of  them. fans of the dead circa workingman's and american beauty should enjoy  this thoughtful and impressive disc, as should haight ashbury enthusiasts  and fans of 60s early 70s rock both their lps are recommended as is the  berkeley eps , shared with country joe and the fish, and the fine s.f. 60s  bands frumious bandersnatch and notes from the underground...
