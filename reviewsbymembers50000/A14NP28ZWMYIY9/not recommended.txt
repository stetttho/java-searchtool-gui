 sorry, but this has got to be some of the worst stuff to come out of the sixties. the version of colored rain is good, but it's telling that one of the best songs on this is the opening instrumental, warming up. i don't mind occasional pompousness but  the song hour of the wolf  is so bombastic it makes emerson, lake, and palmer look like the damned ! the guitar player is pretty good, and joel's organ work is decent, but overall the band is kind of flat and the material is generally either bad or bland. the material also tends to sound like 3rd rate rascals and mitch ryder . some of the songs on the hour of the wolf album, like land of despair, begin promisingly enough, but are soon wrecked by fey vocals or arrangements that just don't work. its hard to make really bad music with almost 0 to recommend it if you're a band in the late 60's, but the hassles pulled it off with hour of the wolf.  their version of just holding on is pretty good, and so is a song called i hear voices, but i really can't recommend this disc. i bought it out of curiousity, and that is really the defining feature of this album-it's  first and foremost a curio
