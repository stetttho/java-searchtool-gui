 a really fine debut from a band that's still underrated. mott the hoople always did excellent covers that weren't predictable- witness this album's version of the sir douglas quintet's at the crossroads. this superb and very soulful piece ranks among the highlights of mott the hoople's career. there are also interesting versions of sonny bono's laugh at me ( mott the hoople did unfashionable covers years before, and a million times better than, all of these whiny gen x no talents)and an instrumental rendition of the kinks' you really got me- proving that side 1 of this debut was among the weirdest of the era in terms of how it all flows and what the side is comprised of. rock and roll queen is a decent hard rock track, though i feel it is somewhat overrated, and half moon bay, while great in parts, is simply over lengthy.backsliding fearlessly shows why ian hunter was always compared to dylan. this isn't their best record ( i would say brain capers is easily their best), but it is a very worthwhile and enjoyable album.
