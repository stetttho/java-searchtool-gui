 i really prefer this debut over their 2nd album, balalavka, which seems to get some more acclaim overall. there are some tunes, such as regions of may, which haven't aged all that well, and pearls before swine were a rather unique, bizarre, polarizing group that people will either really enjoy or totally loathe... playmate is the only cover on the album, and it kinda sounds like what might happen if bob dylan had showed up on sesame street circa 1967! it's a pretty good tune though...another time features the sophisticated lyrics of tom rapp, who, although he sings with some sort of lisp, is usually an engaging and thought provoking song writer...uncle john is one of the best and angriest anti- vietnam songs, and also the closest song on here to early hard rock or garage rock. there's a good bassline on this number too. and the also bitter i shall not care goes through several distinct phases, including a weird and droning 'eastern' sounding part. it also has some beautiful acoustic strumming in it and fine lyrics... although released in 1967,the haunting surrealist waltz is very, very modern sounding, it sounds like a strange poem done by a latter day low fi band...the melody is really pretty, and this is probably the best song on the album. strangely enough, it is the only song on which rapp is not the lead vocalist. drop out! concerns itself with the dominant ethos of the hippie sub-culture...overall, this is a fine folk-rock album which deserves about 3. 5 stars, if such a rating was available...there are some weak cuts that drag it down a little, but it is interesting and worthy of investigation, and the band also gets style points from me for including the great artwork of peter breughel and hieronymous bosch on their album covers!
