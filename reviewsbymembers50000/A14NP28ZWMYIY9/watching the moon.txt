 this is one of the great lost psychedelic one offs of the late 60's. most tunes are coversd, including stellar sixties versions of songs originally done by people like harry belafonte and bing crosby! also includes three  songs written by the great tim hardin. some fine guitar work, vocals, and  organ displayed here. the highlight is the original song " can you  travel in the dark alone": great melody and  words. this song has a  middle eastern flavor that works perfectly. another fine tune is the  original "i watch the moon" . this album is ,if anything, too  brief. it clocks in at about 31 minutes. it is strange that a band with  such talent didn't stick around, one would have loved to have seen what  else this group could've come up with. since we'll probably never know, i  suggest you pick this up if you enjoy lite( for the most part) and tasteful  but not wimpy psych.
