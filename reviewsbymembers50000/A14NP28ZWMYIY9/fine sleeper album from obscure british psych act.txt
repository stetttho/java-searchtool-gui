 july were a late 60's english  band that were somewhat reminiscent of early pink floyd and the first incarnation of the move. founder tom newman put out many subsequent albums and was also involved at one point with michael oldfield...some of the members of this band later went on to a rather obscure progressive rock band named jade warrior that put out some albums MF the early to mid 70's...while the vocals can sometimes be a little twee, the songs are generally well written, and guitarist tony duhig puts forth some blistering leads..the best track on this cd is their non-lp single "my clown": a stunning piece of british style psychedelia, which belongs MF the top tier of british psych, its b-side, "dandelion seeds " is nearly as superb, but is slightly marred by a not that successful, almost spoken,interlude..."the way" features some strong sitar and almost gnome like singing, it's a fine track, as is "friendly man," "crying is for writers," "i see,and the morrocan -influenced"you missed it all." the wistful, "toytown" stle of british psych is well represented by tracks like "hallo to me" and "jolly mary," tracks which will probably be enjoyed by afficionados of similar british acts like the idle race, the british group kaleidoscopeor tomorrow..while there are a few duds on this album, i would recommend it to fans of 60's psych, if you can find it at a much cheaper price than what's listed here...
