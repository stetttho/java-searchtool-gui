 i give this collection 5 stars- not because every single track is excellent, but because this group was, along with moby grape one of the very, very best to come out of the san francisco late 60's scene, and some country joe is essential for fans of that period's music. there's plenty of gems from the band's first two classic lp's, and some of their later work is rather underrated-for instance " here i go again" , the title track from their 4th record is a nice song. of course, i do feel that the early country joe stuff is indisputably their greatest- the ep version of section 43, which predates their 1st album, is actually the better of the two. this, along with eastern jam, is proof that barry melton and the rest of the band can really play. almost all the country joe classics from the first two records, like the fish cheer, not so sweet martha lorraine, janis, flying high,and others are on this cd, which i would recommend for people who are just getting into psychedelic rock,, 60's fans, and people who don't want all of his music.
