 mr unterberger has good taste in music. whether or not these artists are too obscure, or not obscure enough, for me, is beside the point-though i do feel that none of them are exactly household names. this is very well written, and i enjoy his new book, urban spacemen and wayfaring strangers even more, as there are fewer musicians profiled- which allows unterberger to delve even deeper into their interesting, often brilliant, and varied careers.
