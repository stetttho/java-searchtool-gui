 a truly great album. i think that this , along with the man who sold the world is even better than the great ( yet overrated) ziggy stardust album. not a bad track on here, the highlights for me are andy warhol, song for bob dylan, oh you pretty things and life on mars but there are other great tunes as well, such as quicksand. this is a very diverse record even by bowie's standards, everything from hard rock, to balladry , to velvet underground pastiches are found in the record. this  album is a superb achievement for bowie.
