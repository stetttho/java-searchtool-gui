 this album is sometimes ignored in favor of forever changes. true, forever changes is so great i think the only recommendation i could give for it is get it! but the 1st side of da capo is one of the greatest sides of an album you're likely to hear. every track is a grade a classic. revelation is overlong and boring but luckily you can skip it on cd if you like, it doesn't really matter. da capo is a great disc that just happens to be the 2nd best album from what may very well have been america's finest rock band of the late 60's.
