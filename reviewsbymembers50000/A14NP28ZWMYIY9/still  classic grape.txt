 i too am sick of people regarding this album as terrible or subpar. some clown in rolling stone had the audacity to give this 1 star once! its not as good as the 1st record, but very, very few albums are. although it has been tampered with it is still a considerably above average album by one of the very greatest aggregations in the history of american rock , one that would blow any of these horrible bands from today clear out of the water if they existed at the same time. and these other reviewers are correct in that vintage is essential listening. just about every track on here is a classic in its own right, and this is a varied and interesting recording that shows us many wonderful sides to this amazing band. one would have liked to have seen the cd reissued as it originally appeared without editing, but that is probably too much to expect from the nefarious matthew katz...
