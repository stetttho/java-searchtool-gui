 this is a highly recommended release. the version of section 43 is actually probably even better than the one on the lp. country joe &the fish are in fine form on the ep. mad river's amphetamine gazelle ( also done on their debut record) is  a wild and brilliant slice of acid rock, as is the weird ep only anti war anthem orange fire. i also strongly recommend both of their albums, which i feel are two of the stronger san francisco area releases of the period. notes from the underground, despite their moniker, won't remind you of the great dostoevsky story, they were really a  fine garage, or proto -power pop aggregation, with a good timey flavoring somewhat like the lovin' spoonful or bay area contemporaries the charlatans. the frumious bandersnatch (their name taken from lewis carroll's poem jabberwocky)serve up some wonderful and exhilirating psych that probably is the highlight of the cd along with mad river's material. the guitar work, ominous bass riff, great vocals, and  powerful lyrics in hearts to cry is amazing, and the song is a san francisco acid classic. the other two bandersnatch tracks are also very good. there's very little filler on this release and it  definitely should be heard by acid rock fans and sixties enthusiasts
