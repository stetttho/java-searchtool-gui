 this is spooky tooth without gary wright and comes from 1967, before spooky tooth was even formed, its not all that reminiscent of the later group. i'd really give this about a 3.25 rating if that was offered, but i always try to be generous in these reviews and nonprofessional- its not like we're all real reviewers for a magazine or something! supernatural fairy tales is a fine song, and some of the other cuts are pretty good too. this has some psychedelia, hard rock, soul and pop on it , plus some fine drumming during african thing and  decent covers of buffalo sprinfield and the rascals. i read an interview once in which geezer butler of black sabbath said that art was a big influence on his band, and that is very apparent on the track i think i'm going weird, it sounds a lot like black sabbath. overall, this is hardly a great disc, but it does contain a few great tracks
