 this is a superb accomplishment, the only track i don't like is knight errant. buckley ( often with the help of larry beckett) was an amazing songwriter. forget about dylan, lennon, ray davies,, and other giants of the era for a moment, they don't make lesser known singer/songwriters like buckley and the other tim, tim hardin anymore. these songs are not only what you might expect from a troubador type, some , such as no man can find the war, i never asked to be your mountain(later covered by his son jeff) and pleasant street kind of rock a little, too. its quite a diverse recording  with balladry, psychedelia, rock, folk, etc. and with excellent help from the sidemen. his excellent tenor voice is in fine form as always too. there is the  epic title track as well, the lyrics of this look like something from allen ginsberg or another of the beat poets. the beautiful morning glory of course is also on this record, as is the impressive ballad once i was, which appears at the end of the film coming home starring the evil jane fonda( but thats another story). phantasmagoria in two is yet another classic ...in short its an excellent record worth picking up by folkies, 60's fans, dylan fans, singer songwriter fans, jeff buckley fans, etc. etc....
