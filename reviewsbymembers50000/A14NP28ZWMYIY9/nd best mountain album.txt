 i like 'CLIMBING' more: if a 3.5 star rating was available, i'd give it that. my favorite tracks are the incredibly hard-rocking "don't look around", the title track,  the bitter/disillusioned  ballad "tired angels" (with more great guitar from west) and traveling in the dark". there's definitely some filler on this album however. i never cared for " the animal trainer and the toad" , their second biggest hit, very much, and i really don't like the boring " the great train robbery " even less. still, the album features the impressive instrumental  talents of its members , and pappalardi and west were pretty good singers also. a good but not great album.
