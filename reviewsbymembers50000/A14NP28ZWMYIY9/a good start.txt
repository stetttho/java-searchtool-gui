 this is a fine beginning. who would have guessed that e.l.o would eventually become one of the world's biggest groups? the battle of marston moor is frightfully pretentious and wholly alien to the rest of the unpretentious wood's repertoire.it is the only real blight on this solid disc.lynne's tracks are very beatles influenced and quite impressive, if not up to the standard of his excellent pre-move band the idle race.wood's look at me now and whisper in the night are very somber , whisper in the night in particular is a beautifully sad hymn. bev bevan is in fine form as always, especially on lynne's fine track entitled nellie takes her bow. 10538 overture flat out rocks and is an excellent beatles like number that is probably the heaviest thing on the album: great guitar on the cut, and some great cello from wood and french horn as well. queen of the hours features strong vocals from lynne.the instrumentals are also superb, manhattan rumble is an excellent track that sounds like something out of a thirties gangster flick.  overall this is a very impressive fusion of classical music with early 70's rock , too bad lynne and wood didn't stick together. i guess there was too much talent in the band.
