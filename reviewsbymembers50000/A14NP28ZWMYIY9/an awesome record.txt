 larry graham is among the greatest bassists ever. even the rather obscure track SOMEBODY'S WATCHING YOU is a classic. the rest of the songs are brilliant, sly stone was certainly one of the most brilliant and diverse talents at that time. his lyrics and vocals are great, as are the vocals of other band members. surely this was one of the more influential acts of the late 60's, early 70's. the harmonica playing on this album is astonishing, and the band of course was excellent. as always, the fantastic blend of soul, blues, r&b, rock, and psychedelic rock is amazing to behold. this album was great even in an era when great albums came out regularly.
