 this band hailed from either andover or north andover, i forget which. those towns are north of boston, not far from the new hampshire border.  this record has become a pricy artifact that people pay lots of money for. musically speaking, it's quite good. there are many catchy tracks, and the whole thing sounds like the beatles. the singer is a dead ringer for john lennon, and it is quite derivative of the greatest rock band of all time. there is one part of the song " how was your day last night" which is basically a slowed down rendition of the beatles'tune MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR. that being said, this is an enjoyable disc. "salty people" is a good psychedelic track. the opener, "all these years" starts things off with some great backwards guitar. "how did you die" is a fine sgt. pepper's type thing, and "come with the day" features gorgeous harmonies and more good guitar work. the bonus tracks are o.k., but nothing special. if you like beatle type groups and 60's psychedelia, you'll probably like this album. there was a story in the boston herald back in about '95 about the lazy smoke, as well as similar massachusetts aggregations of the 60's like pugsley munion. apparently, the lead singer now works for the public works department.
