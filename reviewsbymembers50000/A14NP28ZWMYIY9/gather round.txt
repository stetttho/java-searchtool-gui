 this features some of the better cuts from OUT HERE, a late 1969 love album, along with 4 live tracks. the best live song is probably the version of stand out, but the highlight may very well be product of the times, a rather funky number not available anywhere else-it's only on studio/live. perhaps the best song from the studio side of this album is gather 'round , presented here in a slightly abbreviated version. while this material is good, it is really for completists only.  and the studio tracks can be heard in their entirety on OUT HERE. this isn't necessarily a good thing, as one song, doggone, is actually better in its edited form-a long and lugubrious drum solo has been edited out, this certainly improves the song, which is a nice melodious ditty.
