 i'd say that the first is the best, the second second best. this album contains some of their best work but isnt quite at the level of its predecessors. drowned in wine is one of their greatest tunes and has to be  heard i just can;'t describe it to you  although i guess you could say that  it partly sounds like circus music at ear splitting level! the title track  is another classic , as is song for sinking lovers , a ballad with fine  violin and interesting vocalizing. wheels is another great cut dating from  when ric grech was in the band. some of the other cuts arent very  intriguing but overall its a good though not great album worth really a 3.5  rating.
