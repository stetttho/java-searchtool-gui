 This is quite unlike their earlier heavy stuff. It's almost 180 degrees from Vincebus Eruptum and their best work, Outsideinside. It's an ok album, but nothing special. "Fool" is a solid r&b sounding number with some good harmonica and fine vocals by band leader Dickie Peterson. 'You're Gonna Need Someone" , by Bruce Stephens, is another solid track that ends with some weird duck quacks and some cool rolling bass lines from Peterson. Stephens, who had previously worked with Chuck Berry and a band called Mint Tattoo, would only appear on this eponymous fourth album. The bands energetic cover of Delaney and Bonnie's "Hello L.A. Bye Bye Birmingham" comes next. Then "Saturday Freedom", and "Ain't That The Way Love's Supposed To Be", two of the best tracks on the album. The latter featues fine keyboards from Ralph Burns-Kellogg. The problem with this album is that the second half of the record plummets into sheer facelessness.It's very dull and far from memorable, and keeps this from being a solid album.This is recommended for Blue Cheer fans, but others might find it merely ok.
