 this is an excellent debut record that also includes their early singles, outtakes, etc. the move were an incredible band, among the best of their era. these early recordings are a lot poppier than their later excursions into psychedelia, heavy metal, classical rock etc. i think the stuff that they did on shazam, message from the country, etc. is their best, but it is all great. i would probably give  both shazam and message from the country an a+, and this debut and looking on an a or a- for a grade, quite simply, this band's entire output is essential. this first album features a few fine covers: moby grape's brilliant 'hey grandma' from their outstanding debut, and 'weekend' by eddie cochran, who was a big influence on this band. there is also a bizarre rendition of the old standard 'zing went the strings of my heart'! , lead vocals are sung by the band's drummer, bev bevan-  with his strange deep voicehe sounds like a troll on this cut. the originals are excellent late sixties pop , such as the big hit 'fire brigade', 'here we go round the lemon tree' (which was covered by jeff lynne's fine band the idle race-jeff would, of course, join a later move lineup), 'useless information'( a quite satirical look at junk culture with witty lyrics from roy wood), and cherry blossom clinic, the most psychedelic song on this album- it would be redone on the shazam album with incredible results. the band plays extremely well together, and the move featured several great vocalists , their harmonizing was superb as well. the lyrics are quite good , too and  this debut certainly belongs in the collection of fans of this band and the offshoot bands, 60's enthusiasts, and anyone who likes british music of the era.
