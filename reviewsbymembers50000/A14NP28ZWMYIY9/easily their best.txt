 much better than their subsequent efforts. this features top notch playing  by  al kooper and friends -and classy covers of 1st rate songwriters like harry nilsson , randy newman, and tim buckley. the originals are also strong and cover many genres: jazz, blues, psychedelia,gospel, lounge music,tin pan alley , balladry etc.. an excellent and diverse debut from what is probably the single greatest year in rock history-1968.
