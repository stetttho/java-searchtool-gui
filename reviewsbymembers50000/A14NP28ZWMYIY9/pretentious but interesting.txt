 in my opinion the best of the bosstown sound albums was earth opera's debut which for some reason elektra refuses to put out on cd it seems. the 1st beacon street union album and the first 2 ultimate spinach records are not far behind. its pretentious but intriguing. john lincoln wright is still active in the boston area fronting country bands. the 1st album is as an earlier reviewer said pretty straight ahead rock with touches of blues and r &b here and there. there are some psychedelic flashes and tones however. those expecting some kind of major musical freakout will probably be disappointed, but paul tartachny was a quite talented guitarist, and you'll find some impressive runs on the 1st album. just about every track on the eyes of the beacon street union is solid. the 2nd album is more hit or miss, but the title track and angus of aberdeen are first rate. the former is a somewhat jazzy piece with oblique dylanesque lyrics and the latter features some of tartachny's best guitar work. another excellent song is now i taste the tears which is kind of reminiscent of the rolling stones to some degree, its an r &b type of tune with some fine vocalizing by wright. this is worth picking up if you are a fan of the era or interested in the bosstown sound.
