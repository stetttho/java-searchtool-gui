 this is the first cd i ever bought online. edmunds' guitar work is simply incredible. much less blues - oriented than their previous album. an especially underrated track may be ' nobody's talking. ' this tune features  lyrics that are still pertinent today along with loud droning  guitarwork.  in the land of the few and sabre dance are somewhat different on this than  in the single versions. sabre dance simply has to be heard to be believed!  this fine record mixes classical rock( not overdone either) with some late  psychedelia/ early metal(well, almost, not quite sure what to call it) and  even a decent chuck berry cover. this may not be for fans of edmunds later  work but nonetheless its quite startlingly good throughout. 'seagull' may  be histrionic but still a good tune. the contributions of bassist john  williams and drummers? (i think its both bob 'congo' jones and perhaps also  terry williams), provide for solid support to edmunds' often incredible  guitarwork on this cd. the lyrics from this band were generally covers or  written in collaboration with the album's producers or managers.
