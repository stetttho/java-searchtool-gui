 this one takes a few listens to get into but then you realize just how great this group and album are. good news bad news is a bona fide tornado of a tune that howls and roars . part of the load is a funky track with great stops and starts. normans is a catchy and impressive instrumental and the bonus track, the flop 45 today from 1970 is a truly beautiful track with amazing guitar from charlie whitney lives and ladies is an epic number with chapman's extraordinarily unique vocals and the always excellent playing from whitney, weider, townsend, and palmer behind him. the lyrics are also superb, family is quite underrated  in this regard, it seems like few mention the excellence of their lyrics. this isn't their best record, but if you like family it is  certainly a worthy addition to one's collection
