 well, freedomburger in my opinion is pretty awful with the exception of the first and last tracks. its surprising that roll over wasn't a smash hit however because all the ingredients are there and yet it is not syrupy . a  good solid album worth picking up for kamen's great vocals. lenny kravitz  knew a good thing when he saw it , having covered fields of joy. if pressed  i would call this an album that falls somewhere between soul and driving  early 70's hard rock , though of course that's simplistic. one of the best  albums of 1970, along with gems like the move's shazam ...
