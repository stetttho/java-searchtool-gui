  marc bolan expert mark paytress has produced a superb revised edition of this definitive account of the life of the t. rex star. bolan's childhood, his various early bands like john's children and solo outings, his  hippie- era career with tyrannosaurus rex and the far more popular t. rex, and his interactions with other famous performers like david bowie, elton john, and ringo starr are explored with great detail and informative tidbits of trivia. while not every recording of bolan's was meritorious or interesting, paytress describes all facets and periods of bolan's all too brief life with clarity, depth, and fascination. this is the best chronicle of bolan's carreer to date, and is a superbly readable and engaging book on this diverse performer, a musician whose very best work( quite a bit of the tyrannosaurus rex stuff, the early 70's albums ELECTRIC WARRIOR  and THE SLIDER, and singles like CHILDREN OF THE REVOLUTION and 20TH CENTURY BOY),are first rate recordings. important colleagues and supporters like producer tony visconti and legendary british d.j. john peel offer illuminating testimononials and insights. a fascinating reminder of a vital British artist who provided some of the best late 60's / early 70's rock,  and whose catalogue remains quite underrated in the U.S.A.
