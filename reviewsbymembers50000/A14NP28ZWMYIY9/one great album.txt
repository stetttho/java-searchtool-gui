 everything these reviewers, fans, and critics say it is. it may be disjointed and off -kilter at times but this is a wonderful , haunting,varied,  brilliant, unique and ahead of its time album that is  sure to please fans of skip's work in moby grape and the airplane as well  as others . one of my favorites. too great to even talk about it in detail  coherently! i give it the  highest recommendation i can. ESSENTIAL
