 their greatest album. fans of procul harum, traffic , early led zeppelin,  etc. will enjoy this. not a bad track on the record.  a dark and disturbing  downer album . sheer power on every level: songwriting, playing(  particularly guitarist luther grosvenor on tracks like "evil  woman" and "better by you, better than me". the organ is  also tastefully used on the recording.), and the incredible lead vocals of  gary wright and the eternally underrated stellar singing of mike harrison ,  one of the finest english vocalists of that, or any time. couldn't  recommend it any more than to say its an excellent addition to one's  collection. hard to say what the best cut is, most would say either of the  two i've mentioned. other than that , i've always loved the gospel styled  " i've got enough  heartaches" and the opening track "waitin  for the wind", but like i say there isn't a bad number on spooky two.  the record mixes hard rock, blues, soul, gospel, and even a little bit of  eerie quasi- psychedelia  for lack of a better term  very well. it's easy  to see why luminaries like george harrison and the move were fans of this  fine band who never received the fame they deserved.
