 overall, this is an inconsistent recording. i love my shirt is good for a laugh but otherwise quite terrible. some of the other songs are flat. highlights include the singles barabajagal and atlantis, to susan on the west coast waiting is probably his worst single of the period. superlungs my supergirl features some fine fuzz guitar, and trudi, with the jeff beck group is pretty good. much of the rest is pretty silly and doesn't hold up well today, if you want to buy his best record, I'd suggest you get SUNSHINE SUPERMAN.
