 this new biography of legendary hard/ progressive rock band deep purple is, ultimately, relatively disappointing. while it is hard to encapsulate the band , which has put out numerous albums since 1968, in a 300 or so page book, one would have liked more details, anecdotes, trivial but interesting information about concert appearances,encounters with other famous and not so famous musicians ,and  one would have especially hoped for a more in depth look at the actual music of the band- many songs are not even mentioned in passing, and the appraisal of some albums is simply breezed through by the author. i found myself disagreeing with some of his opinions, but i didn't find any ridiculous statements. the book does have some merits- some of the interviews with band members and peripheral figures like ronnie james dio are engaging and sometimes informative. there is a useful discography that covers not only all of deep purple's recordings, but also session appearances by all members and the side projects and other bands that they were in. one wishes there was more information on the band, especially the underrated and fascinating 'mark one' lineup. overall, not a bad book, a good choice for someone who is a casual deep purple fan- but clearly inferior to the definitive deep purple tome put out by chris charlesworth about 20 years ago.
