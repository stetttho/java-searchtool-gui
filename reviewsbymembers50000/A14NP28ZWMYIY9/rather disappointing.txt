 i felt that this book kind of raced through the early years of the pretty things. it paid too much attention to their post-PARACHUTE career. while it is interesting to see what the band has been up to lately, this book is bound to disappoint fans of their great r&b and psychedelic tracks from the sixties and early seventies.  this band was one of the greatest english bands of its time, their s.f. sorrow album is a masterful concept album from an era where great albums came out practically every day.  while i think the who are great,s.f. sorrow is earlier and better than the who's tommy album. that they never really got the acclaim they deserved in this country is a shame. fans expecting a truly in depth analysis of their music will probably be disappointed. the book isn't terrible, but it is disappointing
