 i don't think that this is quite at the level of s.f. sorrow, but it's still an impressive release. i don't think it was the best album of 1970, as rolling stone did back then , but its certainly a worthy addition to one's collection. parachute is, for lack of a better word, an often  "creepy" album ( sickle clowns, cries from the midnight circus). the lyrics are great as usual- phil may has to be one of the most underrated lyricists of the era. the band is solid as always too. the bonus tracks are also good, with circus mind being the best in my opinion. parachute is an inventive and eerie minor masterpiece.
