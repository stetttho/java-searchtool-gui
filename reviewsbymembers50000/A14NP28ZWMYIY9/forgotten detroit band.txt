 SRC were contemporaries of such 60's Detroit acts as the Stooges, the MC5, and Bob Seger, among others. Guitarist Gary Quackenbush's instrument had a very distinctive sound. many of the band's lyrics are about science fiction , fantasy, and psychedelic themes. This may seem silly and dated to some, but the singers sense of melody overcomes that for those who find that kind of thing pretentious.  "Exile", "One simple task", and "Marionette" are three of the finer tracks. But the highlight is undoubtedly SRC's best known and most stunning track-"Black Sheep". This features superb guitar and organ work and impressive lyrics sung by lead vocalist, Scott Richardson. A fine version of Grieg's classical music standard from the Peer Gynt Suite " Morning" is also here as a bonus track, entitled "Morning Mood." Src originally hailed from Alabama, and later they moved to Detroit. While they are usually considered a psychedelic band, one can also detect traces of early hard rock/ heavy metal in their work. In addition, one could also say that , in places, they were a proto-classical rock or progressive rock group. This isn't a great album, i would give it about 3.5 or so stars if I could, but there is enough here to please fans of the genres listed above, and "Black Sheep" is a bona fide classic of the psychedelic era.
