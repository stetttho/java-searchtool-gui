 some weak cuts on this album, but the versions of too much of nothing, tobacco road, and society's child are superb, as is the original track sunshine help me. not as good as spooky two or the last puff but worthwhile and interesting. a decent debut that should be given say  3.5 stars. certainly quite different from the pre spooky tooth band art. art was spooky tooth's original lineup minus gary wright. some of their best material is on this debut and i think the ideal compilation of spooky tooth would include the tracks mentioned above, the title track is an o.k. song as well. if you like heavy rock from the 60's reminiscent of traffic and led zeppelin, mixed with blues and soul, and a bit of psychedelia,doing intriguing and unique versions of others material with some fine originals and excellent vocals and solid playing, this band may be for you.
