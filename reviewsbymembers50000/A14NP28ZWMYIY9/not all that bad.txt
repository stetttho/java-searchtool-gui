 i'm a huge fan of the move, and it was good to see a little footage of them performing BLACKBERRY WAY and WILD TIGER WOMAN. some of the commentary on the 1st ELO album was illuminating, and it was nice to see various opinions on the work presented. they did a pretty good job with showing the different approaches of roy wood and jeff lynne. for me, the move, wizzard, roy wood solo, the debut ELO album, and lynne's first band of any consequence, the idle race, are far superior to the subsequent hit making machine fronted by lynne. with the novelty of the early band's revolutionary approach to rock by using stringed instruments in a rock style, and the power struggle between one of rock's most talented duos since lennon/ mccartney...well, there is an interesting story there. unfortunately, while it was great to see some early elo footage, ( particularly solid renditions of  the hauntingly beautiful whisper in the night and the excellent 10538 oeverture)after a while a sort of repettition sets in with the comments...hopefully they will do a move dvd as the previous reviewer noted. overall, not a bad film, but it could have been better.
