 this album features some world class tunes: a hard way to go, needle and spoon, when i was a young boy , and that same feelin' are my favorites. chris youlden was one of the better vocalists of the british blues boom and kim simmonds has some blistering guitar on this. the only other album i have heard from this band is lion's share and raw sienna is much better than that one. this album features some hard rock along with the blues stuff and is worth investigation by those who like either or both genres.
