 this magnificent album is a cornerstone of psychedelic rock. it does remind one in places of the beatles, stones, and early pink floyd- yet it is also fresh, original, and invigorating music. i would definitely recommend this to any fan of 60's rock. the lyrics are often highly impressive, and the guitars are very blistering in places. nearly every track is top notch, and the few that aren't are still very , very good. the bonus non-lp singles are also excellent. a bona fide 60s classic.
