 the songwriting, singing, and playing on this album are all top notch. i don't care for love song, but everything else on the album is great. amoreena is my favorite, i first heard it played over the opening credits of the great dog day afternoon movie. i think it just might be his best song. elton's early work absolutely blows away his latter day stuff. i think he started to go downhill around the time of island girl - say , 1975. it's too bad , because in the early years he could hold his own with other singer songwriters of the era. country comfort( given a decent treatment by rod stewart), burn down the mission, son of your father ( also covered admirably by spooky tooth around the same time), my father's gun, ballad of a well known gun and the rest are classic elton john cuts. a lot of this reminds me of the band, i bet elton and bernie taupin must have been heavily influenced by their work. it's a fine concept album dealing, for the most part, with the old west. its too bad that the classic radio stations don't play any tracks from this disc in order to cater to their tired playlists- a lot of people probably take a quick look at this disc and put it back because it doesn't have any big hits. which is too bad, as this is an excellent all-around album
