 this is an excellent album. it's not really mountain's first: leslie west had put out an album called leslie west-mountain the previous year that was produced by felix pappalardi-i guess you could call it either a west solo disc or the first proper mountain lp. i think that this is easily the group's best album. this is one of the cornerstones of american hard rock/ metal-although it is, musically speaking , much more than that.  as much as i love the original jack bruce version of " theme for an imaginary western", it is bettered by the powerhouse rendition that mountain did on this album.  leslie west was simply one of the best american rock guitarists at the time, and one can witness this opinion throughout this excellent track. pappalardi's vocals and bass playing do remind one of the great jack bruce, but they add to the mix of styles that were a feature of this fine band, possibly the most talented american heavy rock band of their era. the hit " mississippi queen", the fine hippie ballad "for yasgur's farm", the hard rock number "never in my life"  (featuring great drumming from corky laing), the eerie ballad "boys in the band", the weird folk music of "the laird" (with some good sitar work from west)and the  hard rock cut "silver paper" are the biggest highlights of this disc. nothing is bad on the album however. as i wrote above, this is certainly mountain's finest album.
