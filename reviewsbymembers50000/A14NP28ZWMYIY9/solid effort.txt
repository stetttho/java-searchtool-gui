 this is not wood's best solo effort: boulders is considerably better. but it is a fine album for the most part. the song is a really beautiful number- wood was very good at classically influenced epics like this and wear a fast gun from the wizzard brew album that were actually quite moving. why does such a pretty girl sing those sad songs and look through the eyes of a fool display wood's fascination with the sounds of the beach boys and phil spector's wall of sound. as always wood's impressive and comprehensive arsenal of instruments are used to great effect, and the songwriting and singing are generally quite good. unfortunately, for me, this is kind of his last gasp- the material i've heard that appeared after this album's release in 1975 tended to be of below average quality. mustard however remains a worthy album.
