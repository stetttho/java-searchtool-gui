 this is given 5 stars not because everything on it is good, but rather because of the fact that spirit was one of the most talented and exciting american bands of the period. there is jazz, hard rock, pysychedelia, blues  and many other genres or sub genres in abundance. its a fine selection of  tracks as well, perhaps a quibble or two could be made regarding the  selection, but this is good value for the price ...excellent stuff and  highly recommended, randy california was one of the most innovative  guitarists going.each member of the group possessed enormous talent that  gelled with the others so well.i personally think the debut, spirit, and  the 4th album, dr. sardonicus, were the best, though many feel the family  that plays together is their greatest work, regardless, if you are a fan of   late 60's early 70s rock, you definitely should check out spirit if you  haven't already
