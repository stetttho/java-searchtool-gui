 this debut album is the better of the two original blodwyn pig albums; i really don't like the modern alchemist, but everything else is first rate. unfortunately, nobody can keep straight what songs belong on what albums. there are american AND european versions of both. the stunning " see my way" belongs to the first  u.s. album-but it is on the getting to this cd. i think they should just put out a 2cd set with both albums and any spare b sides, live stuff etc. this is like abrahams' old band, jethro tull, but more far out and challenging. dear jill and it's only love are two stand out tracks. abrahams was a fine vocalist and songwriter in addition to being a splendid guitarist. and jack lancaster was, along with traffic's chris wood, among the better sax players in rock music at the time. bassist andy pyle and drummer ron berg, who surprisingly would one day end up with the kinks, give fine support on bass and drums, respectively. a solid, assured debut that will please tull fans, jazz/blues rock buffs, and 60's enthusiasts.
