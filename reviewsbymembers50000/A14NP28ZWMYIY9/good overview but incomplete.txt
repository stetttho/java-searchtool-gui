 this compilation is, overall, a pretty decent introduction to vanilla fudge, a 60's  long island/n.y.c. band that specialized in long (and admittedly sometimes pompous and ponderous) covers of hits of the era. vanilla fudge are sometimes described as one of the founders of heavy metal, and they were a major influence on early deep purple, but although they do play loud at times it is probably more accurate to think of them as somewhat ' progressive'. they also sometimes sound a little bit like fellow long islanders the rascals , albeit with the addition of volume. the fudge, especially the rythym section of tim bogert and carmine appice, were certainly fine players. this collection includes their rendition of the supremes' ' you keep me hangin' on". the fudge slow the number down and present a fine psychedelicized, slightly creepy version of the number that was deservedly a big hit in 1967-68. take me for a little while was another top 40 hit i don't care for their take of donovan's season of the witch, but i like their attempt at some velvet morning, a weird nancy sinatra/ lee hazlewood song. i also enjoy the original track where is my mind?,  but wish that the band's 1970 cover of the theme from the film the thomas crown affair , windmills of your mind, and their fantastic original the sky cried/ when i was a boy, which is probably their best original composition were also included in this set.overall, the fudge were a hit or miss affair, but they definitely had their moments. this compilation is ultimately a decent though flawed overview of their original career, which lasted for 5 albums. though vanilla fudge are perhaps, with the exception of their big hit single, not remembered today, all of their albums did hit the top 40. like iron butterfly and others, in some ways vanilla fudge are underrated and often scorned by critics after their breakup, and few realize just how big those bands were in their day. i've heard that the fudge have reformed recently.
