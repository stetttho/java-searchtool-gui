 this is a hard one to figure out, i really think its a 3.5 star album. some boring material here, i mean 'free country is just awful, does anyone really listen to stuff like that?  and all the  laughter dies in sorrow is as bad as anything else from the period...i  think generally speaking  the band had a lot of ideas early on, but  proceeded to just blow themselves out by recording too much. i think some  of their best material is on three, such as lowdown, sing a mean tune kid(  another potent reminder of terry kath's excellent guitar work), the hour in  the shower suite( kath was one of the few white vcalists who really did  sound black , by the way),mother, and a few others. however its not quite  as good as the second album, and a far cry from their brilliant debut,  easily their best album in my opinion, due to some weak material . after  this , they released a few ok albums, then became about as corporate rock  as you can get, a long way from the' dedicate ourselves to the revolution  in all of its forms' claimed on the second lp. the influence of peter  cetera,( a fine bass player, by the way) continued to increase. not good.  my rule of thumb regarding this band is the lower the number, the better  the disc,  so i'd say this is their third best disc...
