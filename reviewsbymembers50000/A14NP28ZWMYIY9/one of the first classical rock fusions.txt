 ars nova's debut was one of the 1st classical/ rock fusions. the band mixed elements of the psychedelic style of the period with a heavy infusion of classical and renaissance music. along with acts like the new york rock and roll ensemble, ars nova pioneered the style of 'baroque rock', a subgenre of rock that is little remembered today. ars nova's album is , overall, a mixed bag, but still pretty good. for me, the highlight of the album is fields of people, a very middle ages sounding kind of thing that was later covered by english legends the move on their 2nd lp, shazam. the move version, a rather heavy extended piece with spanish bolero parts and a raga rock ending, is a classic, but ars nova's original is hardly weak. the eerie march of the mad duke's circus is another standout track, as is and how am i to know, a droning psychedelic number with cool guitar. the band do a not very successful version of zarathusra. pavane for my lady is a nice, breezy , laid back opening number. there are some other decent tracks here, and one wonders what the band might have come up with. unfortunately, the band's performance opening up for the doors at one of the very first fillmore east concerts, was apparently a disaster. the band broke up soon afterwards despite a feature article in newsweek magazine. about a year later the band reformed, with most of the original members absent from their 2nd lp, sunshine in shadows, a more pedestrian affair that nevertheless included a few decent cuts. ars nova featured good musicianship, interesting song ideas, and a quite original concept for a rock band. sometimes the vocalists are not all that effective though. while certainly not a great band, they remain an interesting curio from the golden age of rock. their album is worth a try for fans of obscure 60's rock music.
