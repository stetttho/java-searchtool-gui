 roy wood's 1st solo album, boulders, was his best album after leaving the move, and one of the best albums of 1973. by this time, most of the wonderful experimentation of the sixties had pretty much died out. wood plays virtually every instrument on this disc, and all of the tunes are totally different from each other. some sound like the beach boys, some like 50's rock stars. one cut is kind of like fairport convention, another like the rolling stones, and yet another like the beatles. gospel , hard rock, and jazz are some of the many genres that one can trace here. the songwriting and playing are top notch as always, and the album was well produced by wood with, of all people, alan parsons as engineer. i strongly recommend this excellent disc.
