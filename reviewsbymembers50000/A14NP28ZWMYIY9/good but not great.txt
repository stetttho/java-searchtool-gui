 this is a decent album but not quite what i expected. this is a good example of a group that straddles the line between psych and prog. there are 3 instrumentals on the album, one of which  (comets)is kinda tiresome after a while.  the best songs are all of my life and come back june, a pair of  psych/progressive rock minor masterpieces. the album doesn't really remind me of anyone off the top of my head, i guess you could say that the band were fairly unique in some ways, and it is rather diverse. a good disc overall, but i wish that the band had more tunes with words. instrumentals are fine, but i  generally don't like albums with more than one or two. pussy plays is good enough that it would have been nice to see another album by this lot.
