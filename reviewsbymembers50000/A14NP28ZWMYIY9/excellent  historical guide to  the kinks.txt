  this day by day historical look at the kinks' touring and recording dates is thoroughly researched to the best of the author's ability. the book provides interesting and fascinating glimpse into not only the music of the group but also the personalities and attitudes of its members, especially ray davies, one of the greatest lyricists in rock history. the kinks are probably the most underrated of the great british invasion bands, at least on american shores, and certainly one of the most interesting, and this work will give fans and readers hours of enjoyment, as well as inform them about quite a few facts that they didn't previously know.
