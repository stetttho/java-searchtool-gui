 the long songs are boring, and there's a few short snippets of tunes that are nothing special, but there are plenty of solid tunes here. i think the remake of SIGNED D.C., originally featured on their debut album, is better. it works better as a hard rock cut. I STILL WONDER is an excellent crosby stills and nash type song. WILLOW WILLOW is a fine ballad.i'll pray for you IS A RELIGIOUS TRACK WITH LOVE PLAYING LIKE ELVIS. STAND OUT is a hard rocking song that confronts prejudice. it's really too bad that arthur lee and company had to insert a tedious and lengthy drum solo into DOGGONE, a cut that features gorgeous melody. you can find an edit sans drum solo on the best of anthology that rhino put out. THIS ALBUM IS BETTER THAN FALSE START, THE ONE THEY PUT OUT NEXT. I'D SAY IT IS WORTH ABOUT THREE AND A HALF STARS.
