 the sound on this release is generally quite good considering the technology available during the period-this is a lot better than the 2cd bbc recordings of david bowie that came out a while back. the move (as always) do interesting to great renditions of other people's songs. many of their early hits and tracks off of the first move album are also included. hopefully, some material from the shazam, looking on, and message from the country albums will also emerge. i'm also hoping that the long-rumored 2cd set of their fillmore west appearances of october 1969 will also be released soon. there's fine versions of the 60's standard morning dew (covered by millions in the 60's) , long black veil, california girls, and other great interpretations. an essential purchase for any fan of this stellar and influential band.
