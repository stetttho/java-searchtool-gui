 along with boulders,roy wood's solo album, this is his best post the move release. it is very weird, a strange mix of fifties rock and elvis impersonations ( got a crush about you,  and a part near the end of buffalo station /going down to memphis) , avant garde ( the free jazz/ metal/ god knows what of meet me at the jailhouse) excellent heavy pop ( you can dance your rock and roll) and barroom silliness ( jolly cup of tea). wear a fast gun would reallymake a fine theme for an imaginary western, to quote jack bruce meet me at the jailhouse is about 14 minutes long, but it is never dull, wood's eternally underrated guitar work in this is always stunning. as always, wood's mastery of numerous instruments is simply superb, and the other members of this raucous outfit make valuable contributions as well. i also suggest boulders, mustard, and the 1st elo album ( no answer) for any roy wood or move fans interested in learning more about this vital and underrecognized  rock genius. wizzards brew isn't perfect, but it's never dull and certainly a  very fine record.
