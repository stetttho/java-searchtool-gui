 this is a fine album released at the point when pop/rock was at its peak. music was more challenging interesting and enjoyable then than today's era of limp (gag) bizkit and kid (puke) rock etc. this will remind you sometimes of the velvet underground, other times it is reminiscent of jefferson airplane or country joe and the fish, and at other times its very unique and original. i won't leave my wooden wife for you , sugar is a humorous satirical song about sex relations and such( it really reminds me of country joe here), while the american metaphysical circus is apparently a  parody of the beatles' sgt pepper's track being for the benefit of mr kite. the song features excellent vocals and lyrics, the mysterious and often poetic lyrics are another strong point of this album interestingly, there are no guitars on this album. however, theres plenty of exciting and intriguing electronic music -some of it is a bit like the 60's cult band silver apples. hard coming love and the american way of love are two other great cuts. not everything on this album is great, and some of it hasn't aged all that well- but this record is a fun, interesting,  funny, and likable release that should be part of any 60's music fan's collection.
