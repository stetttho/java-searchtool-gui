 overall, this is a rather pedestrian release culled from outtakes and scrap material. rosemary's baby and woodrose syrup are good tracks, but some of this is poorly recorded and other things are just rather dull. i would instead suggest that you track down their awesome 1968 ep. this can be found on the berkeley eps cd, and is a better testament to their powers. all three tracks on that ep are really excellent and remind one  to some degree of moby grape and quicksilver messenger service.this isn't a terrible recording but it isnt as good as one would hope for after hearing their ep.
