 this album was made up of leftovers when the band broke up. i think it is definitely the weakest of the three records. that being said, the songs are still generally quite good. young's " i am a child" is a fine short track. " kind woman" is one of the cornerstones of country rock. stills' "special care" is a fine rock track, and his " uno mundo" is a very good latin rock number. his " questions" would later be redone by csn and y on DEJA VU, tacked on to the end of carry on. there are a few lesser cuts, and it is hardly a classic album, but it certainly is a fine addition to one's collection.
