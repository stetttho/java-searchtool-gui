 this album is half early misunderstood, before they moved to england, and rather bad sounding blues material , due to shoddy production. i kind of like their version of the yardbirds' i'm not talking, but the rest is ordinary  mid 60's blues rock. the 1st half contains the gems that the band recorded in england: a good version of anti nuclear number the byrds had done on their 5th dimension lp ( I COME AND STAND AT EVERY DOOR) is included. the anthems CHILDREN OF THE SUN (a yardbirds like song, it really resembles their I'M A MAN) and I CAN TAKE YOU TO THE SUN are two of the very greatest psychedelic songs of the 60's, and the other psychedelic cuts are fine too. the whole band is impressive, but especially guitar player glenn campbell, not to be confused with the country star. unfortunately, the band broke up due to problems with the draft board. a new misunderstood appeared in 1969 , it later involved into the early 70's band juicy lucy. this band was not too great, but it did put out an awesome epic track called GOLDEN GLASS which I also recommend .
