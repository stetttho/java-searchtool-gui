 this band's debut album was so powerful and original when it came out in 1969. i do feel that some of the instrumentals sometimes sound a bit too much alike, but that's a minor complaint. how different this was compared to the bulk of albums of 1969! i like the superb soul sacrifice the best. evil ways is a great tune, but it has been played to death on the boring big stations. i  also like you just don't care, a fine bluesy number and the somewhat psychedelic shades of time. the playing by this group is always top notch. too bad greg rolie would go on with another santana alumnus, neal schon , to form journey, a dreadful arena rock band. their best moments were with this aggregation. carlos santana is certainly one of the best american guitar players of the era. a very solid debut.
