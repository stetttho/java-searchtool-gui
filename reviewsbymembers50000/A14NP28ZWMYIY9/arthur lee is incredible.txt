 this is an essential purchase for any collection. it is one of my  very favorite albums. this reissue comes with some bonus tracks. the single of your mind and we belong together and laughing stock, which appeared after the album's release , is simply essential, eerie, and very underrated. johnny echols' guitar solo that concludes the former is one of the great moments, instrumentally speaking, in the history of this classic american band. the lyrics of both tracks are superb as usual. i do wonder is a bouncy , breezy number that shows listeners more of the supper club, lounge jazz side of the group. the studio banter offers us glimpses of one reason why the band never became as huge as they should have, theres some grouching done by  arthur lee- and the voices seem kind of spaced out.as for the regular album, every track is amazing. every song is of extremely high quality, and they flow into each other superbly. theres no need to make a detailed track by track analysis as you have probably read about it elsewhere and theres just so much you can say about this wonderful record.this album comes with informative liner notes, and the sound quality is excellent . definitely a must, and try their other records as well- particularly the box set called love story , which isn't perfect, but has most of their gems. da capo is another brilliant release, and i think that four sail is underrated, false start is certainly the worst one-however, all love records from 66-70 are at least worthy of investigation.
