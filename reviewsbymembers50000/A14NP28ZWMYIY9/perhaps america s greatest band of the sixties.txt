 i cant even begin to say how incredible a songwriter arthur lee was, never mind his other abilities, and let's not forget mclean's talent either. while not every single song that love  created is a masterpiece (  i.e.revelation , much of false start,parts of out here)i still believe this  is a great great compilation potentially superseded only by a box set of   EVERYTHING ever recorded by love. i agree  that   love  and moby grape were  the preminent u.s. bands of the era.
