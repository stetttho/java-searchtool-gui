 despite the chopping and altering of these albums it may  very well be worth picking this cd up for the phenomenal see my way alone. it's probably blodwyn pig's finest moment and a delight to listen to over and over.  variations on nainos is also splendid. its a bluesy, spacy cut with  excellent work from sax player jack lancaster in particular throughout the  track ending with some captain beefheart type vocals. i always loved  guitarist mick abrahams voice more than ian andersons when both were in  jethro tull : its harder to get sick of mick's voice. fans of jethro tull,  traffic, and similar bands should enjoy this group. some of this lp is dull  however and the 4 star rating is a bit of a gift from me. i suggest that to  avert the confusion surrounding what track belongs with what album that all  tracks  by this band, including any rarities, live cuts etc. be put out as  perhaps a 2cd set or something.
