 this release covers the transcontinental railroad tour across canada by a legion of big acts from the hippie era...i'd have liked to see footage of my 2 favorite acts that were on the tour: traffic and mountain (leslie west is briefly glimpsed jamming on the train early on) the band and buddy guy provide two of the highlights of the disc, the grateful dead( probably the most overrated group of the period in my opinion) and janis joplin are ok, but not great... the flying burrito brothers are decent, but sha na na is,in a word- TERRIBLE. it boggles my mind as to why they were ever popular..the promoter of the tour comes across as smug and tries a little too hard to present himself in retrospect as some kind of tough guy, and although the music for free crowd can be annoying, so is some guy in one of the bands ( i forget which) called 'kenny.' canadian act mashmakhan does a catchy but derivative instrumental. overall, this documentary is all right, but hardly brilliant, though i guess it is good enough to be worth seeing..
