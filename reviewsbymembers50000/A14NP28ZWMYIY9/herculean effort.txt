 get the large , hardcover one if you can. i got it at a book store for like 14 bucks, they had plenty of excess copies. while i  personally don't care for much punk rock, there are hundreds of wonderful , creative, and beautiful posters from the real golden age of rock- 1965 to about 1971 or so. a bad band from that period would be better than most so called good groups today. i mean, limp bizkit. what the hell is that b.s.? grushkin is to be commended for a great job assembling this tome.
