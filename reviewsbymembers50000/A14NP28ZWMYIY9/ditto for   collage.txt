 these two reviewers are correct, collage is a great tune with excellent and evocative lyrics and exemplary instrumentation and tasteful , not tacky strings. this is certainly a finer album than the next two james gang cds(  rides again and thirds) its more cohesive. although some songs may be a  little too lengthy( ie stop and lost woman,) walshs flashy but incredible  guitar  work is phenomenal. a very impressive first album. the cover of  buffalo springfield's bluebird is excellent. the album is even humorous in  places. fred is another brilliant track with an explosive wah wah ending  that leads into stop. funk 48, not to be confused with the far better known  funk 49  from rides again, is extremely catchy and yes, funky.this is a  diverse and underappeciated gem of an album that is easily the high point  of walsh's career in my opinion.
