 this book has chapters on some of the best songwriters of the era, ranging from the, more or less anyway, fairly well known ( like tim buckley and phil ochs)to the undeservedly obscure, like david ackles. these artists do vary in quality, but the stories are always at least interesting, and often fascinating. there are lots of fine pictures of the performers in the book as well,if anything the work is a little short. people who enjoy the writings of richie unterberger and vernon joynson probably will like this as well
