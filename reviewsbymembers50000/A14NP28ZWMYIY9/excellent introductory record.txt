 i prefer the 2nd, eponymous album but this is a fine debut. sure, some of it may not have dated all that well,-but i think that records MUST be rated according to the standards of their time. the extra singles, which are great, show what a superb and multi-talented band traffic was. this was one of the most talented bands of their era, and quite underrated songwriters- mason and winwood were quite a pair. chris wood was one of the best reed instrumentalists in the history of rock music, and capaldi was a steady and interesting drummer. this is one of the best british psychedelic albums of the era. the follow up was vastly different, few 2nd albums of the time are so profoundly unlike the first. i'd suggest that fans of the 60's as well as those of winwood and mason's other projects pick up this fine debut as well as the traffic and john barleycorn lp's. the third lp, last exit, has a few good tracks but overall its not very consistent. there's plenty of fine songs by this group, but i do feel that the first, second, and fourth lp's are the best.
