 this has got to be one of the top 15 or so albums i've ever heard. every single track is outstanding. i would'nt know where to begin discussing this marvelous album. you'll play this album repeatedly.it may very well be their best one, and even if it isn't it is a bona fide classic.it is a diverse album with hard rock, blues, country, soul etc.and jagger's lyrics are outstanding as usual. the playing is superb and brian jones' replacement, mick taylor,strongly contributed to this album as well as subsequent efforts. this should definitely  be a part of any stones fan's collection, and indeed any one trying to build a collection of 60's music.
