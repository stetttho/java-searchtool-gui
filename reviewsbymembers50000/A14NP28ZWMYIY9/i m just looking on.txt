 this is usually considered to be their worst album but looking on is not without it's charms . perhaps the fact that most songs on this album are quite long scares away some and it can be somewhat bombastic at times, but  along with cherry blossom clinic  from the great shazam album of earlier  that year(1970) the roots of elo can clearly be seen in songs like open up  said the world at the door, what , and the title track. in some respects  the title song owes a lot to free jazz , early heavy metal, and west coast  bands such as maybe quicksilver messenger service.as per shazam, a lot of  different styles and influences are interwoven into the total album.bev  bevan's drums and the effects added to them are perhaps a cliche now or at  least quite familiar, but must have been pretty impressive at the time.i  believe that jeff lynne in particular was at his peak on this album and its  brilliant successor, message from the country( along with his great and  underrated pre-move band, the idle race, who i thoroughly recommend. roy  wood's amazing assortment of ideas and instruments are here also, his  vocals are very loud and good on this recording . plus there are several  non lp cuts added so i recommend it even if its their worst album its still  quite good
