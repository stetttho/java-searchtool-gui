 most people think of blue cheer as a kind of proto- thrash metal, screwed up on speed ,insane, , mindless,etc. power trio. in reality the band evolved and changed greatly over its  original 6 album lifespan. fans of  the early heavy period will find some of their best tracks on this, like  just a little bit and out of focus. the great guitar work of randy holden,  from half of the third album, 1969's new! improved! is featured in fruit  and icebergs and the incredible peace of mind, possibly my own favorite  blue cheer cut. the later blue cheer's best tracks, to me, were the title  track of this collection and the phenomenal i'm the light from their last  record, oh! pleasant hope. lyrics were usually not blue cheer's strong  point, but the addition of gary yoder from the fine obscure late 60's band  kak helped them out in this regard. this eastern tinged ,late psychedelic  tune has a beautiful melody and driving vocals. all in all this is a fine  and rather representative collection of blue cheer material.  there are  some questionable selections but  its a pretty good introduction for  newcomers to this oft misunderstood group who i feel rank perhaps behind  only love, moby grape, the doors and spirit in terms of california late  1960s/early 70's bands.
