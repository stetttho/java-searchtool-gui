 this is bubble puppy under another name. the album's not as good as bubble puppy , but the version of todd's tune is, i think, considerably better. face the crowd is a zeppelinesque gem, love people is a decent mellow number, and windy city is a good cut with some fine socially conscious lyrics. it is a better produced recording than a gathering of promises, but the songs just aren't as memorable. fans of bubble puppy, "zeppelin- type rock: and steppenwolf (nick st. nicholas produced this album) will probably enjoy this album.
