 as the previous  reviewer noted, the book has some great photos. that's about all there is in terms of recommending this work. this guy  really knows very little about the bands and performers of the era, most of whom he trashes. his voice is arrogant throughout. there is one passage where he claims to have a crush on the  female sax player from sly and the family stone's band, who i'm sure if she knew that would have decked this uninformed, delusional braggart...buy some other, better book on the music of the period instead of this poor nonsense.
