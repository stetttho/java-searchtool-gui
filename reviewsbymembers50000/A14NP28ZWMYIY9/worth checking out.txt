 an excellent sixties album that not many will have heard of.in a category with the band gandalf though stylistically very different. the 1st part of trieulogy is reminiscent of neil young's cowgirl in the sand. little of  this is really psychedelic, but there are several first rate rock songs on  this, like disbelievin' , electric sailor, and the aforementioned trieulogy  as well as some classy ballads such as flowing by , which feature some  superb vocals. the band plays well throughout the recording, particularly  the guitarist. gary yoder went on to sing with the less heavy version of  blue cheer, less heavy ,but still worthwhile. in fact, some of their best  songs were recorded while gary was in the band, like good times are so hard  to find, i'm the light, and pilot.the drummer appeared on former blue cheer  guitarist randy holden's 1970 album, population 2. this isnt to suggest kak  are anything like early blue cheer. quite the contrary, though this album  may remind some of the blue cheer of original human beings and oh pleasant  hope, and not just because yoder was in both bands. this is one of the  better late 60s early 70s obscure  one or two psychedelic acts from the  u.s. that ive heard , like gandalf, and the 2 shot band from these parts ,  earth opera, etc.
