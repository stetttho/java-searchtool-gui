 an incredible album that defies you to get sick of it  their best one i feel which is not to knock other brilliant releases such as arthur or lola vs powerman, etc. i love this album it is unique and loveable even within  the context of  the kinks alone.days is a great non lp single from the same  year, 1968. i think its one of the top 20 or 25 records from its era , at  least, and that's saying something as i feel 1968 may have been the  greatest year in rock history. unfortunately fans of the time didn't think  so as this may very well be the lowest selling album of their carreer. too  bad , because it was better than 95% of their competition. all the songs  are great, indeed its a complete recording . to talk about the tracks  individually would take forever. all of the strengths of the kinks that one  can think of are evident on this release( especially ray davies masterful  wit,powers of observation and humanity thats seen in his songwriting)  it  is one cd  that i have played over and over again since i first bought it.  thoroughly recommended...
