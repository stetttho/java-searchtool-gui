 not as good as the first album, but still a good one. the roots of peter  cetera's   subsequent sappiness can be first seen on tripe like the road;  though i must say that where do we go from here is a pleasant  little ditty  with simple yet effective lyrics. the influence of the beatles should be  commented on and i'm surprized that  more people don't notice this about  chicago. the 1st lp had an i am the walrus quote on south california  purples, what else can i say and at the sunrise from the 3rd lp also show  this potent influence. here it is the suite on side 2 and fancy colors that  most prominently display 'beatleisms. in the country shows terry kath's  great guitar work and some fine harmony singing. 25 or 6 to 4 is 1 of those  rare overplayed hits that are hard to get sick of. i could do without the  aforementioned the road ,poem for the people is flat ,and  the orchestrated  suite written by kath is pretty dull too, but overall its a more consistent  album than the spotty if at times great third album if not at the level of  their debut which was 1 of the better ones of the era. of course the  "dedicate ourselves to the revolution in all of its forms" lines  didn't become true -but i hardly find the  band's politics of the era  as  silly as one reviewer suggested in reviewing another of their  albums..though i have to admit they are hardly anyone's idea of  revolutionary music today!
