 these other reviews of the film are great and there is not much to add. the acting of some of the hippie kids is bad, and there are a few holes here and there, but this is a tremendous film that doesn't deserve to be obscure today. boyle's character is like pretty much everyone i grew up with, i think this is his finest performance. and i agree that the soundtrack should be re released on cd immediately.
