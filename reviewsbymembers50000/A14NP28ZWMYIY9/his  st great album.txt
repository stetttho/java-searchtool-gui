 this is my favorite along with hunky dory. to me, space oddity is merely ok and his stuff before that album , when i heard it,was probably the worst stuff ive heard from the 60s by a major rock musician! this album is stellar and there's nothing to complain about really. it is  probably the heaviest of his albums, some of this might remind you of black sabbath and led zeppelin. the songs seem very influenced  by nietzche and orwell.i'm surprised the songs aren't played at all on the radio- ( even though commercial radio sucks) and that the album was a flop when originally released. there are several classic cuts but the only 1 familiar to the average listener is the man who sold the world- but this album is so much more than that 1 song. there isn't a bad song on this fine record, although i dont listen to the supermen very often or she shook me cold.. i would call this a  very good album that falls just short of being a classic
