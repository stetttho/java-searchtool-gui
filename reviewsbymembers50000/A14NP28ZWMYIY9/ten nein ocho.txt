 fans of cream and hendrix in particular should enjoy both of  this british  bands late 60s albums. gun were hardly the most original ensemble , but adrian gurvitz was a pretty fine guitar player in his own right, if not  quite at the genius level of the aforementioned influences. the first  albums highlights include "yellow cab man", "race with the  devil"( a u.k. hit) , it won't be long( heartbeat),'sunshine' , a  corny ,  but somehow good track verging on flower power, rat race , a  heavily orchestrated number, and the 11 minute 'freak out' number take off  which begins with a countdown from various languages. drummer louis farrell  and adrian's bass / vocals brother, paul, provide great contributions to  this recording. one would have probably said that they were a young band  headed for better things. gun also performed ballads and gurvitz is also  notable on both lps for some fine flamenco guitar , they weren't just a  cream-esque', psychedelic  proto- metal power trio . the 2nd lp gunsight  isnt as strong but 'head in the clouds', 'drown yourself in the river'(  with great, addictive delta blues guitar playing), the very heavy 'dreams  and screams' and the soft almost cocktail lounge ballad ' angeline' are all  high points of the disc. it's too bad that like so many other groups of the  era they remain unheard and underappreciated .
