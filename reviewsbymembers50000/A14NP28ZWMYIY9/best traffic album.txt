 i think this is their greatest album;vagabond virgin kinda bores me but the rest is phenomenal. pearly queen is among their greatest tracks, 40,000 headmen is great lyrically, as is feelin' all right, means to an end, and  don't be sad, a quite underrated masterpiece from this record. traffic were  really among the first 'do it all ' combos, this record features wonderful  songwriting and tight, amazing playing. there is hard rock, jazz,  folk,blues west indian music, psychedelia,and soul to be found here,among  other genres i always felt the pre- barleycorn material tended to  be much  better.it;s too bad the 2 cd anthology smiling phases appears to be out of  print, it was a fine introduction to this incredible band. any kids out  there who think of steve winwood only as the composerof overplayed aor  boredom should buy this record. its funny how such great talents of the day  got so bland so quick after starting out with such a bang( see  contemporaries chicago, jethro tull, santana, etc.)
