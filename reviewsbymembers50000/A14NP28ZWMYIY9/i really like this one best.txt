 i'd say this is their greatest album,  it is very diverse, running the  gamut from heavy metal to honky tonk, soul to folk. mott always did great  versions of other people's material in this case dion( your own back yard)  and a youngbloods great number( darkness darkness), plus the originals on  this are incredible. songs like death may be your santa claus and the moon  upstairs are incredibly loud, ahead of their time and excellent tunes. both  foreshadow later heavy metal and punk rock. second love is a great and very   rolling stones circa sticky fingers/exile on main street -like ballad. its  always apparent that mott the hoople weren't mailing in their performances,  ian hunter really believed what he was singing. as always with mott the  hoople the playing on this recording is excellent. a great album that would  please a wide range of music fans that has been unfortunately overshadowed  by mott and all the young dudes. worth picking up.
