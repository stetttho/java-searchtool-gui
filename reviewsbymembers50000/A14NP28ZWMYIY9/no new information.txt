 This book barely contains any new information about Arthur Lee and his fascinating and brilliant group. It's ok if you don't know much about the group but die hard Lee fans will be quite disappointed in this book. I agreewith the other reviewers : most of this book I've read before in liner notes and online postings. This is strange because Hoskyns' other books that I've read (on The Band and music in Los Angeles) were engaging, informative, and entertaining. In addition, he writes for MOJO magazine, a British  publication that is top notch. It's puzzling how he could write such an inferior work as this. I also don't know why Hoskyns loathes the post Forever Changes music by Love so much.  Granted,it's not as essential as the first three albums, but still it is generally quite good. Overall, this is a very disappointing book.
