 this is an amazing  and diverse debut album , with jazz, hard rock,  psychedelia, blues, etc and fine production and decent songwriting.. the  only thing i would complain about is 'free form guitar'. everything else  works on the album, even though some of the tracks have been played to  death since. i agree with the reviewer who said the best stuff is the stuff  not played on the radio. for me, chicago really  went downhill after the  3rd album , ( which was a pretty shaky affair anyway- including some of  their greatest and some of their most bombastic work.),perhaps recording 3  double albums and then a monstrous 4 lp live set depleted their creativity  too much, the 5th album is only so -so. by about 1975 they really had   absolutely nothing left to offer but saccharine mush. sometimes i wonder  why, because these guys were all fine musicians and all 3 vocalists were  certainly talented.then again,it often seems that just about every rock  group had something good  or redeeming about it in the late 60s early 70s  except for maybe the bangor flying circus ...  people who are more familiar  with the likes of hard habit to break will be shocked by the awesome  instrumentation of, in paticular, terry kath, danny seraphine and, yes,  peter cetera . also interesting and rather shocking is that in these early  years the band were very politically to the left. in these years no one was  making fun of chicago, the band earned plaudits from the likes of jimi  hendrix and family's roger chapman. this 1st album is easily their finest  work, and definitely the one to get if you only want one, and that would  include any best of recording out there. i would say that one of the 100  best albums ive ever heard..
