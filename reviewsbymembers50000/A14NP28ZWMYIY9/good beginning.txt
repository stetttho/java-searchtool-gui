 This debut Buffalo Springfield album is a fine start. While I wouldn't claim that it is among the truly great debut recordings, it is a fine disc. Stills and Young were already demonstrating their formidable potential, and Richie Furay's vocals have got to be among the most underrated in all of rock music at that particular point in time. My favorite tracks are probably Young's haunting "Out of my Mind" and "Burned", but there is nothing embarassing here. Strongly recommended.
