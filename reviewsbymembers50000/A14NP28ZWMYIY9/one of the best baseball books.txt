 this is a classic that should go back into print immediately. gammons is probably the finest living baseball writer. this book covers the boston red sox during the decade after their world series appearance in 1975. the heartbreaking 1978 playoff game with the yankees, the beginning of the free agent era, and the wonderful characters like bill lee, george scott, aka " the boomer", bernie carbo,  and the great pitcher fergie jenkins, are all covered. in that period, the red sox had a lot of cool characters and  also some excellent ball players on the team, like jim rice, fred lynn, and carlton fisk, to name just a few. the team's tough  battles with the yankees ( who lee called "fascist brownshirts")are also covered admirably.  gammons has a great sense of humor as well. the book flows superbly, and is a fine read for any baseball fan , even  yankees fans.
