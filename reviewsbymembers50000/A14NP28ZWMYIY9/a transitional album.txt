 this is the missing link between the harder rocking early chicago and the more lightweight hit machine, by the time of 5 , (actually before this period) the group was among the biggest acts in the world and would only get bigger this was the 1st of 5 straight! #1 albums, quite an accomplishment. i think success may have gone to their heads after this album. the album features 2 great album tracks, a hit by varese and while the city sleeps. the role of terry kath was declining which is too bad since he was a top notch guitarist. the hits are ok but i think dialogue is the worst chicago single from the 1st 5 records and saturday in the park is overplayed as someone suggested. now that you've gone is a pretty good track with good drumming by the underrated danny seraphine. some of the rest of the album is merely so-so , and there is even some fluffy 'mom-rock' in this, i.e. stuff your mother would like, sappy overly commercial stuff that cetera unfortunately specialized in. this is an ok disc, but nowhere near the first three albums. rock music was changing by the time of this album, complacency and boredom was setting in. chicago featured a ton of talent instrumentally and vocally, but something  wrong happened after 3.  i'm not just  knocking chicago-this affected a lot of their contemporaries like jethro tull, the moody blues etc. many of the bands of that period, though far better than today's groups (gag), essentially had  little to nothing left by say 1973 or 1974. i'm not saying don't buy chicago 5, it has a few gems. just make sure you get 1, 2, or 3 first.
