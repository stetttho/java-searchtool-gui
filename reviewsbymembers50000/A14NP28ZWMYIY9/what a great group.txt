 fleetwood mac's early stuff remains criminally under regarded in this country. even with the loss of the great  guitarist/vocalist peter green, the band continued to make some outstanding material. lots of great blues, early rock, and country songs on this. the songwriting is fine, and guitarists jeremy spencer and danny kirwan make valuable contributions. the singing is consistently excellent throughout. jewel eyed judy is, as an earlier reviewer commented, an excellent love song. blood on the floor is a humorous country and western parody , with great vocals by spencer, who was a very talented mimic as well as being a blistering guitarist. this is the rock features his superb imitation of elvis. buddy's song is a fine tribute to the great buddy holly with lines from his songs. hi ho silver is a first rate blues number by the band , and earl grey is a charming instrumental. this is a fine album that features christine perfect, soon to become christine mcvie. it's too bad that spencer left shortly after this album to join the children of god cult, he was a funny and gifted individual.
