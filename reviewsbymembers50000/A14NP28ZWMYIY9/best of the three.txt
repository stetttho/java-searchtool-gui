 i like all 3 albums but this one is the best. i agree with the earlier reviewer in that sad memory is a weak and boring track. otherwise this is a great album that should be part of any 60's fan's record collection.some  say it lacks cohesion etc. but i actually feel that that is a strength of  the disc. its formlessness works...
