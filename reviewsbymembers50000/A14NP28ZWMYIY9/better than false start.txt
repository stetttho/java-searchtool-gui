 the first post love release by this extraordinarily gifted all around figure is better than the last love album, 1970's false start. a wide range of styles as always: funk, soul, heavy metal, and hard blues in particular.  the highlight is the amazing love jumped through my window, featuring some  of lee's best vocals ever. otherwise its a quite solid although not  spectacular album i.e. no bad tracks but relatively little  that is truly  memorable. other stellar tracks include everybody's gotta live and you want  change for your rerun. this contains some alternate versions and also a  rather ordinary remake of hendrix's easy rider. this solo album should  certainly please lee's fans, but those expecting another forever changes (  maybe the greatest album ever in my opinion) will of course be  disappointed.
