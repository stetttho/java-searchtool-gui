 this is a wonderful album. what's really impressive is jay kaye was only  FIFTEEN YEARS OLD  when this incredible album was released. it is orchestral psych for the most part, with occasional horns. FLY really is the best track, but NOBODY, an arthur lee and love sounding song is also great. none of the  songs on the album are embarassing or boring. it isn't perfect, but its definitely an overlooked gem of the era.
