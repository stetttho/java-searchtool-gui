 this is often called their greatest record. i havent heard enough of new! improved!, or the final 2 to authoritatively make such a claim. the cover of satisfaction is pretty dreadful and the version of the hunter is  mediocre , but the rest really thunders. highlights include "just a  little bit", "gypsy ball", "feathers from your  tree", the instrumental called, believe it or not, " magnolia  caboose babyfinger","sun cycle" and "come and get  it". maybe youve never heard of blue cheer before and are wondering  what they sounded like...put it this way if youre a jackson browne(yuck)  yuppie youre not gonna enjoy this.......
