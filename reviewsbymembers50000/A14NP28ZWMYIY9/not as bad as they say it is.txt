 most mentions of this album tend to be negative. usually it is a footnote to the career of free (kossoff and kirke were in an earlier black cat bones). this isn't a great disc. for the most part it is fairly run of the mill late 60's british blues, with largely covers. however, the singer has a pretty good voice, and rod price's guitar is excellent in places. feelin' good is probably the highlight of this recording, its a slow bluesy cut with hippieish lyrics that turns into god rest ye merry gentlemen 3/4 of the way through!  there's a decent version  of the blues classic chauffeur as well and , of all things, a cover of nina simone's 4 women. overall this is a pretty pedestrian disc that lovers of the british blues boom may enjoy and it also has traces of progressive rock as well. some of the guys in this band went on to a group called LEAFHOUND that i'm interested in  hearing who are allegedly a really good zeppelin type band  that put out an album in 1971
