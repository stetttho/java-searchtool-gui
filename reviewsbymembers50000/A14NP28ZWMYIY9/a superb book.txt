 unterberger is probably my favorite music writer, his tastes most closely resemble my own. he's right when he says that there were many, many great groups in the 60's that DIDN'T make it. there were (in my estimation) very very few truly bad bands in the 60's and early 70's- most groups had something going for them. if you like this era, you should also try mr. unterberger's other book on obscure rock greats. this book profiles interesting to sublime performers like the bonzo dog band, tim buckley, and fred neil, to name just three. hopefully unterberger will continue to produce books on musical figures from this halcyon period.
