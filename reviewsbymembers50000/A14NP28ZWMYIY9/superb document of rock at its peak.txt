 rock music  definitely peaked around the time of this show. the stones put on a a good performance. the supergroup of lennon richards, clapton, and mitch mitchell doing the beatles' yer blues makes up for the truly hideous caterwauling of yoko ono that ruins an otherwise decent enough jam. taj mahal's number is a pedestrian tune that relies too much on the famous gimme some lovin riff that steve winwood came up with while in the spencer davis group. the marianne faithfull song is also so-so. the who do a fine version of their a quick one opus, and one can tell that the relatively new jethro tull was a hungry band - their rendition of song for jeffrey reminds us that early jethro tull (up through aqualung) was quite a potent aggregation. look out for black sabbath's tony iommi as the guitarist, he'd recently replaced the underrated original guitarist mick abrahams, who went on to blodwyn pig. iommi only stayed with tull for a few weeks. there are some amusing introductions by stoes members. rock music, in my view, was best from, say, 1964-1971...this is a historically important, fascinating souveneir of some of rock's greatest bands.
