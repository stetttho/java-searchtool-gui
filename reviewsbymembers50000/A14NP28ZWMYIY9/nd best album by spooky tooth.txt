 only the tremendous spooky two album tops this one. their version of david ackles' down river is great as is the i am the walrus cover and their version of elton john's son of your father. spooky tooth were great with other people's material. mike harrison was surely one of the finest british vocalists of this or any period.this is a fine album worth picking up , not quite a classic( there's a pair of mediocre cuts on this ) but above average.
