 i first heard this material as part of the split ends album. this is incredible music , not a bad track in the bunch. hard to say which is better this or the shazam album. right now i'm leaning towards shazam , but  this is definitely an excellent , brilliant recording in its own     right.   lynne's ' the words of aaron' may be    his single greatest piece of music  ever. it is a haunting and beautifully performed track with     great  keyboards and  it is a jazzy and heavy ,    tail- end of the psychedelic  era masterpiece.     wood's it wasn't my idea to dance is somewhat      similar, another great eerie cut you'll play over and over and over again.  i guess you could say    that the song is somewhat bombastic, but you'll    love it anyway. ' the minister' is a paperback    writer knock-off that may  be the only instance    ever where someone totally ripped off the beatles   and actually IMPROVED on them, it's an   impressive and very infectious  piece. until your  momma's gone proves that the move could even add   stunning old-time blues  to their diverse      palette, wood's vocals are  great.  the title      track features a good deal of the ominous,         rolling bass rythyms that characterize much of   this album, as well as its  predecessor, looking   on.it also has earth conscious lyrics and ends     with some beach boys type harmonizing. don't mess me up is fine elvis  mimicry , and  ben crawley    has fun with johnny cash, showing the band to  be  excellent at tributes and pastiches. no time      sounds somewhat like  the bee gees with a slight   hint of british isles type folk music and is a     track that grows on you.my marge is a humorous    20's style song and  ella james is a r and b       influenced catchy pop song that would have        probably  been the best choice for a single off    this album. somewhat  strangely, only don't  mess me up appeared on a 45, and that was  as the  b-side of tonight, which does not appear  on this album. amazingly, like  both shazam and    looking on, this record sold poorly not only in     america, where the move remained cult       artists , but also in the u.k.,  where they were   unfairly thought of as borderline bubblegum       singles  artists. which is a shame, as rather few  artists have ever put out albums  anywhere near as  good as the move. this is one of those bands  where it is  best to own their complete catalogue  , i have never heard a bad cut from  the band and  very very few mediocre ones, i strongly           recommend  this and / or any move disc.
