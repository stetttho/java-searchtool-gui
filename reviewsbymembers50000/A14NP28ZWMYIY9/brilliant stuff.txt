 this comprises neil's three albums fred neil, sessions, and the final release of his, the other side of this life .ok , some of the 2nd album (sessions) can be repetitive and not all that great and a few things on the 2nd disc arent totally great either-but most of this collection demonstrates just how many truly superb  but forgotten performers there were out there in the 60's that deserve to be remembered today. fred neil is one of the best songwriters of the era, and certainly had one of the greatest voices of the period. best of all, there is no b.s. about him, the songs may be relaxed but there is no mistaking the sincerity and honesty each time you hear fred sing. the 1st album is a classic of folk rock , or singer songwriter or whatever this music can be called. it really defies description and labelling, suffice it to say that fred neil's voice , guitar playing, and songwriting is incredible. and don't forget the fine accompaniment by "name sidemen" like cyrus faryar, canned heat's alan wilson,the drummer billy mundi and others ( including a duet with gram parsons on the great country/folk standard long black veil  from the 1971 album other side of this lifefor having influenced the likes of dylan and tim buckley alone merits neil "near cooperstown" status. incidentally, buckley covered neil's wonderful the dolphins , and you'll recognize tracks here that were done later on by nilsson, the jefferson airplane, and numerous others. despite a few mediocre and overlong songs here and there, this is the best record i've bought in quite some time.
