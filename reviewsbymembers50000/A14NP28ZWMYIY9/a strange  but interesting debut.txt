 i like this album but i think it is really worth about 3.5 stars. it is certainly different from what one might have expected from bruce after cream broke up. my favorite tracks are to isengard and the original theme from an imaginary western, later covered superbly by mountain. this should appeal to cream fanatics and others interested in jazzy improvisational rock, offbeat balladry, late 60s early 70s music etc. bruce's top notch vocals and excellent instrumentation, (and not just on bass guitar either) are on display in this solid effort. sometimes i wonder why he never became a big star because he is so gifted,but i think he may have purposely chosen a non-commercial route. i think that clapton , on the other hand, became very commercial after derek and the dominos
