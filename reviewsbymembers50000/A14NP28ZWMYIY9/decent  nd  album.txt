 This album really should be a three and a half star recording. It's not as good as their debut album, which featured some of the best lyrics of the period. There are four fine songs here: the epic title track, the eerie and beautiful "Mad Lydia's Waltz",  the early country-rock number "Home to you", and "All Winter Long." "Alfie Finney " is ok too.The other songs aren't very good however. Guest musicians on this album include John Cale of Velvet Underground fame. This album made the charts, which is kind of surprising when you consider that their eponymous debut album is a much greater recording, and yet that album  somehow failed to reach the top 200. Perhaps the Boston area band suffered from the backlash against "The Bosstown Sound." Peter Rowan's vocals and songwriting skills aren't nearly as strong on this followup album, although the playing on it is still of a high standard. More kinds of instruments are used on this album, especially saxophones. Overall, a decent enough record, but get the eponymous album first
