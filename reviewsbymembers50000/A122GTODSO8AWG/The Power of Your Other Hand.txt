 This is a neat little book that helps you tap into your spontaneous, creative, expressive side. Capaccione shows how we usually are dominated by rationality, logic, straight-lined thinking, and how we neglect the wise,  intuitive, spontaneous parts of us. By asking us to do writing exercises  with our "other" hand, she helps us get in touch with our inner  child, with excitedness, a sense of discovery. Doing the exercises (and  they are small, no big tasks at all) can be quite eye-opening - and  thoroughly refreshing for your soul.
