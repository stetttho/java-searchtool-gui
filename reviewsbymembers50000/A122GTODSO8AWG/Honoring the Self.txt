 Seldom has a book, or an author, had such an impact on me as this one. Branden shows so clearly how we can achieve self-worth, self-acceptance,and it opens our eyes on how we stand in our own way sometimes. All those  hidden patterns are revealed, and suddenly everything seems so clear! I  highly recommend this book to anyone who's ready for finding their inner  confidence, peace and calm.
