 This book is for anyone who wants to develop a deeper and keener sense of intuiton. What I like about this is that the author seems to be a very down-to-earth person, who's done her research and has a very solid,  grounded approach to this subject. It's a fun book for those who want to  know more about how to discover and exercise their sixth sense.
