 Anyone who feels they'd like to develop their own wholeness further, who'd like to delve into a realm of peace and calm within, might find this book very helpful. The book gives many many very diverse meditation and  visualization exercises. It is great even for the beginner, since it starts  with very simple, and yet suprisingly so effective little exercises. The  book is also an introduction to Psychosynthesis, a guide for enhancing  psychological and spiritual growth. It is a philosophy of  self-actualization and the art of living. The basic premise is, that we  need to combine all the split-off or repressed parts within us into a  harmonious whole to feel fully alive and free. In easy chapters, the  different concepts are introduced to the reader. Definitely worthwhile  reading!
