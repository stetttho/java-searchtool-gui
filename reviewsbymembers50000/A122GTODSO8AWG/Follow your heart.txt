 This is another jewel from A. Matthews. Just as in his earlier book "Being Happy" he once again pins down in incredibly simple and humorous form the way life works, and how we can make it work for  us. What I find most amazing and impressive is how Matthews can put so  much wisdom and insight into a few sentences. This is a thin book, with  lots of his cartoons to make it look almost like a children's book. And  yet, if you were to weigh the value for day-to-day life you gain from  reading it, it would have to weigh tons. Profound insights that can change  your whole perspective on life. And again, so simple. Your heart will feel  lighter. A great gift even for those who normally shy away from reading!
