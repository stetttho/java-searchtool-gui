 If your interest got hooked in the temperament differences, here is another very useful book on this subject. It is using the same basic four opposite temperament pairs as we are introducing them to you in our series.   Kroeger then explains in detail how, depending on your preference, you  and your loved ones act and react in certain situations at work, at home,  in love. It is quite funny to read his examples from everyday situations  between husband and wife, boss and employee, etc. These arguments between  the different types are so easy to relate to, we've all been there. This  book will further deepen your understanding of the types and give you tips  on how to avoid misunderstandings and better relate to others.
