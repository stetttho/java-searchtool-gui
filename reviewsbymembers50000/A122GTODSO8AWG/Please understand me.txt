 Keirsey's explanation of the different temperaments was a real eye-opener for me. Finally I understand why people get upset with certain of my character traits, and why I always felt so misunderstood by some people. It was a big relief to know that after all, I'm "normal", and so are  the others. Where there used to be resentment on my or the others' part, we  now knowingly smile at each other, saying "ah, there shows your J  again, can't help it, can you?"  Keirsey introduces us to four basic  opposite tendencies in temperament, then describes the temperaments, and  applies this to the areas of relationships, work, children, and  learning. The book starts with a questionnaire that you can take to  determine your type. I would strongly advise not to just read the part  about your own type, though. The real aha effect comes when you read about  the others, too. You won't even need everyone to take the test, you'll know  just by what you've read what types you're dealing with. It's fun to  realize our differences and see them in a new light.
