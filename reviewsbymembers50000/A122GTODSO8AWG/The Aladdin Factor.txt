 Ever heard of "Ask and you shall receive?" Canfield and Hansen illustrate beautifully that this principle really works in all areas of our life - if we are willing to ask. So many times, we don't even try, we think  it's impossible, we give up too soon. The principles of how to do the art  of asking are interspersed with inspiring examples from real life  people.
