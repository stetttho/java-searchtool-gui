 I read this book about a year ago.  I read alot of books and don't remember many of them.  I remember this book vividly because it was so different from the other sci fi I've read.  It's set into the far, far  distant future and was so different, it was a bit hard to comprehend at  first.  The nonhuman races were unique and very believable.  It was  interesting to see humans viewed as "dumb animals" by a wolf-like  race of beings but it wasn't a Plant of the Apes kind of thing.  The  characters were very interesting and very diverse.  As some reviewers  noted, this book doesn't really focus on the technology as it's all  "old hat" for the characters that use it. For something  different, give this a try!
