 I purchased this book(let) expecting to learn of common "pitfalls."  Instead, I believe I was subjected to a rant by the author on how genealogists create the pedigree that they wish they had by ignoring obvious disconnects in their research.  I wouldn't consider this a pitfall.  I consider this fraud.  Great detail was provided for case after case of suspect researchers.  (Of the 74 pages, many were devoted to citations.)  There were some bits of worthwhile information wedged in between the tales of horror.  I found the information on the calendar change and heraldry of interest.  Otherwise, Mr. Rubincam's message was clear.  Don't trust any source by itself.  Always verify and reverify.  I agree completely with this point. I just don't think it in itself justifies a book - even one as short as this one.
