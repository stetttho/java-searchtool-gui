 First off, I have not seen the show.  I bought this CD because I liked "Written in the Stars."  I'm glad I did.  While the LeAnn Rimes duet is still maybe my favorite, I really enjoy Sting's "Another  Pyramid," "The Gods Love Nubia" - Kelly Price has a great  voice, and "A Step too Far."  What I really like about the CD in  general is the mix of music from Sting's sort of Reggae style to the slow  ballads to the zippy Spice Girls number and ever to the almost Gospel like  qualities of "The Gods Love Nubia."  It's a keeper.....
