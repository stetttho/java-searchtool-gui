 I'll say I did enjoy the read - especially the first half.  There were some surprises and a sense of anticipation.  The last half was interesting - especially if you're into the medievel time period - but predictable.  I  was very disappointed in the ultimate purpose for the time travel  technology - not very original for an author of Crighton's caliber.
