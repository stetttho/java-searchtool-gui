 If you're buying this book for more layout ideas, you might want to look elsewhere.  Yes, there are plenty of ideas but the focus here is on the entire album - not the individual pages.  Cynthia Hart shows the reader how to actually craft an album - from cover to cover (literally).  About 90 pages are devoted to instruction, 90 pages are devoted to designs and about 50 pages are of art and templates (which can be copied for personal use).  The scrapbook designs range from the usual wedding scrapbook to a rollerblade scrapbook.  There's even a horse show book made in the shape of a horse's head!  Supply lists, color photos and instruction are included with each design.  While I may never be as creative as Cynthia Hart, I'll view my scrapbooking from a new perspective thanks to her book!
