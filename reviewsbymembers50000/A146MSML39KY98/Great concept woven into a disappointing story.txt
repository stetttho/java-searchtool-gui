 This is the first Greg Bear book I've read and I'll probably read more.  I thought his premise was very interesting - evolution occurring as a "flash cut" rather than gradually.  However, I found the story  quite disappointing.  I agree with the previous review that a sequel is in  order.  Numerous characters were introduced throughout the story.  We began  to care about them only to have them simply disappear from the book without  further word.   I also think many of the plot lines could have been  better developed.  All the important events just seemed to be very  convenient and very unprobable coincidents.  This a really a shame since it  could have been so much more.
