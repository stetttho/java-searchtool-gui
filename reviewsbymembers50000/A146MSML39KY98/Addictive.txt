 I bought this game because I enjoy computer games and don't have a place to set up a traditional jigsaw puzzle.  Now I'm hooked!  The interface was easy to use.  However, I didn't like the tray sorting system.  If you're  trigger happy with the mouse, your trays end up getting combined or dumped  pretty easily.  I ended up not using it.  I was concerned that the  exploration part would be kind of skimpy but was pleasantly surprised.   There are more puzzles once you're inside the mansion as well as the  mystery to solve.  The graphics were very good.  It was also neat to see  the mansion from the inside and be able to identify features that you put  together in the puzzle segment of the game.  The attention to detail was  great.  I can't wait to do the Castle and Notre Dame!
