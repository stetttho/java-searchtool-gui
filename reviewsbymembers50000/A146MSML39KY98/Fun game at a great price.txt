 I didn't buy the first game based upon the reviews I read here.  Most reviewers spoke highly of the second edition so I couldn't pass it up.  I'm glad I did!  The game installed without a hitch.  The graphics are pretty  good and the sound is great!  I did about as good on the game as I do  watching the show so I guess it's a "realistic" experience!    Best of all, the price is right.  I've paid a good deal more for games not  half as entertaining.  Go ahead - you know you want it!
