 I had never heard of Christina Aguilera until I saw her perform "Genie in a Bottle" during ABC's Millenium coverage.  I loved the song and ordered this CD.  I'm always afraid to do this since the song I  buy the CD for is often the only one I like.  I enjoy all of this cd and  I'm part of the "over 40" crowd!  I love Christina's sultry  voice.  Genie in a Bottle is still my favorite track but I also especially  enjoy Come on Over.
