 Readers who appreciate an intricate mystery plot will enjoy Dobson immensely. This book has it all--a tightly-woven, haiku of a mystery; interesting, well-developed characters who act in synchronization with  their motives (and whose motives stem from their personalities); and an  intimate and realistic exploration of the specialized world of  academia. It's a shame how few mystery writers manage to hit all three  targets, but Dobson shows herself to be a master (that she keeps this up  through the next two books is nothing short of amazing). Dobson's specialty  (in my opinion) is the integration of subplots and side stories with the  main mystery. Everything happens for a reason, and the reason always has to  do with the mystery (not just to throw the reader off-track). I'm looking  forward to the fourth book in the series this winter.
