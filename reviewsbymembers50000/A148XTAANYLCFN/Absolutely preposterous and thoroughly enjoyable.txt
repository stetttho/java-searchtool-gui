 Ok, ok...so the premise that five or six mob families all use the same guy as their accountant and that this man keeps all their account information in his head is a bit of a stretch. (That this man's death is so easily  faked is even more of a stretch, in my opinion.) Once you get past the  set-up, this book is very enjoyable. So if you were a mob accountant who  had faked his own death, you'd have two problems: what to do with the  billions of dollars, and where to hide. If you're lucky, you'd have the  help of Jane Whitefield. Jane is a woman who specializes in making people  disappear. She's also smart as a whip and pretty mean with any weapon she  can lay hands on. Watching her think herself two steps ahead of her  pursuers is one of the joys of this series. Perry is a good writer, and  the Jane Whitefield series continues to be excellent. The ending to this  novel is not as climactic as in some of his other novels, but if it had  been, it would have seemed formulaic. Hats off to Perry for keeping us  guessing.
