 I hesitate to call this novel a masterpiece, not because I have any  doubts, but because I fear it may turn people away from a really enjoyable  book. Don't let the critical acclaim scare you off--this is a great  read. Tom Ripley is a down and out young American whose prospects are  minimal until he is sent to Italy to persuade an old school chum, Dickie  Greenleaf, to return home to the United States. Instead of convincing  Dickie to return home, however, Ripley finds himself enamored of Dickie's  carefree lifestyle and ready access to money. Ripley dreams of becoming a  permanent fixture in Dickie's life, but when it becomes clear that Dickie  is growing bored with Ripley, Ripley calmly and coolly kills Dickie and  assumes his identity. Mr. Ripley's talents, alluded to in the title,  include forgery, impersonation, and murder. What makes this book a  masterpiece is the way Highsmith draws the reader into Ripley's world. His  actions seem not only logical, but also inevitable. The reader is brought  to sympathize with him utterly, as we watch him grow (if it can be called  that) from a clever but passive misanthrope to a cunningly amoral hedonist.  How can you loathe a man who wants to use his ill-gotten gains to start an  art collection? The story is told from Ripley's point of view, which  leaves the reader with a lot to think about. Ripley's perceptions are  necessarily tainted by his own world view, and the book may well be worth a  second or third read to try to sort out Ripley's perceptions from reality.  Does Dickie love his lady friend Marge, or are they just good friends? What  are Dickie's true feelings for Ripley? What brings Ripley to act the way he  does? The answers provided in the recent movie based on this novel are  rather simple and, ultimately, pedantic (focusing too much on the  possibility that Ripley is homosexual). The novel is far more interesting  and complex. Don't miss it!
