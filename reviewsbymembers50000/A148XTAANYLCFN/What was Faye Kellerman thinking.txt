 This book was bad, bad, bad. I've read my share of mysteries with fantastical plots, but this book had not even one sympathetic character. I didn't care about anyone, I didn't care about the story, and I didn't care  about the outcome. In fact, I didn't even read this book in its entirety  (and I normally manage to plod through anything once I've started), but my  mother (who had loaned me the book) assured me that finishing the book was  a waste of time. I LOVE Kellerman's other books, but I won't be tricked  into buying another book with these characters again. Kellerman fans -  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!
