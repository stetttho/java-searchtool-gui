 I saw the end of this book coming a mile away. Perry's books are all so DARK, it becomes easy to guess what horrible secret (incest, pedophilia,  necrophilia, etc.) will be revealed. And WHY does Monk always wait until  the trial is underway before he really starts investigating?! I think  Perry's plots are becoming strangled by her own conventions as an author.
