 On the one hand, this sixth book in the Stephanie Plum series has all the qualities of the previous five. Unfortunately, it also has all the same  plot devices, with nothing new to enliven the mix. The novelty has worn  off, and Stephanie is starting to look pretty shallow. What other grown  woman is so devastated by a zit or so obsessive about sex? It's funny, but  it's also getting pretty old. The cliffhanger from the previous book is  resolved with little fanfare and even less finesse, pretty much setting the  tone for the entire book. The usual hijinks ensue with the usual crowd:  Grandma Mazur, Lula, bumbling thugs (following her around, just like the  last book!). None of this would be too bad if Stephanie herself would grow  a little, but she's the same ol' Steph, sailing along without too much  introspection. I'm not even sure this book can be called a mystery, since  very little sleuthing occurs, and the mystery is not so much solved as it  is resolved. In the usual manner.
