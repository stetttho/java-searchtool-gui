 This is the third in Tim Cockey's "hearse" series, and it's far and away the best. It has all the humor and attitude of the first two, but here Cockey shows us he can serve up a great mystery too. Hitchcock ("Hitch") Sewell is a thirtysomething undertaker, surely one of Baltimore's most eligible bachelors. When his good friend Lucy is accused of killing her boyfriend, he sets out to find the real killer. As a truly amateur sleuth, Hitch counts himself lucky when he meets Pete Munger, a bona fide private investigator (unfortunately suffering from a midlife crisis). Together, these two will bring a killer to justice. This is an intricate mystery, with almost every character having a strong motive. There are twists and turns galore, and at the center of it all is Hitch, whose ironic sense of humor and quick turn of phrase have made this series a continuing delight. The addition of Pete Munger to this series provides a dour counterpoint to Hitch's carefree jesting. I hope and pray Munger is a permanent addition. These two have the makings of a great mystery-solving pair.
