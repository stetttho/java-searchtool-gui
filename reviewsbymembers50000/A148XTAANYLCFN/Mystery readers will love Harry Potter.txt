 There's a reason the Harry Potter books are so popular with an adult audience--they're wonderful! And Jim Dale brings Harry's world to life in the audio versions--I pity readers who have ignored these outstanding  tapes. Thankfully, they're unabridged. You won't want to miss a word. The  third installment in the series is far and away the best (so far), full of  surprises and twists. The first two books follow a pretty simple formula  and felt like children's books--I was beginning to fear the entire series  would follow the same predictable format. But Rowling's readers are growing  older along with her protagonist, and the plot of this one is subsequently  more sophisticated. Like the rest of the world, I am eager for the fourth  book, but willing to wait the extra time for the audio version. Mystery  readers should try this series--although the books are known as  "fantasy" novels they are also cracker-jack mysteries, complete  with clues, surprise revelations, and adventure. Those of you who are too  embarassed to be caught reading a "children's" novel have  probably also missed out the best fiction of C.S.Lewis and Madeline  L'Engle. Don't deny yourself these literary pleasures!
