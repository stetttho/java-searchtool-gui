 Stephanie Barron's Jane Austen mystery series has maintained its freshness and appeal through this, the sixth in the series. These books are supposedly Austen's "discovered diaries" edited by Barron, whose explanatory footnotes help the reader better understand the time period and locale. This episode finds Jane in Southampton in 1807. Her brother Frank, a post captain in the Royal Navy, is convinced that his good friend Tom Seagrave, a captain who stands accused of violating the Articles of War (the punishment for which is death), is innocent. Jane becomes convinced as well, and together, they set out to prove it. Their conviction takes them from Southampton's finest homes to its darkest slums, from the sickroom of French prisoners of war to the discovery of espionage and finally, a revelation of ultimate betrayal. Barron shows herself to be a master of plot here, as a tangled (but never convoluted) web of intrigue and revenge is slowly revealed. The many characters and motivations are complex and fully drawn, and Jane's enthusiasm for the Navy gives us a glimpse into a time when military service could mean the making of a fortune. I'm not an Austen scholar, but I am an Austen fan, and I enjoy the entire series for the way it evokes Austen's sly sense of humor in reporting the events and people that surround her. The only thing that kept me from giving 5 stars is that I was able to solve the mystery myself.
