 The only reason I read this book is because it's by Anne Perry, whose earlier fiction I greatly admire but whose writing has let me down IMMENSELY over the past few years. I'd hoped this "novella," a departure from her two mystery series, would represent a return to the compelling story-telling I used to associate with Perry. Alas, it does not. This is a short story, not a novella (barely 70 pages with large print, wide margins, and small pages). The characters are like stick figures, with no past or personality to explain their actions. The plot careens around and through historical figures and events without touching them--Perry seems to have chosen to set the story in 1792 Paris because the time period interested her, not because it has much to do with the plot. In fact, without the description of historical events, this wouldn't even pass muster as a short story. As a reader extremely familiar with Perry's thought process, I saw the "surprise" ending coming miles away. The only saving grace to this story is that you can read it and be done with it in one sitting.
