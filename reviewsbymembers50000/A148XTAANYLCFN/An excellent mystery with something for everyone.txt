 The China Bayles series offers the best of all worlds for mystery fans. China herself is no nonsense and tough talking (she calls her husband by his last name), with a background in criminal law and a circle of friends that include police chiefs, sheriffs, and Texas Rangers. But she's put the dog-eat-dog business world behind her to run an herb shop in the small Texas town of Pecan Springs, and she's just recently opened a tearoom with her best friend, Ruby. With Christmas approaching, business is booming, but then things start to go awry. China's mistletoe supplier, Carl Swenson, turns up dead by the side of the road, the victim of an apparent hit-and-run. The main suspects are Carl's next-door neighbors, the two Fletcher sisters, who happen to be China's good friends. And on top of all that, China's friendship with Ruby is suddenly strained by Ruby's odd behavior and insistence that nothing is wrong. This is an interesting mystery, with ample subplots and characters to keep a reader on her toes. China is a complicated character, and her life in Pecan Springs is fun to read about. This is the ninth book in the series (preceded by Lavender Lies), but Albert does an excellent job of making China's recurring involvement with mystery solving plausible. (It's difficult for long-running series to keep their amateur sleuths stumbling over crime in a realistic manner. Most authors don't manage it very well.) A thoroughly enjoyable Christmas mystery.
