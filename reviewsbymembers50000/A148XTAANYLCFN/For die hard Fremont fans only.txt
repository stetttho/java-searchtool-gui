 This book is a western, not a mystery. It tries to be a mystery, but it relies too heavily on events that happened earlier in the series. In other words, if you haven't read the rest of the series, you have no chance to  solve this one and probably won't care enough to try. Fremont's captivity  is disturbing and dull, and I am not interested enough in the supporting  characters to enjoy an entire book with them at center stage. Everyone  seems to act out of character in this book, and it doesn't help that none  of them are quite in step with the time period either. How could it have  taken so long for women to get the vote with so many bold adventuresses on  the loose? I loved the first two books in this series, but was  disappointed in the last one and EXTREMELY disappointed in this one. Dianne  Day may have only one chance left with this reader.
