 This is a truly wonderful book that will help you rethink your approach to gardening. The emphasis is on careful planning of your garden design and smart selection of plants, all to save you time and work in the future. The most useful part of the book is undoubtedly the "Picking Unpicky Plants" section, which includes lists of vegetables, herbs, annuals, perennials and biennials, bulbs, trees, shrubs, and ornamental grasses. The last portion of the book is "Easy Projects for the Weekend Gardener," an excellent source for quick ideas for your garden, such as "A Quick Walk," a garden path that can be created in a few hours and won't be overrun by weeds. Despite its limited availability, this book is a must-have for anyone who enjoys having a garden but doesn't want to spend their every spare moment working on it.
