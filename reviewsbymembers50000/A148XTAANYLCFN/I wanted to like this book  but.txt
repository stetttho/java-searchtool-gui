 I admire the feminist politics behind this book. Jo Fuller is plus-sized and not ashamed of it, and when her close friend is found murdered with "Kill the Whales!" scrawled on the mirror, Jo decides to  investigate. As any fiction reader can attest, overweight female  protagonists are few and far between, and the introduction of such a  character should be a refreshing breath of fresh air. The problem with  this book is not that it's heroine weighs over 200 pounds. The problem is  that reading it FEELS like reading a book with an agenda, rather than  reading a book with a great mystery plot and an interesting heroine. The  author is simply too heavy-handed with the message--slim people are  depicted as starving, unhappy, and unfailingly rude. On top of that, Jo's  instant (mutual) attraction to her dead friend's lover was repellent to me.  You know the old saying about the body not being cold yet? The connection I  felt to Jo, with all her wit and charisma, was severed when she gave in to  this attraction. And unfortunately, that connection was never regained.
