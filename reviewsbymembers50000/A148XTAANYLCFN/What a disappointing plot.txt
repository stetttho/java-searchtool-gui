 I am a HUGE Anne Perry fan, but I found this one to be a bit of a letdown. Perhaps I've been spoiled by Perry's trademarks: tightly wound plots and shocking conclusions. This one just seemed to sputter to an end. Plot  hole #1 (don't worry, I don't give anything away): Part of the big mystery  is figuring out what all the blackmail victims have in common. During the  course of Pitt's investigation, several  of the victims discover who their  fellow blackmailees are and rack their brains trying to figure out what  they all have in common. But when the reader finally learns what the  victims DO have in common, it seems inconceivable that the victims  themselves didn't figured it out earlier. Plot hole #2: It's clear very  early on that the blackmailer is blackmailing to cover something up (i.e.,  not blackmailing for money). But when you discover who the blackmailer is,  you never understand WHY he or she (or they) did the thing that's being  covered up. The motive seems to be: the villain is a bad person. Pretty  weak by Perry's own standards. The historical detail and the main  characters are engrossing as usual, which is why I've given three stars.  But the mystery lacked punch.
