 Several of my favorite mystery authors have recently let me down with really poor plotlines, as if our interest in the main character were more important than a tightly-wound plot. Not Kijewski. It was a relief to me to  read a solid mystery story. I was captivated from beginning to end. I found  Kat's depression to be very realistic, as well as Hank's death. Not all  murders are solved instantly, and Hank's may never be--I appreciate  Kijewski's realism. I enjoyed watching Kat start to regain interest in her  own life as she focused on the case. And I can't wait for the next one.
