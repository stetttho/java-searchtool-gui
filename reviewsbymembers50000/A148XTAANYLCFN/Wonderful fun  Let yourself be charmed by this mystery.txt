 Set in 1923 England, this series follows the adventures of the Honorable Daisy Dalrymple, a young woman who has defied convention by choosing to make her own living (as a journalist) rather than let her aristocratic family support her. She uses her connections, however, to gain access to material for her writing. In this, the second of the series (preceeded by "Death at Wentwater Court" and followed by "Requiem for a Mezzo"), Daisy is researching information for the second installment of her articles on country manor houses for Town and Country magazine. Having inveigled an invitation to Occles Hall, Daisy finds herself entangled in mystery when the body of a pregnant maid is discovered in the garden. Aggravated by the ineptitude of local investigators, Daisy calls on her friend Alec Fletcher of the Scotland Yard for help. This series is absolutely charming, a delight for fans of the "cozy" subgenre of mystery writing. Unlike many authors of this subgenre, Dunn doesn't over-rely on antics and hilarity to carry her story, but instead allows the mystery to drive her plot. The characters are interesting and well-developed, the depiction of the era is precise, and the execution of the mystery plot is masterful. Daisy is an enormously likeable character, intelligent and practical. There is a lot to like in this series, so hopefully this title will be re-released in paperback soon (as was the first in the series). In the meantime, check your library, and tell your friends.
