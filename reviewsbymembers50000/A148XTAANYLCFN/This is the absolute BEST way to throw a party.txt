 If you've ever wanted to have a few friends over but worry that your party may, for whatever reason, fall flat, throwing a mystery party is a wonderful solution. People can chat and get to know one other while they play the game. And if you and your friends happen to be mystery lovers, all the better, because the "How to Host a Murder" games are marvelous fun. The game provides plenty of structure, making your party easy to plan. You can be as elaborate (costumes, multi-course meals) or as casual (jeans and pizza) as you like. "The Last Train to Paris" is an excellent episode, particularly if you would like to throw an elegant party (characters include a princess and a spy). The mystery is top-notch; nobody guessed the murderer at the party I attended (and we were a group of avid mystery fans). I HIGHLY recommend this game for mystery lovers and adventurous hosts.
