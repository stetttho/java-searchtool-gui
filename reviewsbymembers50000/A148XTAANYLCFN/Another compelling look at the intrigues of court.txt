 This is an outstanding mystery series for lovers of historical fiction, and although this entry may lack the punch of the first two (there seemed to be too few real surprises) the book is still a worthwhile read. The  mystery is solid and interesting, the characters are complex, and the  description of time and place is unbeatable. Best of all, Fiona Buckley  is an extremely good writer, a true pleasure to read. Unfortunately,  Scribner's proofreaders seem to be letting her down--I noticed several  typos (including a "teh" in place of "the").  Spell-check, anyone?
