 This is an absolutely compelling novel that depicts a group of people, each a specialist in his or her own field, struggling to track down a serial killer back in the days when "serial killer" was an  unknown phrase. The process they use to catch this  killer--"profiling" as it known nowadays--is untested and  unreliable at their point in history. What is fascinating about this book  is not watching these people track down a killer, but watching them  discover HOW to track down a killer. The point of this book is the journey,  not the destination. And what a journey! Carr is a vivid writer, bringing  each character to life so clearly that I could see the story unfold in my  mind as clearly as if watching it on a movie screen. You've read the phrase  "couldn't put this book down?" I called in sick to work to finish  this book.
