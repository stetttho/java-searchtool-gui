 A Breach of Promise exemplifies everything wonderful about Anne Perry's  work: complex characters, a detailed plot driven by those characters, and a  rich, historical setting. Whenever I finish one of her books, I feel I have  learned something new about the human psyche and its darker side. Hester,  Monk, and Rathbone, with all their tension and awkward friendship, are  fascinating, and watching them grow as people over the course of this  series has kept this reader immensely satisfied. Add to that satisfaction  the interest and complexity of each "case" the three have worked  on together, and you will understand why Anne Perry has so many devoted  fans.
