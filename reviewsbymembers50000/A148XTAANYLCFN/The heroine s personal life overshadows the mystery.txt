 This series features Lily Bard, an emotionally and physically scarred cleaning lady with a penchant for solving mysteries. (She lives in a town called Shakespeare-- Shakespeare/ Bard...get it?) As a rape survivor, Lily  is a loner with little patience for the everyday human interactions that  most people thrive on, and cleaning is part of her refuge (as well as her  livelihood). Sound dark? It is. Up to this point in the series, Lily's  past has been part of her characterization, part of what makes her  interesting and different. In this, the third entry in the Shakespeare  series, Lily's past dominates the story as she comes home for her sister's  wedding. The neighbors and loved ones she left behind look at her and think  "rape victim," not "Lily," and she cannot stand their  pity. Add to this drama a visit from Lily's intense boyfriend (with whom  the sex is so steamy the two can barely keep their hands off each other),  and the mystery plot is simply incidental. One of three little girls was  kidnapped as an infant from her true parents, and solving the mystery is  more a process of elimination than an exercise in sleuthing. This is not  a stand-alone mystery; readers should start with the first two in the  series, then read this one to understand the development of the character.  Though it was nice to meet Lily's family and explore some of her past, I  look forward to seeing Lily return to Shakespeare for the next book.
