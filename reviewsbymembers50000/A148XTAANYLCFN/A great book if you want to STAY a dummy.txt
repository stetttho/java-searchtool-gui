 Whenever I have a new software to learn, I go buy the "dummies" title to get me up to speed. Sadly, I'll be returning this title and looking for something more informative. Although this book does teach you how to use FrontPage in the most basic possible way, it does not cover some very fundamental topics. For one thing, the author recommends using readymade (albeit customize-able) "themes" to design your site, with little information on how to format if you're NOT using a theme. The author also neglects to mention that using a theme will create a huge folder of theme graphics in your web, whether your site uses those graphics or not. So you can double or triple your upload time. This example is emblematic of many problems with the book. I'm not a sophisticated computer user, and when I'm first learning a software, I count on the "dummies" titles to answer my novice questions. When I have questions that go unanswered, something's wrong. This might be a good book for the individual user who wants to fool around with the software and perhaps design a personal web page. But if you're looking for the skills you need to design a professional looking site, look elsewhere.
