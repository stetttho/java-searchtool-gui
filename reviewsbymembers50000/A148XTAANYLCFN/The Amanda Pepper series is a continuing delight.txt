 Gillian Roberts is a wonderful mystery writer. In each of her books, there is always at least one point when I laugh out loud at her witty phrasing, and when she's at her very best, as she is in "Helen Hath No  Fury," I laugh from beginning to end (look for Roberts' vivid  description of the effects of humidity). Amanda Pepper is a high school  teacher in Philadelphia. Although she has a live-in boyfriend (homicide cop  C.K. Mackenzie), she is of an age when her friends have been married  multiple times, and her own single status is a source of frustration (at  least to her mother). When a member of Amanda's book group is found dead of  an apparent suicide, the group's suspicions are aroused, and Amanda, in her  continuing quest to retrieve her raincoat from the dead woman's house,  finds herself in the middle of a murder investigation. Roberts has cooked  up a solid mystery here. At one point, I felt positive I knew the culprit  and was surprised and pleased to discover I was completely wrong. For the  avid mystery fan, there is nothing better than the surprise ending. Add to  that the fun of reading about Amanda, a character whose evolution  throughout this series has been interesting and enjoyable without ever  overpowering the mystery plot, and you have a real winner.
