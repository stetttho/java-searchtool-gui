 This book has some valuable and interesting tips for the financially savvy. Unfortunately, the book presents itself as a guidebook for beginners, and in inexperienced hands, this advice may spell financial  disaster for those who need the most help. Example: Kiyosaki encourages  risky investments over more stable but less profitable investments. This  might be good advice for those with an already diverse portfolio, but  considering that the vast majority of people are not adequately preparing  for their retirement years, this advice might be the worst possible. The  rich dad/poor dad story that everyone else seems to find so charming  repelled me--Kiyosaki seems in need of therapy to resolve his childhood  issues. He encourages the reader to not let money have too much power, but  then he has clearly made it the governing influence of his entire  life. Sadly, the biggest weakness of this book is that Kiyosaki never  conveys WHY the acquisition of money is so important to him, or should be  to us. He doesn't know what it means to feel pride in one's work, or to  love one's job. He also doesn't seem to know what it means to enjoy life as  opposed to enjoying money.
