 I love all these recent reviews calling "A" trite and typical--Grafton wrote this in 1982, and if it seems trite now it's because Grafton revolutionized the genre, and everyone has been copying her plots  and style ever since! Kinsey Millhone is a hard-boiled, gun-toting,  loner--a private investigator who keeps to herself and does whatever it  takes to solve her case. I first read this book as a teenager, and Kinsey's  toughness and un-sentimentality turned me off (young romantic that I was).  Coming back to this series as an adult has given me an appreciation for the  character and the genre that I lacked before. What you see is what you get  with Kinsey Millhone, and that simplicity is her strength. This book is  not only truly groundbreaking, it is also a plain ol' great mystery.  Grafton keeps Kinsey busy interviewing suspects, following leads, and  stirring up trouble. Kinsey's work is pretty much her life, and except for  the occasional evening with a handsome stranger, you can expect her to stay  focused on the case. Unless you prefer your mysteries soft and cozy,  you'll enjoy Kinsey Millhone and her straight-forward approach to crime.  Best of all, if you enjoy this one, there are 14 more (so far) to keep you  busy.
