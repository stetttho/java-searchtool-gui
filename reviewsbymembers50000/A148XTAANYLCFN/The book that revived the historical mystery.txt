 What plot! What a setting! What characters! Anne Perry started a revolution with this book, the first in her Charlotte and Thomas Pitt series (Charlotte is not "Pitt" yet in this book). When murder  disturbs the elite and proper world of the Ellison family, the cracks begin  to show in the family's heretofore placid exterior. Family members start to  look at each other with fear and doubt, and suspicion is as frightening as  truth. Perry's depiction of Victorian England is detailed and  fascinating--she is as knowledgeable of upper-class life as she is of the  working-class. Her characters are realistic and sympathetic, and the kicker  of an ending in this book is the sort that has become her trademark. You  cannot call yourself a fan of the historical mystery without reading this  book.
