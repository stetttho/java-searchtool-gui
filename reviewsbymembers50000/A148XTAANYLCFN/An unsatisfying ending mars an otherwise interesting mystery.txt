 This entry in the Jane Austen series--purportedly a series of Austen's personal journals only recently discovered--has many of the delights that characterize the entire series. Jane is a complex character, frustrated on the one hand by the limitations society places on her as a woman, and completely unaware on the other hand of her own biases towards members of the "lower" classes. Her sharp wit and keen observing eye make her an ideal sleuth. Jane's trip through the Derbyshire countryside with her cousin is marred by the discovery of a mutilated body, that of Tess Arnold, the stillroom maid at a local estate. A "stillroom maid" is a sort of healer, an herbalist, employed by a family for their own treatment, but also free to sell medicines to local townspeople. The more Jane discovers about the maid and the estate where she worked, the more tangled the web of mystery surrounding her death becomes. Ultimately, the web proves too convoluted. The solution to the murder and the revelations of the last 15 pages of the novel stretch the abilities of even a close reader, and how Jane solves the mystery is not satisfactorily explained. Another death near the end of the book borders on inexplicable (or at least, too hastily explained). A final note to Ms. Barron: as long as you are fictionalizing Jane Austen's life, you might consider allowing Jane a little requited love in her life, for the sake of your readers.
