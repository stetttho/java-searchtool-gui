 I heartily agree with the reviewer who described this book as an "outline" for a great mystery. Mystery fans will find this book extremely formulaic and simplistic. The familiar and uninteresting  characters were most disappointing to me: the little old lady who's not  what she seems, the wise-cracking reporter, the bumbling but  well-intentioned police chief, the intelligent young woman trying to put  her past behind her, idiot teenagers. The fact that the little old woman is  an alcoholic is not amusing or charming, though the author thinks it  is. The plot is contrived to introduce the whole crossword puzzle theme  to the series and to introduce all the characters to us. It holds up well  enough, but can't compensate for the weak characters (including the  killer). Readers looking for an interesting old lady would do well to try  Heron Carvic's Miss Seeton series instead.
