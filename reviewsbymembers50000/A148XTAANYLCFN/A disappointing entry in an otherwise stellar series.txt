 I really enjoy the Fremont Jones series, particularly the characters and the historical setting. But the plotline of this book was simply too thin. Dianne Day has fallen into the lazy mystery writer's trap - the solution to  the case is "The murderer was a lunatic!" The reader plods  through myriad clues and tangents only to have everything suddenly wrapped  up in one swift, unconvincing chapter. I also fear that the Fremont Jones  character is losing some authenticity. She is an atypically progressive  woman for the time period, yet everyone who meets her seems to love her.  Everything she does/attempts works out just perfectly (i.e., her guise as a  man - so successful that her own lover doesn't recognize her), and her  every problem solves itself easily (i.e., her money situation). I much  preferred the Fremont of the first two books - a woman who was struggling  to make ends meet, to find her way in the big city. She seems to have lost  some humanity. I hope that the next installment in this series shows  Dianne Day returning to form and giving us the Fremont Jones we want to  read about.
