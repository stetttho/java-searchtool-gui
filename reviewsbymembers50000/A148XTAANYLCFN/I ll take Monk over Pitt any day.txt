 The mistake Perry made in her Pitt series was developing her characters too quickly--she has had to compensate by introducing a rather large cast of supporting characters. This, the first in her William Monk series,  avoids that gaffe by inducing amnesia in her hero--he hardly knows who he  is or what he's about. It may be preposterous, but it's also an enjoyable  read and an outstanding mystery. The story has Monk attempting to learn  the set of circumstances that resulted in his hospitalization and  amnesia--he must face the horrifying possibility that he was involved in a  vicious crime, and he knows too little of himself to trust that he was  incapable of such a deed. He learns through the reactions of others that he  was (is?) not a nice man, and the more he learns, the more he doubts  himself. The fact that his past does not come flooding back to him after  another bump on the head speaks well to Perry's prowess as a  writer. Hester Latterly and Oliver Rathbone are the edgy counterparts to  Monk's dark personality. Though never friends, these three circle each  other with wary respect. Monk himself is an appealing character, the  mystery is top-notch, and the Victorian setting is quintessential  Perry--she has made it uniquely her own.
