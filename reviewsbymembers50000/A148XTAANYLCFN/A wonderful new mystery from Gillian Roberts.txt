 This is a really enjoyable mystery from the author of the popular Amanda Pepper mystery series. "Time and Trouble" is darker, edgier, better written, and more tightly plotted than any of the Amanda Pepper books, and I hope this is the first in a new series from Roberts. Emma Howe is a crusty old P.I. whose unapologetically blunt demeanor repels her employees; she's gone through seven detective trainees in less than three years. Enter Billie August, a young, pretty single mom desperate for a steady income and a mental challenge. Theirs is a match made in hell--Billie's naive earnestness and Emma's been-there-done-that coldness bring out the worst in the other. After Billie botches her first case, their partnership seems doomed. Billie is given a second chance, however, when the Howe Agency is asked to locate a teenage runaway. Learning as she goes, Billie soon finds herself involved in something far more complex--and dangerous--than she imagined. These two characters are marvelous depicted; each is so distinctive, complex, and fully portrayed. The reader completely understands Emma's irritation with Billie and Billie's frustration with Emma--each person is so convinced the other is a big pain. Kudos to Roberts for creating a relationship that is so fresh and interesting. The plot is satisfyingly complex. Another reviewer complained of "coincidences," but I did not think these strained credulity. I read stranger things in the newspaper every day. I highly recommend this book and look forward to reading the next in the series.
