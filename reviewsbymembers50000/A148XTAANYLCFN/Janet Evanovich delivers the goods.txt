 Fans of this series have certain expectations, and Evanovich is smart enough to deliver. Our heroine is smart-mouthed and sexy (not one, but TWO incredibly handsome beefcakes are after her in this one), the supporting  characters are...ahem..."colorful" might be the right word  (colorful to the point of parody--not always intentional), and the plot is  fast-paced and fun. Stephanie tends to stumble over clues and stumble out  of dangerous situations, and the joy of this series is that none of the  stumbling feels too contrived. Kudos to Evanovich for sticking to a  winning formula--she knows, as do her readers, that the charm of the  Stephanie Plum series is Stephanie herself, not the plot. The fact that the  plot is quite good is just icing on the cake for mystery fans.
