 I find myself writing the same things over and over about the books in this series, but Grafton is so consistently top-notch that it's hard to think of new superlatives. Kinsey is a great character--complex, tough,  practical, nosy--and Grafton stays true to that character in all her  books. Kinsey's not just solving a mystery in this one, she's also trying  to outwit the hit man on her tail. To this end, she teams up with another  P.I. to act as her bodyguard. This innovative twist adds just the right  amount of suspense to this book, and the ending--to both the mystery and  the hit man scenario--is definitely a kicker. Whether this is your first  Kinsey Millhone book or you're a fan of the entire series (there's a nice  emotional payoff for Kinsey fans in this one, as Kinsey finally meets a man  worthy of her), this one is a must-read. Enjoy!
