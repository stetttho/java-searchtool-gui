 Stephanie Barron has created a delightful mystery series that captures the essence of Austen for a modern-day audience. Readers who know Jane Austen through only her novels (and not her letters, for example) may not always  recognize Barron's sophisticated integration of fact with fiction, but  anyone familiar with Austen's biography will surely enjoy the imagination  and cleverness of this series. Mystery lovers and all but the most  curmudgeonly of Austen fans will enjoy this well-written tale as  well. The first in the series, this book introduces Jane-as-sleuth along  with the cast of supporting characters. Barron is true to Austen's  character and life (as much as we know of it, anyway) and has written a  solid mystery also. Thoroughly enjoyable.
