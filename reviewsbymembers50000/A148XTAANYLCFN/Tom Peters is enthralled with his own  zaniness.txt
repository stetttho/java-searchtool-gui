 Here's Tom Peters' advice: hire "zany" people who don't know how to dress professionally (because they have a lot of energy); throw out every idea, concept, and system that has ever WORKED for your firm (because  you don't want to grow stale); and forget any and all conventional measures  of success (because they're wrong, and Tom Peters is right). We are not in  business to make money or even to provide a great product/service --we're  in business to be different at all costs (proof: Peters pooh-pooh's  McDonald's as "McOrdinary's").  Although some of his ideas might  prove useful to some readers, I found myself increasingly annoyed with  Peters' own infatuation with himself ("aren't I crazy? aren't I just  rocking your world?"). His tone conveys the sense that he'll say  anything to be shocking--hardly a good motivation for writing a business  book.
