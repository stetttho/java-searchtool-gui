 There are are hundreds (maybe thousands?) of historical mystery novels out there featuring women who are out of step with their time period (i.e., heroines who appeal to our modern feminist sensibilities). Hannah Trevor is  one of the only protagonists I've ever read who is actually ostracized for  this incongruity. Subsequently, she is also one of the most believable  historical characters I've ever met.  This is a dark tale of  post-revolutionary United States. Bad things happen to good people in this  series, and although it's sometimes hard to read, it's also utterly  realistic. Life is very, very hard for the inhabitants of this world, and  for Hannah especially. The plot is solid and interesting but necessarily  takes a backseat to the time and setting. The main characters are  relentlessly intense--I wish Hannah had been able to throw her head back  and laugh once or twice, but this is not that kind of story. This is a  hard book to put down, and you will come away from it feeling as though you  have traveled to another world. But you might want to take a break with  some light-hearted reading before embarking on the sequel.
