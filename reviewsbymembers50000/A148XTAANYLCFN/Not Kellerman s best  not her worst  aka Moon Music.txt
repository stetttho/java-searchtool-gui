 Half of this book is a great mystery. The other half is one of those never-ending police standoffs shown on television, with a million cop cars surrounding a building from which shots are ocassionally fired. I don't  find myself watching that sort of thing on TV, and it is even less  compelling in writing. Decker's co-workers are more the focus here than  his wife, Rina, despite her name on the cover of the book. Still, this is  Decker true to form, and fans of this series will enjoy visiting with this  favorite character.
