 I have several different Indian cookbooks, and this is the only one I have found practical enough for everyday use. The first time I made an Indian dinner, I visited an Indian grocery store to get the 4 or 5 ingredients (spices) that weren't readily available at my usual grocery store, but these "unusual" ingredients are called for in almost every recipe, so I can use them over and over again--they are called for in almost all the recipes. And unlike my other Indian cookbooks, I don't need to buy a bunch of different spices for each recipe; the basic menu of spices is used over and over again.    I have found every recipe to be delicious and easy to cook. Indian food used to be a treat we had only at restaurants, but now it is something we eat regularly at home.
