 Donna Andrews' debut mystery is a lot of fun, a great bathtub book. Meg Langslow finds herself maid of honor to three demanding brides, and Meg  takes the summer off from work to oversee the wedding plans in her small  Virigina hometown. When murder taints the wedding plans, Meg adds an extra  item to her too-long "to do" list--find the murderer. Meg's  family (indeed, the whole town) is a wonderful mix of obliviously eccentric  folks: an uncle who wears a gorilla suit to formal parties, a cousin who  thinks wearing clothes is a sin, a group of die-hard croquet players  determined to "play through." In the hands of a less able writer,  this group of oddballs could seem contrived, but Andrews has a light touch,  and the group remains amusing and even realistic. The author's decision to  keep Meg the straight man is a wise one. The weddings provide a useful  backdrop and ample opportunity to drop dozens of "red herrings."  Unfortunately, a little too much time is spent on the weddings, and not  enough on the mystery. Many side stories, although resolved in the end,  have nothing to do with the main mystery. This is a bit of a cheat in the  mystery world. And finally, Meg's friend Michael, and the  "thing" he tries to tell her all summer, is extremely obvious and  very distracting. Another reviewer has described this as farcical, but I  found it very cumbersome. Nonetheless, I look forward to Andrews' next  entry in what promises to be a delightful series.
