 I have read every one of Perry's mysteries, and was extremely disappointed in the previous two. Half-Moon Street is OK, but it lacks the punch of Perry's best work, and a plot twist at the end doesn't actually make too  much sense. The bottom line: I just wasn't too interested in this  mystery, and since Perry's stories ALWAYS have a modern-day moral, it's  pretty easy to see the resolution coming.
