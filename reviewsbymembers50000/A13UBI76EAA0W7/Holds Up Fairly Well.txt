 Having been a U2 fan since 1983, I eagerly awaited this CD, and it's supposed "return to the old U2" format. This CD is an enjoyable one, although seemingly a bit uninspired. I believe U2 has already put out their defining albums, but compared to the garbage coming from Limp Bizkit, Britney, etc. - ATYCLB is a good thing. Favorite songs are "Stuck In A Moment," "Grace" and "Peace On Earth." A decent effort from an amazing band, my favorite for many years. It's earned it's place in my CD player for quite some time to come!
