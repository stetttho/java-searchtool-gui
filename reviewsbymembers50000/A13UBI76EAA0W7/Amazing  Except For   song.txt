 This is a good compilation of Sting's music,except for one of the new ones - "The Cowboy Song." I'm not impressed with that at all. But otherwise, I highly recommend this CD, especially for those who are big fans of the "Nothing Like The Sun," "Ten Summoner's Tales" and "Dream Of The Blue Turtles" CD's. All three of those records are great as well ... I enjoy this CD b/c it's a combination of all my favorite songs from this particular time period.
