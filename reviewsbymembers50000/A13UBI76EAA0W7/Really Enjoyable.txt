 I very much enjoyed this film. Bruce Willis' comedic timing is great, he made me laugh. The kid was cute, although the acting on his part could have been better. This is one of those movies that leaves you with the "feel-good" sensation afterwards. I also enjoyed the theme of re-visiting your childhood and not letting it go. I did not recognize Matthew Perry and wouldn't have even known it was him if I hadn't read the other reviews here. I recommend this for adults and children alike!
