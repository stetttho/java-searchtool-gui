 I'm not sure why I rented this movie, but I did. It was completely predictable and rather '80s in style, but I wouldn't say I hated it. The story was interesting enough, but it never really delved into it. Mostly I felt that it was just an opportunity to put scantily-clad women on screen to make money. Which is sad, because the movie could have been (and should have been) so much more than that.
