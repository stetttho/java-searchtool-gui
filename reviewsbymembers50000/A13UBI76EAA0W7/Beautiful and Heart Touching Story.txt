 A friend from Ireland recommended this movie to me, as it had touched him deeply. I saw the DVD of it about 3 weeks ago, and it has been on my mind ever since. The acting job by Jamie Bell is superb - I cannot imagine why he didn't win any major awards for his portrayal of Billy Elliot. The accents are hard to understand, but it is worth putting the effort into it. This story should touch your heart in a very special way - I know it did mine.
