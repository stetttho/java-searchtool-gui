 Just spent the better part of a 5 hour road trip listening to this new cd set. The studio set has a couple of new songs that are wonderful, but other than that, I found it kind of dull. The new "versions" of the older hits were not as good as the originals, although still enjoyable enough to listen to. The live CD is off the hook!! I've seen this band play live numerous times and am a big fan. The CD captures the intensity of their concerts, as well as the talent of the group. I really enjoy the version of "Worlds Apart". I recommend this cd set, although it probably could have fit onto one cd ... but if you are a Jars fan, you will want to add this to your collection.
