 I have been enjoying this book since my youth (am now in my 30's) and always recommend it as a "must-read" for both children and adults. I purchased this particular version a gift for a friend and was very impressed with the quality of the book. The color illustrations added a lot, and as always, the story has a timeless impact on all who read it. C.S. Lewis is a hero in the world of literature.
