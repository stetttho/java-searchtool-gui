 I have read all of the Left Behind series. The first few, I soaked up and couldn't get enough of. However, as time goes on, each book is becoming progressively weaker - with story and action. The last two books especially have barely been able to keep my attention. And I'm certainly not "waiting with baited breath" for the next one to arrive. The writing is not that great, and the story lines are to the point where I don't care all that much anymore what happens to the characters. This series was a wonderful idea, with noble aspirations. But I think the time has come for the authors to finish the job, and finish it well.
