 I heard Darrell Scott speak at a youth conference a month ago. It was a life-changing experience for me, and so I read this book to go along with that. I was so impressed by the extra-ordinary mind and heart of this young woman. Having just lost a friend to a senseless tragedy as well, I was comforted by what was written in this book. By the honesty of her family, and also by her honesty. My prayer is that many will be blessed by the legacy of writings & drawings that Rachel left behind ... that it will cause us to sit up and take notice.
