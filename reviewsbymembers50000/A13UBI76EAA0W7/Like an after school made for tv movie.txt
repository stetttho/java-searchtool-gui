 The movie was "okay." I did feel like I was watching a TV movie, in terms of quality though. And I think the story would be confusing to someone who hadn't read the book first. But all in all, it was a "pleasant-enough" way to spend a Saturday night (watching the video). The acting was decent, except I would have chosen someone completely different to play Nicolae, I did not feel his character was believable. But I did feel that Raymond Steele, Buck Williams and Hattie Durham were all well-cast and well-acted out. This is not a movie I would watch over and over, but like I said, it was an enjoyable enough experience.
