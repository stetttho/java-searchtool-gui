 I didn't want to get this CD as it seemed to be a "repeat" from their last one. But I am SO glad that I did. It captures a spirit of worship on CD, and is so uplifting and fresh and the music is rocking. I find myself in my car or at the gym listening to it and just praising God, having my own worship time wherever I am. I have seen Sonicflood twice and both times God touched my heart in powerful ways through their music. It carries over onto the CD!! Favorite song is their "re-make" of "Lord I Lift Your Name On High." Buy it, even if you have the original CD. You won't regret it.
