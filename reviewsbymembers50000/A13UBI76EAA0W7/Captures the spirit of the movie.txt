 I saw "Moulin Rouge" for the first time this past weekend, and it rocked my world. Astounding film, and I was blown away by the singing of Nicole Kidman and especially Ewan MacGregor. #6 on the CD - Ewan's version of "Your Song" will send shivers down your spine, it is that powerful and moving. The "Lady Marmalade" song, I feel, is the weakest point on the CD. Just an excuse to get pop female stars together - to me, it detracts from the rest of the CD, and isn't even featured in the film. Other tracks I really enjoyed: Beck's version of "Diamond Dogs", and "Children of the Revolution" by Bono. The songs sung by Ewan and Nicole are very well done and bring you right back to the movie, and the emotions experienced while viewing it. One of the most powerful scenes in the movie is the tango/Roxanne scene - and although the song is not an enjoyable listen, so to speak, it still remains powerful on the CD. I highly recommend this soundtrack, although don't purchase it before seeing the movie. Wait until after ...
