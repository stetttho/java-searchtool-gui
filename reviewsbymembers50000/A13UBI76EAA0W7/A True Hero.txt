 I have been a MWS fan for many years now. His books, his music, his person. We are blessed to have this man of God around as a role model and a hero for our youth. I love this CD ... his heart comes across in a very  real way, and his love for Jesus also. The combination of both is  heart-warming, touching and inspiring. I recommend any of his recordings  and also his books are great too.
