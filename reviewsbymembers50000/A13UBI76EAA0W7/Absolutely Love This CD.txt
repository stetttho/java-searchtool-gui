 Having no idea who Bebo Norman was, my friend dragged me on a 3 hour ride to one of his shows. I was immediately impressed. Honest lyrics, great acoustic music and he's just an all-around adorable guy. I purchased this CD about a year ago and it's been on steady rotation in my CD player ever since. Favorite songs are "The Healing Song," "The Hammer Holds," and "Deeper Still."
