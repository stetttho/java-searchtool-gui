 I read this book 3 years ago, and it has remained in my mind ever since. The writing style is so beautiful that it draws you right in to the story and the characters. You feel as though you are right there with them, experiencing their story. I have recommended this book time and again, and will continue to do so. Read it - you won't be disappointed.
