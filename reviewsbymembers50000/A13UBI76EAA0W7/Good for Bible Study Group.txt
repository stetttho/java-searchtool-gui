 I have enjoyed this book, although I agree with what other reviewers have said - that she takes too many "liberties" with the stories. However, I am in a women's study that is using this book and it has facilitated great discussions. And we have learned many a lesson from the "bad girls." I would recommend this book for any group that wants to use it as a study guide.
