 I absolutely fell in love with "Ten Thousand Days" and it has been in constant rotation in my CD player for over a year now. So I was quite excited to get "Big Blue Sky." I have given it about 10 listens now and I have to say I'm generally disappointed. Whereas Bebo stood out before because of his acoustic sound and brilliant, heart-felt lyrics -- this CD falls way short. It sounds too much like the mass-produced generic Christian music I don't enjoy. There are a few songs where he shines through and it seems to be the same man. But I would like to see whoever is producing Bebo let him be original and do great things in a genre of music that seems to be hurting right now.
