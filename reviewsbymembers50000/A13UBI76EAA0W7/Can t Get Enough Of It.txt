 I've enjoyed Moby's music for awhile now but just got around to buying the CD last weekend. It has been on non-stop ever since. I enjoy the slammin' songs like "Bodyrock," and I am also deeply moved by songs such as "Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad?" The essays written by Moby in the liner notes show a keen mind, and an intellectual one. It is obvious he applies this to his music as well. In the wake of mindless fluff coming from most of the music world, Moby is a breath of fresh air.
