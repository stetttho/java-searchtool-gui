 This was an extremely powerful story, and is well-written and engaging. I was completely enthralled from the beginning to the end. As a Christian, I found the elaborations on the story to be thought-provoking. And as a woman, I found it so interesting to read of the culture of that time and of the bonds between these amazing women. The only fault I had with the book were the liberties that were taken with the story of "Joseph," and how he was portrayed in what I believe to be a bad light ... after re-reading that story in the Bible, I didn't agree with the liberties the author took there. Other than that though, I enjoyed this book and have highly recommended it to many others allready.
