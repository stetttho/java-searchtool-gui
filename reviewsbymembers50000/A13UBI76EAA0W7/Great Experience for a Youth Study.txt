 I used this book with a discipleship group I was leading. It was a great tool, and really caused everyone in the group to evaluate their Christian walk. The only drawback was that we were doing this during the school year and it was very in-depth and required a good 45 minutes per day. We ended out splitting each day into 2 days of study and that worked much better. I highly recommend this book for any youth that wants to get serious with their faith.
