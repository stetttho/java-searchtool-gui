 I am a huge fan of Josh McDowell and purchased 20 copies of this book for teens in our youth group. Many have come back to me to tell me over & over again how much they enjoyed this book. That it was the first devotional book they followed through on, and really got something out of. I only took one star off b/c sometimes the book had a tendency to be on the "cheesy" side, with the stories. But other than that, this is a GREAT devotional for junior/senior high youth.
