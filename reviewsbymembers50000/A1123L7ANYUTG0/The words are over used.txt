 but this is an unsettling and harrowing film. If you've seen **Boyz N the Hood** and felt relieved at the end by the uplifting aspect of the protagonist making it out of a dead end life, you're unlikely to have much patience for this comparatively darker and angrier picture, in which the characters seem to know that they're doomed from the start. But if this puts you off, you're missing out. As you probably know, this was brothers Allen and Albert Hughes's first feature. They direct with great self-assurance, in a style that is mostly invisible, matching the naturalistic, low-key acting of the principals-- Tyrin Turner as Cain, Larenz Tate as the sociopathic O-Dog,and Jada Pinkett[Smith] as Ronnie, Cain's lady friend, who just wants to escape and make a better life for her child.
