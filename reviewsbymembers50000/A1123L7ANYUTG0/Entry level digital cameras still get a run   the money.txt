 If this review is still here 2 or 3 years from now you may laugh at it, as digital still-photo cameras are getting better all the time. Nevertheless, the Canon Snappy LX II is an unbelievable value for the money, and, as of this writing(Mar. 2002), there's NOTHING in this price range by way of "value" digital cameras(less than 60 bucks) that can touch a true 35 mm point-n-shoot camera for picture quality. With auto-loading and auto-rewinding, the Snappy LX II is practically idiot-proof, ideal for the person inclined to throw away the instruction booklet and then figure it out(but keep it to operate the timer). That it also  has an auto-date feature is particularly impressive in this price range.
