 The Olivia Tremor Control is the most amazing pop group you've probably never heard of, which is more a reflection of how bad radio's gotten in the past few years than a reflection on their supposed inaccesibility. I wish I knew how to describe the sound- a psychedelic mix of the beatles and the byrds and even the waterboys(especially in "Love Athena"), yet without being in the least  derivative. They seem to have broken up, at least unofficially, and the band members are now recording separately as "circulatory system" and "the sunshine fix"... if you can find cd's of either of their albums, grab them!
