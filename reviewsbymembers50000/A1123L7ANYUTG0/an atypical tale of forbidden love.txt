 Run the Wild Fields is about a woman[Whalley] whose husband is gone, fighting in WWII, and has been missing in action for some time. She's bringing up her daughter by herself on the family farm, when a mysterious stranger shows up and enters their lives. This is a familiar premise, the drama set before us being: 1.what will we learn about the stranger, and 2. how will the stranger affect his hosts? And of course, in a typical Hollywood film, you expect lust-driven sparks to fly.    Yes, things do happen, but not what you might expect. Maybe this particular story is a useful corrective, in its own way, to Adrian Lyne-style melodramatic excesseses, of which you certainly can't accuse the makers of this picture. Still the kid [Alex Vega] is pretty good, in what could've been a treacly, insuffrably sweet role. The adults are ok too.  a slight revision 9/2005: I first reviewed this in 2004. I saw RTWF a 2nd time recently, and  it grows on you-- still no melodrama, but  Joanne Whalley and Sean Patrick Flanery are better as the romantic leads than I first allowed for. Both performances have a sort of antidramatic calm about them-- as if the characters simply "are," and you have to go to them, watching perhaps a bit more intently for shadings and nuance than you might be accustomed to, participating in the unfolding of the narrative, as it were.   I guess, over the years, I've grown accustomed to allowing for that sort of minimalism in Asian and European pictures, but not American ones.
