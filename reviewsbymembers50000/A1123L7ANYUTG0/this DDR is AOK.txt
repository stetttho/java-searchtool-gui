 A RAM review?  Ode to a memory module on a Thursday afternoon? What kind of  useful verbiage can I offer about a RAM stick?   Obviously, not much, and I shouldn't try-- suffice to say I was happy with this Kingston product, as I have been with previous Kingston purchases.   Amazon frowns on discussing cost in a review,which is quite understandable as prices flucuate, and especially so with RAM modules. I'll just say it was a substantial savings for me to order this stick here rather than through the only 2 retailers in town that had it.
