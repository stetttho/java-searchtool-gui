 ...excessive or ornate, unneccesarily complex.(from the Latin tugere- to be swollen.) Mandlebaum's translation is heavy and dull, like an Al Gore speech     from his pre-neo-populist days. The glossary is succinct and helpful, but there are so many references and classical allusions that putting the glossary in the back serves to frustrate the reader. An edition with facing-page glossary notes, like the old Folger Library Shakespeares, would be an immense help to the general reader.  (The translator seems to emphasize capturing the original meter over rendering a breezy narrative. To be fair to Mandlebaum, Virgil ISN'T a light and lively poet, and unlike Homer he didn't write for a popular audience, at least not on purpose.)  All in all, a serviceable but uninspiring translation, at least to boob like me.
