 This album is unlike anything else I have ever listened to. The truly amazing vocals of Amy Lee add to the almost chilling background music to create a band that is one of if not the best band in the world. The CD has tracks that are good to just kinda let go with as well as lighter songs that really show Amy Lee's voice...
