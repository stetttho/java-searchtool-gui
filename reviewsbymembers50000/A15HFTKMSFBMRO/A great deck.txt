 This deck is simply awesome. The art of the cards is also extremely awesome. The book that accompanies it is also very helpful. The pictures of the cards are next to the text that describes their art and meaning. This is my first deck and I am glad that a chose it for my first deck. In the back of the book there are candle spells and meditations. If you are a dragon lover then this deck is a must but even if you are not I highly recommend it. I hope this review was helpful.
