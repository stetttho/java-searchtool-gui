 This is one of the few fragrances out there that every guy needs to at least check out. (Others in that category are Aqcua di Gio and Dolce Gabbana pour homme.) while not the rarest scent, it isnt overly common like Acqua di Gio. It is a somewhat strong fragrance that may make some people not like it. A single or possibly 2 sprays will do it, any more than that and you may overwhelm not only yourself but whatever girl you are trying to impress. Wear it moderately and impress it will. Lasts all day and is easy detected by anyone withing a few feet of you. Maybe not for the older crowd. I am 16 and I use this whenever I need to dress up a bit or when I am going on a date with my girlfriend. The Dreamer is a sophisticated, refreshing, "warm" scent that should be checked out by all guys under 30. Also, the new Black Code from Armani is just about a copy of this, only Black Code starts off with a light scent this fades into the lighter base of this, so if this is too storng try that, but try this first.  And, if by some strange twist of fate (such as you are struck with a disease that makes you lose your ability to smell) you dont like it, it is not hard to sell on ebay.
