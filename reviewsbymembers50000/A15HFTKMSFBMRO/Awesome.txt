 The Rasmus are one of those rare bands that you only have to hear once and then your hooked.  I bought the CD the day it came out after hearing IN THE SHADOWS only one time.  The sound of this album are kind of like a cross between Evanescence and a pop/rock band like Yellow Card because even though they offer the dark sounds of Evanescece they also have catchy fast paced lyrics that are very catchy. They are no doubt going to get HUGE over here.  Every song on the album DEAD LETTERS is a "letter" written to someone and each song has its own feel to it that end up making for a great album. The only thing I can say is give them a listen and check out there website to catch their video for IN THE SHADOWS and see for yourself that this album is worth buying.
