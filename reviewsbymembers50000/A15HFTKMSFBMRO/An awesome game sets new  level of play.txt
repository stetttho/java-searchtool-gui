 First of all this game DOES have multi-player. The multi player in this game is awesome there are up to 4 AI-bots you can add to face or play against you and you also control how strong they are such as health and accuracy. There are two teams in multi player, the good guys MI6 and the bad Phoenix. With that two teams can play in modes such as capture the flag, team arena, king of the hill, and protect modes where a team has to keep the other away from a satellite which is in there base so that the other team doesn't blow it up. Also add in mini helicopters and tanks which you can control and a weapon called Ronin which opens up into an auto machine gun. Also the levels you can play in are HUGE. So this is an awesome multi player game if that is what you want.    Now not to forget the 1 player mode which has a great story line. The levels include breaking into a castle to spy on a meeting, escaping on an armored snowmobile, driving the Vanquish, a submarine level where the vanquish turns into a sub, and a space level where you have to disarm huge missiles before they launch. Lots a cool gadgets can also be used.  Ok well this game has graphics that are almost unreal because they are so good. Tons of weapons such as explosives machine guns pistols bows, mines and sniper rifles and a laser gun. And also gadgets such as a watch laser which recharges itself a stunner, and other gadgets.   So to sum it up this is a truly awesome game and I highly recommend it. I hope this review was helpful.
