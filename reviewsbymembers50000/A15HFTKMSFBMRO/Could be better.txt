 The game isn't as good as it could have been. The things I don't like are that the game doesn't really change the enemies change but you still fight them all the same way. Even though there are 4 different kind of weapons which are spear, sword, two handed sword, and gauntlet they differ in only speed and strength the combos are a little different but not enough to make a big difference. Also there is no free roaming you stay in the game where it wants you to. Like I said the enemies change but for the most part the human enemies stat just the same other than they get more health and a new looking weapon they are still just the same. The game does however have some good points. The graphics are great. It takes place in Egypt before the scorpion king movie which is cool. The game had a good idea but it just gets kind of boring as you play or at least it did to me. The only thing in the game that is thrown in to keep you interested is Egyptian monsters like a Gorgon, Horous, and Anubis and some of his warriors. If you plan on buying this game rent it first to see what you think because even though I don't like it, some people might like how nothing changes.  This is for those who either like not having to get used to new things or really really like the scorpion king. (If you are getting this because you like the Mummy then I recommended that you get the Mummy Returns instead even to those who don't have the reason the Mummy Returns has a better set up than this one) I hope this review was helpful for those who weren't sure about this game.
