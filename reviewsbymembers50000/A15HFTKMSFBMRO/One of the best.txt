 I read this book awhile ago and I have now read all of the Charmed books. This in my opinion is one of the best. In this book a coven of warlocks is trying to kill and take the charmed ones powers. They turn the charmed ones powers against them. So instead of freezing things Piper speeds things up. Also all the spells they say do just the opposite. A woman working at a local Wicca store befriends one of the charmed ones. She does however turn out to be someone who is trying to kill them. But this person turns nice and try's to help them. The coven is called the coven of the New Sun. They get power from a crystal that absorbs witches powers. There are others that turn on the charmed ones...........but I think I have said too much already I don't want to ruin the story. Enjoy ^_^
