 I really did try to enjoy this game but I just couldn't. While the graphics are ok at best that is the only thing I like about this game. While it has many different weapons they weaken and break when you use them and are forced to fight without them. The game play hardly ever changes. Each element has the same type of enemies only with a different element. The game is also too short. Save your money for another game that is worth buying. If you are looking for a good action game this is NOT it. A game that I would highly recommend would be Dynasty Warriors 3.  If you are still interested in this game I recommended you rent it to be sure because I bought it and I am sorry I did.   .
