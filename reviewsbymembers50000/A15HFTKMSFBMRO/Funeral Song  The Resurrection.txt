 This single features a new version of "Funeral Song". The new single version has harder drums than the original album version. The result is that an already great ballad is infused with even more energy. To any The Rasmus fan who likes the original "Funeral Song" this is a must buy. If you are new to The Rasmus, this single is worth checking out. But, if you are new to the band, I recommend buying their album "Dead Letters" first or in addition to this single (they make a great pair).    The single also features 2 other tracks "If You Ever" and "Everything You Say". Both of these tracks were previously unreleased.    In all, this CD single is very much worth the money it takes to import it (the CD is not released here in the US). All of the tracks will have you quickly addicted and playing them over and over.
