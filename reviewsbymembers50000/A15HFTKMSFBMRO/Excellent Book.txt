 This, in my opinion, is the best book yet in the Charmed series. In it, Pheobe gets warped back in time by a time demon. She ends up in Salem, Mass. where they kill witches. She meets her ancestor, the second one to have the families book of shadows. Prue and Piper don't know what happened to Pheobe and fall apart. The're also starting to act strange stealing warlocks powers.It's almost like they're turning evil. Also, Dark spells begin to apear in the Book of Shadows that Prue and Piper have. Now Pheobe has to stop a time demon, get home, and now she has to stop her ancestors from becoming evil. All of this is due to the time demon and what he did to the ancestor Phoebe is with. Will they be able to beat this time demon without the power of three???.............................. Yes, they will but read the book to find out how.
