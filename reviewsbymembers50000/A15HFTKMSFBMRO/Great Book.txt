 Rob is just starting seventh grade. He is doing whatever he can to try to be "normal" but with a family like his thats not going to happen. He has a 5 year old sister who is a genius. Not only that but any time Winnie reads a book she acts like the main character. His mom is obsessed with Winnie-the-Pooh she even named her daughter and the family pets after characters from that show. His mom also has a home based childrens book buisness,and a pink van with there logo on it that she takes him to school with. His dad used to be surfer. This turns out to be really embarrassing later on. And if this isn't bad enough there is a kid called The Shark who is making his life miserable. And he also likes an 8th grader which he has been told not to do. So, with all of this he does everything but being normal. Good Book read it to find out what happens. I recommend this book to any one who would like a nice funny book. ENJOY!!!
