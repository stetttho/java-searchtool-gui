 This Review is like no other and in a good way. The songs are almost all fast paced and they are better than I had expected them to be. I have other cds like Avril Lavigne and Good Charlotte so that is what I am comparing this to. However I would say this is a must have for anyone.  The cd has 11 tracks. Which are 1. Disconnected 2. Come Dig me out 3. Contradiction 4. COOLHEAD 5. Right Here 6. SHUT UP (very catchy) 7. On the Run 8 On your Own 9. TOO MUCHOF YOU 10 Everything's Alright 11. More than Life Itself (the only slow song on the cd)
