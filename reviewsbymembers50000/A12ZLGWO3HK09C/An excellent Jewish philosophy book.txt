 Jonathan Sacks, the Chief Rabbi of England, writes fluidly and lyrically.  While this is a general, basic Jewish philosophy text, it is appropriate not only for beginners but also for those with a more advanced knowledge of Judaism.  Rabbi Sacks explores a variety of ideas within Judaism including:       the egalitarian nature of each Jewish person's relationship with G-d,       the Hebrew Bible as the first way to understand the world and how it works without resort to myth,       the covenantal relationship between the Jewish people and G-d and the covenantal relationships within Jewish families,            Judaism as a rejection of both tribalism and universalism,       the synagogue as a revolutionary institution, etc.      The only piece of the book that troubled me was Rabbi Sacks' treatment of the destruction of the Second Temple.  While he regards it as political disaster in which the Jewish people lost their national independence, he also feels that it brought about "the flowering of its religious vision." Sacks further states,         "[n]ow that the Temple lay in ruins, every Jew became a            holy person, offering prayer instead of sacrifice, and        achieving atonement through repentance.  At long last the        ideal of Sinai had become a reality.  Israel really was        a 'kingdom of priests.'"   This fits in nicely with other ideas earlier expressed, affirming the dignity of every individual, particularly in their relationship with G-d.  However, Sacks does not deal with the desire to rebuild the Temple (together with its attendant priests and sacrifices) as an important strain within Jewish thought and liturgy.      Overall, this was a pleasure to read and I recommend it highly.
