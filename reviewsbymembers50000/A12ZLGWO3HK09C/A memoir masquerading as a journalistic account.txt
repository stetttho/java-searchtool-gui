 The subtitle of the book, "A Clash of Cultures in Heartland America" as well as the book jacket description suggest that author Stephen Bloom wrote a sociological portrait of the clash between the Hasidim, who recently settled in Postville to operate a kosher slaughterhouse, and the Postville locals, many who had lived in Iowa for generations.  However, what Bloom actually wrote is a memoir of his time in Iowa, particularly his travels to Postville.  As in many memoirs, this account displays the gamut of Bloom's biases, insecurities and conclusions made without conducting sufficient research. A large focus of the book is Bloom's constant wondering aloud which side is correct and who he would ultimately side with.  In these moments, Bloom sounds more like a high school student picking which clique to join than a journalist who is striving to create a relatively unbiased sociological portrait.  In his chapter on two Hasidic young men who had committed an armed robbery, Bloom posits that a factor in the commission of the crime was that the Hasidic community held the gentile community in such low regard.  He ignores the shady past of both men.  The gunman had been involved in alcohol and drug abuse, robbery, and assault and battery for many years, most of those in New York.  In addition, he offers no sociological or criminological evidence to back up his theory, and uses these crimes (which apparently were isolated incidents, otherwise Bloom surely would have informed us of any other crimes committed by Postville Hasidim) to tar the entire Hasidic community. On this basis, I would have rated the book one star, but because it was generally interesting to read, I gave it two stars.
