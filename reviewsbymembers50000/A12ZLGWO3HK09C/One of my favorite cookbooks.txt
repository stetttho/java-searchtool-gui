 This is an excellent cookbook and my husband and I (and our guests) have throughly enjoyed everything that I have made from it.  The macaroni and cheese recipe is so delicious (and different than any other version that I have seen) that its hard to go back to eating the regular (i.e. full of grease) version.   A couple of points, however: the stated prep time is often on the short side; many of the recipes are time-consuming (albeit worth the time and effort); many of the recipes call for fresh, cooked and chopped spinach when frozen would work just as well; sometimes too much salt is listed for certain dishes (e.g. the macaroni and cheese calls for a half teaspoon of salt, when none is needed--there is enough "saltiness" from the cottage, cheddar and parmesan cheeses). But overall, this is a fantastic cookbook, with informative and enjoyable notes, introduction and glossaries.
