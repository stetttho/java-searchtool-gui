 This is the first cookbook I used after I got married. It is concise and not overwhelming. It helped me to plan complete Sabbath meal menus (it even has recipes for Melaveh Malkeh--the traditional after-Sabbath meal).  The recipes are easy, classic and foolproof.  For traditional Jewish cuisine, many of the recipes offered are relatively healthy, with a variety of vegetarian side dishes and a section on all whole wheat flour desserts.  In addition, on the margins of each page are inspiring vignettes to read as you cook.  I highly recommend trying Shabbat in a Pot and Pot-Roasted Chicken with Olives (pages 38-39).
