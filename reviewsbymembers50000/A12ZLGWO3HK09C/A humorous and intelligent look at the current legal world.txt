 David Margolick wrote "At the Bar," a weekly column for the New York Times from the late 1980s through the mid 1990s.  Each column explored a new and interesting facet of the current legal world.  This book is a compilation of the best of those columns (representing about a third of all the columns written) with addenda updating the columns where appropriate.  Margolick deals with a wide variety of topics including:  lawyers' use of language, dramatic changes in the culture of corporate law practice over the past fifteen years, legal ethics, women in the law, law schools, etc.  Most importantly, the columns as a whole offer a light and humorous way to learn about the different aspects of the law.
