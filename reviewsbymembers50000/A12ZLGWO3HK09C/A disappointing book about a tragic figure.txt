 After reading Robert Caro's masterful biographies (Volumes 1 and 2) of LBJ, I yearned to learn more about the background of Lady Bird--specifically what contributed to her not only staying married to LBJ but to singlemindedly propelling his career forward.  Well, Russell's book certainly disappoints.  It is very poorly and awkwardly written and edited.  The only new information that I gleaned from this book was gossipy.  If one  wishes to learn substantive information about Lady Bird (and of course about LBJ), Caro's biographies are a far superior source.
