 The recipes in this book are very good and sophisticated (particularly for a Jewish cookbook).  I am already looking forward to making over half of them.   Unfortunately, Ms. Levy makes some errors in her descriptions of kosher standards.  Two prominent errors include:  1) Ms. Levy states that the symbol "K" on a food product indicates that it is kosher.  The kosher consumer does not rely on a "K" symbol because it does not represent any particular reputable kosher certifying agency.  2) Ms. Levy states that the "P" symbol on a food product indicates that the product is parve (suitable for use with milk or meat).  This is incorrect.  The "P" symbol next to reputable kosher certification indicates that the product is kosher for Passover (as well as year round).   A food product that is certified as parve must have "parve" written out on the label.  These errors are particularly unfortunate because Jewish consumers often rely on kosher cookbooks as a guide to keeping kosher.
