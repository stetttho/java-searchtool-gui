 This book compellingly presents the case that Baruch Litvin brought all the way up to the Michigan Supreme Court against the congregation of his synagogue in Mt. Clemens, Michigan.  The synagogue members voted to remove the mechitzah (the physical separation between the men and womens' sections of the synagogue sanctuary).  Under Jewish law, it is forbidden to pray in a synagogue without a mechitzah.  Litvin thus contended that in removing the mechitzah, he would be deprived of the beneficial use of the synagogue (in addition, there were no other Orthodox synagogues in Mt. Clemens at that time).  Litvin prevailed in court and this volume richly documents the court case and its aftermath as well as the historic, rabbinic and halachic background behind the mechitzah.  One caveat--this is a reference book, with sometimes repetitive sources--not necessarily a book to sit down and read straight through.
