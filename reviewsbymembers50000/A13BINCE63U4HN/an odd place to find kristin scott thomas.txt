 Romanian director Lucian Pintilie has been making great films since the 1960s but due to the obscurity of his nation in the eyes of the West he has unfortunately remained pretty much unknown outside his own country. This changed somewhat with the acclaim of his amazing dark satire from 1992 "The Oak," a French-Romanian co-production, and his "An Unforgettable Summer" - once again a Romanian production largely bankrolled by foreign money and starring popular English actress Kristin Scott Thomas. "An Unforgettable Summer" is, like the Oak, an ironic look at political terror. Purposely less outlandish and surreal than "The Oak," the film is nevertheless quite an accomplishment and proves its director to be one of the great living filmmakers, still a largely unheralded great and an important chronicler of his nation's troubled history. The VHS tape of this film is unfortunately (along with "The Oak") still terribly overpriced.
