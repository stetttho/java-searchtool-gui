 Though I haven't heard "The Coroner's Gambit" I can with reasonable certainty say that it's unlikely that the Mountain Goats will ever surpass "Nothing For Juice," which is one of the most truly beautiful records I have ever heard. I think the album's completely free of slackers and in it's finer moments (which are many) it achieves an almost transcendental grace. The Goats' haunted cover of Robert Johnson's haunted "Hellhound on My Trail" is a sublimely mournful homage from one guy with a guitar to another, "Full Flower" is an oddly jubilant song where the electric guitar drowns out Darnielle's voice at times, "Waving at You" embraces complete destitution by declaring in its opening line, "Listen, you can tell your lawyer that he can go to hell." And it's only fitting that on such an amazing record the closer, "Going to Scotland" is magnificent ("...and i loved you so much it was making me sick"). John Darnielle has a true gift with words but words can't do justice to this one. Dig it up at all costs.
