 Wajda's "The Conductor" could have potentially been a masterful examination of the nature of art and politics, but the film's weaknesses keep greatness at bay. It's about an aging Polish conductor who's made a name for himself abroad returning to his hometown to direct Beethoven's 9th with the local symphony at the request of a woman who claims to be his daughter. The conductor's command of the orchestra causes resentment in it's original (non-famous) leader, the conductor's daughter's husband. In its favor the film has some striking moments and the finale is beautiful and moving. It is also a deeply felt tribute to the healing power of music. The acting is great though John Gielgud is horrendously dubbed into Polish. The film's drawbacks are its obviousness and occasional pretentions and, well, Gielgud IS horrendously dubbed. Still worth a look.
