 Bordwell's extremely well-researched book on Ozu covers all of the great director's existing works from the earliest silent films on  - unlike Donald Richie's book, which tends to pay scant attention to the silent pictures. Bordwell does challenge the notion of Ozu as a "traditional" director (Richie tends to reinforce it) and instead makes the argument that Ozu was a formal pioneer - as he was. The problem with Bordwell and many other "serious" film critics is that they get so wrapped up in technique that technique becomes the only measuring post - which is why formally innovative but otherwise shallow directors like Orson Welles continue to be considered the best directors in history. Ozu combined cutting-edge technique with beautiful, quiet, often profound insights into Japanese society and human nature but Bordwell, like a scientist dissecting a frog, can tell you about all the parts but not what truly animates the thing. Ozu always called himself a formalist and his attention to formal details was meticulous and precise, but it was the real poetry of his films that caused Wenders to cite Ozu as "a sacred treasure of the cinema" and seperates Ozu's films from emptyheaded formalist garbage like "Last Year at Marienbad" or Welles' endlessly awful "Touch of Evil." Bordwell's dry analysis of technique borders on the obsessive and really [stink] the joy out of each film, even Ozu's extent pure dumb fun silent "B" pics like "Dragnet Girl." Mr. Bordwell's effort and his attention to detail should be cheered; some of the points he makes and the patterns he discovers are truly astonishing and enlightening. But ultimately, though, I would say that neither this book nor Richie's really seem able to nail Ozu down. Perhaps that's merely a testament to Ozu's enduring genius.
