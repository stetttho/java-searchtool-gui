 This VHS is taken from a recently restored print of famed Swedish silent film director Victor Sjostrom's "The Outlaw and His Wife." Widely considered to be a masterpiece when it was released (one critic referred to it as "the most beautiful film in the world") it's still a landmark - but it hasn't aged well. The acting (by Sjostrom and his wife) is very broad and theatrical and the melodrama's all pretty hammy. However, it is a beautifully shot film, utilizing the rugged Swedish mountain locations to great effect. The restoration job is great considering the film's age. Nice to look at if one can get past the film's faults and undeniably a nifty little curiousity. The plot: A man with a past (Sjostrom) arrives on a farm run by a very unattractive woman (played by his real-life wife) who he and everyone else nonetheless seems to think is very attractive. She likes Sjostrom, he likes her, her rival suitor finds out about Sjostrom's criminal past and Sjostrom and his wife become outlaws living high up on the mountains. After several years of peaceful living that produced a daughter they're found. Tragedy ensues.
