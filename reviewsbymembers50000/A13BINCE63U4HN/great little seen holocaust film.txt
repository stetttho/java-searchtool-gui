 "romeo, juliet and darkness," jiri weiss' story of a young man in prague who hides a jewish girl during the war is a moving and ultimately harrowing film that spares us the excesses of steven spielberg's "schindler's list." prior to "schindler" several amazing films about the holocaust were made in eastern europe though unfortunately the tendency today is to see spielberg's film, because it's a big-budget hollywood picture, as the ONLY film ever made on the subject. weiss lacks spielberg's sentimentality and his sermonizing and his film is the stronger of the two for it. although "schindler" was amazing and powerful in many ways it isn't the definitive statement on the subject and, unfortunately and through no outright fault of its own perhaps, it has eclipsed several outstanding films simply because it's not subtitled.
