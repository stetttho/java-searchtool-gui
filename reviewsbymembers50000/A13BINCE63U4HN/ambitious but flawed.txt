 This massive, ambitious book attempts to cover all of the world's most important films and almost succeeds. Covering such ho-hum obvious choices as "Citizen Kane" down to less-known recent great films such as Yang's "A Brighter Summer Day" and Kore-eda's "After Life." A major annoyance is the insistence of using a foreign film's original language title instead of its (generally) more well-known English language title - although the titles (English and otherwise) along with the cast and crew are indexed at the back. The real problem is that the selection is inevitably going to leave out some major films: did Robert Bresson make no significant films after "Pickpocket?" Are "A Taste of Cherry" and "And Life Goes On" better, more interesting Kiarostami films than "Through the Olive Trees" and "Close-up?" Also, when taking into consideration directors that made a number of great films (i.e. John Ford) which films should take priority? But really this book's major fault and the most glaring fault of its sister volume "International Dictionary of Filmmakers" is the shameful disregard of some important lesser-known directors (Mikio Naruse) at the expense of including mediocrities (minor Hollywood films/makers). All in all though this is a fascinating, informative read, flaws and all.
