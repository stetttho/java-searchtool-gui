 I'm pretty sure that this was the first full-length Mountain Goats album to make it onto CD. It's been out of print for awhile which is too bad. Though it's a hit and miss affair and contains less real standouts than later records, it's notable for having what is arguably (says John) the most beloved song among fans, "Going to Georgia," a blissful angry wail of a song that's got more fire in it that you come to expect from the source. When he plays it live the veins bulge in his forehead somethin terrible. The weaker tracks here are weaker than most, though "Georgia," "Alpha Sun Hat," "Young Caesar 2000," "Orange Ball of Hate" and a few others reach classic Goats status.
