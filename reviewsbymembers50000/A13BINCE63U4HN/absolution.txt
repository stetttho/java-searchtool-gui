 One of cinema history's most tragic examples of a filmmaker who never lived up to his promise, Yanagimachi's "Himatsuri" is a burning, haunting experience. Combining obscure imagery and Shinto references along with odd, bold leaps in tone the director crafts a singular and astounding work illuminating the disasterous results of man's severing his ties with nature. Taking a true life inexplicable murder/suicide in a remote Japanese fishing community as its platform, Yanamiguchi creates a fusion of image, sound and montage (coupled with Toru Takemitsu's chillingly primal score) that shows a real mastery of film form. But "Himatsuri" is not just form without content: beneath it all lies a message that is still very relevant as society progresses forward towards its digital future. A bonified masterpiece, there's never been anything quite like it.
