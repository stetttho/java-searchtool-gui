 as with every other major cinematic advancement ozu held out against color as long as he possibly could but his use of color in "equinox flower" and later films is just as inventive and seemingly effortless as in his black and white compositions. the director's color scheme shows up surprisingly well in this solid vhs transfer from the folks at new yorker films, whose reliability in terms of picture quality for their videos is sometimes questionable. as for the film itself the plot is a variation on the usual ozu schpiel about marriage and its consequences. the focus is, as always, more on character than plot and the film is has many well-drawn characters. "equinox flower" is highly enjoyable and certainly one of ozu's less demanding films. however, in this case it's a bit more of a curse than a blessing: in the end the film feels somewhat slight and it's not nearly as profound or memorable as ozu's best work. though i wouldnt recommend that anyone go out of their way to dig it up it's most definitely worth a look.
