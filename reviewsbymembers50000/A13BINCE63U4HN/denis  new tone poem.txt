 I believe that Claire Denis is one of the few great directors working in Europe right now. Most of the greatest European filmmakers are past their prime or dead, and currently most of the world-class talents are located in Asia (Iran, Taiwan, Korea). Denis, one of the last hopes for French cinema, has made some brilliant films, but "Vendredi Soir" could be her weakest. All the stylistic traits that have served her so well in the past are there: the spare style, the moodiness, the soundtrack, the superb cinematography of Agnes Godard... and the editing in this film is particularly fine. Yet here all the stylistic excellence comes off as too little. The director describes it as an attempt to capture a moment, but the moment is relatively banal (a woman meets a man, they check into a hotel, make love and have pizza afterwards) and the whole attempt at spontaneity comes off as forced, despite the film's beautiful rhythm. Many have responded favorably to the film (one critic even calling it the most beautiful film ever made about two people) because, as I've mentioned, it has a lot going for it. It's just that unlike the director's best works, "Vendredi Soir" is unable to engage. It left me indifferent to the characters, the scenario, and whatever the director was trying to convey. The DVD transfer looks good, though, and adequately captures Godard and Denis' lovely vision of Paris at night. It's perhaps a little grainy, but I suspect Denis just likes the grainy look. The DVD also contains commentary by the director and the great critic Kent Jones - certainly a worthwhile perk if you're a fan of the director's work.
