 ~I can't write much about the film that others haven't. Yi Yi has been bemoaned as Yang's concession to mainstream audiences (after a career of making formally rigorous, "difficult" works), though that assumes that an artist should spend his career in one mode. The softening of Yang's style - which actually began with his two "comedies" in the mid-90s - is not necessarily a bad thing. Yang's formally challenging work reached its apex with the brilliant "A Brighter Summer Day." "Yi~~ Yi" is an epic-length work of an altogether different kind - not a "selling out" per se, but the work of someone who has perhaps come to see the world in a less despairing light (though "Yi Yi" certainly contains much sadness and disappointment). It is a brilliant film and justly acclaimed, and unlike "Brighter Day," it's a film I would recommend to those who don't necessarily go in for "demanding" or "arty" fare despite its runtime. The Fox Lorber DVD is a shame, as~~ has been noted several times, though its value lies in the director's commentary (ah, the wonderful thing about laserdiscs and DVDs: the possibility of capturing the words of the artist) rather than the poor presentation. I recommend people who really love this movie to SEEK OUT THE KOREAN DVD, which is easily found on any websites that specialize in Asian imports. It is a far superior transfer to the U.S. release and also, from what I understand, a step up on the Hong Kong disc.~
