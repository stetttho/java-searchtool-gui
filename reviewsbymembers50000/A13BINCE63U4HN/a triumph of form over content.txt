 Although "Deserter" is pure propaganda on par with the best (or worst, take your pick) of the Soviet classics, it has something going for it: it is an example of early Soviet filmmakers' commitment to bring montage experiments to the new field of sound film. As such, it surpasses anything made by Eisenstein. "Deserter" is in fact quite likely one of the most complex and innovative sound films ever made. Pudovkin achieves an incredible interplay between sound and image that makes most films look like "The Jazz Singer;" his experiments in this film are astounding even today. This film is a virtual textbook of the possibilities of sound use in the cinema, pushing beyond the merely functional (the "talkies") into the realm of the sublime. Way ahead of its time on the level of technique, but it's just too bad it could not have been applied to less yawn-inducing material.
