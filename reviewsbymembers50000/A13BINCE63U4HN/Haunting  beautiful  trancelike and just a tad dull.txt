 Eleni Karaindrou's music for the films of the great Greek filmmaker Theo Angelopoulos are usually just variations on a theme (and the theme doesn't vary much). For fans of minimalist music her themes for "Ulysses' Gaze," "Landscape in the Mist" and "The Suspended Step of the Stork" ought to be in your collection. If you want to slip into a meditative state (or sleep) I suggest you turn to any of Karaindrou's soundtracks - you won't be let down. "The Suspended Step of the Stork" is a CD for rainy days when you're stuck inside. I imagine that if you set it on repeat you could stare at the rain dribbling down your window for hours. "The Suspended Step" is a notch below "Ulysses' Gaze" only because it lacks the stunning viola of Kim Kashkashian. However, it's still great music if you're in the right mood. In the end, though, it's perhaps music best heard with Angelopoulos' cinematic accompaniment.
