 The Smetana piece has been recorded time and again, but what makes this CD great is that it is one of the few - perhaps the only - performance of Franck's masterful, tragically little-known string quartet on disc in North America. The inclusion of the Franck piece alone should make this an automatic addition to any serious classical music lover's CD collection. However, I do have to agree with earlier reviewers' compliants about the somewhat rote nature of the playing. The finale of Franck's piece should swell (as I've heard it done in older LP recordings), but here there is very little of the passion and intensity that the string quartet deserves. Regardless, any release of this extraordinary piece of music is a blessing.
