 Arguably the finest film of Jean Renoir's declining years, "The Elusive Corporal" is often wrongly cited as a "remake" of Renoir's universally heralded "Grand Illusion" (the similarities between the two are slight). Many critics have unfavorably compared the two, claiming that Renoir was merely re-baking old ideas here. However, other great directors frequently dipped into earlier successes, and some - Howard Hawks and Ozu Yasujiro to name a couple - made a career out of it. Yet you don't hear too many complaints about "Floating Weeds" or "El Dorado." "The Elusive Corporal" may not have been as groundbreaking as "Illusion" but I feel that it is the funnier and better of the two; it's a shame that it's out of print and so rarely seen.
