 I have always used Cobra FRS/GMRS products, so, yes, I am a bit biased. That said, this new product is spectacular! These FRS/GMRS radios look great, sound great and work great! Lots of features, many buttons to press (always a plus for me!), range that is within advertised distances [assuming or using the product in an ideal environment] and a great price for performance/quality, etc. With these radios you can choose hi/lo power to conserve battery juice, go the "full Monty" and ask for 2 watts to get maximum range, hear your "other half" clearly and save big bucks over "professional" models. Really folks, when you and a spouse or friend goes out into the town and wants to stay in touch for any number of reasons, realistically you are NOT going to be apart more than about a mile or so (unless you are hiking the Yukon!)...so 2-way radios that enable you to stay in touch reliably within these distances are a godsend....and the Cobra 950's do that easily. You cannot beat the price/performance ratio. Invest in some rechargable NiMH batteries and you no longer have to pay 10-20c a minute for a cell phone when going shopping in a mall or visiting a museum or taking a car caravan...this is the best deal around, bar none!
