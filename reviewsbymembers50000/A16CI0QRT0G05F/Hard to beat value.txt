 I have another set of Cobra FRS radios which I think are great. This new addition to the Cobra GMRS/FRS group is really outstanding. It has smart looks, easy to operate controls, good fidelity and the ability to change from 500mw to 2 watts, depending on the channel selected and whether you wish to save battery juice. There are some other "bells and whistles" like 10 different ringing sounds, including a "Vibra Alert", power indicators, signal strength (incoming & outgoing), belt clip, carry strap....jeez, what else could you ask for and only [price] a pair? The range is typical for these products, which really depends on the terrain (4+ miles in the open, about 3 ish on highways [car to car] and about 2 miles or a bit less in crowded streets). Remember, the higher one is the better when using UHF "line of sight transmissions. I was parked in an underground lot the other day (under cement and steel, etc) and had to coordinate picking up my wife....even though we were, at one point, separated by 2 floors, about 1/3 of a mile and lots of cubic feet, these Cobras still did the needful and kept us in contact while I negotiated my way out of the... parking garage. This deal has to be a "no brainer."
