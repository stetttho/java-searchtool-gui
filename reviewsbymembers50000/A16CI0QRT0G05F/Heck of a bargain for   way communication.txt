 You cannot beat this deal! Two FRS radios, charger and battery (hopefully you will get the NiMH batteries - they are better than Nicad's) My wife and I use these extensively everywhere-- on the road, in big grocery or department stores, while one of us goes across the street to buy bread (or lottery tickets), or in the basement to put stuff away....time and again these Cobra FRS's have been helpful for inexpensive two-way communication. In the US, I am sure that there is channel saturation in places (malls and sporting events); still, these are so handy if someone is in the car and needs to drop the other person off to get directions or find a parking spot...you will be amazed at the number of uses you will find for them. This model has about everything you might need....remember that 500mw is only going to go so far...the laws of physics do not change even if the brand name of your product does! UHF transmissions are best when you and the other party are in "line of sight" and not blocked by large buildings, lots of trees, etc. This is just a fact of life. But in stores or malls, these radios come in sooo handy...one can shop at the "guy store" while your wife looks at clothes or kitchen junk....and each can brouse to their heart's content, then ring the other when it is time to go the opera (or baseball game!!)....grab this deal, it's a winner!
