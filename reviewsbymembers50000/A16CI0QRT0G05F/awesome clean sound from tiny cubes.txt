 For an above average entry into Home Theater, it is hard to imagine how you could beat this system. The tiny cube speakers disappear into the listening room and one can place the Acoustimass module out of sight (but pointed correctly - more on this in a moment) then the sound comes from everywhere! Many people chastise Bose systems claiming the bass is not "thumping" enough. But maybe they are missing the point. Bass should not be 'thumpy' but smooth, clean and absorbed by the bodies of the listeners!  The trick to getting beautiful bass from this system is to aim the opening of the bass module TOWARD a side wall, leaving about 2-3" from the wall. You can adjust the distance a bit to change the bass, but you will be pleasantly surprised. The bass is clean, without loosening floor tiles and with reasonable care in the placement of the 5 cube speakers,well, it is hard for my friends (and myself) to believe the sound that surrrounds!  Set up is EZ, with cables already in place on the bass module; you just prepare the connection by separating the twin leads to match the placement of the cube speakers, and you're done! Set up your AV receiver according to the EZ 2 READ chart on the enclosed instructions and you are ready to enjoy Home Theater, thanks to this incredible BOSE system.
