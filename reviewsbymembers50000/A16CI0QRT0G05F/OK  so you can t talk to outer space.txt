 I own a set of these FRS radios and they get a workout! We use them in museums (like the Louvre!), big grocery and department stores and car caravans...since these radios use the UHF frequencies, "line-of-sight" is important for maximum range...I have obtained almost 2.5 miles or so, but one person was on top of a hill and the other down in a small city...otherwise, expect about a mile and change between 2 cars (put the radio outside the window for maximum range - unless it's raining!) and anywhere between 3/4 mile to 1.5 in town, depending on how surrounded you are by buildings. For most people these radios can be very useful...we like 'em in malls, etc so we can go to shops each of us likes and then just buzz the other when we are ready to do something else. I bought the rechargable NiMH batteries...a real long term savings and good for the environment too...I get decent time usage with the NiMH The extra "fluff" items one can buy like AM FM or weather...well, geez, why oh why pay for something you already have? Just get a model with the 14 channels and be happy. These radios are a godsend when 2 people are traveling to strange cities, looking for parking spaces or directions, etc and allow one person to leave the car or luggage safely and carry on some business.  The Cobras are a great value.
