 I have an earlier model of the Midland GXT - the 400 and it has performed well for me. I could not resist the 5-watter and so I bought a set. These operate like the other GXT models - I have achieved 6 miles with the GXT 400 between cars - and 8 miles with this model. Of course, hills break up transmission clarity. In a city environment, I have managed about 5-6, depending on the buildings. Of course 14 miles could only happen across water (which is where Midland and perhaps other manufacturers test their products for their generous range claims) or between mountain tops. Remember that UHF signals do best in a "line of sight" mode and do poorly with stuff in the way - that's just plain physics. The extra watt might buy an extra mile or so....also remember from physics class the "inverse square law" - which applies to light waves and radio and sound waves....basically, the strength of a signal/sound/light falls off at a ratio inversely squared to the distance....in plain English...if an FRS radio at 1/2 watt reached 2 miles [sure!], then doubling the power output to 1 watt would not, repeat, not double the distance achieved, but rather only add a mile [maybe]...thus a 5 watt transmitter (10 times the power) will achieve about 3X the distance (square root of 10) over an FRS 1/2 watt xmitter, assuming the distances are as advertised. The extra power sometimes gets thru objects a bit better, but won't reach the moon!  In real life, most of us use these over ranges of about 1/4 to 3 miles tops, and most of these products in the 2-5 watt range should handle this distance adequately. There is some "fussiness" with the menu options, etc, but once you are accustomed to it, these are decent radios.
