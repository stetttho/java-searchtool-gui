 My brother-in-law has a set of these recently introduced GMRS radios from Cobra....our transmissions were fine...we thought we had better fidelity than some police radios we have heard. Range was pretty good inside a large mall; one of us in a basement store and the other at the far end (about 3/4 mile) on the second story...that is a lot of concrete and steel in between, but reception was clear, vioces easily understood -  a bit of static now and then, but that is to be expected from all the lights and other things "in the way" between the 2 units. I imagine the range in the open would be considerably more than standard FRS radios...but again, the law of physics apply....an FRS radio with 500mw (1/2 watt) goes say 2 miles on a good day; this unit with 4 times the theoretical power will only double the range, on average (the inverse square rule). But really folks, how far apart are you going to be from each other most of the time? Usually a mile or less...here, the extra "juice" gets the signal thru buildings better...we have no complaints about this new addition to the Cobra family...a great bargain with NiMH batteries, in-unit  charging plus the earbud mike...even with an FCC license it is a good deal.
