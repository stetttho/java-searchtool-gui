 Having recently switched to DVD, I had to replace my TEAC ProLogic with something else to go with my BOSE Acoustimass 6 system. The Sony STR DE 575 fit the bill. Great sound, more than enuff power to disturb the neighbors (!), pretty EZ to hook up and use. The DTS decoder performs superbly with GLADIATOR, MATRIX, JURASSIC PARK III...this unit has overall great performance and features at this price. Initial setup is a bit tricky - but hey, for the guys, what else would you wanna do but fiddle with all the controls for a while? The Sony does a great job with its ProLogic (not ProLogic II) and VHS tapes...why spend tons more when you can get all this for less [money]? Grab one soon!
