 I recently upgraded to the AM6 model having retired my AM3 (with different rear speakers). I have read other reviews on other sites that claim this system won't rattle the walls - well, perhaps the contributor did not set up the system correctly. Place the AM module (bass module) FACING the wall, about 2-3" away and prepare yourself for enjoyment! I think a lot of Home "Theaterphiles" prefer the "boomy" or "thumpy" bass - well, more power (no pun) to them! The Bose AM6 produces the kind of bass response I really like - smooth, pure and without the boxy thump some systems make. The surround image is a delight and one can fiddle with the little speakers to create an image field to suit one's taste. All in all, it is hard to beat the quality and versatility of this system.
