 I don't know where the "country" description comes in, since this is more a combination of late-60s Stonesish country (Exile on Main St., as noted) and some 80s basic rock (like REM's first couple albums). Now, if they had used a Telecaster with less distortion, maybe I'd say "country" ....  Great barroom rock without any pretense. Sounds like it was recorded the old way, with everyone just playing at once. This is a real tight band, though -- no keyboards or effects, just a solid set-up of electric and acoustic guitars, drums, etc. Everyone is dead on, and Layne's vocals are excellent -- Jagger crossed with some honkytonk country singers, and the guitar is something between Keith Richards and probably a bunch of influential bands I'm too naive to know about. I really like this album, and I already knew of these guys as bloggers and writers (the founders of Prognosis) and members of other bands (Tsar?), but I'm astounded at how a few people can be so talented. I always pop a beer when I listen to this one, which is pretty often. Ought to be even better live. My only small gripe: "I Should Be That Guy" is a little too generic. And why isn't "Monkey Cup" included here? And why hasn't Amazon put up some song samples?
