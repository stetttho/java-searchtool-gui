 Whenever you think your life is bad, pick up a Zola novel. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone looking for a happy ending, but if you're the twisted sort who loves reading up on other people's misery (e.g. Dostoevsky, Kafka or Flannery O'Connor), then dig in. And if you've ever read Frank Norris's "McTeague" and liked it, then you should know that Zola was his biggest influence. You start off with a family hovering on the brink of ruin in the slums of Paris. Could it get worse? Oh yes, and how! Increase the levels of alcohol and poverty (the characters', that is, not yours), sit back and watch. I can't vouch for the translation, but you'll be reaching for the sequel (and God knows there were plenty) once you finish this sordid tale.
