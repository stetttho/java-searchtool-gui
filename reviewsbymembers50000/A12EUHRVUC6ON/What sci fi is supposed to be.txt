 First of all, does writing a review for an inexcusably out-of-print book assist in getting it republished? Clifford Simak was a giant in sci-fi, with a grand output of classics and duds (but there's always another Simak book you haven't read...), and most of his books are fascinating, fleshed-out premises, but well done.  This one is another in a series of understated "what if" books, and deals with the readjustments society makes after everyone starts getting cryogenically preserved to be reawakened in the future. The upshot is, they all become pennypinchers and start looking at everything as an investment, not for old age, but for 200 years in the future. Classic Simakian themes of economic craziness in a society where everyone starts living for tomorrow and tricksters, swindlers and so on run amok selling postage stamps, future antiques, worthless swampland and so on.  Plenty of spooky futuristic images that are even more relevant today than when he wrote this. And fun to read!
