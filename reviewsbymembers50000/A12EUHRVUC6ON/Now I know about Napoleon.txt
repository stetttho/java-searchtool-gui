 Before reading this, I never did know the whole story about Napoleon, even after reading War and Peace and visiting his grandiose tomb in Paris on several occasions -- a must-see, right up there near Graceland. This is a great book for anyone who wants to know who Napoleon was, what he did, and why it mattered. I'm sure there are better, more drawn-out, academic and specific books out there, and maybe I'll end up disagreeing with the author's inclination that there is a certain villainy in Napoleon's climbing the ladder of power until he could take over as much of the world as possible, but I don't see that as far-fetched at this point. This is not hard to read at all -- it flows well, and is just long, compared to some books. In the end, you'll have the overall picture, all the major players and all the background you need to talk about Napoleon and find out more.
