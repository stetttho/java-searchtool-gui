 Rhetoric is the art of convincing and persuading, which requires not only understanding what it is you want to say, but all the psychological details of the people you want to say it to..... If you want an excellent description of all the main human emotions and how they are taken advantage of, or targeted, by everyone from politicians to the common man, check this out. This is a classic that cannot be left on the shelf. Parts are a bit dusty, but the rest is still immediately relevant.  In one way this is a great starting point for any discussion of psychology, propaganda or speech and media. In many ways, this book straight to the heart of the matter, where we nowadays are ineffectually specialized. Buy it!
