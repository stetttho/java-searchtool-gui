 If you like the Ventures, or if you like the way your guitar sounds when you turn the reverb up all the way, this is the best CD out there! The problem with instrumental albums is listening through to the end. There are only a couple lyrics here (weird chanted stuff), so this one might be best appreciated on a rotation of 3 or 5 CDs. But every song is primo. So many great bands out there that never get airplay. Some of these groups take their Ventures so seriously, they up everything. More reverb! More twang! Yeah, that's how it ought to be. You can't go wrong with this CD.
