 What do you mean, "ennui"? We went to "Eastern" Europe for adventure, enlightenment, shocking new experiences and fun! It was the best time of our lives -- those who stuck around learned a new language, made life-long friends, discovered appalling and comical customs and had a blast! There's nothing anti-intellectual about that -- I could have brooded at home just as efficiently. I wondered when the "new Hemingway" flatulence would finally bubble to the top. Well, Phillips is actually a very good writer with a way with words, but not much more. As always, ignore the gassy cover blurb cliches -- this is no Hemingway/Fitzgerald/define-a-generation/"finally!" novel.  It describes expat life in Central Europe, as I and many other found it in the early 90s, mostly in poignant single phrases and episodes, and in lots of quotable scenes. But we're already familiar with the situation and expect a decent story, so disregard the setting and let's read the book.     Unfortunately, Phillips violates two extremely important rules of a good novel: 1)  Show, don't tell, and 2) If nothing happens after page 1 (20? 50? 100?) why should anyone keep reading?     The author writes with an unnerving, almost pathological (Jeopardy champ?)obsession with surface detail. He makes Joseph Conrad's Marlow look forgetful and reticent by comparison. Once you recognize this, you begin to skim past whole paragraphs or pages of catalogued information for the next actual instance of activity. But because that rarely comes, I think few will readers will actually read to the end.      There are some gripping, square-on accurate scenes, but they are so spaced out. The author is probably an excellent short-story writer who has overreached himself. If he put out this same book as 10 or 12 short stories, I'd be raving! He's got the situation so precisely in his photographic-memory crosshairs.  But every character and scene is noosed up so tightly in trivial detail -- as though the reader would be tested later, or as though we're unable to infer or assume anything without overbearing guidance -- that the book becomes claustrophobic. But the detailed descriptions lend nothing to the story -- they say only, "look at how accurate this is." So the oppressively omniscient and looming narrator becomes like a dinner guest telling a drawn-out yarn for hours as his captive guests doze off. Even Conrad's Marlow paused now and then, for chrissakes; Phillips just describes and describes until his photo-memory, self-satisfied presence becomes downright irritating.      Phillips (or his editors) seem never to have read chapters aloud to test the rhythm or tone, or to see if eyes glazed over. I read aloud just one page endlessly describing the concrete facade of a building to my (Czech) wife until she screamed, "Stop! Enough already!" Not the response you'd normally expect for an engaging book.       Once you realize that the plot is just a thin, prolonged theme with zero suspense -- young people overseas discovering themselves, and just barely -- the book becomes an endurance test. The uninspiring, self-defeating notion that Prague is more exciting than Budapest was apparently worked up later to justify the title and cover photo, and to appeal to potential expat buyers. That's it? That's the theme that's supposed to get us through 367 pages?        I'm still waiting for a good book that describes the reality of those expat days -- the whimsical, random, fun-loving, (definitely not "ennui"'d) times. Given what's been published so far, you'd think the American presence behind the liberated East Bloc was composed of braniacs and neurotic sticks-in-the-mud, rather than fools, folks, libertines and nerds out for kicks and to check out a new frontier. No one I knew back then took that Prague Post/Newsweek hype about "Paris of the 20's of the 90's" seriously, but so far no one has successfully challenged the hype -- certainly not Phillips. For God's sake -- we weren't writers, we just had cheap tickets and a sense of adventure (or massive delusions, for some few). A blistering and blissful experience that was just as eye-opening as that had by Phillips' pottering characters. Once the critics have finished scribbling blather about the "Generation X" thing in Eastern Europe, this book will unfortunately lose its relevance, inspiring no one, and will drop into its appropriate pigeon hole, even though Arthur Phillips may have done the best so far at "describing" what was going on.      I suppose if expat writers were less compelled to write "The Novel," and instead turned out scads of down-to-earth potboilers about the fun we had, we'd have something to choose from -- to enjoy or discard -- and we'd then have an actual genre to enjoy, instead of an occasional overhyped "voice-of-a-generation"-type tome that can't possibly meet expectations.
