 When you listen to Hendrix or the Beatles from this same year, or even a few years before, a couple things stand out. One of them is the shoddy original recording mix of Cream that no remaster seems to be able to fix. There's some kind of distance between you and the music -- a couple inches of sonically muffled noise, and no, I don't mean because their amps were too loud. There is always just a hiss, and the drums always sound like they were off in the distance, with all sorts of crashing and banging into one mike. I can only imagine how good this band might sound if someone had wandered over from the Beatles', Donovan's, Rolling Stones' or anyone else's studio and mentioned, "Hey, this guy is a pretty good drummer, why record everything through some cheap garage sound system?" Compare the recording quality of, say the White Album to this. Heck, even Zeppelin with its distortion was better recorded. Steppenwolf, too. And, dare I say, "Blue Cheer"? Too bad. It's not like they couldn't have afforded better recording. They sound way, way behind the times for their time on the recording quality level.  The second thing that ruins Cream is Jack Bruce. His wailing vocals are neither here nor there, and he has some indulgent need to echo the chorus and guitar leads with lots of "waah waah!" choruses. I guess he was all that back in the day (though how he was "the cream" with no memorable pre-Cream hits, and just a career abyss thereafter says plenty), but he ruins every Cream song for me. Nowadays everyone thinks Cream is all about Eric Clapton, but it still sounds like they're trying to back some earnest, failing singer. I guess his muffly, willy-nilly basslines are/were the cat's pajamas, but if Eric had sung these songs, brought in a studio bassist and a decent engineer, Cream would have been oh so much better.  Still a rockin' band, I must say.
