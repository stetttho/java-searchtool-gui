 This is a very well-written book stylistically (the author is great with turns of phrase, but only in spurts now and then, so there's no "wall of sound" effect), and the subject matter is fascinating. The book appears to be exhaustively researched (loads of thank-yous and aknowledgements), and yet is actually quite short and easy to read -- in fact, it is slightly repetitious. I have to say I will never forget this book after the bizarre and unforeshadowed turn of events toward the end that still has me puckering and unintentionally crossing my legs. The best part about this book is how much you learn in a short time, and the way it always interests folks when you bring up in conversation the subjects it covers.
