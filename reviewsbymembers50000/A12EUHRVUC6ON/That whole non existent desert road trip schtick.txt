 Honestly, I only made it about 15 or 20 minutes into this.  The opening act, I guess was supposed to set the stage, but then it ended and I forgot what it was about.  Then we proceed to the worn-thin territory of the predictable "American desert" drive. The one that only exists in movies, where there is no I-40, and everyone just rambles along in treasured classic cars down roads where there seems to be no cross-country trucking, no traffic, no one heading anywhere, drinking coffee alone somewhere in a non-existent Route 66-type diner out of the director's fantasy with the predictable results: 1) Long lonesome two-lane highways? Check. 2) A diner in the middle of nowhere? Check 3) A waitress in a ridiculous pink outfit that says "Hon"? and offers a refill? Check 4) A jukebox that always seems to play some kind of Patsy Cline or something similar, even though both jukeboxes and Patsy are unknown around the states. No Toby Keith or anything like that. Check. 5) No sports TV at the aforementioned bar. Check. 6) Some kind of gas station that would never meet any sort of legal standard, with a 50-year-old pump. Check.  Well, that's about all I got out of the first 15 minutes. I probably could have gone on, but why bother? Not a single original idea so far. Maybe it gets better. I can't be bothered to find out.
