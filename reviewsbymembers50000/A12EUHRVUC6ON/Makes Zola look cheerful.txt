 Geez! Just finished my original 1932 hardbound edition from the library book sale -- my first Caldwell book -- and feel blessed above all men compared to the characters in what I just read. This book makes the Li'l Abner gang look like the Vanderbilts. You've got a whole book based on a family who subsists off stolen turnips, snuff and boiled roots, with no money, no family allegiances (despite living like worms in a couple of beds in a shingle shack propped up on rocks), but somehow you come to love them, with their hairlips and inbred idiocy and more. Imagine the most isolated and ignorant hillbilly characters you know (I mentioned Li'l Abner, but maybe someone from Deliverance or Flannery O'Connor or Faulkner). You could put a Faulknerian idiot man-child up against this crew as a role model. Man, what a harsh book. It's kind of repetitive (a lot of times I thought I had already read a paragraph, but it was just the same thing being restated -- usually the parts about Jeeter wanting to get his daughter's hairlip "sewed up" or plant something in his wasted fields)-- I think the repetition may have been deliberate, in order to drive home the tiny hopeless world Jeeter and the clan live in. In any case, the book is short enough to wonder about this and still power though to the end without any draining literary analysis.  Before Caldwell, I thought Emile Zola was the best at spinning a story that started off bad for all the characters and got progessively worse (oh, and Frank Norris), but this breaks the record. I'll be reading more by this guy wherever I can find them. There's something dirtily satisfying about reading such books, sort of a literary slumming alternative to trash TV. I don't know if this was literature or not, or if there is any factual basis for this -- but that hasn't stopped me before.
