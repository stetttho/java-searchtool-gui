 I already commented on this book once -- and after a closer reading and a few more reviews to open my mind, I'm still stuck at two stars -- a rough combo of 4 small stars for episodic, descriptive proficiency and a fat 1 star for tying all of it together into a readable novel. I still think Phillips is very perceptive in identifying some of the sort of people who were "over there" in the early days, before the expat-tourist onslaught, but I still have to say -- if you're looking for a story that hangs together and is enjoyable to read, this ain't the book. As an aside, I might mention that my experience in Central Europe begins soon after the "revolutions," in Prague (with only one visit to Budapest, for reasons of money and distance) but mostly in relatively isolated brown-lignite coal/uranium country in far-north Czech (one year) and bucolic, post-Sudeten far-south Czech (four years). All this may have colored my view of most expat lit as facile and overwrought (unless there's a story to tell).  But in 1990, tickets to Prague and Budapest were, in fact, pretty cheap (and rarely one-way, incidentally) -- or better, you could train in from Germany -- the countries were fresh in a run-down way and exciting, and no retrospective overintellectualizing can ruin the fun we really had or are having. I just hope Phillips wasn't one of those I met who zipped over to write "The Novel" and zipped out when the glamour faded.
