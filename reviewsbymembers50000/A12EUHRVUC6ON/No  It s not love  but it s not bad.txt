 Great CD. One of four new albums of Merle's vintage stuff arranged thematically. I have three of four ("Drinkin," "Cheatin" and "Prison" -- I didn't get "Hurtin" yet, because it seemed, well ... possibly downbeat). If Merle wasn't cuckolded and cheated on like a blind poker player, then he sure faked it well. These are those classic country Haggard songs you're looking for, with that "swinging doors" sound and twang from the golden age that Merle pretty much helped define.  After this album, you'll be tempted to drive around the Motel 6 and see if the old lady's car is there. Which will lead you to Merle's "Drinkin" CD. Hey, either way, it's a tribute to the master Merle that his stuff is still out there as country music continues to go into the can.
