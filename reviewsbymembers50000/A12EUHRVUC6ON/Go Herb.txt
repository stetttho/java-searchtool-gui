 I don't know what happened with Herb and our unappreciative society. He beat out the Beatles for some Grammies and sales, but good luck hearing the Tijuana Brass on our accursed "oldies" radio. Now his records are dumped into the nation's thrift stores. Thank goodness -- it's allowed me to collect everything he's ever recorded. This is a great collection. You'll know this stuff, guaranteed, but just can't place it. Was it a game show? Some movie? Probably all of those.  There's some great stuff here -- stuff you should own. If you can't listen to that many trumpet instrumentals in a row, then flop this CD in with a couple other albums in the mix and watch the crowd go wild!
