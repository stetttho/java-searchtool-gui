 The commercial bombast now known as "country music" left the prison scene behind long ago, but back when the musicians knew what they were singing about, Merle was laying it on the line about doing time. This album even has a great cover of Johnny Cash's "Folsom Prison Blues" I'd never heard before. There are no bad songs on this CD, and by the end, you'll be scared straight. It's vintage Merle, with trademark Telecaster and lap steel, Bakersfield sound and no pop orchestrations or nothin'. The last song seems to be a long-lost copy of the San Quentin prison choir performing for a radio program. Real country/western and some of Merle's greatest. No reference to the unsettling topic of soap-dropping, shower shenanigans and makeshift forced copulatory arrangements, but just as well. There are 4 CDs in this series, so check them out. "Hurtin," "Cheatin," "Drinkin" and "Prison." I hope the series isn't finished, because I think they need a couple more thematically arranged albums, like "Bustin' Heads" and maybe "Grindstonin'" or "Hippie Slammin'".
