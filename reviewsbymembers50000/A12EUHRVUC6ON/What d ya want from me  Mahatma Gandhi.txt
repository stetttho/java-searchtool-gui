 Wow -- what a flashback. I had almost forgotten this record (or CD or whatever). This was a classic "let's have some fun" record back in, what, 1987? with my friends in Berkeley. Here's my weird connection. My original LP has deep score marks around the little guy, because a buddy was doing the video for "some friend's band" and wanted me to do an animation sequence for their first (?) video. I had been doing a little illustration work on a college magazine with him, and didn't know jack cheese pie about animation, but .... I was 19 or 20. I traced the figure and painstakingly drew maybe 50 animation "cells" on tracing paper, which my friend magically converted to computer in black and orange for the video for "Innocents Ablaze." In the video, the kid came alive and walked off the edge of the albume. Wow -- I was famous. Actually, not. And thank God. If you ever see the video, it's the most amateurish thing you've ever seen. I'm sure there was some severe disappointment among band members. But it worked. I got an album out of it. I probably should have followed up with the band, but I was just helping out a buddy.  If it means anything, friends and I still know "The Otter Song" and "King Fred," not to mention the fact that we occasionally quote the classic "Don Quixote." I wish young bands still started out so fun and fresh like this. But now we've got Eminem.  Great record, great memories.
