 If you're getting tired of strumming your same old C, F, G, A ... trying to pick out songs, stuck in a rut, then this is a great big step in your acoustic guitar playing. This isn't a big "how to" book, nor does it have any complete songs or big music theory. But it's so funny and relaxing, you'll have no problem learning a bunch of fun stuff. One short page per example. Like where to put your fingers to sound like you know more than you do, and the author's always hilarious examples of things to play when testing out a guitar at the shop to make people turn around and think you really know what you're doing. Seems to work! Funny thing is, you actually do learn a lot of stuff. Some of the changes and patterns in here I played and then said, "Wow -- that sounded really cool." You'd be all the way to Book III, Chapter 9 or wherever in most books before they thought you were ready for it. But you're just "faking," remember? If you're an "upper beginner" or intermediate guitar player, this little book has a lot for you. Way more fun than nearly all "how to" books.  Well organized, funny drawings, great stuff. A keeper.
