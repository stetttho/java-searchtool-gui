 If you're the sort who buys solo albums by Rolling Stones members, then  you'd better get this one. But don't get it if you don't have Keith's first album, which is a lot stronger. Now that we have the audience defined, let's talk pros and cons on this album. On the first couple listens, I got the feeling I was listening to unadorned rhythm guitar tracks for Rolling Stones songs that never got recorded. Keith gets a basic band together, but there's no lead guitar or that trade-off on licks that the Stones do so well. Mostly just that open-G chunga-chung Keith chord he's been doing since 1968, and some songs that go totally off, bafflingly, and don't seem to depend on guitar at all. And there are some slow songs that are better left ignored. Unfortunately, anything that Keith did that is musically elementary and depends entirely on his singing to create the song is sure to fail.  I'd recommend "Talk is Cheap" over this one. There are some good cuts, but I can never figure out why superstars put out songs with three lackluster chords, boring words that just have to rhyme, and no substance that stays in your mind even after a couple listenings.
