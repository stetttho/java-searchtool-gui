 "Princess" was ERB's first book, in 1912, when he was already nearly middle-aged and didn't even know he was an author, but he spins a story to match Homer's Odyssey -- one that sets the stage for sci-fi's greatest series. It's probably not the best of that series, but a must-read if you want to see how modern sci-fi began. The best thing about the Mars series (and Tarzan, and Venus, and Pellucidar) -- and what makes it so important in sci-fi -- is its efforts to rationalize all sorts of outlandish things through scientific and cultural explanation (I'm convinced!). "Princess" has a few "feeler"-type occurrences, with ERB putting sci-fi stuff out there in print for the first time, making sure to expand on the whys and hows for the virgin readership -- but after he sets up the whole genre of modern sci-fi, the series takes off in a run of books that stab at his Mars idea from all sorts of crazy angles. You can read the Mars series in order, but after reading the first two or three books to understand the world ERB created, I especially recommend jumping to "The Synthetic Men of Mars" (cool! headless man-like beasts being farmed by body-less head-only men, for self-evident reasons) And "The Chessmen of Mars" which kept me up all night when I was 16.  Yes, all the women are beautiful and to die for, although they have pretty much no personality, and all the heroes are bombastically and genetically heroic in a medieval way with, likewise, no personality (and anything related to sex with ERB is bizarre, unconsummated and usually requires drawing of swords and the author's ambivalent but feverish avoidance of innuendo, despite everyone always being naked, it seems -- kinda freaky), but minor characters steal the story from the cardboard protagonists -- and hell, it was 1912, after all, and ERB had never written a book before.....
