 If you want authentic country, and you're ready to open a bottle, Merle's ready for you.  Maybe the best album series idea in a long time: Four Merle CDs arranged thematically: "Drinkin'", "Cheatin'", "Hurtin'" and "Prison."  Now you don't have to go poking though bulky greatest hits albums to get to the point. Pull up a barstool and start knockin' 'em back with the master. No bad song on this CD. Or any from this series. They're all exactly what you're looking for -- if you're looking for that classic Bakersfield sound, with a twangy Telecaster, a little lap steel, authentic lyrics about booze, women and neon signs. No overorchestrated tangents here -- just you, Merle and the bottle.  You know, I always took Merle for a beer and whiskey drinker, but so many of these songs talk about wine, I'm just hoping the bottle's got a screw-off cap and holds at least a gallon. This is what country music's all about -- a man like Merle who's done the time; not some Twinkie-fed, blow-dried mullet boy singing about his truck.
