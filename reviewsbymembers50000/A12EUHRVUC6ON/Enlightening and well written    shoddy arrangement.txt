 There's no telling how much editing this book underwent before publication, but Dylan's memories of New York and Minnesota before he hit it big are astonishingly detailed and well written. He doesn't come off nearly as arrogant as he appears in various '60s clips. Then again, no apologies. Not that he admits any wrongdoing.  The most striking part of the book is probably the middle section about how he tried to destroy his own myth by producing a bunch of crap in the early '70s, but even then "The gourd! Follow the gourd!" types wouldn't leave him alone.  The problem with the book overall is the shoddy editorial arrangement, with some very revealing and intelligent confessions mixed with long and drawn-out uninteresting details about how Daniel Lanois mixed one of his albums in the 1980s.   Dylan comes off as much more eloquent and direct than you'd expect, but reveals absolutely no emotional attachment to any person outside of musicians, dead or alive. Wives, kids, ex-girlfriends, etc. are barely mentioned, if at all -- and if so, only vaguely and usually without even receiving a name. There's no dedication in the frontispiece. A biographer looking at this book would not find much info here about Dylan's family or personal life -- but they will get a lot about Lanois' approach to chord arrangement and studio mixing, which I and probably everyone else passed over.   I did like the fact that Dylan takes on a lot of the vapid reviews and criticisms over the years. As a book, it jumps around randomly, but still better than "Tarantula."
