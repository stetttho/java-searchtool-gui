 I Just got this system a month or two ago, and I'm happy with it. The speakers are quite outstanding actually. I have everything run through a Sony Receiver (the one that I've already reviewed) along with some vintage Yamaha center speakers, and the setup sounds quite nice so far. As everyone has already mentioned regarding KLH sound systems, the speakers are amazing, and the subwoofers lack bass. Then again, you do save a great deal of money on the sattellite system, so throw it towards a decent sub. The speakers come with everything required for mounting, except decent wall screws. Also, the included speaker wire is absolutely dreadful, I'd recommend getting your own separately.  This system is perfect for an apartment where you have to worry about neighbors above and below complaining about constant wall thumping. I've had no complaints thus far. I don't mean to sell the sub short, it is nice for the price, and doesn't seem like its going to blowout any time soon. Again, if you want to shake the paintings off your neighbors walls, you might want to try something else.
