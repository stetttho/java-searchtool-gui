 This is a decent album from elements of REM (Peter Buck) and Wilco (Jeff Tweedy). I bought the album because I am a huge Wilco fan, though not the biggest REM fan, and I found this to be a happy medium. There are some weak tracks on the album like: What I don't Believe, View From Below, and Life Left Him There; all of which are rather uninspired songs, and seem like they are really searching for a feeling. However, there are some absolute gems on this one that definitely make worth a listen or two. My personal favorites are "Where Will You Go?" which is very catchy up until the ending where things degrade, rather artistically. Not all songs can end as this one does, and I think they pull it off. I really like this one cause at the time of my first listen I was considering sending an ex girlfriend a fee for all of the money I'd spent on her (channel your negativity). "I'm Not Bitter" is another great song that really feels like a Lennon/McCartney song. It just has that feel. I also really like "Retrieval of You," which is a really good, upbeat song. Kind of a lament for all of us wannabe artists and musicians that fell tragically short of the mark.  This really is one of those albums that grows on you. I had put it away for 2 or 3 months, came back to it, and found it to be delightful. Its very light, puts a lot of emphasis on vocal harmonizing and catchy melodies. If you're into folk-rock or indie, or you really love Wilco/REM, I don't think you'll be that disappointed. I like it.
