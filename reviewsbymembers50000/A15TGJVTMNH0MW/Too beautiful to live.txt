 Okay, So this was the first Elliot Smith Album I bought, mostly on a whim at the suggestion of a friend of mine. I'm very glad that I did lay down the cash to pick this one up. It's sad that I should begin listening to Elliot Smith with such an awe inspiring album, even sadder that I got into him posthumously. This one is definitely inspiring, with a pleasantness that belies a deeper melancholy. Lyrically, it develops beyond the simple angst ridden drivel that is so commonplace in music these days. This album presents old themes and ideas about forlorn love and whatnot in a very flavorful way. If you had to make the Simon and Garfunkel comparison, I'd say that it compares more favorably to Paul Simon post S & G. However, none of the songs have the poppy hook that is prevalent in Simon's work.  I notice that I'm managing to write a lot without really saying anything, but you need to experience this to understand. It's a classic. RIP Elliot, such romantics are too beautiful too live
