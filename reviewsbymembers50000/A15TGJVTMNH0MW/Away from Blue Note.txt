 Being an enormous fan of 'Come Away With Me,' I immediately dropped the cash to pick this one up when I saw a single copy nestled sunggly on the cd rack at Best Buy (Great price for it this week, the deciding factor in the purchase $9.99). After three times through this albumn, I'm not nearly impressed with it as much as 'Come Away With Me.' This one is definitely more country than jazz, as is evidenced by Dolly Parton's self-indulgent appearance on the album (I hate vibrato, and she uses entirely too much in her singing). Since I'm more of a Jazz/Blues fan than country, this did upset me.  However (ever notice there is always a however or a but?). This is better than most of the albumns that have been released in the last month. And like it or not, Norah still has that seductively sultry voice that sends tingles up the spine, and makes you long for a glass of wine and a lover's touch. Still works as mood music; a good background for a romantic evening. "Sunrise" and "What am I to you?" are my particular favorites, probably because they've proved to be the most catchy after only a few times through the album. There are love songs on this album, and since many were co-written with her boyfriend and bassist, Lee Alexander, the lyrics are a little more poignant.  I don't doubt that this will grow on me, and I will change the review to be a little less critical. However, the point I want to make is that if you are expected to be blown away like you were when you greedily bought 'Come Away With Me,' ran home with a silly grin on your face, dropped it in your cd player, and melted to such a soulful new sound, you might be disappointed.
