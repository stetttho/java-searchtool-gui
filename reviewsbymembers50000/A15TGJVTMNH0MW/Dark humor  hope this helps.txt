 Think of the dry cool wit of the Simpsons, combined with the provacative humor of All in the Family, and I think you'll have a pretty good idea of Family Guy. There are parts where you'll laugh out loud and immediately feel guilty about laughing at the joke. Stewie is by far the utlimate evil genius and closet drag queen, always foiled by Lois, his mother. Brian, the talking dog, seems to provide balance, despite being an alcoholic and recovering cocaine addict. Then of course there is Peter, the dad, who is your stereotypical stupid father and would be strongly compared to Homer Simpson on his worst days.  This is perhaps the funniest two and a half seasons of a show that has ever been. However, with this collection you only get the first and second seasons. Adam West as the mayor is a great touch too. I think you can tell that I'm a huge fan, since this review is all over the place. Before you sit down and purchase this, it might be a good idea to check out the Family Guy on television, I believe it's on one of the Cartoon channels at night sometime. The show isn't for everyone, and some people might be a bit offended by the humor.
