 I zipped over to Blockbuster to pick this one up last night. My Girlfriend and I were looking for a romantic comedy. Being the Cohen Brothers fan that I am, I quickly suggested this, since I missed it when it was in the theater. I don't know if it was the dinner or the wine, but she quickly nodded off, leaving me to catch this one on my own. I was disappointed, especially since she really like 'Fargo' and 'Oh Brother Where Art Thou?' Make no mistake, from the opening credits with 'Suspicion Minds'  overlayed, to Billy Bob Thorton in a daytime drama, this is unmistakably Coen. It has that Big Lebowski feel, a light hearted story with deeper meaning. In this case, it's the lovely interplay between George Clooney and Catherine Zeta Jones. Clooney plays a high powered divorce lawyer, while Zeta Jones plays a socialite that jumps from man to man to increase her fortune. Obviously, their paths cross. Clooney is 'fascinated' by Zeta Jones, and they eventually hook up. This movie really deals with the question of whether love is more important than money, and the nature of conquest. It's difficult to justify this being a great movie without giving too much of the plot away, but it's really worth your hour and 40 minutes. Just remember that the Coens are excellent story tellers, both as writers and with cinematography. So you get a wonderful tale with some wonderful imagery. And a cast of thousands.
