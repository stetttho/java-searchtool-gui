 What can you say about this saga? As a work of historical fiction it is fairly decent, though some of the factual evidence is in question. The translaters do a good job of pointing out inconsistencies based upon other Icelandic sagas, and overall it could be acceptable as fact and citable in research papers. If nothing else, Njal's Saga gives us valuable insight into Icelandic life during the 12th century.  This is an entertaining, if somewhat repetitive, read. There are elements of humor within Njal's Saga that will occasionally inspire a chuckle or two. Most often these are incorporated via insult shortly before an individual buries his axe in the head of another individual. In all likelihood, these weren't intended to be humorous, but reading it in the twentieth century makes it so.  This is the story of a feud between several families and the Njal family, whose proud patriarch was supposedly one of the "three best lawyers in Iceland" at the time. Essentially, his notoriety and good fortune incurs the ire of the surrounding nobles. His sons warlike attitudes further this animosity and Njal is burned alive in his home. I'm sorry if I spoiled the ending for you, but the translators actually do it in the notes, and it is a story that took place 800 years ago, if you didn't realize he was going to die by now... I wouldn't really call this a must read. If you are interested in Icelandic history, folklore, or just want to check out something different, then you should probably read it. Otherwise, you might get bored with the constant murdering then settlements at the annual Althing. I mean that's pretty much what happens each chapter.
