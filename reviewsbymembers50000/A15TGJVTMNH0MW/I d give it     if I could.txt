 Okay, So I'm about halfway through this book and though it is very, very good, I don't think it is as good as Unbearable Lightness, so I can't give it five stars.  The writing style is, of course, uniquely Kundera. It is high brow, yet matter of fact, and full of sardonic wit. This seems to be a philosophical dissertation, in which he identifies beliefs and philosophies while relating his story.  The story itself deals with Agnes, an elderly woman that is in fact a product of Kundera's (who is also a character) mind. She is born of a gesture that Kundera observed at a health club. She is actually the embodiment of immortality in this respect. In an imagined conversation between Goethe and Hemingway, Kundera hammers out immortality in the physical sense, or the legacy that we leave behind when we pass on. In creating Agnes as a character, she is an immortal legacy of a gesture. Since there are so many faces and so few gestures, one that can make a gesture that is commonplace seem original is desrving of immortality.  At least this is the impression that I have at this point in the novel.  I'd suggest this for people already familiar with Kundera. I don't really think that its a good novel if you're just getting familiar with him. Otherwise, I've enjoyed it immensely.
