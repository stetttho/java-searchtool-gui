 I have all of the studio albums that moe. has recorded, and this is undoubtedly my favorite. It seems closer to a live recording than a conceptualized studio effort, and therefore has a spontaneity you don't normally find on studio albums. Having never seen moe. live, so I am lacking that experience. But when compared to albums like wormwood or dither, this stands head and shoulders above them. The guitar work on Rububla is absolutely astounding, and moth opens with a funky little riff that you can definitely groove to. There are no real weak links in this album, no filler songs whatsoever. Check it out sometime.
