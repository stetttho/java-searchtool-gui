 Well, it might not be quite the same level as Rolling Stone, remember clout and tradition have something to do with the interviews THEY can get. The writing and reviews are a lot better... since it's British it gives quite a different spin on things and emphasizes other than the mainstream. The downside is the price...You do get a free cd, which is cool I guess.
