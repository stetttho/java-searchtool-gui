 I am 23 years old, and admittedly quite jaded with life, society, and just about everything about the good ole Earth. I got wind of this movie over New Years, and have since watched it several times, always with different people. Not one has been disappointed, so I believe that Amelie is truly a movie that appeals to everyone. For those of you that can't get past subtitles, you probably went and saw the Passion, so you should check this out too. This will contrast that so wonderfully, and probably fill you with a new zest for life.  The premise: Amelie is a single waitress that decides to pass on living for herself, and makes an attempt to affect the lives of everyone around her. You might find her meddlesome, but it is never contrived, and normally to a person's benefit. That is until she meets Nino, a pornshop clerk, who has a weird habit of collecting torn photographs from beneath photo booths, and reforming them in albums (I realize that sentence has horrid grammar, but I'm typing faster than I think). This romance is what got me. IF there is something so innocent and pure as the chase depicted here, then perhaps humanity is not all bad. At first, it might seem a tad obsessive, but when placed within the quirkiness and oddities of the characters within the movie, it seems completely normal.  I took many things from this movie. Aside from some profound discussion with my friends after seeing it, I got a newfound desire to actually give people a chance. In addition, I also got a rather insatiable appetite for Audrey Tautou, whose childlike innocence, alabaster skin, and melodic voice is something to behold. This is probably the best film made within my lifetime; not because of special effects or cinematography, but because it tells a wonderful story in a wonderful way. You should see it, it's only $4 or so.
