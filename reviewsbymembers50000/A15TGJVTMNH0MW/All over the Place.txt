 As was already stated in the 'professional review,' this is the story of how Jennifer Connolly's childhood home was repossesed for tax evasion, purchased by Ben Kingsley and tells the tale of the turmoil that would follow. It's really difficult to pinpoint which characters are the "good" and which are the "bad" in this film, and that adds to the appeal. Masterful performances are turned in by the entire cast, and from that perspective it is an exceedingly well done movie.     However, this one does drag at points, especially the beginning. While the end will tug at the heartstrings, the beginning will lull you to sleep. There is some impressive cinematography, but not worthy of so much time. The dialogue is the strongest point of this movie, and the interplay between Kingsley and Connolly, as well as Kingsley's wife and Connolly, is truly impressive. If you're into dramas, this one is worth a rental. I wouldn't buy this one, though, as I have little desire to see it a second time.
