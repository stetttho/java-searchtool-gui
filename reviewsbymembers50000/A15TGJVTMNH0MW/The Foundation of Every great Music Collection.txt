 They should issue this album at birth, with the statement, "Use this to get through the good and bad times of life" on the sleeve somewhere. This is the definitive Jazz album, and a must have for anyone considering getting into the genre. Admittedly, I'm not the biggest Jazz fan in the world, but I couldn't imagine a collection without this.  So many reviews have focused on the technical masterpiece of the album. The review by amazon lists all the artists included on this record. To the novice they mean nothing (believe me, soon enough they will), so just take my word for it, this is one of the best ensembles of MUSICIANS (not just jazz) to ever collaborate on one album. I can't picture editing being done at all to this disc, it would seem completely obvious that coltrane, davis, adderly and the rest just sat down and cut the thing in 45 minutes, and called it complete. I've raved enough, but it should be the first album you buy if you even remotely call yourself a music fan.
