 To say that this is an existential work proves that you are an intellectual half-wit and know nothing of the life of Camus or his work. This is largely biographical, until the point of the arab murder, and follows Camus's own personal conflicts with class, familial relationships, ethnic relations, and illness. This should not be read with out first at least skimming THE REBEL. That will give some insight into one of the most under appreciated intellectuals heros of the 20th century.
