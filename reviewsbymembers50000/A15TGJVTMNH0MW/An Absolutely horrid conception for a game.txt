 If you are an rpg fan, please stay away from this one. The story line is one dimensional, and does not adequately develop characters. The main character, Ryudo, is insulting to all things RPG. The script is childish, and the plot pushes you in a specific direction, rather than allow you to follow on your own. Weapons upgrades are fairly automatic, as it takes you a certain number of battles to get to a new city to buy weapons, and when you do, you can always afford them. You are always more powerful than your enemies, even the bosses, and unless the storyline demands that you die, you never do. Hence there is no challenge. Even the soundtrack is repetitive.  The only saving grace is the real-time/turn based battle system. This is a very good amalgamation of a tactical turn based/strategy driven action system, and a hack and slash real time combat system. It could rely more heavily on strategy, as counter-attacks are not determined by proximity to the target, but rather initiative, which is inane. In effect a counter attack occurs before the attack actually takes place (begging the question, How, then, is it a counter attack?). Do not buy this game, I'm very distraught that I did.
