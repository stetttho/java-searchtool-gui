 This is another Album in the vein of Miles Davis' Kind of Blue, that belongs in everyone's music collection regardless of whether they like Jazz or not. Echoing the sentiments of others, it is not the revolutionary work characteristic of Coltrane's other works, but it remains just plain cool. From the opening measures of the title track, you know that you are in for a fun, very chill ride. The album is kinda like Errol Flynn, James Dean, or even Paul Newman... cool without trying to be.
