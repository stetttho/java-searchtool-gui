 Since I am a novice in the realm of Chinese history, I felt that the abridged version of Romance of the Three Kingdoms would be a better starting point to satiate my appetite that has been whetted by various video games. I find this odd, since I've always lived by the rule of never reading abridged versions, and never buying greatest hits albums. I wouldn't say disappointment settled in, but when reading such a story of chivalry, honor, and valor, you don't want the beautiful writing to end. But then it did. Needless to say, I was left wanting.   Moss Roberts is a poet, no doubt. The language he uses in translation would make this a great work no matter what the age. Essentially, Three Kingdoms is the abridged version of about 90 years of Chinese history chronicling the fall of the Han Empire, the splintering into Three Kingdoms; Wei, Shu, and Wu; and the rise of Wei to prominence. It deals with betrayal, honor, strategy, and respect. And if you can read this, and not have Zhao Zhilong (Yun) be your favorite character, you are a better person than I. His abilities are outstanding.   This is an abridged version (4th time I've said that... Theme?) so you're getting a taste. The original work is 4 volumes and in excess of 2400 pages, this is a hair over 400, so you see what you're getting. I'm about to tackle the original, I've got to get through my Sophocles first, though, and I'll let you know how much better that is. If you're at all interested in Medieval Chinese History, consider this a jumping off point, the chocolaty exterior before the creamy filling.
