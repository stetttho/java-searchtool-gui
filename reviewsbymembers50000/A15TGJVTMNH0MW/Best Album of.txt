 There are few things that come along that always seem to be good, no matter what your frame of mind. PJ's Vs. is one of these albums. From the opening lines of 'Go' this one demands your attention. I have owned this on CD since it came out in 1993 and it has rarely left my rotation. Having seen PJ 5 times now, I also know that these songs form the backbone of a live performance that few modern bands can match.   My personal favs are 'Blood,' 'Glorified G,' and 'Rearviewmirror.' Blood is just such a good hard/funky song, it always reminds me of my first concert and subsequent Mosh pit. I saw them at what you could call the height of their popularity back in 1996, at Merriweather Post, and this was one of the last songs of the show. Watching them jam this song out, it felt like 10 minutes, just captured the spirit of live music. Call it life changing. Glorified G is just a good song man. Good song. And Rearviewmirror is a driving anthem. Tell me you won't drive faster when that was on your cd player.   The weakest link is probably 'WMA' but that is still catchy in a hypnotic sort of way. You kind of lose track of yourself listening to that one and move on to thinking about different things. This is a must have album, and if you don't have it I won't talk to you. I actually broke up with a girl because Daughter came on the radio and she couldn't identify the band. It's that good.
