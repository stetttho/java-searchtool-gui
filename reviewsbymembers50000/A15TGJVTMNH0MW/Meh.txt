 I've been anticipating seeing this since I read about it in Rolling Stone months ago. My friends further whet my appetite by touting it's good qualities, and telling me what a wonderful movie it was. Perhaps I had built my expectations to dizzying heights, perhaps it was the influence of others that placed this movie head and shoulders above anything I'd see. In my mind, it was Citizen Kane, the pinnacle of indi-film. A life changing experience.  Needless to say, I was disappointed. Incredibly so.  This is not a bad movie, but its not a particularly good movie either. Sophia Coppola's debut is littered with montages that have absolutely nothing to do with the plot, except to make this movie drag. Bill Murray is charming, as always, but something misses the mark. Perhaps its the fact the female lead (Scarlett Johansson) seems to have take acting lessons from Natalie Portman. By that, I mean all lines are delivered in a monotone, even when she's angered. The plot is almost non-existent, and there is very little in the way of astonishing sound or cinematography to salvage this one.  It does have its good points. There are some humorous interactions between Bill Murray and basically everyone. The problem is that these interactions are few and far between. Perhaps I've become entirely too jaded to buy into the melancholy of this movie, but I just found it lacking in anything resembling a human emotion.  I read somewhere that this compares to 'Harold and Maude.' I'd really suggest that you dig that one up at some point if you're considering checking 'Lost in Translation' out. It's a far superior film, without the hackneyed directing this one has.  Again, my expectations were built to dizzying heights, and I was severely let down by this movie. I don't think I'll give it a second chance though, simply because it took too long to develop. Check it out though, it's worth an hour and 40 minutes.
