 (This book is a must. I am a teacher at Universidad Nacional de Ingenieria, and this book is one of the texts I use. I recommend it everywhere. It is easy to understand and comprehensive for all levels. I mean, it is useful for the beginners and also for graduate students. Maybe it needs a spanish translation. It is unfair that for most of my students the book is hard to read because of the language). This was my last comment, oh, yeah. But it was before the fourth edition, in which I expected to see corrections of obvious mistakes found in previous editions. Take this: page 35-36, "after the arrival of the direct sound", uh uh, big mistake (who is the proofreader?), another pearl: page 34: log(0.22/1) is always a negative number! come on! The same mistakes in four editions? unacceptable. I had to correct these mistakes in my classroom to get my students on the way.
