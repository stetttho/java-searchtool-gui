 I am not a specialist in the field, but anyway, I studied this course in college. It is not intended for Electronics Engineers only, I would say that it is mainly for Industrial Engineers instead, because I found a  chapter on basics of electronics that could be a complete waste of time for  people like me. But it was fun to review the elementary topics of our  beloved career. On the other hand, this book is not as deep in the subject  as, say, Ogata, but works for someone who wants a quick review on  Industrial Control, PLCs, batch and continuous proccesses, etc. The  illustrations are very good, the book as a whole is a luxurious edition, a  proud to have and show. They use three colors for the graphics. The  chapters cover all you want to know about the subject, and are very easy to  read and understand, Nice work
