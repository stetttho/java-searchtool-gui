 Vacuum tubes technology, a must for electronics technicians and engineers only 30 years ago, has limited its action to a few applications. One of them, and for artistical reasons, is audio amplifiers. But the main application nowadays, is RF high power amplifiers. Radio and TV transmitters, for example. One single tube is able to handle the whole power driven by the final stage of the transmitter. That is sometimes an adventage for engineers. But anyway, there still are thousands of transmitters in the world that are using high power tubes. I work on one of them, and this book is the ONLY ONE, and I mean this, that has allowed me to know the deepest secrets of this technology that, of course, was never taught to me this deep in college. By the way, the historical background the author gives us is very amusing. Read the book and you will know why.
