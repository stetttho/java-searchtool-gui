 The 1992 approach of DTV in this title is now out of date. I know it is very difficult to catch up a very variable technology, but, after the Grand Alliance, we need another edition of this book, or maybe a new appendix,  featuring the new developments on Digital Television. The rest of the book  is of course, a bible on the subject. Almost every topic of TV engineering  is covered here, execept maybe for audio for television, barely bordered.  We can not even find Stereo TV or mutichannel audio for TV. They should be  approached in the upcoming edition.
