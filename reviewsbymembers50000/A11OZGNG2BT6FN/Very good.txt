 This is the book we needed for a total understanding of the Satellite Systems. Easy to read, easy to understand, from basic concepts as the Kepler Theory to up to date technologies, as digital satellite  communications. Maybe the mathcad equations should be replaced by normal  format equations, with an appendix regarding the mathcad work. Recommended  for those who want to understand thoroughly about this matter, or for a  college course on the subject. I will recommend the book to the Satellite  Systems teacher at the University I teach.
