 I finally found "THE" book to meet our needs. I am an assistant teacher at the Electronics Engineering School at Universidad Nacional de Ingenieria, Lima, Peru. For years we have been trying to find a book on which to rely on for the complete course of Television Engineering. Our choice has been made, this is the book. Despite the few differences between the second and third edition, which we celebrate, the contents of this books is a condensed coverage of all topics related to television in a modern view. Our goal is to teach our students the widest range of knowedge about television systems, starting from analog TV up to DTV, and happily, this books covers it all. My favorite chapter is the one related to CATV systems, I found a lot of material previously unknown to me, good to know, if you find that I have been in the television business for the last 10 years and I have been Technical Manager of one of the most popular stations in my country. I recommend you to buy this book, read it deeply and you will learn a lot about the most innovative technologies of the new "vision" of "Television".
