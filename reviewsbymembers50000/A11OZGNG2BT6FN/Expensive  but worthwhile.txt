 Broadcasting is, to the laity, only concerned to television systems. Of course broadcasting engineers know the truth, the broad field covered by our career could lead to the development of specialities inside our own  major as EE. All of the subjects that you need to know to transform your  career from EE to broadcast engineering are covered in this book. Even  those chapters like "Planning an Audio Production Center" are  topics that I have never found in this kind of books, very useful for the  broadcast projects engineer. There are some printers errors that should be  corrected in an errata, like "x" signs where there should be a  "+", etc, but we understand this in such a huge work. This only  book is enough for any consultation or hesitation that a broadcaster might  have about any topic related to AM, FM radio, Television, Towers, Antennas,  Satellite, DTV, etc. Nice work, and very topical.
