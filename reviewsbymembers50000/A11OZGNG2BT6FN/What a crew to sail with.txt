 Mr. Christiansen gathered a group of fine authors for this title. This book covers almost every topic you want to know about electronics. The level is, of course, advanced. It works for graduate students, or for  college teachers, like myself, who want to have a sort of vade mecum that  can not be carried in ones pocket. I will call this book, a bible. This  means, a collection of books, with different specializations by different  specialists. Mr Christiansen wrote some chapters himself. But as a final  comment, an Electronics Engineer who does not know what his/her intended  major will be, should buy this book to clearly study every branch of our  beloved career.
