 If you read the first books of Mr. Everest, this practical approach is a very useful complement. I use it as a series of examples of my courses on Acoustics. The theorical treatment of difussion is very good, and completes  what has been said about it in the Master Handbook of Acoustics. Two good  and easy to understand examples are the talk booth and the home project  studio, the latter for the difussion approach (you will learn here about  the bass trap, the skyline and the abflector, all in one chapter) and the  former for the axial modes treatment. Here, again, the Cutoff frequency  (chapter 18) is different from the one in the other books written by Mr  Everest. What is the truth?. Anyway, my collection of books on Acoustics  would not be complete without this excelent title.
