 I own a previous edition. I read it very carefully. The book is very useful, if we understand the word. I mean that if you want to build a Recording Studio, fast cheap and easy, read this book. There were serious  incongruences in the previous edition I hope to find renewed in this one.  For example, the cutoff frequency value, which in the Master Handbook of  Acoustics is set to a certain value, in this book has another value! both  books have been authored by Mr. Everest. I will try this new edition and  more comments will come up. Anyway, buy the book. If you use the  recommendations given by Mr. Everest, you will earn money.
