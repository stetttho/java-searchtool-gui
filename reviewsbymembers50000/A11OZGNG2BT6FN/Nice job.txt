 This book is very good. Its four parts are very easy to search: analog audio, digital audio, analog video and digital video. They cover all of the existing aspects. As a university teacher, I use it for my course on  Television Systems, but I think it is useful for an audio course, or a  comprehensive audio and video course. I still think that books like these  should have a spanish translation, for my students who do not read english.
