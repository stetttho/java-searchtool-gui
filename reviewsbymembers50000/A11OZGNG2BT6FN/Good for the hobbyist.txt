 The final goal of this book is to build up an analog synthesizer a very easy way. For those "do it yourself" guys who enjoy and triumph over themselves by constructing everything and take pictures of them beside  the appliance, it is ok. But it will also be useful for those audio fans  who would like to understand the principles of analog synthesis, being the  basis of the understanding of the appications of DSP for audio. Good for  the hobbyist and for the Electronics Engineer too
