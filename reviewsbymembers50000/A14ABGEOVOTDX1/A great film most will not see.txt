 I've been waiting on Manic since it was in production, so I've had a long wait. I must say it was worth it. I really have no complaints about the film; the acting was great, especially from Joseph Gordon-Levitt- who really proves what a good actor he is, Don Cheadle, and Zooey Deschanel. The story seems very accurate, haunting, and at times heartbreaking, as it paints a very realistic picture of teens with problems. There's no fluff here. Direction was great. Jordan Melamed's debut proved to be a good one- and I look forward to more by this unknown director.
