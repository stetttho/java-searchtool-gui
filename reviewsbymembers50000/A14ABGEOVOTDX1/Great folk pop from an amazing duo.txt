 John & Mary's first album is a little taste of the wonderful music the duo is capable of writing and performing. Ramsey's haunting vocals, as well as Lombardo's classic-style of songwriting gives the listener one heck of a treat. Found on this album are two lead vocal performances by Lombardo, something he doesn't do nearly enough.
