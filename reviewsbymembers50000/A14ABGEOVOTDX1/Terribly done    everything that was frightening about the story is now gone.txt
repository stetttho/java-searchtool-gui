 I'm not a fan of remaking films- there have been a few decent remakes- but for the most part, the magic of the original is lost. This time is no exception.  For months, I've been hearing and reading about how this remake wasn't a "remake" at all, but was going to follow the story of the book, rather than the first movie. Boy, was that a lie. Not only did many of the things in this version come from the first (including dialogue which was hardly changed), there were new story lines, new fiction that we'd never read or seen before. If this was supposed to accurately follow the book, I must have read a different book.  There was nothing frightening about this film at all. The creepiness of the original ghost story is no longer there. This time, we have more of a monster/zombie-type flick that isn't the slightest bit jump-worthy.  If you were a fan of the original or the book, don't see this. It'll upset you and make you wish for your time and money back. If you've never seen the original or haven't read the book, do yourself a favor and do one of those two things and forget about seeing this waste of time.  Definitely one of the worst movies I have seen in a LONG time. Even if this wasn't an Amityville remake, there's no way it'd stand up to any of the decent horror films out there.
