 Clare Fader has mastered bringing cabaret back to life. Her debut album contains some great songs and shows promise for the future (her future would produce an even better album a little while later).  1. Animal Charm - quirky, catchy, and fun... a sing-a-long type of song. A  2. Sister Of Mine - another catchy song. B+  3. The Wine - fun, quirky, and catchy... this song was featured on MTV's The Real World for a reason. I dare you not to sing along. A+  4. Love is the Cruelest Cliche - a slower song with strings, oboe, and piano backing Ms. Fader. B  5. Drunk on Skin - great lyrics, great music, Clare's done it again. A-  6. Wedding Day Lament - a slower, storylike song that'd fit perfectly into a musical. B  7. Alice - my least favorite Clare fader song... it's slow and not overly catchy... doesn't seem to fit well on the album, in my opinion- but I'm glad it's here, because it's something else from Ms. Fader. C  8. Johnny - the album picks back up in pace with this one... a great sing-along. A  9. Cabin Fever - another one I can't help but singing along to. How does she do it? Great lyrics. A-  10. Queen - a slow-down point again... but not necessarily bad. Another song that'd fit well into a musical. B  11. Isle of Summer - the climax of the musical that is the album. Wonderful way to close the album. A
