 This movie should not be listed as a comedy, as it's far more a drama. The good: Definitely memorable for it's creepiness, and reality that something like this can and probably has happened. The bad: it doesn't work as a documentary style film, as Best in Show or Waiting For Guffman later did. The ugly: poor acting by many members of the supporting cast. The poor acting makes it even less believable as a documentary, because nobody in "real life" acts the way some of these characters do. At times it seems that the actors are amateurs practicing the scenes for the first time. 5/10
