 Barely, I say, because three songs DO stand out as fine performances: her rendition of the 10,000 Maniacs song "Gun Shy," a nice performance of "Seven Years," and a fantastic cover of "Gulf of Araby." Unfortunately, between the three mentioned tracks is listless filler, songs that were slowed down from their orignal album-slowness.  This isn't the Natalie Merchant of the 80s or early 90s. Seems she's aged twenty-five years since then, as the performance aspect of her show is gone, and replaced by sleep-inducing nothingness.
