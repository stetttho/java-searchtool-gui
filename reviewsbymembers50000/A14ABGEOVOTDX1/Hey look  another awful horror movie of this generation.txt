 One word describes this movie: pointless.  I love horror films, but this certainly isn't a horror film, it's bad acting and lots of special effects-- and the special effects are what brought people in. If you're stupid enough to be scared by special effects then see this film. If you're a fan of what you don't see is scarry, see The Changeling.
