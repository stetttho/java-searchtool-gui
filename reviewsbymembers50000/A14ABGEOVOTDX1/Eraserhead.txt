 **may contain spoliers**  Eraserhead is a movie like none I have seen. It did remind me somewhat of Pi, however. Eraserhead is another cult classic that has a following. However, I found it at times painful to watch (though possibly because I started coming down with the flu while watching it). I have never seen another David Lynch film, as none of them seemed very interesting to me, and after seeing Eraserhead, I doubt I will in the future.  Though I didn't care for the film, I appreciate it for its originality. The actions of the characters are classic and unforgettable, as is the film. Henry, the main character, is the first of many oddballs we see in the film, as he seems to walk around in a daze, or in his own little world. I think my favorite part was the old lady being maneuvered to toss the salad, and then having a cigarette lit for her. I did find it quite annoying (though I'm sure that was Lynch's purpose) when the baby (if that's what you want to call it) is crying and making noises for quite some time while Henry and Mary are trying to sleep.  I'm not sure what Lynch meant to show in this film, other than its oddness and absurdity. It basically has a no plot, or one that you can follow for any length of time. It has little dialogue, very odd characters that appear and disappear without explanation, and dream sequences that make no sense and go nowhere.  I think David Lynch appeals to the cult audience for his humor, which is evident in Eraserhead. It's twisted and almost sick at times. He makes films that he wants to make, not something the mainstream would praise him for, and I respect him for that. Obviously Eraserhead wasn't intended to be seen by the same type of people that would go see Wizard of Oz or Titanic. It was intended for the underground folks who like things to be edgy and not quite make sense, which he achieved with this film.  "A"  for originality, but I'd never sit through it again.
