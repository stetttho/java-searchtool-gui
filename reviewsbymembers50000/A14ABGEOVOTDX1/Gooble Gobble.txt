 Tod Browning's Freaks is one of those movies that you never forget. It is a classic cult film, as its subject matter (circus freaks) could be seen as controversial, and the mainstream audience surely wouldn't find it to be entertaining. This film, like the earlier ones we saw in class, does not shoot for the mainstream, but goes along with a vision the director and the writers saw.  Even though this film is considered to be one of the best ever made, the mainstream audience wouldn't accept it, and I love it. I think that it was not accepted at the time because of people's extremely tight morals and religious beliefs. In today's world, where people have come to their senses and have begun to enjoy life, the movie is quite tame (though still disturbing to see the many deformities of nature). I agree that it is one of the best films ever made, or at least that I have seen. It is extremely memorable. For the past week, I haven't been able to get the song out of my head ("Gooble gobble, gooble gobble, we accept her, we accept her. Gooble gobble, gooble gobble one of us, one of us.")
