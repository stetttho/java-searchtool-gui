 The Earth Pressed Flat is a collection of songs that brought 10,000 Maniacs back to their early days. Unfortunately, with no major label support, and changing tastes in music, the album was overshadowed and buried. Several gems can be found on the CD, including "Hidden in My Heart," "Ellen," "Smallest Step," and the should-have-been-a-single "Once a City." Don't pass this one up; it's a wonderful way to end the recording period of an amazing band.
