 To add to my collection, I bought the latest Bond DVD, got home, and popped the sucker into the DVD player... only to have to stop it 45 minutes into it (I finished it a few days later). The first half hour is pure trash, and only gets slightly better.  My major complaints are as follows: *What's the deal with the first half hour??? *the "blue screen" shots were done better in the early films; they are so incredibly noticeable in this film. *Diamond-face-man... come on; poor villian and poor makeup job. *The special effects are not up to par with what could have been done. Some of the explosions are good, but other things are just too cheesy looking. *TOO unrealistic, even for a Bond film. Bond would have been dead ten times over... after awhile, I was actually hoping he'd die, just to give me some satisfaction.  I didn't care about the characters (including Bond), the one-liners (they were extra bad in this one- not even funny the way they're supposed to be), and the story was poor.  In my opinion, this is the worst film in the James Bond video library. 3/10
