 It's no accident that the band titled the album "Love Among the Ruins," as replacing a lead singer is not always an easy task, especially after two of the band's highest selling albums. However, Mary Ramsey stepped in and far exceeded expectations. The band's cover of "More Than This" was the highest selling single in their career, as well as in the catalog of Geffen, and the opening track "Rainy Day" is agruably one of the best songs the band has ever written. It's a shame that the band was overshadowed by their former lead singer, as this album proves the talent remained in the band.
