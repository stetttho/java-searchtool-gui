 ...then then movie isn't bad. However, anyone with any sense of reality would have problems doing so.  Forget everything you've been taught about life- this movie doesn't follow those rules. Instead, it expects the audience to dumb-it-down and just buy into every error there is.  Other than all of the impossibles this movie presents, it's a mildly good thriller. However, all of the "errors" lowered it big time for me. 4/10
