 Since the first time I saw this film when I was 6, I've been trying to find a haunted house film to top this. I still get chills in certain scenes (not going to spoil it for anyone) 20 years later. They don't make 'em like this anymore, only wish they did. Until they do, nothing will beat this one in the haunted house genre for me (and I've seen a bunch).
