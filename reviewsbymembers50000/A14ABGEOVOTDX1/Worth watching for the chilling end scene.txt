 I sat through this movie simply because it was a Kubrick film. For the first fifty or so minutes, I was a bit bored, even though I saw some early Kubrick shots that would later make him the famous director he turned out to be. However, the ending scene is an early example of Kubrick's way of "creeping" the audience out, and was done quite well.
