 Of the three John & Mary albums, this one is my favorite. From the opening track "Two Worlds Parted," we're treated with the lovely vocals of one of the most underrated singers of all time (Mary Ramsey), as well as the brilliant songwriting of John Lombardo. With some amazing guest appearances, as well as thee wonderful covers, this album is perfect.
