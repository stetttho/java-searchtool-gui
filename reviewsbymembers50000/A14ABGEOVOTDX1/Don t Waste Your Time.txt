 *** This comment may contain spoilers ***  Spoilers may follow!!  This movie gets worse as it goes on... not that it starts great, but... Anyway, instead of relying upon real creepiness, they've chosen to use sound to make you jump (didn't work once for me), whether it be a slight burst of music or thunderclap, it gets to the point where you can expect it and predict it before it happens. They've also chosen to borrow a scene from The Shining (mother with a knife in the bathroom with young son, while crazed father is trying to break down the door).
