 The film really isn't a bad film- sure it starts off on a bad note, but it does pick up. It is true that the best part about the film is Joseph Gordon-Levitt-- even in his younger days he was still a very believable actor. At first when I heard his accent, I was thinking "Oh no...," but when he's actually on camera for his longer scenes, you suddenly forget that he's as American as anyone, and has no real accent.  Without a doubt, this is a shining moment of young Gordon-Levitt's career (for later standouts, see Forever Lulu, aka Along for the Ride, Sweet Jane, and Manic). Too bad the movie wasn't a little bit better (but it's really not bad).
