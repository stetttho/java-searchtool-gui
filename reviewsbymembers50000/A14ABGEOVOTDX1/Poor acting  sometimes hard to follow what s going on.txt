 Stephen King wrote a good story that was ruined by poor acting. This was really not one of his better mini series for the following reasons: 1) as stated before, poor acting-- nobody is believable except King himself in his cameo 2) terrible special effects-- sure it was a made for TV movie, but come on... 3) story was hard to follow at times, and character's actions were unbelievable... I thought (without spoiling anything) "Why are they doing this when there's that other VERY IMPORTANT thing that they should be concentrating on?"  Good idea for a story that didn't quite turn out. 4/10
