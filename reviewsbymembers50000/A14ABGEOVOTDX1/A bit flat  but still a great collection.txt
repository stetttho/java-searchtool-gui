 I remember watching the original shortened broadcast of MTV Unplugged on TV before the album was released, and my first thought was that Natalie Merchant sounded tired during this performance. It's understandable, as the Maniacs were playing many dates in late '92 and early '93, but her last album with the Maniacs is also probably the worst. However, worse doesn't always mean "bad." This is a nice reworking of some of their back catalog, as well as the surprise hit, a cover of "Because the Night," that was worn out by excessive radio play.
