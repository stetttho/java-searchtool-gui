 This film is not overly scarry by any means, but it's a well acted, well written film that never goes over the top. It is certainly one of the better haunted house flicks made (though none can top The Changeling). I only wish Hollywood would stop putting out the trash horror films they continuously spew out and would watch some of the classics and get back to basics.
