 I searched and searched for this movie for years and finally found it. What once scared the crap out of me made me laugh. The acting is terrible, for one, and the film itself is very dated. It does have a good basis for a story, but it simply doesn't hold to the test of time. If you saw this one when you were younger, just remember it. Don't try to find it and ruin what you remember.
