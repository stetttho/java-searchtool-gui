 This has turned out to be one of my favorite films of all time. Every single main character is memorable, as well are the supporting characters. I am a Michael Douglas fan, and I believe that this is his best role. I could not imagine anyone else playing Grady Tripp; same goes for Tobey Maguire as James Leer. Robert Downey, Jr. IS Crabtree. Much of the humor is subtle and not overly obvious, not is it humorous to the characters in the situation. This is one of the types of films that has it all: great characters, great story, great acting, great cinematography, great directing, and great music (which, by the way, fits in perfectly with each scene-- look at the scenes specifically with the Neil Young and Leonard Cohen songs). This is definitely one of the best films that's come out of the past decade, and I'm sure it'll remain a favorite for years.
