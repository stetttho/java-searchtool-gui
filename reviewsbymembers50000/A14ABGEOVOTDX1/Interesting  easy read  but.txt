 ... is missing a punch. Warning: may contain a few spoilers. The book itself tells a good story: it's interesting, flows easily, and you feel for the characters. But there're a few things that bothered me about the book. Included are a few photographs of items the family found, yet were not supernatural in any way. The author tells us of a photo she took that contains the face of a ghost, yet it's not presented in the book. Something I had a hard time believing was the almost immediate growth of a tree, from sapling to full size, as well as a rosebush that appeared almost overnight. This like these would have really attracted attention from neighbors, and would have most likely brought local news crews to the scene to see the miracles. Yet, other than the neighbor asking if they could prune the tree, it went basically unnoticed. Good story, but not completely believable, even if you believe in the supernatural.
