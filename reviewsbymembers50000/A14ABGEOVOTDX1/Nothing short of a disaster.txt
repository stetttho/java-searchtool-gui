 There's very little about this album that's worth listening to, which is unfortunate. Natalie Merchant used to be my favorite singer, but the way her musical career has gone has dropped her out of that list completely. The good: "This House is On Fire" - a catchy, funky, almost-reggae, tune that opens the album. It's the only thing worth listening to. The bad: everything else, besides "Henry Darger," which comes in the next category. In this category, we have Natalie attempting (and failing at) blues; we have a rehash of "Kind & Generous" in the first single "Just Can't Last" (which is the catchiest song on the album), and a bunch of songs that start at finish without going anywhere. The ugly: "Henry Darger" - an absolutely awful song. She strains her vocals SO much, it hurts to listen to. I honestly wonder what she was thinking when she released it as it was, as it's an unlistenable song. This is by far the worst album Ms. Merchant has ever been apart of to date. Thankfully, the only place to go from here is up.
