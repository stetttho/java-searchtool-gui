 Though this album has a few catchy songs on it, the pacing and overall flow is nothing to get excited about. A far cry from the upbeat tunes of 10,000 Maniacs, Natalie opts to kick it down a notch (or ten) from her last album (Tigerlily), which was slow itself. Slow music is not bad, but it begings to drag and blend together after awhile, making very few of the songs on this collection memorable.
