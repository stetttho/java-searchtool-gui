 Maniac seems to be a type of propaganda film detailing the dangers of mental disorders. I don't think that this film was made strictly as a propaganda film, but I believe that some extremely sheltered people probably took it seriously. The several scenes of nudity surely shocked the church-going religious freaks of the 1930's, who in turn probably urged their children to stay away from crazy people. It is possible that the film was made as an exploitation endeavor, as it had nudity (though non-sexual) and violence, which was extremely risky and nearly unseen in those days.
