 After leaving the band that made her famous, Natalie Merchant opted to go for a lighter, different sound, which sometimes worked, but more often than not, slowed down the pace of the album. Songs like "Carnival," "Jealousy," and "Seven Years," are the closest you'll get to her days with 10,000 Maniacs, and that's still not very close. The overplayed single "Wonder" is the peppiest of the songs on the album, which does get slow and seems to drag at points, but overall, this is not a bad album; but it's not great, either.
