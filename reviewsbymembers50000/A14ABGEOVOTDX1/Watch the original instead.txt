 Being a fan of the haunted house genre, when I first saw the teaser trailer in the theater, I was extremely excited. That excitement didn't last long. This movie was a ridiculous remake of one of the classic haunted house films, and I'd never recommend this. Special effects are not scarry. What you don't see but know is there is what will make people remember the story and come back time and time again. Rent or buy the original instead, it's much creepier.
