 I admit to owning Clay's debut album, Measure of A Man. I thought it was very good, and I was anxious to hear his Christmas CD.  Now, having said that, I have to also admit my apprehension over the fact that I was afraid Clay's Christmas CD would be a pop christmas  cd that so many artists put out, and I just hate those. I like my Christmas CD's to stand the test of time - meaning, I can play them year after year, and that it's a cd that all different age groups can enjoy.  Well, the latter is what Clay delivered. It's a timeless, CLASSY cd which I look forward to playing for my entire family at Christmas because I know it will be enjoyed by all. I can't say that for 99% of pop artists Christmas CD's. Hope this review helps!
