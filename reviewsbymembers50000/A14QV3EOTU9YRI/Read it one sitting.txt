 It was a great book. I don't want to say too much because I know there are die hard fans out there who haven't finished the book yet. It is the most "adult" book yet - with a little romance thrown in for flare. We learn about Harry and Voldemort's past which is nice, and as dark as past books have been. Harry seems to have matured a lot in this book. Hope this review helps!
