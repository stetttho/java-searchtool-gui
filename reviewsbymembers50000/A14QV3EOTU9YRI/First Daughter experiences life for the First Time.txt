 This was your run of the mill coming-of-age story where little girl grows up and finds out what it means to be her, and who she is. Except this little girl is the first daughter and is experiencing everything for the first time from falling in love to playing the arcade games at the carnival, to living with a college room mate. Everything isn't as it seems for Sam (Katie Holmes) and with her new found freedom comes a couple mokey wrenches along the way. Marc Blucas as James, Sam's love interest was right on, and Mia's character was good as well even if a little over the top when it regards reality. Overall, a good movie for romantics, and all young girls! Fantastic soundtrack as well, and great dancing scenes too!
