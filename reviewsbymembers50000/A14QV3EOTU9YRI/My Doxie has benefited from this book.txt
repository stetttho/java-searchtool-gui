 I can honestly say that my doxie  has benefited from my buying this book. Growing up I only ever had big dogs (Germand Shepards and Mastiffs) so having a little hound who is prone to back problems was/is a learning experience for me! This book helped me with where to find specific resources on Dachshunds, how to prevent potential back disk problems (VERY important) and helped me to understand WHY they have these problems. Also, it gave indispensable insight into the attitude of a doxie - stubborn! but they end up "Owning" you! Great beginner book for new Doxie owners such as myself!
