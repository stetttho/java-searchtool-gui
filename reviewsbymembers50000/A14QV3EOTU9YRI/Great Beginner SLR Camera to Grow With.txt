 I bought this camera a year ago as my starter camera to learn about film photography. I really didn't know anything about photography when I purchased it, and I still have A LOT to learn, however, I feel as though it's a camera that can grow with me. It has automatic presets that make taking photos for a novice handy - not much thought required, but also allows you to set manual settings so you can experiment and learn.   Another review mentioned the body being cheap. I disagree. The body seems fine to me, and to be quite honest, a camera is not something that you should be rough with. Set it down gently and handle it properly as to avoid ruining the lens or some component within the camera.   The pictures have been fantastic. I highly recommend this camera for someone who is starting out and wants to learn more. It will grow with you. Enjoy!
