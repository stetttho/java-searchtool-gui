 I am not a magazine reader at all. Adventure is the only magazine I have a subscription to (going on my 3rd year). It has great photography, travel journals, spotlights on different place to visit (i.e. South Africa). It also is fantastic if you are an avid outdoorsman/woman. The cover a lot camping, rafting, kayaking, etc. Well written, informative, great pictures. Always finding new places to write about. Good read every month - and CHEAP!
