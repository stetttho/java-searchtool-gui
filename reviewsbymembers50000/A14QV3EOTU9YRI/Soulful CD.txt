 Scott Krippayne I first heard on the radio singing a live version of a song on this album called the "Coffee Song." It's a hysterical song that all coffee lovers would get a kick out of, and at that point I had no idea he was a Christian artist. Anyhow, I wanted his cd based on that song just because it was funny, and when I listened to his other songs, I was dually impressed. He has a really pretty voice (not the most imaginative descriptive word but accurate) and he uses a lot of piano in his music. His songs are a mix of fast and slow, and it makes for a great album. I highly recommend it!
