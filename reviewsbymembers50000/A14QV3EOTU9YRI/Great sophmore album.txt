 I love this CD! I like it better than their first album which I own. There are some really pretty songs on the cd "God Blessed the Broken Road" and songs that I found myself personally relating to about where I am in life.   Both upbeat and slow songs are on this album - and overall a great performance. A good mix for sure. You should definately at least check out the cd! Hope this review helps!
