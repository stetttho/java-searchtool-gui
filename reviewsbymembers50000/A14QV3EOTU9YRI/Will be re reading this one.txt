 I bought this book because it was the choice of the month for a book club I recently joined. I don't think I would have picked it up otherwise, but I am really glad I did!   It's a really thought provoking book with complex moral issues that surround slavery and the people entwined in it. There are a lot of layers, and depth of meaning. The characters are well developed, and I for one, think this is a book that you will read again and again.  At first it was hard to keep all the characters straight but in the back of the book there is a list of who is who. It also jumps around from the Master's childhood to his adulthood and in between, but it clicks before long. Definately recommend!
