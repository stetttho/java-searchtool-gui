 I've had this CD since it first came out, and I was suprised to find that I hadn't written a review for it. It's a pop CD which I don't normally listen to that genre anymore but I make an exception for Clay. (I am usually more country/accoustic rock folk if that helps to give you a better idea of where I am coming from.) Clay has an amazing voice and that is shown on this album. A couple songs have lyrics that are kinda cheezy, but so does every other pop album out there. Having said that, I truly love every song on the album, and I haven't gotten tired of listening to it 2 years or so later. That's the part that I really want to stress - I can listen to every song, love them, and not be sick of it. There aren't many albums out there that you can say that about. Hope that helps!
