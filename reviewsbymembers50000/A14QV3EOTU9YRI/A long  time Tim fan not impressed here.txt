 I am giving this album by Tim 3 stars. I consider that a terrible rating. Normally, I would give him 5 because I love him, and think he's a great artist, but this album left me really disappointed. I loved "Lived Like You Were Dying" and enjoyed "My Old Friend" and the upbeat "Everyone Hates Me" but other than that, there's nothing on this CD I care to listen to. It has more of a rock feel to it than country which is fine that he is trying to branch out (and it seems that way on his past couple albums as well) but on this album it's not working for me. I really feel terrible saying that, but this wouldn't be an honest review if I didn't.   If you're a new fan of Tim, stick  with his earlier albums such as "Set This Cicus Down," "Place in the Sun" or "Everywhere." They are all fantastic. Hope this review helps!
