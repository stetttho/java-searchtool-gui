 Christopher Jak's Album "Applause of the Rain" is simply fantastic! He has a smooth melodic voice coupled with great rifts and varied tempos you find yourself listening to this album over and over. I found myself almost internalizing it if you will - finding myself humming it in the middle of different moments of the day. Think Bebo Norman meets John Mayer and that's kind of how you might describe him. Enjoy!
