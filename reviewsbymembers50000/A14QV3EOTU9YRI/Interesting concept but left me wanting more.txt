 I picked up this book because I thought the concept was interesting, and after reading the first chapter I was hooked, and decided to buy it. I liked the setting of the book - late 1800's in San Francisco, but after finishing the book, I was disappointed with the ending. I felt like I was left with a lot of questions that could have been answered in a simple epilogue of sorts. But overall, it was a different read, and I'm glad that I read something out of my normal genres. Hope that  helps!
