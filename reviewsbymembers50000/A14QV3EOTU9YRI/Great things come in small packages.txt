 I bought this camera just over a week ago, and am dually impressed. I apologize in advance- it's my first digital camera I've owned or dealt with so I can't compare to any others out there.  That said, here's a break down of the pros and cons:  Pros: small, pocket size. Lithium battery is fully recharged in 90 minutes. Lasts for a couple hours on full battery charge which I think is a lot. It has a 2 inch LCD display which is great if you don't have the best vision in the world (I don't). It also is fairly simple to figure out how to use - just pick up the camera and after fiddling for 5 minutes, you've pretty much got a thorough understanding on how to work it. It also has a nice zoom feature and comes with great software. Oh, and it's ability to pick up small detail is amazing!   Cons: Doesn't come with a camera bag. The camera itself is made out of metal but there is a cheap plastic cover where the usb cable goes and also where the auxillary cables plug into that I am fairly sure if I am not super careful might  break in time. The pictures also have a lot of red eye but it's my understanding that is common with digital cameras so maybe that's not such a big deal.   Overall: highly recommend this snazzy little camera! It's great for a beginner such as myself!
