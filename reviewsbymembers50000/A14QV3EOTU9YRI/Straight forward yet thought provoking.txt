 "How to get a date worth keeping" was an excellent book. It challenged me to look at motives behind dating, expected outcomes and to be prepared to accept ownership for my participation (or lack thereof). It used everyday common excuses as a precursor to elaborate on the real issue(s) that people are in the dark about.   I liked the fact that it made me consider dating in a totally different aspect than I have in the past. I also liked how "real" the author came across. No psychology mumbo jumbo just everyday common language that drove home the point and left me relating to the book.  I think if you're open to "stretching" yourself and growing as a person and incorporating dating into your life, than this might be a book that will help you.  A couple side notes. The author is Christian, so his book places heavy emphasis on making sure your spiritual side is examined just as is your physical and emotional. However, the aspect I liked best about the book is he advocated common sense to pitfalls or ruts that people fall into, and I for one will be making my roommate from college read this book because there were so many parts of the book that screamed her.   So I hope that helps! Enjoy!
