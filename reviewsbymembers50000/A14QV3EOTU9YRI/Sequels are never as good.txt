 At least that's what most people say, and I'd have to say that motto rings true with "Meet the Fockers." I wouldn't place blame on the actors - they all did a great job. I loved Barbara Streisand as a sex therapist - her casual nature in the film was a great contrast for the Byrnes parents.   The problem with the movie  lied  in the fact that it was somewhat contrived after seeing the first one. The lines weren't as good, and overall not as funny despite the all star cast. Hope this review helps.
