 What a fun, fantastically fresh cd! I have one of Harry's first albums which I love, but this has got old standards that everyone knows with a new twist. The arrangements on all the pieces are really, really great. Very different, very... fresh! Highly recommended for the big kid at heart - I am not sure younger children would know some of the songs on here (i.e. You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile).   I really love this cd! If you like Jazz, harry and old showtunes, put it all together and you've got the perfect cd!  Hope this helps!
