 Great book! Thought provoking questions that sometimes leave me not knowing what I'd answer! I leave it on my coffee table, and it usually gets picked up when friends come over, and has led to some pretty interesting discussions!  Sample questions: If you could fly a hot air balloon over any city in the world, what would you choose?  Which of the seven dwards personifies you best?  If you could create a new Hollywood monster, what would it look like and what would it do?  Happy conversing!
