 I have this LG phone for a year now, and I have a lot to say about it.   The Pros: Good reception. Easy to hold (not to small like some cell phones are) and has a little bit more weight to it (which I prefer).   The Cons: 2 phones later and they both have a short battery life. They both also shut off in the middle  of a conversation ALL the time. The phone will power off for no apparent reason, and it will do so if you go to answer it and pick it up the wrong way. The battery doesn't seem to stay charged for as long as I'd like.   About the Camera: I think it's crap, but it's a cell phone, in my personal opinion, it's not meant to be taking award winning pictures. So neither a pro or a con, just what I'd expect from a camera on a cell phone.   Overall: For all the hassle I have with it shutting down all the time, I wouldn't recommend it.
