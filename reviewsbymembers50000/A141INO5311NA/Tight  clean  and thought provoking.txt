 I imagine everybody knows what "Memento" is about by now, so I will be brief: Leonard, who can't make new memories due to a brain trauma, is on the trail of his wife's killer. The movie is told in a series of two tales: One, working backward, is the "current" storyline, filmed in color, told in 10-minute increments that jump backward. The second, filmed in b/w, which takes place well before the "current" storyline, is interspersed between each "current" segment, and it runs forward. At the end, both storylines meet. It's brilliant. The characters are fascinating, with constant surprises (who CAN you trust, the movie asks). There's a delicious sense of disorientation caused by the backward movement, because we don't know any more than Leonard does how he got into each new situation. We, the audience, also see that Leonard trusts his intuition and his skills more than he should (he thinks he's a great read of character, but he makes several very key misjudgments; he thinks he's terribly organized, but he doesn't have photos of nearly everybody he should, and he doesn't even carry a pen in one crisis situation to write something down before it's lost), things that are revealed slowly through the backward takes. In the end, the movie is an expose of how unreliable memory is. Leonard's own memories of his pre-trauma days are not reliable, but his belief in them is crucial to his well-being. Even when told a very plausible story of what *really* happened, at the end, the audience realizes, with a pang of loss, that this is the beginning of the "current" storyline and that Leonard will go the rest of the storyline not remembering what he has gone to so much trouble to discover.
