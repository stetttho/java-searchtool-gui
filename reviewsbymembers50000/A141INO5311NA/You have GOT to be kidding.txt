 I hate to disillusion Kay Hooper's big fans, but I personally felt the book was far from satisfactory. This is the first book of hers I've ever read. I actually liked the premise of this book and spent all morning reading it when I really should have been sleeping. Then I hit the bits about reincarnation, karmic debt, and who the bad guy is/was and went "Oh god, tell me she's joking." She wasn't. A beautifully woven plot, a sympathetic and believable heroine, and a fascinating premise got shot down in flames with the worst ending I have ever seen in a thriller. The bad guy here makes about as much sense as the bad guy in the movie "Urban Legend", and for about the same reasons. That was hideously disappointing and cliched. Does Kay Hooper not watch horror movies? Does she seriously think that all bad guys must be seen in the book at least once and that you can just pin "bad guy" on any schmoe interchangably? I mean, it could just as easily have been the guy at the library, the bum, or some total stranger who bumped into someone on the street, with the same motivations and justifications. That was TERRIBLE. That was the worst of it, but there was a lot of other stuff I really hated about the last 50 pages or so of the book. The heroine does something so harebrained at the end that I lost all suspension of disbelief right there. The "kosmik karma" aspect was bad enough, but the explanation of just *why* the heroine is doing what she's doing was absolutely lame, not to mention insane. Loved the buildup, hated the actual ending. Cassidy
