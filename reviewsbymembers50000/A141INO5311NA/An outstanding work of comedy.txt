 I love this book! I re-read it every year or so. I've never seen such a giddy-paced or tight comedy. Every so often, just to show you they can, the authors throw in a zinger (as in their discussion of how old the Earth is, a dry essay which ends with "This also proves that the Earth is a Libra"). The writing is for the most part easy to follow with careful reading, with an interesting assortment of characters. The book is a fast read, which isn't so great because at the end, I wanted WAY more. The religious theories espoused here won't deeply offend anybody, I don't think (they're pretty absurd, on the whole), but they *will* make one think. I was Pentecostal when I first found "Good Omens", and while I cannot claim it is wholly responsible for my unconversion, it gave me quite a bit of food for thought. I really couldn't find any holes in their logic. They start with a fairly tight premise and roll on from there. There are neat little touches that make perfect sense (like demons having the same wings angels have, "except better groomed").  I do hope these authors collaborate again, if not on "Good Omens" related works then somewhere. They're clearly a force to be reckoned with.
