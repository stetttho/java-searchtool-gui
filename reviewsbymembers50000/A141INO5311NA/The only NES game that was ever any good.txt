 I grew up when the Atari was the machine to have, so I largely missed out on the entire beginning of the Nintendo craze till the SNES came out, at which point my mother (who was and still is a total console-game freak) gave me her 8-bit Nintendo and all her old games. She had about 40 games, all the old favorites like Zelda, but none of them caught my attention till I tried Final Fantasy. It is a rich, multi-layered game that's extremely straightforward. There are few puzzles (I hate them, so that's good), few mazes, and few trials that are overly difficult. It's a straight hack-and-slash game -- go kill things, go through this new level and kill things there, get objects, find the big bad guy and kill him too at the end. Basically, if you're persistent, you'll figure it all out. And there's none of that irritating "ensemble cast" design that the later FFs seem to like. As simple as the game design is, it still manages to tell a rich and involving story that actually, considering this is a Japanese game, makes sense. It took me a month or so to beat the game, and I immediately made another party and set out again at level 1, it's so good. Since then, my mother's given me her SNES too, and I think some other system that involves CDs, but I still play Final Fantasy almost exclusively and still love it. If you actually manage to find this game, and you're a puzzle-hater like me, then I think you'll like it.
