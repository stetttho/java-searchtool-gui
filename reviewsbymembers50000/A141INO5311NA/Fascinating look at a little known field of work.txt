 Details a number of case studies from the files of a professional cat behaviorist. If you ever wondered what it'd be like to counsel cats and their owners, here you are. I didn't get the impression that the book was trying to be a serious treatise on cat-box behavior or spraying or whatever, though each vignette includes treatment plans and information about what was going on in that case. For in-depth treatment of issues like cat-box behavior and spraying, I'd recommend one of the author's other books, "Think Like a Cat". The treatment plans here are interesting to read, giving much insight on how one goes about changing an animal's behavior. And what cat owner doesn't love reading about odd cats? We got lots of them here, and sometimes the owners are just as odd. Honestly, I love reading these frequently amusing, sometimes very touching stories. "Psycho Kitty" contains vignettes of what a day of a cat-behaviorist's life is like. I found the book absolutely fascinating, sometimes humorous, sometimes very touching.
