 How do you rate something like this? Wendy Pini has an exquisite sense of pacing, a master's command of the English language, and a grand story to tell. Without hesitation I would recommend any of her works. This is the first book in the series. Told in text form, it stands easily on its own -- people who don't have or want the graphic art series won't miss anything here. It tells the story of a band of elves who are persecuted out of their home and must find a new one before they die in the desert. Along the way they encounter a new band of elves, hostile trolls, and some even more hostile humans. Sure, they're elves and they're cute, but these elves have courage, heart, and compassion -- they are as accessible and understandable as we are, metaphors for what we wish we could be. Unlike many novelizations of graphic art, this book is accessible to newcomers and doesn't leave out important things. It expands some parts of the graphic art series, adding details like background, private thoughts, and extra interactions.
