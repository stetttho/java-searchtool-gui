 The Children of God, one of the more bizarre semi-Christian cults out there, makes for some of the most interesting reading in comparative religions. This autobiography details one woman's descent into one of the cult's weirder periods. There is much here for students of cultism and religion -- the man who headed the religion sounds like a complete fruitcake, so half the "fun" is figuring out what possible appeal his philosophies could have for anybody remotely normal. Miriam tries to answer that question, and I think she did a good job of it. Miriam's story is filled with regret and apologies for her involvement, but it is honest. I about cheered for her when she finally stood up for herself and her family and said "I'm out of here!" She joined as a high schooler and was in the cult for 15 years. Though only a few years of that were spent as an official prostitute, the entire story reads as one long journey of sexual repression at the hands of a group that seems more obsessed with deviance the further along it gets (something else she addresses quite well). Sadly, at its end, Miriam herself is a damaged-but-recovering soul, frayed around the edges as so many ex-cultists are regardless of what cult they've left, and uncertain how to approach religion. This, too, is good information. I think this book would be worthwhile for any student of religion or anybody interested in cults. I don't think it would be appropriate for underage readers, but it's safe reading for those who get ruffled easily. There's nothing too graphic in it.
