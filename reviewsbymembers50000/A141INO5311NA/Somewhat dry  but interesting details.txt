 I found the book to be knowledgable and thorough, but extremely dry and hard to read. I could not believe that someone could make a subject like this so dry. ...P>That said, you won't find too many straightforward sources like this, and it's got some neat photos and portrait reproductions that make the book worth getting. The information contained herein isn't particularly suited to children, but it isn't shocking or titillating. It reads more like a lecture by a very prim history prof. Anybody of any morals should be able to digest this without dying of offensensitivity.
