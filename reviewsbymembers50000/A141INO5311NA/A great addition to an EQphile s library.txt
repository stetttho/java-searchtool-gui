 Or really, anybody interested in fantasy storytelling. The Gatherum really doesn't have anything really to do with the RPG -- I don't remember a thing in it that'd really help an EQ gamer out. It's really just a bunch of background material -- and by "bunch", I mean hundreds of pages of photos, interviews, drawings, background, source material, and reference stuff. This isn't so much a guidebook to Elfquest as an illumination of how it came to be. Some of the essays are written by the Pinis, and others are by admirers and friends. EQ readers will probably appreciate the essay about how Recognition works, but there's lots more there to love.
