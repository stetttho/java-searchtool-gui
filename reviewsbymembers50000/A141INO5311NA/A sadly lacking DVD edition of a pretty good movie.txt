 If one were rating the movie itself, this would probably be a "4". It's not a bad retelling of the myth, though it does drive the historian in me insane with its inaccuracies. It has heart and it has cool treehouses and the neatest archery effects this side of "Lord of the Rings" (though impossible ones at times). It starts with Robin in a Jerusalem jail and adds in a black Muslim with a warped sense of humor. It has a blind man in it who has more courage than most sighted folks. It has Maid Marian dressed like a ninja trying to kill Robin (where DOES all that courage and martial skill go when the Sheriff's trying to rape her?). Unfortunately, it has a medieval birthing scene, and I just can't forgive the producer this -- it didn't add anything to the movie, and just squicked me royally. And then there's the acting.. or one actor's acting, anyway. Kevin Costner's worse at showing emotion than Keanu Reeves. Everybody around him is showing sadness, joy, hate, and the best he can come up with is a totally monotonous, non-emotional, deadpan delivery of stilted lines like "Did I offend you in a past life, Will Scarlett? What did I do to inspire such hatred?", in the face of Christian Slater's overwhelming, beautifully portrayed anger and grief. I don't know who convinced Costner that this would be a great way to portray Robin, but whoever did it needs to be reprimanded. It's still a decent movie. But the DVD edition of it is clearly a rushed affair. There are very few goodies on it, and it is two-sided for no particular reason that I could discern. It's widescreen, which is nice, but that two-sided thing is irritating as all get-out. At least on VHS it doesn't make me get up and switch tapes! I can't recommend this DVD edition, pretty much. Maybe they'll come out with a deluxe edition, or tweak it so it's just one sided or something. Till then, I'd hang onto my money.
