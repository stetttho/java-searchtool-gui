 I should preface this by saying that I bought this as an introduction to non-Egyptian mummies and that I'm in my mid-30s with no kids (and that I didn't realize when I bought the book that it was actually specifically marketed as for children; imagine MY surprise). This is a very beginner-style book that brushes the surface with gee-whiz factoids. The information here has been handed to us a dozen times on various cable channels already and in way better detail. There are tons of pictures, which I thought were pretty cool. Also includes "stuff to do", which didn't seem to shed much light on the subject and which I thoroughly regarded as space filler, but which a pre-teenager might find amusing. It's also a slim volume. I was a very precocious reader, and even at 9, this book would have been way below my reading level -- so it is hard to say if it is too far below the average kid's reading level or intelligence today. It's slick, packaged, colorful, and short on real background or history -- a lot like a TV special, if you want the truth. It delves very lightly into a lot of different areas, but doesn't get too far into any of them. Get this as a beginner's book and as a launchpad to find other, more intelligent and more detailed, books on the subject, but don't expect it to answer any real curiosity.  In short, there are several books out there that cover the material in way more detail and with less of a Fox-News feel, but the book wasn't a total waste of money.
