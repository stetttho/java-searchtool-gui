 I used to have this book, years ago, and just re-got it and re-read it this weekend. The first time I read it, I thought it was racist and demeaning. Since then, I've lived with guys just like these, proving that slack has no color. I was able to put aside the earlier preconceptions and just enjoy reading about Danny and his band of friends, whose lives revolve around women, slacking off, and drinking.  The book is a very loose retelling of Arthurian myth, loose enough that I didn't catch it upon first read, centering around Danny, who brings all his friends to live with him in the large, free house he's inherited (Danny's "throne" is his bed, which nobody but him is allowed to use). The work's only drawback is its looseness of narrative -- it reads more like a collection of short stories than a novel with any sort of overall plot. Even so, I do think it's one of the more accessible Steinbeck works. Definitely I'd recommend it.
