 Not complete and definitely geared toward a more youthful audience, but an excellent read and very informative. Lots of pictures, but (AARGH!) little info on titles or artists, which is frustrating as some of these pictures I've never seen anywhere before! The book details Lorenzo's young life as well as that of his grandfather and father. It talks mostly about his youth and his earliest days as ruler of Florence, with flavoring about his life, marriage, kids, and other such topics. It also details his death and a bit about those who followed him. A very useful geneological chart is included, which, though far from complete, was appreciated. There is also a map of Italy, which one would expect in this kind of work but which is sometimes lacking. I vaguely know where Florence is, but it's always nice to know exactly where things are. The book did tell me a lot of things I didn't know about Lorenzo's all too brief reign, but I'd have loved to have heard more about the politics of the region. I also would have enjoyed hearing more about his relatives and his daily life. That said, I would recommend this book to anybody looking for an introduction to late 15th century Florentine history. I'm a costumer, and already this book has given me some absolutely delicious ideas.. as soon as I figure out where some of these paintings are from.
