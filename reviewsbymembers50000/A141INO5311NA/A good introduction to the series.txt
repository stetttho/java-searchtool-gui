 Unlike some series, which have about 120 pages of NOTHING happening before the plot begins...,this more or less starts quickly and moves underway. Garion, a plain scullery boy, and his aunt, the regal-but-oddly-domestic Pol, join an oddly assorted group of characters to chase after something they won't tell Garion about. I like the sense of mystery in the book. Garion really has no idea who he is or what his group is after. I also like the relationships between Garion, his aunt, and his grandfather. All three are drawn richly and realistically, and are well worth the reading. On the bad side, Eddings has a fascination with re-using characters and plotlines (there's a lot here fans will recognize from the "Elenium" series), and with using the same sorts of jokes (such as the phrase "an indifference to the finer points of property ownership"). Most of the cast have overly clever mouths and a penchant for irreverence and flip comments at the strangest moments, something you'll notice out of his other series as well. The supporting cast also tends to be almost interchangable, though not as badly as Sparhawk's traveling companions -- at least THESE characters have different accents. The series itself sounds about like a D&D outing (it's mentioned a few times in the series that the group is TOO assorted to avoid suspicion, something I wish D&D players realized themselves), with national Gods and strong nationalistic tendencies that reduce most characters to stereotypes. That said, it's a fun read. Eddings moves his cast adeptly through a plot it's obvious he's spent a little time on, and the main characters are fun to watch. Those who get frustrated with overly clever characters and derivative plots may not like this, but I enjoy the series. This beginning book is just the first of many fun outings with Garion and the gang.
