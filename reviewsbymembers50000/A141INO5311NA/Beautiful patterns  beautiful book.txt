 This hardcover book is remarkably well put-together, looking almost like a coffee-table book and not a pattern omnibus at all. Inside there are lush patterns with flavor text about how the author thought up the project and historical notes about why she chose this or that positioning or border.  The patterns are simple and easy to make, though it does make me crazy that the author doesn't include patterns for all pieces depicted -- I wonder if these were included as teasers to make readers seek and purchase additional patterns. Many of these neglected patterns were ones I'd dearly love to make, but there's lots of other stuff here for embroiderers. The lion tapestry, in particular, is graceful and looks genuine for its period, and I adore her unicorn even if what she came out with as a pattern bears next to no relation to the "inspiration" she says she used. Her fleur-de-lys pattern, as well, is magnificent and would make a splendid seat cushion (a project which she actually recommends), floor mat, or hanging -- definitely suggest to readers.  Overall I'm very happy I got this book and would recommend it, especially as a gift, for any embroiderer, especially for those who enjoy fantasy or medieval-style patterns.
