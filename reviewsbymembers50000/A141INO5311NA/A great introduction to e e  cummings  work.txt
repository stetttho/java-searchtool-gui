 This slim volume is attractively packaged and presented, with a good range of his work arranged chronologically. Only 100 poems are reprinted here, a tiny drop in his total output. But they're the ones you know best, including the cowboy poem we all had to read in Texas in high school (WHY they made us read that one, when there were so many better that he wrote, I will never know).  I have to admit, I like his earlier work much better -- the further it goes, the weirder his poetry gets, till idea is almost entirely divorced from form. But I got this as an introduction to his work, and it fulfills that role admirably. I felt I'd gotten a good idea of his range and technique, and that I'd seen the most important of his works. Those who want a basic e.e. cummings introduction will not be disappointed here.
