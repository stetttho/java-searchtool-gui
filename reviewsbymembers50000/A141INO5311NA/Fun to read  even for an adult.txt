 Don't look here for big huge plots -- this book is a slice-of-life book about daily life in a pioneer family. There's no plot to speak of, so I'm not sure a small child's attention would be captured by this sort of writing. However, for me, an adult who grew up with these books, it's almost like a return to a simpler, easier time, when your worst fear was wolves. I probably plow through the entire series, from "Big Woods" to the "On the Road Home", once a year. As a bonus, I've taken up a number of handcrafts, and the information in "Big Woods", among other books, has helped me enormously in my endeavors to live more simply. I really think all kids should be exposed to this book. The family values in it are commendable, and the writing is easy to understand at a kid level. But be prepared to work with the child on this book.. they're barraged with explosions and shapechanging robots, so they may need a little help to appreciate a calmer, quieter work like this.
