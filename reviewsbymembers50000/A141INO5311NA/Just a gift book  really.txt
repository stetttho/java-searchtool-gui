 I found this book very disappointing. I expected a book about paintings of cats, and what it ended up being was poorly-inserted cats set into famous paintings. I didn't find the prose very funny at all, either. I caught mine on sale (there is no way I'd have bought this 5" square book at full price), but after the first glance, I didn't bother further with it. I'm sorry I bought it. I'm still waiting for a good book about cats in art history.
