 You don't need to be religious to appreciate the magic and wonder that is Narnia. The religious symbolism is, at times, a distraction from the excellent storytelling (we are occasionally beaten bloody with the Aslan-as-Jesus bit), but overall, the stories are well-written and bear the mark of a master's hand. Taken on their own, the novels are as easy to approach and enjoy as the "Wrinkle in Time" and "Lord of the Rings" series, though written for a younger age group. The novels do not occur chronologically, but the general story involves Aslan creating Narnia, which is then taken over by a witch from another world. Aslan's power brings 4 Earth children to Narnia to liberate it from the witch, after which Adventures Occur. The children return to Earth and then make periodic trips to Narnia, along with other Earth children on occasion. Eventually there is a huge war and Aslan destroys Narnia and recreates it as paradise. As I said, there's definite religious overtones here, but don't let that stop you from trying the series if you haven't already. Don't even let being a grown-up stop you from enjoying it -- I re-read the whole series about once a year. It is beautifully written and worth the effort -- one of those cultural tapestry things that everybody just ought to have read.
