 Exceptionally well-written by one of our generation's best science-fiction authors, this book is both disturbing and thought-provoking. Though it is short, I cannot remember being so affected by a science-fiction story for years.  The premise is simple. A black man named Rudy has the ability to read minds. A dear female friend of his, a lawyer, asks him to read the mind of a murderer she has recently sent to Death Row, to find out if he's really guilty. Rudy goes to see this murderer, and is astonished by some information he learns. There are many twists and turns to this tale. The actual tale isn't what makes this story, however. As barebone plots go, this one isn't the most original I've ever seen. It has to be the actual storytelling. Ellison has a way of writing that reads almost like the breathless banter of a conman. It is engaging, engrossing, and, dangit, fun to read. Every page has some new gem to discover on it. Ellison is right: This is one of his finest works, perhaps even the best he CAN write. Don't miss it. (Don't miss his acknowledgments page, either. It's one of the funniest ones I've ever seen.)
