 I enjoyed this midpoint book quite a lot. It has a lot of action in it to make up for Eddings' few flaws. Garion, in this installment, goes with his aunt and grandfather to fetch what he now knows to be a talisman of great power, and to kill the talisman's thief. Garion's power continues to grow, and his affection for the little princess Ce'Nedra continues to confuse him (and her). The characterization of the relationship between Ce'Nedra and Garion is masterful, if a little stereotypical (do ANY real teenagers argue that way? I argued a lot, but I recall being a bit more quiet about it), but that doesn't detract from its fun. There are numerous other good scenes in the book, culminating in a classic wizard's duel. Probably the only real bad point in the book (and in the series as a whole) is the introduction of the angelic child Errand (I didn't like Flute, either, so there). But overall, I found the book enjoyable.
