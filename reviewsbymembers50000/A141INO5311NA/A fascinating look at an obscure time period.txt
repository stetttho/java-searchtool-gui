 (written on light-grey paper, with a sprig of rosemary tied into the ribbon around it) I came into this book knowing absolutely nothing about the Heian period of feudal Japan, and left knowing enough to stand my own. The details revealed are absolutely fascinating, and the writing is rich and evocative. It is a lifestyle of an age long gone, brought to life again. The noble writer of the diary is, as has been promised, not entirely an angel (her life does sound a bit talk-show-ish at points), but she does certainly have an eye for detail and storytelling. I doubt even non-history-freaks would find this difficult going. Easy to read and digest, with lots of neat looks at life in a very exotic place. I cannot say enough about the book's usefulness as a sourcebook for the period. The copious notes at the end are almost as fascinating as the book itself. I wouldn't have minded more pictures, but I suppose one can't have everything. Those into history, Japanese history, biographies/diaries, etc., will find this a fascinating and informative read.
