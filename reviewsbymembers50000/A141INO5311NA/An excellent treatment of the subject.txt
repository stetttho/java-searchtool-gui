 I admit it. I'm scared of blackwork. But this book makes it seem not quite so intimidating. Lots of examples of it are included, in numerous b/w illustrations and photos of extant Tudor/Elizabethan work (there's modern stuff, too, but I'm not as interested in that). There are also instructions for doing blackwork, though the explanations are a bit hard to follow in places. Overall, this is the best treatment of the subject I've seen yet. As an acquaintance of mine has said, while it's still in print, get it! Or you may find yourself hunting for it when it's gone.  I seriously don't know /any/ blackworkers who don't have this book.
