 I'm not entirely sure about this sequel Adams has written. "Watership Down" is without a doubt one of my favorite books in the world. I've literally read my way through several copies. I awaited the sequel breathlessly and pounced on it when it came out in paperback.  Overall it's great. One section devotes itself to El-ahrairah, the Prince Rabbit, in a long series of connected short stories. One section devotes itself to the Watership Down warren after the battle with Efrafa. These are enjoyable, with the same deft touches one sees in other Adams books. They're not as well-written as "Watership Down", being altogether fluffier, but that almost goes without saying. There's less of a sense of urgency about the stories, I suppose. The middle section, however, is a disappointment. Preachy and flakey, it is a demonstration of the very wackiest of wacky New Age "We are the World" mishmash beliefs, with forced storylines galore. Only the most fervent ecological nuts could possibly think this has any value as narrative. Other than that, the stories are fun to read -- and Kehaar's in the last section, so what else could one ask?
