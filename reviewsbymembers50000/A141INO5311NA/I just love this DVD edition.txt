 I'm a Mozart freak. One of the things the DVD includes is the track from the movie -- just the soundtrack, no movie. I think that is totally cool. Of course, I do own the soundtrack already, so that's more of a goodie than a must-have to me. But still, a cool goodie.  The movie's good too, with a crisp, clear picture. The version I saw was widescreen -- my preference, personally. For those who have not seen the movie, it is based on the life of Mozart and his rivalry with the older, more staid Salieri (whose music you can still find). Costumes and sets are lush and evocative, the acting is divine, and the direction is incredible. This movie won a lot of awards back in its day, and for good reason. And in a cameo that just begs to be recognized, it has Vincent Schiavelli as a valet who thinks he knows how to get Salieri's attention in the first scene (he was the disgusting biology teacher in "Fast Times at Ridgemont High", and has had a host of other neat little roles). Between the exquisite quality of picture and the extras it includes, this is definitely a DVD I appreciate having.
