 Told through a cat's eyes, "Tailchaser's Song" reads like good mythology. It's a simple story, at the beginning: Tailchaser, a tomcat, goes searching for his soon-to-be-mate Hushpad, who has gone missing, and has many adventures as he seeks her. He journeys through a world filled with intelligent animals ranging from dogs to squirrels to birds to more, eventually meeting up with the source of much evil in the world. Tailchaser comes of age and learns much about himself and about the value of friendship -- and about what love really is. I encountered this book first as a 20something, and I've read my way through two copies so far. Williams is a fantastic storyteller, with an artist's touch. His descriptions and characterizations are excellent, as always. I'd recommend this without hesitation to anybody interested in a good yarn. Even those who don't normally get into "fuzzy animal" stories may like this -- it's really about way more than just talking kitties.
