 Tons of citations, tons of primary-source documentation. It's a gorgeous book, full of information about life in a very specific time-period. This isn't a general "medieval" resource -- it is a resource about London and Paris of the years 1150-1200 and that.. is.. it. I wish it went into more detail in places (such as how women lived), but one can't argue that it's probably the best book of its kind concerning this time period. There are recipes, instructions for planting gardens, herbalism and medicine notes, information on how ironsmiths and goldsmiths worked, architectural notes, and loads of tidbits about how students lived (since the book's primary source is a 12th-century student's writings), stuff about jousts.. you name it, just about. The author sounds like he might have lived there, he's so familiar with his material. Effortlessly, he spins his stories, and his writing style is quite pleasant to read. I'd certainly and without reservations consider this book a must-have for anybody interested in this time period. I just wonder that it took me so long to find it -- it was written in the 50s! This book also comes out in softcover from Wisconsin Press and is currently in print.
