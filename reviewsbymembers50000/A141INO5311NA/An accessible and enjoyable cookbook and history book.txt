 Here we have a small collection of redacted Roman recipes, along with explanations of ingredients and concepts and some modern adaptations.  Frankly, I think it was quite cool. I particularly got a lot out of the explanation of garum -- it really changed my mind about a lot of things I used to think about Roman food.  The few recipes I've tried from here turned out well, though I'm not sure I'd want to try them all. Some sound a bit bizarre and are probably included as a culture-shock device. For the average home cook, I'm not sure I'd consider this a must-have unless that cook were very VERY adventurous. But for the historian looking for a sourcebook, this looks like a keeper. Thoroughly enjoyable and well-written.
