 From the exquisite cover art to the outstanding stories contained in the graphic novel, this is one of the best EQ collections I've ever seen. The art is uniformly stunning -- EQ has finally found artists worthy of Wendy Pini's example. And the stories are well-written.  The collection covers the relationship between Cutter and Skywise, two male elves who consider themselves "brothers in all but blood". Different aspects of their relationship are revealed, including their "sort of Recognition", and Skywise's fear and loathing of the idea of Recognizing a mate. The tone of the stories varies from serious to playful (I think the image of a troll beauty shimmying out of her dress has permanently scarred my retinas). The stories are all black and white art, but one doesn't miss the colors with art and storytelling this lush.
