 I don't know much about the military or the FBI, but whoever is teaching Lee Child psychology needs to be reprimanded. I'm not a total expert in that, either, just a BA, but anybody who's had a year or two of psych knows that that is NOT how hypnosis works. I'm afraid that completely ruined this book for me. I read it through, but since I already knew who the bad guy was (in what was surely the most telegraphed foreshadowing I've ever seen), and I knew the manner of killing was completely unrealistic, it was hard for me to get into it. Thrillers are cool because they *could* be true -- there was just no way this premise could be true, that's all. I don't ask much out of thrillers. Consistency and coherence and some modicum of real-world fact -- that's all I want.
