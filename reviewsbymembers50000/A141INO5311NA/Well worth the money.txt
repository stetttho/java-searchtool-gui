 I think we're mostly familiar with the story of this movie, but I'll recap briefly: A thief is sent to steal a scientific formula from a nerdy-but-gorgeous physicist, but he falls in love with her. He deceives her, she tracks him down, there's a lot of chases, and oh yeah, there's a revolution going on around them. The fun part: The thief is noble at heart, a master of quick-changes and impersonations, and always picks for his personae the names of Catholic saints (a rather telling calling-card, if you ask me, but the movie asks us to "forget" that any criminal profiler would catch that within 30 seconds). It's a romp of a movie. There's definite chemistry between Val Kilmer and Elisabeth Shue, the leads, and it's delightful to see Kilmer's various personae, how different they all really are. The movie drags a bit in the middle (and honestly, the entire beginning sequence could have been left out safely), but it picks up again. There are some fascinating characters in here, most particularly the greedy "art dealer" Frankie, who steals every scene she's in. Unfortunately, the bad guys aren't among the fascinating -- both are two-dimensional and stereotypical. But there's plenty to compensate for the movie's shortcomings. A chase scene involving Shue trying to reach the American embassy is among my favorites in movie history. The sets are very cool. The acting is fairly solid, bad guys aside. There's a lot of eye candy here, and not all of it is Val Kilmer in leather pants posing as a South African artist. The DVD version doesn't include a ton of goodies (a commentary and the trailer), but the picture and sound quality are excellent. Well worth the money.
