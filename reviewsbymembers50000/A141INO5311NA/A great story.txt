 This is one of those "guilty pleasures" people talk about. Despite its many flaws, it still stands out as one of my favorite movies -- I watch it more often than I will admit. Yes, the story can get stilted. Yes, it's more full of authenticity errors than your average LARP. Yes, the soundtrack's electric guitars and synth sound ridiculous. Yes, the script forces the actors to say really stupid things. But you know what? It's still a great movie, in the tradition of the greatest medieval romances.  It borrows shamelessly from many sources, ending up with a nearly archetypical story of a lady in love with a knight and a dreadful, awe-inspiringly-unpleasant curse preventing them from being together. Rutger Hauer makes his knight, Nevarre, brim with barely-controlled fury, tension, violence, and desire the entire movie. Michelle Pfeiffer's Isabeau is delicate and airy, but capable and somewhat irritated with (and resigned to) Nevarre's impulsiveness and violence, a welcome change from standard damsels-in-distress. Broderick's "Mouse" is a false note -- it's like Ferris Bueller got set down in 13th-century France. The whole "talking to yourself to illustrate motive" thing is annoying. But he does provide some welcome humor (the "she flew away, Your Honor!" line is one of the best in the movie). The sets are excellent, the scenery is incredible, the costumes are all right (with the exception of Isabeau's hair, which looks just flat-out WRONG the whole way through the movie, and Nevarre, whose black leather is totally cool, even makes squeaky leather noises when he walks), and I just love the horse, who is a character in his own right. There are very few goodies on the DVD, but the few there are, and the widescreening, make it worthwhile as a purchase. I'm definitely glad I got mine. Incidentally, while it has no real sex or graphic violence, I don't think it'd be great for little kids to see due to some pretty mature ideas in it, including very naughty priests.
