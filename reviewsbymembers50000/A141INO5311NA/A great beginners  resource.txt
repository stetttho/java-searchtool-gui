 I'm very new to jewelrymaking and recently picked this up as a first guide. I'm very happy to say that it has fulfilled my expectations. Extensive greyscale illustrations show step-by-step how to perform the steps described in the text. Basic concepts are discussed with an eye toward explaining them in detail for the total beginner.  This is very much a homemade sort of book -- saddle-stapled and not very long, about 60 pages. If there's ever a second edition, I'd like to see better editing to get the grammar errors out, and I'd love to see some useful color photos -- the ones included are there more for showing possibilities than for illustrating concepts. It is also true that some of the things discussed don't fall under my personal definition of "basics", like making daisy chains (f.e., I'd never even *seen* a daisy chain before seeing them here). But as my first guidebook, it's worth the extremely low cost. The style of writing is accessible and friendly and the step-by-step illustrations are invaluable to understanding.
