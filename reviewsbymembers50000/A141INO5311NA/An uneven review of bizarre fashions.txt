 Some of the information is fascinating, but it is haphazardly organized and uneven. I also wasn't happy that many of the portraits appeared to be repainted (ie, not the original portraits) with 20th-century mistakes in them. Skipping around from the middle ages up to more or less the present day, the book shows all sorts of odd fashions, from corsets to plastic surgery to foot-binding. It's a thin book, long on illustrations and with text being mostly in the form of sound bites, like most of these Time-Life style books are. I got it primarily as a novelty, and that's about what it is. The authors don't cite sources, but a determined researcher could probably figure out where most of this came from. It's an interesting first look at extreme fashion through the years.
