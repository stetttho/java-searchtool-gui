 Though not long by novel standards, this is a powerful, magnetic read. It's a quiet, meditative, exploratory tale, almost a detective novel, but without a real whodunnit. I found it deeply satisfying.  A young woman's grandmother dies, leaving behind a legacy of bizarre mementoes and a statement that she (the grandmother) is the princess in the oddly altered version of "Sleeping Beauty" story she has been telling her granddaughters their whole lives. The heroine spends the rest of the novel trying to ascertain the truth of that statement, and it leads her to the Holocaust, Poland, concentration camps, and more. Characterization is spot-on, as always for Yolen, who has a gift for capturing a person's essence with just a few brushstrokes. The plot is tight and moves along briskly and without the reader noticing -- and it actually sounds plausible. Readers who prefer whiz-bang action or fantasy will find this a different kind of story, but I can't imagine anybody actually disliking this book.
