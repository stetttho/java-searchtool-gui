 Not scary at all, but quite fun, Saturday the 14th includes ALL the cliches, from the family (a banal, witty father, an equally banal Mrs. Cleaver mother, a cute teenaged daughter who is just destined for mauling, and a super-smart 10-year-old son) to their newly inherited "house with a curse". The house is as much fun to watch as the characters living in it, with moving-eye portraits, sentient (and carnivorous) bookcases, candles that mysteriously light themselves when light switches are thrown, and a Dark-Shadows-meets-Brady-Bunch decorating scheme.  A pair of gothy-looking married vampires are trying desperately to get into the house to retrieve a book, which the boy inadvertently opens to release many evil things into the world. A nutcase exterminator (hired to get bats out of the belfry) seeks to find the book as well, and to foil the vampires. Somewhere along the way there's a house-warming party with a houseful of detestable guests (and the daughter wears a VERY 80s Gunne Sax dress, a cute touch), most of whom deserve everything that happens to them. The monsters are of the latex suit variety and there's mild violence, but nothing here is meant to terrify. It is a parody, short and sweet, with many fun little comedic touches (the TV *only* gets "The Twilight Zone"). Everything you think will happen does happen, right down to the bathtub scene with the teenaged daughter. The acting isn't fabulous, but the casting is good. I'm still trying to figure out if that pizza delivery boy is played by Adam Sandler in a pseudonym. Definitely this is a fun movie to have, and I've already worn out my VHS edition, which is why I've gotten a DVD edition. Incidentally, the DVD includes a few little goodies -- bios of some of the actors and staff (the producer's bio is a hoot -- it's HUMONGOUS), and trailers of various movies the same studio has done including this one.
