 This is not an exploration of individual religions in the "Star Trek" mythos, but an examination of the Big Questions about religion as they are answered by Star Trek. I found the writing interesting, with lots of examples to back up the theories within. Religion has changed a lot in "Star Trek" since Kirk's day. This book traces that change through chapters regarding the existence of God and evil. How the different races in Star Trek view these questions is also presented and contrasted with humanity. Since "Next Generation" is the longest-running series, naturally it is represented more than TOS, DS9 and Voyager. This was printed before "Enterprise", but I hope it will be updated a few years from now to include "Enterprise"'s viewpoints. Frankly, it's fascinating to see religious-theory experts take on a project of this nature. I'd love to see more. I think most "Star Trek" fans would be very interested in this work, as would students of religion in culture.
