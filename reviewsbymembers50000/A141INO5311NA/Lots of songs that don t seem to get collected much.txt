 This is a great compilation. With 14 songs, it has enough length that you don't feel bored listening to it a second time. The songs themselves sound good together -- whoever picked them did a pretty good job. I particularly like "Keep Your Hands to Yourself" -- never seen that one on a compilation before. If you're in the market to get a compilation, well, this one's the best one I've seen yet.
