 Katherine Hepburn plays Eleanor of Aquitaine, one of the most famous women in medieval history. She is portrayed here in that period she was under house arrest by her husband, who has her there because she and her sons tried to take his throne. This Christmas, she tries to maneuver herself free and her favorite son, Richard, to the throne, while her husband, Henry, tries to outwit her by keeping his own favorite the heir, his heir's mistress for himself, the French king at bay, and his wife at arm's reach. It's a very politically convoluted plot, with many twists and turns. Do you like political roleplaying? Are you interested in this period of history? This is your movie. The acting is absolutely incredible, with depth and humanity given to even the most unsympathetic characters, like Prince John. Keep an eye out for Timothy Dalton, who appears here as a nearly adolescent French king with remarkable political acumen. The DVD version of the movie doesn't include a lot of fun stuff, only an audio commentary, but the picture quality is excellent to make up for it.
