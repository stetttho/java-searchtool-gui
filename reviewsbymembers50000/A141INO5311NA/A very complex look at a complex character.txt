 Bearclaw isn't an easy character to love, and he definitely isn't the stereotypical nurturing, loving, peacable Wolfrider. The book details how he came to make war on the humans and firmly sets responsibility for that war just as squarely on his shoulders as on the humans'. Prejudice, racial hatred, violent childrearing, and Dumb Boy Mistakes abound here. After reading this book, I came to understand that the Pini's elves are in their way just as human as we are, and just as capable of unpleasant behavior and beliefs. In "Hidden Years", when Ember asks her father, Cutter (whose hand is raised to slap her), "Who taught you to do that, anyway?", the question is all the more poignant, and Cutter's childrearing beliefs in the face of Bearclaw's treatment become all the more remarkable. I was quite jarred when, midway through the book, another artist took over -- this new artist had a very different style from Wendy and honestly I did not like that style much -- but eventually Wendy took over again. I'd consider this a must-have in an Elfquest reader's library. It very efficiently balances the overly-good image the elves have.
