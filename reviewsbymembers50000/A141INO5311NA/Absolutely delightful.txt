 This large but not-too-thick book details a number of beautiful and little-known places in Tuscany, ranging over the entire region. This isn't actually a travel book per se -- it doesn't tell you contact information, for example, or even if these places are open to the general public. It does, however, tell you about places in Tuscany that tourists probably never ever get to, to wit: The Refuge of the White Monks at Monte Oliveto Maggiore, built in 1313, with its vaulted white halls filled with frescoes of cats and mounted archers; the lush, almost surreally beautiful gardens of Villa Garzoni in Lucca; the thousands of treasures of all sorts in the Museum of Silver in Palazzo Pitti; the Florentine Botanical Museum; the inlaid treasures of the Museo delle Pietre Dure, including shots of inlay artists at their craft; a silk factory; and many other things, probably 30 to 40 in all. The pictures are lavish and beautifully made, and the text is lyrical and pleasant on the eyes. I'd never even heard of ANY of these places, so reading this book was quite a delicious experience. I wouldn't get this as a serious travel guide, but it piques the imagination. There may be things here you'll want to find on your next trip to Tuscany.
