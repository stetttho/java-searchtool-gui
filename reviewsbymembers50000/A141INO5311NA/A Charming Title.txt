 I actually got this in the 70s and didn't realize it was still in print; I found it in a box of stuff when I moved and was charmed by it all over again.  It's a collection of short stories and fables, mixed with a few riddles, along with about a dozen recipes. I'd never seen the stories before, though all of them are acknowledged from previously-published sources from around the world.  The recipes seem easy enough for kids, though some might be challenging. They include roast chicken, butter cookies, cherry dumplings, chocolate potato cake with frosting, pancakes, honey butter, pumpkin chiffon pie, and soup. One recipe I thought was good was one for molasses milkshakes. This cookbook, unlike other "kids'" cookbooks, assumes kids are pretty functional in the kitchen if given half a chance. Nothing here should be really dangerous; nothing's more complicated than sifting.  The illustrations for this (b/w line drawings) are particularly charming. I'd suggest this for anybody who likes kids' cookbooks or who wants to combine fairy tales and food.
