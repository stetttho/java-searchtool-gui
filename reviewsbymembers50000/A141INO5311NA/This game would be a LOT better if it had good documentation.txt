 Did I play the same game the other reviewers did? Seriously? Maybe it's just the version I got, but this game is far too flawed to enjoy on any kind of consistent basis. Commands are not detailed in the manual or on the tutorial (for example, how to QUIT). There is no ingame help system, either. There is no explanation for important concepts like question marks over buildings in the tutorial.. the manual just says to look at them, decide what to do, and handle it. Overall, the tutorial was almost useless as a way of learning the game. Each segment of it appeared to last about 2 minutes and provide about 10 text lines of material, most of it encouragement. The manual, incidentally, can only be retrieved from the CD using Explore -- the CD auto-runs any other way you try to access it. It sure has a lot of pretty pictures, but it doesn't tell you how to quit either, or how to get tools, the shortage of which I tended to knock up against on a regular basis. Graphics are blocky, but survivable. There is no explanation of what stars mean in the initial game setup -- I thought it was a rating system, but turns out it's probably a difficulty level. I still have no idea why I couldn't build a warehouse on the scenario I tried -- I had enough stuff, but it just didn't want to do it. I suppose if I were more intuitive or more patient I could probably figure it out, but as it is, it's just too frustrating to play.
