 It's fun to read such a no-nonsense manual for cat owners. Clear, concise, but gentle in tone, this book covers all aspects of pet ownership, from litter box issues to poisonous plants. The book asserts that most problems cat owners face are a direct result of misunderstandings -- misunderstandings that arise because humans don't understand the cat's point of view. One must admit this theory is compelling. I've had this book a year, and consider it indispensable. It's resolved several problems I thought were impossible. And I must admit that my cats seem a lot happier now that I've been reading this lady's writing. I certainly don't have any behavioral problems with either of them anymore. Push all the other how-to manuals off the shelf. This is the only one you need.
