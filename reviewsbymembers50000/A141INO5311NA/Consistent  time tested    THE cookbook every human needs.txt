 I actually have both the original and the new JoC. This one's a vast improvement over the original. This one's updated with all the new foods we're all used to now that we just didn't have 20 years ago, like star fruit and jerk rubs. And it revises recipes from the original -- the cornbread recipe now includes a "northern" and a "southern" version, with the "southern" version actually resembling authentic cornbread.  This is the first cookbook I ever bought. It is still the seminal reference work for cooks. From how to skin squirrels to making hard candy to how to roast turkeys, anything you want to know about any food, it's in here. I've probably cooked dozens, if not hundreds, of the recipes in this book over the years, and haven't been disappointed yet. Every recipe is tested and consistent -- and that's probably the best thing you can say about this book. It's consistent. It's also the primo information source on food ingredients, from types of flour to varieties of pears. Due to its scope, individual sections are somewhat limited, but they are effective at piqueing the imagination. The book also assumes a small amount of skill on the part of the reader -- the brand-new cook will find plenty here that is do-able, but some things will look intimidating. That said, rest assured that *nothing* in here is outside the ability of the average home cook. In short, I have no reservations at all about wholeheartedly recommending this book to every single cook reading this.
