 I found this second book to be far more enjoyable than the first, though of course it doesn't make a lot of sense to read this one without reading the first one (I don't think they'd stand alone all that well). In this one, Garion discovers during the flight to recover whatever that thing is his aunt and grandfather are chasing that he is, in fact, a powerful sorcerer. He tangles with a bunch of bad guys, including a fascinating snake-queen, and wreaks a little magical havoc on people. Garion's a well-drawn character -- a realistic, pouty young man who would vastly prefer that his cup had gone to another. His aunt is a force of nature (the description of her pounding through the halls of one of the bad guys looking for him are not to be missed, or forgotten), and his grandfather is an affable enough mix between Talen and Gandalf. This book adds the temperamental Princess Ce'Nedra to the cast -- and she's fun to watch as well, a complex and mercurial personality. For my money, the best part of the book takes place in Nyissa -- it is a fascinating place, and Eddings lavishes the best of his art on it and its denizens. Overall, a good book.
