 Reads in many places like an adolescent's third-period efforts. Much of it is sentimental, obvious, trite, overly narrative, and unschooled. Too many people think that poetry is purely subjective, and Jewel here falls into that trap. (Also, she has gotten the idea that a lot of high schoolers have about weird line breaks being the defining factor of a poem.. sigh.) But there's a lot of genius here, too. With some nuts and bolts techniques under her belt, and some more years behind her, this young lady may become a force to be reckoned with. Her command of imagery is primal (such as one poem's longing for a man "with wild things in his hair") and her choices of analogies and metaphors is, simply, terrific. I can easily put up with the high-school level stuff to get to the good stuff. In her foreward, she admits that she'd never have been published had she not been a megastar singer, which is, sadly, true; she also says that she included the fluff poems deliberately, the wisdom of which I question. I am hoping very much that we see more out of Jewel, and this time, I hope she takes it a bit more seriously and includes only quality works. Poetry buffs should not avoid this work just because it is written by the famous rock star Jewel.
