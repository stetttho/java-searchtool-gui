 I recently found a copy of this book. It is drastically out of print and took almost a year to track down. But it was well worth the large sum it cost and the time it took to find. It is a large book, some 250 pages, lavishly illustrated in b/w and color. A complete art bibliography is included, but some of the paintings' attributions and titles have changed in the past 25 years, so be aware. Text is scholarly and witty, told by someone whose expertise in the subject is clearly profound. A glossary is included of garment terms from the period -- a lifesaver for me! Text includes all aspects of garment, from underwear to shoes to belts to hats to jewelry to clothes, and information on fabric types and weaving and dyeing techniques. I've already read it several times, and every time, I get something new from it. I should also add that many of these portraits do not appear to exist online, so you'll see plenty of things you haven't seen before. It wasn't quite what I expected, however. I thought it'd tell me how exactly to make sleeves, hose, etc., and it didn't. But what it did give me was an excellent and in-depth study of clothes in Renaissance Italy, and enough information that I feel I am prepared to use all that velvet I've been hoarding finally without making an idiot of myself. If you are into costuming, and this is your period, definitely get it! Be prepared to spend some cash money, though.
