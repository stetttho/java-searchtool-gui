 This kind of parody and self-mockery is rarely seen, nor done so well. Not everybody will like its insistence on not taking itself seriously, or its improbable plot. But it is howlingly funny to those who can appreciate a little physical humor and parody. Kirk and a bunch of Klingons find themselves on a strange new planet, having to negotiate for a rare mineral. The planet's indigenous population turns out to not want either group there and takes steps to get them both off the planet. This sounds like a fairly straightforward plot, but the twists and turns that arise from it are, to say the least, silly. This is slapstick at its finest. It is roaringly funny filk songs sung by the most wildly improbable cast one can imagine. It's Klingons in formal Earth-style tuxes and dresses. It's a landing crew soaked in replicated strawberry milkshake. It's a dominatrix leading a Busby-style musical scene. It's Bones totally hung over and a Klingon fed to a laundry chute. I can well imagine that not all fans are going to get into this. It solidly pokes fun at everything Star Trek fandom has revered for 20 years. It's not serious; it's barely even plausible. But that's part of the fun for me. If you like your SF seasoned with more than the average amount of humor, you may find this to be fun as well. Probably its only detraction is that I didn't know all the songs being referenced. I'm probably just too young!
