 I'm not a dress-up fan, but I do like this playful movie. The DVD edition is well worth the investment, with lots of very fun extras, including interviews, old footage, and even a commentary version featuring dress-up "cast" members acting out key moments in the movie just like they do in movie theatres around the nation every weekend. The movie itself is a horror spoof, featuring a "straight" couple who get stranded in a mansion full of lunatics and who eventually get drawn into the very bizarre things happening there. It's a romp with lots of fun songs and constant neato surprises. It isn't scary in the slightest, though it definitely isn't appropriate for the underage crowd.
