 In a world glutted with obscenity and gratuitous violence and hatred, here's a good-hearted, only slightly racy comic who can still make you laugh so hard you'll pee your pants. Though the text humor differs quite a bit from the onstage humor (chiefly in pacing -- his onstage show, of necessity, has a driven energy level and non-stop humor, while this book has the feel of a campfire yarn, told with all the necessary changes of mood that any good story would have), it still translates to funny, as well as occasionally thought-provoking. The humor works best, I think, on Southerners (people not familiar with and sympathetic to how the South works may find themselves looking around all uptight, muttering "I don't see what's so funny"). One can hardly say that one sense of humor fits all, so I'll just say this: It's fairly clean humor that pokes fun at Southern quirks, with a good storytelling style and irreverence. The book stays well away from the touchiest political/social topics of the day, concentrating on stuff we can all meet on -- hating one's day job, finding the love of one's life and discovering her butt is always cold, why hunting is ridiculous but considered cool by many Southern men, stuff like that. Ostensibly it's a biography, but it meanders quite a bit, duplicating some things from the stage shows. I liked it, personally.
