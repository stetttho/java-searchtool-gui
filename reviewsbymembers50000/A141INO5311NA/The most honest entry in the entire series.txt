 I always got the impression, reading the Little House series, that the events in Laura's life had been sanitized. When I got older, I found out that I was right -- all sorts of important details got left out because Laura felt they were too personal, or too unpleasant to share, and usually both, like her baby brother's death. Because this book wasn't ever meant to be part of the series, it ends up being the most honest. Laura's life here is presented as is, with no shame or excuses. Her miscarriage, the great debt trouble she and her husband had, terrifying run-ins with Indians, her day-to-day hassles learning how to run a household, and, worst of all, a devastating fire, are all presented in Laura's usual lean prose. Other Little House books concern themselves as much with how life was lived as with Laura's story, but this is more Laura's story and less a treatise on how to do pioneer things. Thus, it is the shortest book in the series (except for "On the Way Home", which I'm not sure counts). But to me, it's one of the most satisfying in the series, though I suspect that not everybody will like it, since it IS so different from the rest of the series. (It is perfectly appropriate for children, in my opinion, with no sex, bad language, or non-farm-related violence.)
