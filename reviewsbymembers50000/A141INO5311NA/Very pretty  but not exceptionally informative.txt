 This was fabulous to have before "Fellowship of the Ring" came out, but it was really just an appetite-whetter. It's got very pretty pictures and some good interviews, but there isn't anything here you wouldn't have seen already from the six gazillion "making of" shows floating around on cable just before the movie premiered. There's no real depth to it at all; it isn't even very thick. That said, it really *is* very pretty, with lots of nice pictures and decent writing. I don't regret getting it, but would I have bought it after seeing all the "making of" shows and seeing the movie itself? Very doubtful.
