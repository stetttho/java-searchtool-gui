 I'm hoping the "Worst Case" series doesn't degenerate much further. The original actually *was* pretty useful, but this, the third or so in the series, is just humor, with little that's actually useful on a date. What are my dating worst-case scenarios? Getting spaghetti sauce on one's shirt, getting too drunk, inadvertently bringing up something controversial, discovering some Awful Truth about your date that makes you want to get up and run away, etc. Some of these are addressed ("How to leave a date in a hurry", "How to tell if your date is really married"), but too few to make sense. The rest are just silly (like "how to tell if your date is really a woman"). Frankly, I view this book as an enjoyable foray into bizarre problems, but not actually something useful. For all that, it IS terribly funny. The style is different from the earlier two books, but it's still hilarious imagining someone in these situations (like a guy running around a girl's apartment hoping to figure out her name from her mail before she wakes up.. advice which totally disregards that a lot of women don't go by their "official" first names!).
