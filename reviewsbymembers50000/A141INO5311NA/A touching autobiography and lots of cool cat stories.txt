 The late and dearly missed Dr. Camuti talks about his veterinarian practice in the big city, which concentrates on cats but which includes all sorts of other fauna. His stories are as much about the animals' kooky owners as the animals themselves, showing a touching side of wackiness. There are some famous people in here, but plenty of nearly-anonymous commoners as well. His writing style is approachable and easily read, and the stories are unique -- you won't have seen anything like these elsewhere. This is not your typical "cat stories" book, all treacley and preachy and maudlin. This is a straightforward guy telling straightforward "no [kidding], there I was"-style war stories, and sounding just like a prototypical NYC veterinarian should. Do be careful about adopting his advice, of course. Nowadays, we know feeding cats only ground beef is Very Bad For Them, and certainly we have no need of quarterly vitamin shots. This is 1950s medicine, with all that entails.
