 While I realize it's not an exact copy of the original, it is a wonderful look at food from the 50s and 60s. I got it because of my fascination with food history and wasn't disappointed.  50s food was garish and a bit twee, but there's still a lot here that will sound appealing to modern readers. I just made the Hot Fudge Pudding (a baked chocolate bread-style pudding) that was without question one of the strangest things I've ever cooked, but it was absolutely delicious--made the entire cookbook worth the buy, just that recipe right there. I've made flourless chocolate torte and STILL think this was the weirdest dessert I've ever made.  Nothing here is outside a kid's abilities; it's all just following directions. There's some chopping and oven use, but none of the talking-down that other children's cookbooks employ ("get an adult to turn the oven on" being the most irritating example of this, and all absent from this book). Recipes tend toward the simple--chili, soup, biscuits, cakes, cookies, salads, breakfasts--with a concentration on making the food appealing to kids.  I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars because most of it's arranging food, with no actual cooking. Page after page of imaginative ways to put fruit on cereal and make shapes out of salad parts isn't my idea of cooking. I'd rather have had more actual recipes. But that's my own preference. As a snapshot of another era, this is a fantastic little book and I wouldn't hesitate to suggest someone buy it as a gift. I'm not sure how much actual kids would enjoy it, but adults and food wonks should love it, and introducing it to a child as "This is how I ate when I was your age" should work well. And do try the Hot Fudge Pudding thing; if that doesn't convert them, nothing will.
