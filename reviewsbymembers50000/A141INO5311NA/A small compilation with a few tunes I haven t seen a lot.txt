 At only 8 tracks, this compilation is definitely not on par with other collections. However, it does have a few songs on it I haven't seen in a lot of other collections, particularly "Private Eyes" and "Funkytown". It has some others that are on far too many, as well ("Who's Zoomin' Who" especially). Sound quality is fine on my CD, otherwise.
