 Concerning itself mainly with Florence in the last half of the 1400s, this book tells how to look at paintings and get garb out of them. More than a hundred black-and-white illustrations and details are included and each reproduction is discussed in sections detailing general cut, men's and women's dress (doublets and hose, dresses, "overtunics", etc.), headgear for women (not for men), sleeves for men and women, and chemises. One of the most useful chapters (aside from the sleeve ones, which are cool) is about fasteners. Birbari cuts right through to show tons of little details, such as the custom in portraits of *always* letting a little bit of undershirt show atop a doublet's collar. It's true, every portrait I've ever seen does show this, but I'd never noticed it before she pointed it out. She also provides information for telling how pattern pieces are cut, and what sort of fabrics one is looking at in a painting. Sumptuary laws, embroidery vs. woven designs, seam placement, linings, pleating, and more topics are covered. There's even a teeny chapter at the end about not trusting everything you see in a painting. I would have loved seeing the book be longer, and I'd have loved to have seen technical terms given for the garb discussed. I must admit I don't agree with everything she says, either. But she's mainly writing for the theatre crowd, not necessarily the SCA/re-enactment crowd (which is where I hang out). That explains the book's perceived shortcomings. I still think it's a wonderful reference despite this. This book is for experienced seamstresses and avid costumers. No real instructions for actual construction are provided (there're a few gridded patterns, but not many), only pointers for interpreting what you're seeing in paintings of the time. It definitely focuses on Florence, though other cities are marginally represented. Also, it is out of print. You can expect it to be hard to find...
