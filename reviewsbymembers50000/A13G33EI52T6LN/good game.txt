 I am not too much of a sim fan but this game is really good.  The graphics are beautiful on the higher settings (machine gun shells spill from under your fuselage, vapor trails from wingtips at high altitude, the clouds are amazing, starry night skies etc..) and the many choices of viewpoints are cool as well as very helpful. I am not giving it 5 stars because of the annoyingly LONG and BORING flights to and from the target areas.  I know this is a realism thing but it really hurts the gameplay.  I have put the game on 8x speed, gone and get something to eat, and come back after five minutes and I'm still not there!  Otherwise, this is a must have for all you simmers.  Real super fun.
