 For cheap thrills, Tropico is a good game. By now, it can be bought in most stores for around $10.  While the premise of being the dictator of your own island is an intruiging one, there are a couple of quirks that keep the game from really living up to its promises.   Asassinate a rival political candidate to ensure your victory in the upcoming election and another person instantly steps up to run against you.  Kill the new candidate and another volunteers!  Don't they get the hint?! The game is too short.  You can only rule for a maximum of 70 years. (Isn't Castro going on year 115?) On the more difficult settings, it is almost impossible to make any cool progress in this amount of time.  Freighters arrive to buy exports only a few times a year and large buildings take forever to build (especially if they are built away from the center of your town, like airports and hotels)  For the price of a cheap dinner out or a few video rentals, Tropico delivers some enjoyable and silly gameplay.
