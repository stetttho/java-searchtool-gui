 Some of the reviewers of this book seem put off by Trefethen's opinionated writing style.  I enjoyed it thoroughly.  This book was not meant to be read by someone on a boat, but rather someone who is thinking about being  on a boat.  If there were more cruising books like this one, there would be  a body of literature from which a budding cruiser could read, compare  opinions and then decide for themselves what route is the best for them.   I'd rather have an author tell it like he/she thinks it is than say  "you'll just have to find out for yourself."
