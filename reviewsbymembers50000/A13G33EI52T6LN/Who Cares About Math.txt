 Don't discount the validity of this book just because Aczel isn't a world renowned mathematician.  I could care less how good he is at math.  He sure is a pretty good writer though.  And whether you believe in God or  not...there is no denying the fact that the closer one gets to a unifying  theory of the universe, the more and more one realizes that there is and  always will be something curious about it that resists description with  mere words or numbers.  I think the title is an excellent one.
