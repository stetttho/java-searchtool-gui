 I can watch this movie over and over again.  So many classic scenes.  What makes this movie even funnier is that probably every character in it is based on an actual person living right now in California.  Don't worry about the significance of the plot...just sit back and watch the pure comedic genius as Jeff Bridges and Co. explore the possiblilites of what can happen when perfectly innocent morons start to make plans.
