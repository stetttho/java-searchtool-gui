 Amazing film.   Sharp, memorable, hilarious dialogue:   "I'll be taking these Huggies and whatever cash you got." "Do these balloons blow up into funny shapes and all?" -    "No...unless round is funny." "When there was no meat we ate fowl. When there was no fowl we ate crawdad.  And when there was no crawdad to be found...we ate sand." "What did the boy's jammies look like?"      "I don't know! They were jammies! They had Yodas and ... on 'em!" Great acting.  John Goodman, Nicolas Cage, Holly Hunter and everyone alse are stellar and dead on. The cutest toddler you'll ever see on film. Raising Arizona is up there on my list of great films like Blade Runner, American Beauty, Shawshank Redemption, Apocalyse Now and Magnolia.
