 "I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side as a condemned soul, than to enter heaven without you."   Enough said. I criticize this film for the many times that it seems to focus on technical wows and high wire antics, often at the expense of potentially great drama.  Chow Yun Fat's words in his final scene all make up for it though.  This would be a truly great movie with less hidden wires and more Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh together. The only thing that bothers me about the DVD is that you have to watch the same scenes over and over before accesing the menu.
