 Thousands of people died in the September 11th attacks yet not many in America seem to care WHY.  Well I care and Chomsky cares and you should too so that it won't have to happen again. Other reviewers have more eloquently stated why this is a most important book.  Short and to the point because there is nothing complicated and long winded about why those horrible attacks took place. It is all out there in broad daylight for anyone who wants to wake up and look.  I love it here in America, but make no mistake that everyday people all over the world die for American interests. You don't [tick] someone off enough to want to kill themselves by being the "brightest beacon for freedom and opportunity in the world", you do it by being the exact opposite.  Years of death, starvation and oppressive economic embargos led to those attacks. How do you cash in on 9/11 by selling a book for [money]??? You don't. Others have though with their [expensive] coffee table photo albums (now that's disgusting) and their [even more expensive] terrorist emergency kits.  There will always be a market for big color pictures of death and destruction. Too bad there never seems to be much of one for preventing it. Popular media won't talk to him so Chomsky has to publish his thoughts in print in a little pamphlet that every American should read.
