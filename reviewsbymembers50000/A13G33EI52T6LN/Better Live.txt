 Saw this band open for Brad a couple yars ago and bought the CD just because I thought they ROCKED!  I was a little dissapointed in the arrangement of the album. Too many violins and other doo-dads overpowering  the really good tunes.  I'll give it 5 stars cause' I really like their  live show. Album is so-so.  The only song that relfects their live power is  Devil in My Palm.
