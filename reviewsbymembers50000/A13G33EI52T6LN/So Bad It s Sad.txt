 WOW!! This movie is bad!  Not Michael Jackson Bad, but really awful. I cannot believe that some of the same poeple who helped create the Matrix were involved in this pathetic excuse for a movie.  Where did they get the machine gun noises from? - recordings of cap guns? The opening action sequence on the bridge is done so poorly that I literally cringed in my seat and started laughing in amazement.  How could a director watch that and say "Print!"?? Tom Arnold and a few topless dancer shots help make about 5 minutes worth of the movie watchable.  Can you name ONE character that Steven Segal has ever played??  Neither can I. That's because he is one of the worst actors ever put on film.  His calm, Zen, toughyetsensitive guy schtik has been soooo played out over countless mediocre films. Segal is as out of shape as ever in this one and it is tough to tell whether the fight scenes were shot in slow motion or if the actors are just tired.  I won't even start in on DMX...Didn't people learn their lesson from Belly?
