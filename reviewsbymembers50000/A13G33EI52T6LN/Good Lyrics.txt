 I agree that this is Rage's best album lyrically to date.  However, the music and rythms don't hold a candle to Evil Empire or even the first album (what is that one called anyway? with the monks burning themselves) The  rythms are moody, often mushy and don't seem to flow very well at times.  Still, if Guerilla Radio dosen't make you get up and jump and scream then  there is no cure for you my friend.
