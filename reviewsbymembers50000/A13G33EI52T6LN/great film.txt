 Fight Club is a wonderful movie.  Even though it gets a little weird and past itself at the end, it is still great to watch.  Fincher is one of the best directors around and never compromises.  Norton and Pitt are top notch as usual.   The first half of the film is really the best.  "The things you own, end up owning you."  The scene where Pitt threatens the 7-11 clerk to follow his dream of being a veteranarian or he'll kill him.  Why men join the "fight clubs." These are themes that I wish the movie would have explored more.  Instead the second half takes us on a rollercoaster plot to blow up a bunch of office buildings. Another great Fincher film.  Doesn't hold a candle to SEVEN though.
