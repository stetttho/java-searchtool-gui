 great guidebook.  Describes in detail the good, the bad and the ugly of Nepal.  The language section was extremely useful.  A few hours spent learning some useful greetings and phrases will pay off tenfold upon arrival in Nepal. Being able to bargain or ask for directions in the native language is a lot of fun and much appreciated, especially since most travellers do not take the time to learn anything more than "Namaste."
