 I bought this CD way back in June of 2003 and, like many other CDs I buy, it sat on my shelf for more than a year until I noticed that I had it.  I always knew "You Keep Me Hangin On" and "Kids in America," so I figured I would like the other songs, but hardly listened to it once I received it.  It wasn't until today, actually, Sept. 1, 2004, that I began to like the CD.  I woke up nearly an hour late for work, and simply grabbed whatever CD I could find in the dark (this was at 5:30 am) to listen to in the car.   I don't know how this works, but I simply suddenly LOVED all the songs!  Kim is definitely one of the forgotten relics from the era of big hair and bad synth, and she should've had more success in American by far.    Many say they don't care for "Cambodia," but it's one of my favs.  "Rage to Love" and "The Second Time" I like a lot, too.  Hearing "You Came" and "Never Trust a Stranger" was like hearing God!    I don't dislike any of the songs on this album.  And if you're a fan of 80s music, you won't, either.  :)
