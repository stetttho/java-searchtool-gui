 I'm gonna keep this one short.    This is arguably one of the BEST movies I've ever seen in terms of screenplay, acting, directing, just everything!  But it's really the screenplay that takes center stage here.  Very imaginative and very original.  I thought Adaptation reached new heights, and now Eternal Sunshine has totally topped it!  And Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet have NEVER been better.    This one will go down in history as being one of definitive movies of the first decade of the 21st Century ... the wily "Millennium Years."
