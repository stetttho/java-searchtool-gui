 By the time this album was released (internationally) in 1997, Sheena Easton hadn't had anything close to a hit in America since 1991 (when "What Comes Naturally" reached #19 pop).  This album is a rarity and something of a "collector's item."  Anyway, while it sounds quite "90s," it's not all that different from anything she's released in the past; it's merely just another collection of some good pop songs, some slow some up-tempo.  The first half of this album is awesome, but it begins to drag towards the end.  The average listener will not want to spend 60-plus dollars for this, so they should stick to one of the many greatest hits collections out there.  But those who LOVE her as much as I do ... it's well-worth the money you might spend.  My favorite songs are "When You Speak My Name," "Love Me with Freedom," and "One Man."  But, in my opinion, the best song on the album is the sexy, smokey ballad called "Misty Blue."  It gets me in the mood every time!
