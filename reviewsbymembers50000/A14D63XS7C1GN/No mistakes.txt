 This 1981 album made Kim Carnes a star, but was also her undoing, as she found it impossible to follow up.  The big hit here, of course, was "Bette Davis Eyes," while "Draw of the Cards" also charted.  Basically, this album worked as sort of a transition for Kim; the songs are a somehow comfortable blend of country and pop.  It's also a precursor to the crazy-80s-synth tunes Kim would come out with next, before meandering back to country at the end of the decade.  All the songs on this album are good, but keep in mind I'm a big Kim fan and like ALL her 80s stuff.  If you're a big 80s fan, too, then this should not disappoint.
