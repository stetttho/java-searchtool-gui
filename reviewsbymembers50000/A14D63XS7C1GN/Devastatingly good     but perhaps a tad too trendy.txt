 Since 2000, it seems as though the only actresses to win Best Actress Oscars are the ones that are scrumptiously  beautiful in real life, but ... dress down for their movies.  Arguably, Julia Roberts did this in "Erin Brockovich" in 2000, Halle Berry in 2001, and Nicole Kidman in 2002 ... which brings us to Charlize Theron in 2003.    But luckily Charlize gave us an INCREDIBLE and SHOCKING performance to match the incredible and shocking makeup she had to wear in Monster.  Her Oscar is well-deserved.  And it's a shame Cristina Ricci's performance wasn't recognized.  AND ... I'm not really sure all of the murders featured in the movie could be deemed "brutal" other than the first one we're shown on-screen.  In real life I'm sure they were, but ... the movie is mainly a basic love story, and less emphasis is put on the murders.  The second-to-last scene (where Selby and Aileen are on the phone) will reduce you to tears, and in a way ... we actually feel sorry for Aileen and I think that was the intent of the movie.  ANYWAY, I usually go off on tangents, but ... the first half of the 2000s, like I said, was all about actresses dressing down, REALLY down.  I just hope that 2004's winner (which I'm predicting will be Annette Bening) will not have to dress down just to win an Oscar, because acting should come from the inside and not the outside.  BY THE WAY ... Annette Bening did NOT wind up winning like I thought she would.  The winner (for the second time) was Hilary Swank, the "million dollar baby."  Someday Annette!  But kudos to me because I wrote this review during the summer before the Oscar race officially took off, and even then I figured Annette would be nominated.  So there.
