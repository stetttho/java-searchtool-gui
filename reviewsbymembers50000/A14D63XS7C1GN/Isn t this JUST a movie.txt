 As I'm reading all the other reviews of "The Contender" here on Amazon, I'm realizing that people seem to have taken it WAY too seriously!  Lighten up, people!  It's just a movie!  If I remember correctly, this was Joan Allen's first leading role (or at least her first one in a long time), and she does a marvelous job, and deservedly deserves her Best Actress Oscar nomination (this was the year Julia Roberts won, by the way).  ALL of the performances are first-rate in this one, especially Jeff Bridges as Mr. President (who's somehow witty AND decisive at the same time), as well as the ingenious screenplay and direction.  Although I DO understand why this movie received the negative critical reviews it did (not counting Amazon reviews), I definitely think it should have received a little more love once Oscar time rolled around back in 2000.  It's currently July, 2005 ... any other Joan Allen fans out there?  Any Academy members reading this right now?  Let's take our girl all the way to another Best Actress nomination for "The Upside of Anger"!
