 "Voyeur" was the 1982 follow-up to Kim Carnes's 1981 smash "Mistaken Identity."  The album was not really a success at all.  And unfortunately (though fortunately for me) Kim Carnes became part of the big corporate money-making-music machine of the 1980s, churning out album after album with little or no artistic control or input, with little or no success.  "Voyeur" was the first single, and really the only hit ... and that was even a stretch considering it only made #29 pop.  But there are many more wonderful songs besides this one on the album, including "Looker," "Say You Don't Know Me," and "Undertow."  But my favorite is the power-ballad "Does it Make You Remember."  Kim sings this one with such conviction and such passion ... that you really begin to feel sorry for her, and wish her career in the pop/rock mainstream was longer and more lucrative.    Like many other artists of the era (Sheena Easton and Laura Branigan come to mind), Kim deserved to be a superstar.
