 Basically this Innocence Mission album is very acoustic, with some percussion and some piano/keyboards, but mostly it's a showcase for Karen's voice, which has never sounded better.  At first I was a tad off-put because it doesn't "rock" as much as their previous 3 efforts, but one must appreciate this one as it is.  And you don't really need to worry about the "Christian" lyrics because, honestly, I can't tell that they're there.  If they are actually there, they're so vague that I haven't yet noticed, even after reading them in the accompanying booklet.  Karen's voice takes you to a different place, a different plane of existence.  For me, I can't exactly say where or what that place is, but I do know it is out-of-mind.  That's the type of music Innocence Mission has always done, and this album does not fail on that point.
