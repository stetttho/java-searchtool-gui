 Karen Peris of the Innocence Mission has the distinction of sounding basically like NO ONE else.  And her voice has a certain quality that can simply reduce one to tears.  On this album, like all the others, there are a few up-tempo songs, but ... I prefer the slower ones.  And this may sound morbid, but ... I've always loved listening to their records alone in the dark, just crying my eyes out.  This album is no exception, and like many other reviewers, I would rank it right up there at #2, just behind the 1989 debut (which is a pop masterpiece).  I was going to take the time to list what my favorite songs on this album are, but honestly I can't seem to weed out the good from the bad ... they're all great.  In fact, it's a privelage to say that out of all the Innocence Mission songs in existence there's only maybe two or three that I don't care for, and those are on the second album.  But since I feel I MUST pick out some favorites, they would be "Too Early to Say," "Today," and "Oh Do Not Fly Away."  Music, to me, is supposed to represent--mainly--some sort of escapism from life.  The weird thing is the Innocence Mission sings ABOUT life ... and that's exactly the escapism I seem to need.
