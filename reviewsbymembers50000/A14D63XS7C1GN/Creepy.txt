 The Mothman Prophecies is based on a book of the same name, which is based on allegedly true events that took place in West Virginia in the late 1960s, thought similar situations occur in the present day in various parts of the world ... if you believe all that.  I'm not going to spoil the plot by discussing anything specific in the movie, but basically I knew the real Mothman story before I saw the movie so I already knew how it would end.  But even if you're like me and you already know what happens, you'll be in for some shocks because the road the movie takes to get to that last scene, last revelation if you will, is an eerie, suspenseful one.  This was actually one of the scariest movies I've seen in a really long time, maybe because all this stuff was supposed to have taken place in real life.  Even though I've had the DVD for like 2 years now I still get the chills every time I watch it.  So in that sense the movie "works."  And actually, I thought for sure that Richad Gere would ruin the whole thing because I can't get the Officer and a Gentleman impression out of my head, but ... nothing at all was ruined and he turns in a very dramatic performance, even if it is a tad over the top.  And I agree that Debra Messing and Laura Linney's characters were underdeveloped, so ... they're good eye candy, but don't add to or take anything away from your viewing experience.    I'd compare Mothman Prophecies to Signs because both have that Alfred Hitchcock feel to them.  And if you like weird movies, then you won't be disappointed.
