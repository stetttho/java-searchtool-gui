 This movie was a 1989 nominee for the Best Foreign-Language Film Oscar, and, amazingly enough, received a Best Actress citation as well for Isabelle Adjani's outstanding performance.   This is the story of the title woman, an accomplished, renowned--albeit looney--artist/sculptress.  That is basially, in a nutshell, the only real problem I had with the movie; it resorts to cliche and tries to tell us that she was crazy, when all she wanted was to be loved by her husband, the artist Rodin (Gerard Depardieu).  This all allegedly happened in real life, keep in mind, and what we think is going to happen actually does happen towards the end of the movie.    The story is long, but satisfying.  Isabelle Adjani is a sight to behold, as she's both a beautiful woman and an amazing actress; she'd have to be to hold our attention for almost three hours.  And the French language truly will have an effect on all the non-speakers out there, like myself (but thank God for subtitles).  All-in-all, definitely some good stuff.  If anyone wants to see more movies in the French language, check out "Indochine," starring the lovely Catherine Deneuve, and "Blue" starring the lovely Juliette Binoche.    All of the above are excellent foreign movies.
