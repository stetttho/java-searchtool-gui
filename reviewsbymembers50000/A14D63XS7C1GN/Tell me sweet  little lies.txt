 This movie is an absolute BLAST!!!  Usually I don't care much for action movies, but this one definitely took the taco!  The special effects are definitely special, considering this movie was made in 1994.  And actually, the whole nuclear arms smuggling/Arab terrorism is a terrible foreshadowing, if you think about it; some of the action toward the end of the movie actually mirrors the events of 9/11.  Anyhow, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Tom Arnold are simply hilarious.  Jamie Lee Curtis (as the first Arnold's wife) won a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Musical/Comedy for her role in this one, and she does not disappoint.  She doesn't disappoint in the sex department, either; from what I understand she required NO body doubles.  And veteran actor Charlton Heston has an agreeable cameo.  This is surely a crowd-pleasing movie across the board; it has something for everyone.  Highly imaginative and well-executed; many notches above the tripe they hand us in the mid-2000s.
