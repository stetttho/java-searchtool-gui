 ALL of the performances in this movie are EXCELLENT, especially Ellen Burstyn, who deservedly was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress, 2000 (but somehow lost to Julia Roberts).    The movie starts off light, but gradually builds into this living nightmare, complete with SPOILER ALERT arm amputations, sexual exploits, and electroshock "therapy."  The whole amputation thing didn't really bother me, but seeing Ellen Burstyn getting SHOCKED simply for popping diet pills like candy did.  I had NO idea that something that trivial could drive someone mad, and this madness would actually require that type of therapy, but my mother verified this information for me ... and that's because she herself went a little crazy on diet pills in her younger days.    An eye-opening movie, to say the least, but ... if you're squeamish, WATCH OUT!
