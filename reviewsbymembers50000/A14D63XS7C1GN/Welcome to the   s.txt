 I entered junior high school, graduated from high school, began college and "came of age" in the 1990s, and the reason this movie struck so close to home for my sister and I is because we knew people in real life that mirrored the characters in the movie.  The bitchy sluts, the boys overdosed on testosterone, the slit-my-wrists-and-rub-the-blood-on-the-wall kids (boys and girls alike) and, most of all, the Parents That Didn't Give a Damn.  The performances in this movie are first-rate and sometimes you might think you're watching a documentary.  But ... the problem is the characters in the movie don't seem to be "characters" as much as they seem to be points-of-view.  On the surface everything is golden, but there's not much below and no emotional center.  Just events occurring and people reacting.  For example, Evan Rachel Wood likes to slit her wrists for whatever reason, but we never REALLY find out why.  We just ASSUME it's because her world is "spinning out of control."  The "spinning out of control" part brings me to my next point.  I, like other reviewers, had trouble sympathizing with ANYONE in the movie.  Some view this movie as a lesson on how tough it is to be a teenager, and/or how tough it is to be a parent.  But after seeing it myself and looking back on my time in school in the 90s ... it's a lesson on how people are afraid of--and shy away from--life's responsibilities, adults and their children alike.    Evan Rachel Wood's character had everything a spoiled thirteen-year-old could want, save that fancy pair of jeans, and Holly Hunter's character didn't wanna find a real job.  Do they really deserve sympathy?   Grow up.
