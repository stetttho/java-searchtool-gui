 In the middle of 2003 when I first got this movie I was blown away by all of its beauty, detail, and sense of time and place and character, and I'm still blown away and never get sick of this movie!    Julianne Moore is just PERFECT as a 1950s housewife, and Dennis Quaid is equally as good as a closeted queer.  ;)  He was robbed at the 2002 Oscars of a Best Supporting Actor nomination.  Dennis Haysbert's role is similar to the role he had in Love Field, and I know others have said that already.  It's just the truth.  I think he's been typecast.  And actually, Patricia Clarkson is a vision as Julianne's best friend, even though she's nosey and gossipy and you wanna smack her sometimes, but she's been given a sumptuous role that she, too, is perfect for.  But ... this is how life actually was in the 1950s.  And I feel sorry for, and I know you will to, the children in the movie.  Basically, the reason that our parents (I'm 23) turned out the way they did is because of the way their parents treated them, and ... you'll just have a better understanding of this concept when you see the movie.  This is one of my favorite movies, and it's destined to be a classic in decades to come.  The director and the actors are brilliant.  Everything in this movie COMPLETELY works, and it's not often that that happens.
