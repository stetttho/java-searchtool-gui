 I'm actually very privelaged because I own ALL of Laura's proper studio albums ON CD, including this out-of-print 1985 album, "Hold Me."  This album actually received a LOT of negative reviews, and was the first Laura album not to go gold.  But this may actually seem strange if you listen to it now because it really doesn't sound very different from her first 3 releases.  "Hold Me," "Maybe Tonight," "Foolish Lullaby," and "Spanish Eddie" are all awesome, perfect 1980s synthpop.  "Forever Young" follows next, and it's the only song on the CD that I almost always skip.  "I Found Someone" comes after that, and this is the same song that Cher brought into the Top 10 in 1987.  But Laura's version is more melancholy and more subdued, and not as polished as Cher's version; it's just a tad better if you ask me.  The remainder of the songs on the second half of the collection aren't as good as the ones on the first half, but are still very listenable and enjoyable, even if they do sort of blend together somewhat.    I found this CD on Ebay for less than 5 dollars.  Odds are you won't find it that cheap anywhere anymore, especially now that Laura has passed.  Perhaps someday her CDs will all be remastered and reissued like Sheena Easton's.  One can only hope ...
