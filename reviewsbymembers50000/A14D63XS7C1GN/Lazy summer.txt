 It's always been hard to try to put Mazzy Star (Hope Sandoval's first band) into any category.  One could say they're rock or folk or "pop" ... mostly whenever anyone asks me I say they're "psychadelic" or "alternative" country, if such a thing does exist.    Hope is now aligned with a new band called New Inventions, but, goodie for us, there's nothing all that different from Mazzy Star that's going to alienate us away.  Hope's sad, pretty melodies and her harmonicas and chiming guitars are still there (though this time they're all acoustic), as well as her somewhat "drugged-up," pondering, meandering, whispering voice.    The music itself reminds me of a hot summer day, and it's the best music to relax to and forget all that's bothering you.  Unfortunately, it's still sometimes too difficult to memorize the lyrics because you can't quite understand what Hope is saying or singing, but ... memorizing the lyrics wasn't always the best route to go down anyway; the atmospherics themselves are enough to take you away and bring satisfaction.
