 I first heard Delerium's "Karma" sometime at the end of the year 2000; the world, of which, was an entirely different place.  Or maybe it was the fact that I was but 19 years old at the time and looked at every new experience with the widest eyes ...  Anyway, I fell in love with Delerium, and for that matter, electronic music right then and there.  I found out sometime later that Gregorian chants and all the "New Age" had actually died with the 1990s, but to this day I am NOT dismayed in the least.  And everytime I listen to this album (to me it still holds up today), I look back in wonder and amazement, with real nostalgia for that world that existed before this "Age of Terrorism."  As I mentioned earlier, the musical elements contained within "Karma" are electronic beeps, swoops and mysteriousness; Gregorian chants and tribal voices and rhythms; and sultry female vocals.  "Silence," featuring guest-vocals by Sarah McLachlan, was a big hit from this album, albeit in any part of the English-speaking world aside from the United States.  "Twilight" and "Remembrance" also stand as electronic masterpieces.  Electronic music, in fact, was supposed to be the "sound of the 21st Century," but ... somehow we got stuck with hip-hop instead.  But if you're in the mood for that 1990s sound, then Delerium's "Karma" is one of your best bets.  Another good choice would "Le Roi est Mort" by Enigma, circa 1996.
