 I first purchased "Beekeeper" in April of 2005, after I'd fallen in love with Tori's earlier work (except "Scarlet's Walk").  What I liked best about Tori initially was that she always seemed pissed off about something, and her music was extremely interesting and edgy; no two songs sounded the same.  When I first listened to "Beekeeper" I was put off because it's very calm; it seemed as if she'd lost her edge.  It took me nearly six months (as usual) to finally get into it.  And although it's subdued and tranquil for the most part, it's far from just "bad".  Almost all the songs on the album are first-rate (like every other Tori album).  It's difficult to listen to the entire album in one sitting because it's so long, but I have managed to get through it a few times.  I can't exactly pick just one favorite song, but some favoriteS are "Parasol," "The Power of Orange Knickers," "Jamaica Inn," "Sleeps with Butterflies," "Ribbons Undone," "Marys of the Sea," the tragic "Toast," and the list goes on and on.  With all that said, I didn't quite enjoy the bonus interview on the DVD.  It's difficult to listen to Tori talk for a long period of time like that; she began rambling on and on, and I quickly lost interest.  I can say, however, that she's far from what I would call UNinteresting.  And it's refreshing to see an artist so passionate about their work.  The previous album to "Beekeeper" is "Scarlet's Walk," which I didn't get until after "Beekeeper."  They're both similar in that they're both epics; "Scarlet" also contains 18 songs.  At first I couldn't listen to it, either, but ... I have been getting into it more, and it's just as good as anything Tori's ever done.  Don't let the initial sound and feel turn you off!
