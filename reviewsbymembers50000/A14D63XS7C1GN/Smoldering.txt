 I noticed in 2003 that Alannah Myles had a "new" single for sale at amazon.com called "Like Flames."  I suspected that this was simply a cover of the old Berlin song from 1986 (on "Count Three and Pray"), and I was right.  And although I'm a huge Berlin fan, I like this Alannah version a lot better.  Love the guitars and harmonicas, and the "modern" feel!  The most curious and most dismaying aspect of the disc is that it offers three versions: the radio version, a crappy remix and ... an album version.  But there hasn't been a new Alannah album in years, and I would know because I have all four of her originals.  Hopefully someday there WILL be a new Alannah album, or at least another single to tide us true fans over.  Curse American radio for NOT playing "Like Flames"!
