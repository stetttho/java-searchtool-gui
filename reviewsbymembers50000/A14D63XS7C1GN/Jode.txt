 I'm also gonna keep this one short.    Yes, the movie is "good."  Yes, Jodie Foster is excellent (as usual).    The only problem I had with this movie was that at the end in the courtroom, Nell--wary of a lot of people, remember--is able to stand up and deliver a moving, emotional speech before the judge, and ALSO comprehend what everyone in that court was saying to/about her.  Suddenly she wasn't scared or nervous?  On the other hand ... it can be argued that at that very moment her whole life suddenly made sense and her plight became clear.    Perhaps the movie, like MANY others, was made so that the viewer can dream up their own interpretation about what REALLY was going on.  Jodie Foster received her third Best Actress Oscar nomination for this 1994 performance.  If she had won--and many believed she was going to because it was anybody's game in 94--it would have been her third win in less than 10 years, which is TERRIBLY unprecedented.  It's difficult enough even getting nominated!
