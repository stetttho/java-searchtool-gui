 This movie was released in 1986 with little fanfare, though it was directed by Sidney Lumet and starred former superstar Jane Fonda; it was simply a failure.  Yet somehow Jane managed to receive her umpteenth Best Actress Academy Award nomination, the fluke to end all flukes.    The movie itself isn't very difficult to watch, though at times it's extremely hokey and tongue-in-cheek.  Admittedly, however, it does have its exciting, interesting moments.  Jane's Best Actress nomination was enough for me to pre-order the DVD (having already seen the movie on VHS format).  If you look at the four other women that were nominated with Jane in 1986, you'll find that it was another one of those "slow" years, and Jane MAY have received her nomination simply because there was no one else to nominate.  This isn't Jane's or any woman's fault; in the 1980s there was an astonishing lack of strong, meaty roles for women in movies.  For the most part this situation still exists today, though in the 2000s it has bettered dramatically; just see "Monster," "Million Dollar Baby," and "Being Julia" to see what I mean.  "The Morning After" is not a "hit" movie, and its DVD release will not set rooms on fire with astounding sales figures.  And it's most likely only being released because of Jane's recent success with "Monster-in-Law."  But as a movie fan, it might be important to continue to support the on-going cause for better roles for women.  And by buying (for cheap, hopefully) "The Morning After," you'll be doing just that.
