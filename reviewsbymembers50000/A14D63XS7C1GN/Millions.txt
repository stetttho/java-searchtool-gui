 While watching as Hilary Swank received her SECOND Best Actress Oscar in five years, I grew extremely pissed because she'd beaten Annette Bening AGAIN.  I understand why she won over her for her performance in "Boys Don't Cry" from 1999, but ... she beat her out AGAIN?!  I decided many moons ago that each year I would collect all five of the Best Actress movies (and I've collected all of them since 1980), so that meant, to my chagrin, "Million Dollar Baby" was completely necessary.  In my eyes, Annette Bening in "Being Julia" IS the Best Actress Oscar-winner of 2004 ... but after waiting for seven months for "Million Dollar Baby" to arrive, I can understand why Hilary received all the awards hoopla that she did ... and after I turned my DVD player off after the movie, I found myself a believer and a Hilary Swank fan.  I'm not going to rehash what so many others have said about this movie; just know that Hilary Swank kicks ass, and she'll be remembered decades from now, for "Boys Don't Cry" AND "Million Dollar Baby."  I can't wait to see what she comes out with next.  Let's hope she doesn't pull another "Affair of the Necklace."  Just a side note ... has anyone else noticed the striking similarities between the careers of Hilary Swank and Sally Field?  Go to the official Academy Awards database website, and check out the years 1979, 1984, 1999 and 2004 to see what I mean!  Haunting ...
