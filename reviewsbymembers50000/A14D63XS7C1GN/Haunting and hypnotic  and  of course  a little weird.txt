 First off, this movie is based on a book of memoirs, which, of course, are based on "actual" events.  I didn't read the book (I hardly ever do).  Emily Watson turned in another devastating performance, the first being her role in Breaking the Waves.  Both are also similar in the fact that they're both almost unbearable to watch at certain points.  In this one, that point was the point where Jackie, suffering from MS, is shaking--flailing--wildly and can't stop.  It's just so upsetting.  But we're compensated for this scene because soon after we're shown one where Jackie's sister, Hilary, is holding her in her arms and manages to get her to stop shaking, all while recalling their happier childhood.  It's truly HEARTBREAKING.  Then, of course, in the next scene ... okay, I won't spoil anything.  ;)  Emily Watson, it seems, gets to have a LOT of sex in her movies.  And, in fact, she just LOOKS like somebody that would do just that.  Basically, Hilary takes pity on her sister and shares her husband.  Shocking?  Yes.    More so because this is based on a true story, remember.   Basically, the movies I own fall into 3 categories: "sad," "depressing" and "totally f...ed up."  This one falls somewhere between "depressing" and the latter.  :)
