 For ONE MINUTE in the early 1980s Sheena Easton was the "next" female voice.  Her fifteen minutes of fame were just that ... fifteen mere minutes.  If you're a fan of 80s cheeseypop, then this is the album for you.  "A Little Tenderness" starts off the album nicely.  There's some uptempo numbers like "Just Another Broken Heart" and some ballads like the title track.  "Telephone Lines" has to be the most interesting song on the CD.    There's not really a whole lot to say; you could say the same things about EVERY Sheena Easton album from the 1980s (and I should know because I have all of them).  This kind of music is only going to appeal to those that ALREADY like it, like me.  For me it's awesome, but ... I doubt highly that new fans will be won in 2005.    But still, you own it, Sheena.
