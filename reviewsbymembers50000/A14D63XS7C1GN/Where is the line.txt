 I surely thought that "Vespertine" was going to go down as the weirdest Bjork album EVER, but ... upon listening to "Medulla" it's easy to see that she's outdone herself.  I loved the first 3 studio albums ("Debut," "Post" and "Homogenic") and "Selmasongs."  I was apprehensive when I first heard "Vespertine," but eventually grew to love it as well.  Now I'm sitting here with "Medulla" and I really don't know what's going on at all.  I can admire Bjork's ambition and savageness, and I'm always ready to shove a lot of credit her way for pushing the popular music envelope, BUT ... I think with this album she pushes that envelope just a tad far.  There are a handful of good songs ("Pleasure is All Mine," "Where is the Line," "Who is It," "Desired Constellation" and "Oceania," while "Triumph of a Heart" just makes it), but for the most part this is all just a lot of noise experimentation and obnoxiousness.  Bjork made her name by experimenting and being slightly obnoxious; those are the very reasons I, and many others, love her.  But ... all this noise takes away from the listening experience and isn't joyful at all.  There is no escapism whatsoever.  How are we supposed to enjoy HER when all this other stuff is swirling around?  The closeness and intimacy is long gone.  This might just be the fact that she's shied away from the electronica and alternative dance stuff she did originally, and I'm afraid she won't ever go back to the basics.  But I was expecting something more out of her.  Up to now I've never been disappointed with anything she ever did.  It's definitely a bad thing that she failed to deliver the goods this time.    I'll be wary of running out and buying anything with her name on it from now on, and I hate that.  :(
