 Basically, some archaeologists find a statue of the Babylonian demon called Pazuzu.  The evil spirit of Pazuzu travels out into the world and decides, for some unexplained reason, to inhabit the body of a young girl named Regan.  What winds up happening is a whirlwind of "scary" occurrences as Regan's mother (Ellen Burstyn) calls upon some priests to perform an exorcism on her daughter.  Sound preposterous?  This movie was actually based on a best-selling novel, which was Allegedly Based on True Events (just like "Amityville Horror" and "Mothman Prophecies" years later).    Now, I came of age in the late 1990s, the so-called "Blair Witch" era (which is still going on today), and by own personal standards this movie isn't all that shocking or scary.  There are senses of anxiety, tension and anticipation hanging in the air as you watch it, but ... for those of you that were born AFTER 1980, don't buy into the whole "scariest movie of all time" thing.  I don't exactly know what the scariest movie of all time actually is; I don't pretend to be an authority on the matter; the preceding was my own interpretation, mind you.  Just the same, the book and the movie were both huge hits.  The movie wound up receiving ten Oscar nominations, though I don't think Ellen Burstyn warranted enough screen time to receive her citation for Best Actress.  By early 1970s standards "The Exorcist" IS a technical masterpiece, and established a benchmark for horror movies well after the film's theatrical run.   By the way ... if anyone wants to see what Ellen Burstyn was REALLY capable of, check out 1974's "Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore" or 2000's "Requiem for a Dream."
