 First of all ... I think people that take the time to type up movie reviews forget what they're typing about, exactly.  Everybody says that Eva Peron lived a shallow-hallow life.  Okay, that's fine ... but then why discredit the movie for depicting this exact situation?  During the movie we, as viewers, are "emotionally distanced" from Madonna as Evita, but ... in real life that's exactly how her subjects felt, too, right?  So how does the movie "fail" on that account?  And as far as Madonna goes ... this was pretty much the first (and last) time I ever saw her "acting" in every sense of the word.  She was, by far, quite convincing.  Way to go on that Golden Globe win!  But I do understand the tediousness of sitting through two-plus hours of complete and utter singing and emoting.  There was simply NO downtime at all ANYWHERE during the course of the movie.  It works best watching it at home on television ... at least then you can pause and start and pause and start at will.  I pity those that actually had to sit through this in a theater.
