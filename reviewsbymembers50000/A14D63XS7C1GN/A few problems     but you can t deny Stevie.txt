 I first got into Fleetwood Mac back in 1997 when they were on the Dance Tour.  My mother was totally excited because they would be performing at the Pepsi Arena, here in Albany, NY, on Thanksgiving Eve ... so of course we went.  I was HOOKED from that day forward.  For Christmas that year my mother got me Stevie's greatest hits album, Timespace, and then I went from being hooked to being OBSSESSED!  In 1999 I got the Red Rocks concert and I loved it.  Actually, at this point in my life, I was in the middle of losing 60 pounds, so every night for months on the stationary bike I would watch the show.  Perhaps the only problem I might have NOW with the show is that not EVERY song performed that night in 1986 are included on the disc, like "Stop Draggin' My Heart Around," "Sara," and "I Can't Wait."  These probably weren't included for obvious Stevie reasons, being, for one, that "Sara" is a very personal song to her and she's always reluctant to perform it in front of people, not to mention that it, like "I Can't Wait," turned out MUCH better on recording and didn't transfer to stage all that well.  But seeing that this Rock a Little Tour was the only in which she performed "I Can't Wait," it would have made the disc more of a collector's item ... and thus a better concert.
