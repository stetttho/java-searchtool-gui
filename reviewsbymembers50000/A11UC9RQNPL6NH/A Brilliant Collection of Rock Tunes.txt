 As annoying as it was, the whole "grunge" movement brought forth some really good bands that would have otherwise gone unnoticed. Without the whole country smelling like teen spirit, my local record store probably would have never ordered Superfuzz Bigmuff, my first Mudhoney album. In 'N' Out Of Grace, Touch Me I'm Sick, and When I Think (all of which are included on March To Fuzz) were instant favorites. I bought March To Fuzz last year, and in my opinion, Mudhoney's music withstands the inevitable test of time. Today, they are no longer a "grunge" band, just a damn good rock group. The guitars are noisier than a monster truck competition, and Mark Arm's screeching yelp cuts through the mess like a rusty knife. These guys know how to arrange a song, too...just listen to the breakdown in the middle of In 'N' Out Of Grace...when those guitars rev back up over the pounding drums and bass, all hell breaks loose until Mark comes back in and shreds his vocal cords with the final verse. It sends chills up my spine every time I hear it. I wish I had enough space here to review each song, but since I don't, you'll just have to trust me on this and go buy this double album. The rarities and b-sides disc is as awe-inspiring as the first disc...the only thing that could make it better would have been a third disc with nothing but live songs...but I'm probably asking for too much. Go out and buy this cd, and march to some serious fuzz.
