 It's a shame that more people don't know who this man is. He started one of the biggest rock and roll franchises of the seventies, and even today he is revered in circles of musicians that are educated on the history of Pink Floyd. This album shows his songcrafting abilities and his undeniable guitar skills. Even under a haze of LSD, the man can deliver a song as good as anything that was on the radio back in the day, but his reputation preceded him and his music remains in obscurity.  This isn't a Pink Floyd album. It's full of little ditties about being lost in the woods, girls that don't like his songs, and dresses. The whole album has a "sit right here, I'm gonna play you a song" vibe to it, and the lack of a dedicated backing band makes it almost folky...but those are the qualities that I like about it. It's a little disjointed at times, but an unpolished gem is still a gem.
