 Brad conveys emotion like Monet could paint flowers...with a natural ease and a unique style that cannot be denied. The uplifting songs on this album will make you feel elated, while the softer ballad-type songs will have you weeping like a child. When I first bought this, I could only listen to it in small doses. Too much would wear me out emotionally, and I would be put off from listening to it again for a long time. I only play it once every 2 years or so, but I still consider it one of my favorites. I remember back in '94, driving my car in the rain, singing along, and all of a sudden, I'm sobbing like my dog died. A few songs later, I'm bobbing my head along to the music like I don't have a care in the world. It's that magical. Most musicians can only dream of crafting songs this real.
