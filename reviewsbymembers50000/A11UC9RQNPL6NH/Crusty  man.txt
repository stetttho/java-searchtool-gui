 The hood of your car is up, you're bent over the engine, trying to tighten that darn pulley that keeps making your A/C belt squeal like a castrated cat...but it's just a little out of reach...hmmm...maybe if you leaned over more you could get a wrench on it...you bend further into the engine compartment...you can almost reach it...a little further...almost....There...you got it...but the angle is difficult, so you bend your elbow a little more, and shove your arm further inside of the engine..."Got it," you say outloud...but your wife (who is sitting behind the wheel, waiting for you to say "Start it", to see if the belt it still making that terrible noise) thinks that she just heard her cue to turn the key. Just then, the engine rumbles and jumps to life, and the belt that you are were initially trying to repair is now caught  around your wrist, pulling your body into the car and ripping your hand to shreds...the engine growling, the belt still squealing, your shrieks of intense pain and terror, your wife hollering "Turn it off yet?"...that's what this band sounds like...just like that.
