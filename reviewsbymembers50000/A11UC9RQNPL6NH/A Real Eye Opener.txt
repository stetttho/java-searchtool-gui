 When I started playing guitar in 1987, I pigeon-holed myself into one playing one type of music or the other. When I first heard this album, I didn't understand it. After 2 days of making myself listen to it, my musical interests expanded ten-fold and by the end of the week, I was listening to everything I could get my hands on. This album helped me explore music as a whole instead of categorically eliminating entire genres of music just because they weren't easily accessible. This album really got me into funk, hard rock, and general weirdness. My album collection expanded to include everything from ABBA to Frank Zappa. I can honestly say that because of Mother's Milk, I am more of a well-rounded musician today instead of a three chord chugging moron. This album introduced me to John Frusciante, and my guitar playing went from being a hobby to a passion. Thanks, John! If you already own the original version of Mother's Milk, it is not a necessity to own this (the extra tracks don't make it any better or any less incredible), but I gave it five stars because to give it less would be criminal.
