 Melodic, schizophrenic, heavy, brutal, and definitely intense. This band stretched boundaries by combining sick death metal guitars with soaring vocals and grinding bass lines. I had the opportunity to see them many times before they were signed to Rotten Records, and even opened for them numerous times with my own band. They sounded just as good live as on this album.  Every song here has a memorable guitar riff, catchy vocal, and some of the sickest lyrics ever sung. I can't say enough positive things about this band, other than if you hate what is passing for "metal" these days, you will love this album from the first note to the last.
