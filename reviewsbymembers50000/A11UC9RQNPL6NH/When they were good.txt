 Now that the Beastie Boys are a trio of aging activists, it's time to look back at their career in a retrospective manner. Check Your Head is easily their most diverse and accessible album. One song that stands out as an example to their multiple talents is Gratitude. It's a catchy, funky little rock song with a punk attitude, and it has about as much to do with rap as my grandmother. The first time I heard this album in completion, I was trying to guess what kind of music the next song would be. I was wrong half of the time. There's even some old school hardcore punk from the Boys' earlier days. It took a long for something to replace this album in my stereo. I was addicted to the bumping guitar chunk of "So Watcha' Want?", the mixed bag of bass lines on "Pass The Mic", and Adrock's rhymes on "The Maestro". Sad to say, we may never see these days again. The Beastie's are out there playing the political game now, forgetting that there are lots of fans over here that remember the days when they could make you "Shake Your Rump". I heard about their new album coming out, and honestly, I don't even want to hear it. I'd rather have them be remembered for this masterpiece instead of some anti-Bush soapbox album. Check Your Head will never be regarded as one of the top Hip Hop albums of all time, but it should definitely be known as one of the top albums of all time period.
