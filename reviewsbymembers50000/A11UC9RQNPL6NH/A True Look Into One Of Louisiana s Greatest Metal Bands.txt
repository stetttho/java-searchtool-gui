 When I saw this DVD at a music store on Carrolton, I nearly jumped out of my skin. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I bought it, went home, and invited some friends to come over and watch it. Much to our surprise, there's a show on there that we attended (at the Jungle Rock Hut in Gretna, LA), and those are my PA speakers on there that I used to lend to a local sound guy. Acid Bath was such an influential force in New Orleans metal, it is almost an honor to briefly see the top of my head in a crowd in their only video release. This DVD brought back so many fond memories of beer soaked nights, listening to Acid Bath pound the crowd into oblivion. This video captures all the sweaty grit and grime of this legendary group paying their dues in small clubs, and it shows how much they were loved by their fans. Every Acid Bath show was an experience, and I even had the opportunity to open for them a few times. I know it sounds like I'm hung up on my own personal experience with them, but watching this has got me reminiscing about paying cover charges, the filthy men's room at Zeppelin's, drinking with Sammy on the patio area of the Last Stop, the sad news of Audie's death, and so many other things of that era. Acid Bath were the heartbeat of the local music scene at that time, and not only does this DVD showcase the band's greatness, but it's also a bit of nostalgia. If you were here around that time, you know what I mean. When Marilyn Manson was in town recording Antichrist Superstar, they stumbled into the Last Stop, expecting everyone to bow at their greatness...but no one even paid them any mind. We had our own idols. Long live the legacy of Acid Bath.
