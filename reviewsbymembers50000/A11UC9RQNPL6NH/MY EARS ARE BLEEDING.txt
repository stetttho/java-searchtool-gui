 My friend Rene from the band Flesh Parade was always talking about this band (they're on the same label), so I felt obligated to check them out. I literally couldn't figure out what I was listening to at first. Was it some alien jazz/grind hybrid? Whatever it was, it hurt like hell, and I'm glad that I spent the dough on it. The tempos switch faster than Scott Peterson's alibis, and when they change, the band remains so tight that you'd swear your cd is skipping. I don't even know how to classify this album, other than "Brutal". The vocals sound like rusty machinery screeching along with the music, and from me, that's a compliment. Fans of unpredictable violent music should definitely check this out.
