 Pros- 3 hours of Zappa! Cons- Only 3 hours of Zappa... If you're a hardcore fan or a casual listener, this DVD has something for you. The humorous songs, the wacky instrumentals, the extended guitar solos, the backstage footage, Terry's vocal performance on Punkys Whips, that girl in the front row...IT HAS EVERYTHING!!!! It even has white guys with afros playing keyboards! He looks like Disco Stu from The Simpsons! Believe that! If you like pointless clay animation by some stoned-out freak, it has that too. But most of all, it has Frank Zappa playing the role of musical genius, and that alone is worth the price of admission. If you work for Warner Bros., you might want to turn the sound down in certain parts, because BOY IS HE MAD AT YOU!!!!! Did you know Adrian Belew played in a crud band in Nashville? GET THE MOVIE AND FIND OUT HOW FRANK SAVED HIM FROM THE CRUD SCENE!!!! Also, there's panty throwing, if you're into that sort of thing. And a fat guy with a gas mask that washes  a blow-up doll in a sink! How could you NOT want to see that? Ok, I'm giving away too much here. Buy the movie and all of this will make sense somehow.
