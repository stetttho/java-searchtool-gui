 This is what turned me onto the craziness of Henry Rollins, and the wildman guitar playing of Greg Ginn. The intensity of a live punk show is captured here, drawing you into the music and making you feel like you're up front, getting pulverized by the crowd and going deaf from the assault on your ears. The thing that I love about this album the most is that sometimes the songs seem like they're about to fall apart while the band is playing them, and just when you think it's all going to collapse, it snaps back together and punches you in the throat. What a rush! It makes you want to check out a live show of some noisy local band in a seedy club...and it's not often that music makes me want to get out of the house and spend money on a cover charge. For a live punk show, the production is incredible. The vocals are in your face, but not over the top. The drums and bass are tight, and the guitar weaves in and out of the spaces between them. Greg Ginn's solos make your hair stand on end. They twist and turn like a psychotic serpent, leaving you guessing where he's going to strike next. There's not one single "fast-forward" moment on this album, and you will find that it is entertaining from beginning to end.
