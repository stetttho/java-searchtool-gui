 I am an American that lives in New Orleans. I first heard this album when I was 24, in late September of 1999. One week later I was put into the psychiatric ward of a local hospital due to a mental breakdown. And although I had only been listening to blur for a week, Damon's vocals kept ringing in my head..."Tender is the touch of someone that you love too much...", "Love's the greatest thing"...and when I was released a few days later, I had to listen to that album again...and it immediately became one of the best albums that I have ever heard. It actually stroked my heart, and I knew where every word was coming from. Especially "No Distance Left To Run". I was a heartbroken fool at the time, and this is the only music that I could relate to. This WHOLE album is beyond description...it's just perfect. To me, it sounds vulnerable...like they recorded it watching each other's backs, protecting each other from their personal evils. You can almost hear the color of the walls in the room that they recorded it in...that is how clear the songs come across. I bought their "Best Of..." album when it came out, and I connected with every song on it...the songs that I had not heard yet sounded like another band, since I had only heard "13", but I recognized the emotion and attitude behind them. I even bought the home video that accompanies the "Best Of..." album...and I watch it every chance I can. Every image fits perfectly into the songs, and it really opened my eyes to this band whose first American hit single was popular due to the "Woo Hoo!" chorus. They are much deeper than any radio slave could imagine. The only other band that I ever respected this much before was The Beatles...but they're long gone...and I'll bet you that I know who is carrying the torch now. Blur...bigger than Jesus?...just possibly...
