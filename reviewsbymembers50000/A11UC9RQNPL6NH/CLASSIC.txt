 Absolutely one of the top five albums of the nineties. This record stood firm against the rising tide of "grunge" music in the early nineties and launched the band to mega-stardom. The music breathes in such an organic way that it almost seems like the music was playing them instead of them playing the music. This is one of the only albums that I can continuously listen to from beginning to end for days at a time. It cemented John's spot as an iconic guitar player, raising the bar for many musicians, myself included. This is a masterpiece by every definition of the word, and I'm glad that I was around to witness the magic of these four guys creating music together. Don't miss out on this experience.
