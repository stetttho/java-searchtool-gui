 This album (actually, the band itself) has been sadly overlooked for far too long. I love everything about every song on here. Some of it sounds like it was recorded in a bedroom, which is to it's credit. It's raw attitude. The tempos fly and push the envelope of human capability, the guitars and bass sound like they're on the verge of meltdown, and the vocals keep up every step of the way. Definitely not background music. This album DEMANDS attention and it deserves more credit than what it's been given. If you like S.O.D. and other hardcore thrash of that era, then get this disc and treat yourself to some ear drum bludgeoning. The doctor's fees will be well worth it.
