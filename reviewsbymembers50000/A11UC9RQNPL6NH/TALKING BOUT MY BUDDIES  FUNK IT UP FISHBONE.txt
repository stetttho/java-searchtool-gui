 You want to hear a bunch of guys that can melt styles together like there's no tomorrow? Go pick up this album (or order it from this site), and slip into the groove known as Fishbone. This band cannot be categorized, period. Call it funk metal, call it R&B rock, or just call it music. This album is the twin cousin of Mother's Milk by the Chili Peppers. It triggers something in your brain that makes your body move and your face crack a smile. Funky as hell? YES! Does it rock harder than anything you've ever heard? YES! Music critics might as well put down their pen on this one, because it deserves every ounce of praise that it can get.   My first exposure to Fishbone was on the Arsenio Hall show. They played "Sunless Saturday", and before the song was finished, I had started a bonfire in my room with half of my record collection. Just writing this review makes me have to listen to it again. Bye.
