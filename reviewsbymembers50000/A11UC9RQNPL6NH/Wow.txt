 I bought this album when it first came out, thinking that it would be John with some friends of his, jamming on some funk songs...then I listened to it. WHAT THE? I put it aside and didn't listen to it again for about a year. Then one rainy day, I decided to give it another listen. This time, I put aside any preconceived notions of what I expected from him, and just let the music play. What I got out of it was pretty disturbing, but beautiful nonetheless. His passion for guitar playing really shines through on here, as well as his creativity. I've read reviews on here saying that this album is garbage, but those people have to be told what to listen to by MTV and Clear Channel radio. Yes, it's a hard listen at first, but put things like a spotless production and the standard Verse-Chorus-Verse-Chorus song structure aside, and just listen to it with open ears. It is a completely different form of art than most people can digest (no, I'm not some artsy-fartsy holier-than-though "I get it because I'm smarter than you" jerk). Music is supposed to move you and take you places, and sometimes, those places make you uncomfortable...as they should. I love this album as much as I love the guitar playing he did in RHCP, and it's refreshing to see an artist show his unpolished side to his fans. Most guitar players can only dream of coming up with music this original and real.
