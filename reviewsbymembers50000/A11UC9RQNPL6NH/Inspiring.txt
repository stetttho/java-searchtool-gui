 You can hear Bradley's passion for his music in his voice, and it's a shame that didn't live to see exactly how many people he touched with his gift. It's too bad that his ability to arrange a good song will always be overshadowed by this album's sad legacy. R.I.P., Bradley, and thanks for the music you made.
