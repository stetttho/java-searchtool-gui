 One reviewer was right on in pointing out that this album came out years before Beck blew up. For those of you that haven't heard this yet, this album is filled with relaxed breakbeats, jangly guitars and singing about breaking up, drinking, bad hair, and the hope of a brand new day. The intro and outro tracks are funny as hell, and the samples are as much a part of the music as the vocals. They aren't thrown in just to spice up the music, they tell part of the story. This is a very easy album to get into, and I do believe that fans of any genre can listen to this and appreciate it. It's a shame that this album is relatively obscure, almost NEVER getting any radio play other than on the occasional college station. Help this talented man out and buy this album. I heard that he's a religious man now, but who knows...maybe with enough interest, he'll convert back to the dark side of Basehead.
