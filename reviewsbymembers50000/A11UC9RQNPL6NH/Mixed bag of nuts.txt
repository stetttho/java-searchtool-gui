 Okay, to be honest, I only like 5 songs on here...but they are so good, they each deserve a star, hence the 5 star rating. Here they are..."Earth Died Screaming", "Such A Scream", "All Stripped Down", "Jesus Gonna Be Here", and "Going Out West". Those are 5 of the most classic Waits songs you'll ever hear. I especially like the part on the cd when Such A Scream kind of morphs into All Stripped Down...althoug I have no idea why. Listen to Jesus Gonna Be Here, as Tom gets his junk-joint vocals going, and the testosterone drive of Going Out West (I don't need no make-up, I got real scars...). The rest of the album really drags for me, but that is my opinion, and you are more than welcome to disagree. The slower piano songs do nothing for my inner weirdo, and neither does "I Don't Wanna Grow Up". Tom only tapped into his unique brilliance 5 times on this disc, but still, it is worth the price for the above-mentioned songs. Who knows? Maybe you will think the whole disc rocks and that I'm an uneducated idiot, which is probably mostly true...so go buy it now and thank me later.
