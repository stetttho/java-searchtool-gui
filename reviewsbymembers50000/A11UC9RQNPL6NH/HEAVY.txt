 In 1995, my guitar player called me and told me that we would be opening for Crowbar at Zeppelin's in Fat City (about 8 square blocks right outside of New Orleans, containing the city's premier metal bars). For the past year, all I had been listening to was this CD. So, you can imagine my excitement as I pictured my little group playing with the heaviest band in the world. But it wasn't such a good idea after all. We sounded paper thin against the mammoth guitars of Crowbar, and they figuratively spanked us, right in front of hundreds of fans. We stupidly agreed to play another show a few weeks later in Slidell, LA, and once again, we came off as the Lollipop Guild. Lesson: NEVER go up against something this heavy and expect to come out with your dignity in tact. This album set the pace for heavy in the mid-nineties, and very few even came close to it's mastery of molten sludge riffs. The vocals scream of pain and hopelessness, with "Self-Inflicted" and "I Have Failed" being the ultimate self-loather's anthems...and I just can't put into words how freakin' insanely heavy the guitars are. They crunch and roar with a ferocity that is STILL unmatched, almost a decade later. How about this word for a description: chuggachunkawaaaachiggachunk...yell this word in a really low James Earl Jones voice, screaming it through a microphone hooked up to a Mesa Boogie Dual Rectifier guitar amp. Try that, and it might be close to what you can expect from this album. Every song is full of some of the sickest riffing this side of Black Sabbath, and the laid back tempos push the songs along like barges on the Mississippi River. Definitely not for the meek listener. Wear protective gear while playing this album.
