 I saw these guys on Louisiana Jukebox one night while suffereing from insomnia, and I'm glad that I was awake. 100% ORIGINAL N'Awlins funk. These guys have crafted the New Orleans sound into something so unique that it can't be touched. In a way, I wish there were more bands like this out there...but then again, let's leave it to the fellas that do it right the first time.  For those of you that don't know what Brass Hop is, it's like this. Take a funky hip hop track, and replace the bass with a tuba (or is it a sousaphone?). Take that keyboard track out and toss in some trombones. Then get rid of the rest of the sound effects that every rap artist uses these days, and add some trumpet. Now start rapping about REAL stuff, not all about rims and guns. You're getting the idea now...but you have to sprinkle dust from the streets of New Orleans all over it, or it won't have that distinct NOLA flavor. Don't worry, it's easy to digest, and it goes down real smooth. These are true New Orleans musicians that deserve worldwide recognition. Peace.
