 Well...what did we all expect from the whining of Billy Corgan? Something good? The pope of "alternative rock" has been rewriting the same lyrics for over a decade now. This is music for confused shoe-gazing teenage slackers to fill out their McDonald's employment applications to, because only Billy could relate to the pain in their precious little hearts. Someone made the mistake of telling him that he can sing, and then millions of people made the mistake of believing it. His message is usually lost in his nasal drip delivery, and when most people hear his whine on the radio, they don't listen to what he's saying anyway. They just figure that since it's Pope Corgan, they should be enjoying it. They don't...but they'll never admit it. No one told them that it was okay to not like his crap anymore. Well, here it is...IT's OKAY!!! YOU CAN STOP PRETENDING!! Go buy a Syd Barrett album if you want real genius. Go buy a Jimi hendrix album if you want real guitar playing. Go buy a Doors album if you want real pained vocals. Go buy a ticket to France if you want some wine (or whine, as it is implied here). Just don't buy this doggy poop of an album.
