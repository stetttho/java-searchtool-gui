 This is the ultimate thrash supergroup. Members of three of the most noted thrash groups of the time united and made an album of hardcore anthems. From the first note to the last the listener is bludgeoned by Scott Ian's heavier-than-anything-you've-ever-heard guitar attack. The music is total sonic violence, and Billy Milano's lyrics are classic. This is a fun album to listen to, and if you're a fan of eighties thrash and DON'T have this album, where have you been? "Sgt. D is coming, and you're on his list!!!!!!" Politically correct metal heads need not apply.
