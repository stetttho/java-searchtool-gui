 Grating, majestic, rough, delicate, insane, uplifting...these all could be used to describe this album at any point. John uses sounds as colors to paint a vivid picture of the demons and spirits in his head, and the end result is an album of beautiful chords, intricate melodies, possessed howls, and inspiring guitar abuse. It reminds me of those musicians in the sixties/seventies that most people were afraid of, or didn't have the patience to understand (Frank Zappa, Captain Beefheart, and Syd Barrett come to mind). After I heard this album, I sat down with my 4-track, my strat, and just recorded music, however it came out. It opened a lot of doors musically for me, almost as much as his guitar playing on Mother's Milk did when I first heard it. Smile From The Streets is not an album for Chili Pepper fans, but if you love music as an organic force in all of our lives, you can appreciate the creativity of John's songwriting on here. I could go on and on about the emotions and soundscapes that he weaves together, but I think that it would be lost on a lot of people that expect music to follow a proven formula. Music this raw and real cannot simply be written...it has to drip from the exposed nerves of an artist losing a battle against himself.
