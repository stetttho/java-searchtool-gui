 This cd truly represents what the guys down here in NOLA are up to. Having been released in 1996, the music may sound a tad dated, but at the time, these groups were on par with anything you heard on the radio. The groups featured here worked their butts off to make every one of their shows something memorable. Being in the local scene for over a decade, I know many of the people that are on this album personally, and they are some of the most dedicated musicians I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. From the spacey rock of Garaj Mahal to the disco-gone-bad of Kwazi Moto, this is a great disc to own.
