 The only negative thing about this CD is that it consists of one single track. Yes, the whole show is one long track, defeating the "skip" button on your cd player. This is a hassle if you jump in your car and want to hear "Sex Bomb" (the last song) right away. You have to sit there with your finger on the fast forward button until you reach the song that you're looking for.  But this being a live Flipper show, you shouldn't want to skip anything here. Every microsecond of noise, feedback, and guitar abuse should be consumed greedily by your ears, because only Flipper can be this chaotic and this disciplined at the same time. The show starts off with "Billy Sacrafice and the Little Italians" singing "If It Don't Fit, Don't Force It", and then the wheels of the might Flipper machine go into motion. For the next hour, listeners are put in the center of a live Flipper show, and frankly, there are no words to put it into true perspective. The music is thick and massive, often sounding like it's sucking the oxygen out of the room. The vocals are harsh and fit the music like an abused leather glove. Their chemistry comes through on this recording, and you can tell that they're all on the same level musically and not just playing riffs that they wrote together. It's no wonder why some of the top "modern rock" icons give so much credit to Flipper. They were ahead of their time (I was only 8 when this show took place), and their music still stands up to the garbage that is being released today.  Face it...if you're reading this review, then you must have an idea who Flipper is, and take it from a true fan...you can't afford to go through life without this album. Here's a free tip...the listening experience goes nicely with a case of beer while playing Grand Theft Auto 3. You're welcome.
