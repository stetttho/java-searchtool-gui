 There is no real way to put this gently, but this campaign setting may actually be worse than Spelljammer. Aside from the fact that that it is peppered with 18th century Londonary street slang, which would be sorta  cool if it were in fact taking place in Londonary in the 18th century.  Planescape offers the player who is tired of slaying Tiamat with their +27  sword of Everything Slaying, a chance to skip across planes as easily as  taking a ship from Suzail to Westgate. They get to stroll across the green  fields of Arvandor (or Arborea or whatever TSR is calling it this week),  have tea and tiffen with Sune then bog off to the 473rd layer of the Abyss  and kick Orcus' teeth down his throat. And apparently, people and creatures  have been doing this forever, and the gods themselves have nothing better  to do than play tour guide from a bunch of 27th level multiclassed  munchkins with too much magic and not enough imagination to create good  adventures in places like the Forgotten Realms. Planescape strips all of  the majesty and mystery away from the Inner & Outer planes, making them  seem as though Disney had set up shop and is selling rides through Selune's  bedroom. Gods and their ilk are meant to be never seen and seldom heard. If  you absolutely MUST plane hop, then I suggest either Rifts or Marvel Super  Heroes RPGs. If your players insist on playing this nonsense, then make  sure the first plane they enter they run into some god who hurls a fireball  at them for 1 billion points of damage and let them save for half. Utter  rubbish!
