 In its entire publication run, I have missed 3 issues of PC Gamer. I used to buy and now subscribe to this magazine religiously, for in a market swamped by games magazines, it simply has no equal. Though nowadays as the market moves away from the PC as the gaming box of choice to the consoles, PC Gamer has become a slimmer volume than it's once titanic 350 page tomes. It has never strayed from its course of never playing favorites, and always producing solid reviews. (Even perennial favorites like LucasArts and Blizzard have not been spared when they produce games that do not live up to their reputations.) They rate their games on a scale of 1 to 100% and no game has ever scored perfect. 	PC Gamer also gives excellent hardware reviews from game controllers and sound cards to full blown PC systems. They have reviewed hundreds of pieces of gear, providing test results where required, and accurate hardware breakdowns. The characteristic feel of the magazine hasn't changed- it's hip, fun, and the staff know their stuff, and their game history. As the PC games selection shrinks, so has the magazine as developers sadly turn their attention to the cheaper consoles which have better market saturation than fully tricked out and more expensive computers built for gaming. That doesn't change the fact that when it comes to a computer games magazine that PC Gamer is the best there is.
