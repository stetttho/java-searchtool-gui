 Have you ever wanted to know where the Glythe Sector is? Or wondered what a M3-D2 droid was for? If you have then I highly recommend the Star Wars Encyclopedia by Stephen J. Sansweet, because it is filled with all things  Star Wars-from movies, novels, comics and TV shows, (Though I suspect I  would have been happier if it had no mention of the Ewoks/Droids cartoons).  This is a high-quality publications and is presented hard cover format,  making it an ideal addition to anyone's Star Wars library. It allows the  reader to see what wonderful consistency that has been built up over the  past 22 years within the universe-something that Star Trek can never boast  about given how everything in that universe is entirely variable. Clear,  easy to read entries are laid out naturally in alphabetical format for easy  location, and it would make an a great tool for role players as well,  making it is easy to find characters, places, vehicles, etc.
