 I have owned all of 3 monitors in my life, an Everdata 14, a TVM 15 flat screen and finally the NEC FE700+, which won out over two Sonys, a 19 NEC and a 19 Samsung. What impressed me most about this monitor was the richness of color-while the other monitors around it seemed faded, the NEC was hands down the superior screen.  When I got it home I had all but forgotten about the other monitors. Its also big enough that I could increase the resolution from 800x600 to 1024x768, and still be able to read text on the screen, something I had trouble doing on my TVM 15. 	This monitor is a dream. Setup time was les than a minute, and Windows detected it for what it was, and not a generic monitor. It is perfect for what I use it for-word processing, games, and  a little graphics work in PhotoShop.  Its superb color coupled with NECs high quality construction and reputation make this display not only good value, but a good investment. Sure there are bigger monitors, but how good are they? I have seen several people with the Samsung  950p and I believe the NEC FE700+ gives a superior image quality and is only 2 small in screen size. And hey, its Macintosh compatible, which means you can do away with those silly and cheap looking clear plastic boxes. I highly recommend this monitor.
