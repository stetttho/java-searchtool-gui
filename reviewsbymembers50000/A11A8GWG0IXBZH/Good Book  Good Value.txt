 TSR's Complete Book of Fighters is one of rare 'kit books' that will go a long way to enhance any fighter, be they PC or NPC. For the most part the kits themselves aren't well balanced against each other, but on their own  they are quite good and would require a minimum of tweaking to bring them  into line with each other. For example, the Swashbuckler kit is vastly more  powerful than the Peasant Hero kit as far as bonus abilities, skills, etc.  Plus the additional background for non-magical or a fighters only campaign  is interesting. It is a solidly written book with loads of information.
