 I don't know who at TSR seems to think that elves are little more than slothful, frivolous flakes, but it has permiated every aspect of their product line for a long time. This supplement goes into vast detail about  how elves can't do anything quickly, it takes them years, even centuries of  debate to figure out what to do about a problem; and how they view  themselves as rea "People" and everyone else is merely "Not  People". They also seem to be a very LAWFUL society for a group that  has been, since day 1 of AD&D, listed as CHAOTIC. It may even be worse  than material written for Dragonlance's own band of of racist elves, the  Silvanesti, who are listed as also being CG...yet they kept the Kagonesti  Elves as slaves, because the Silvanesti believed they were  superior...uh-huh, I see... The author talks a lot about magic, art and  food, but says nothing about it! No concept of recipes for elven food,  except that non-elves aren't advanced enough to taste the subtlties of it.  That elves use waterfalls to shape their sculptures through erosion...hope  they're not making these things for theur human pals, because they will be  years dead before it's finished. Plus the overriding concept that the elves  are retreating and dying out seems to alude to the destruction of the  fantasy element of the whole AD&D millieu, and that somehow magic is  fading from the land. This book is not worth the money.
