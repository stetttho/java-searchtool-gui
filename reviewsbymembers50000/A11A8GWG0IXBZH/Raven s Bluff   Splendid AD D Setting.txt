 Okay, so I actually like a recent TSR publication, and why not? It is a well written tome filled with skads of detail of a place that has until recently been the purview of the RPGA. Greenwood does an excellent job in  detailing the city-and most importantly, the families of note complete with  histories! Wow! Best of all, it isn't overly replete with characters who  made pacts with every god and major demon lord to get where they are. Aside  from Greenwood's obsession with mages and the fact that there are just too  darn many of them to be found anywhere in the Realms, Raven's Bluff is an  ideal book to base a series of adventures, but I wouldn't run a campaign in  it. It could have done with a better thieves guild, but other than that,  this is well written book, and it's layout and maps are extremely well  done. Well worth the money.
