 I'm not going to review the game, Final Fantasy XI, beyond saying that it's a fine game if you're into that sort of thing, but rather the hard drive itself. I figured that having a hard drive in my PS2 would make it as useful as the one in my Xbox, it doesn't. With the Xbox, all your game saves go straight to the hard drive, rather than a memory card. Given that a PS2 8 mb memory card costs around 25 dollars and the 40 gb hard drive costs around 50 dollars, you would need to buy 5120 memory cards to have the same amount of space at a cost of 128,000 dollars. You can find more on-line capable games than you can find games that use the hard drive for game saves. So far, Final Fantasy XI and SOCOM II appear to be only ones. Yes, you can copy games from a memory card to the drive, but why should you have to bother? Why not just make the newer games write directly to the hard drive? Also, Sony had promised a sort of media center that would enable you to record and share media files, but no such software has appeared. Now that Sony has redesigned the PS2, making slimmer, it of course doen't seat the hard drive. No big deal though, Sony doesn't support the hard drive anyway. Buying this is like buying a turbo charger for your car that isn't connected to the engine. You can say you have it, but it doesn't do you any good.
