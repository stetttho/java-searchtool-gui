 Dennis Miller will always remain one of the five funniest comedians in my  books. Along with Denis Leary, Robin Williams, George Carlin, and Eddie  Murphy, have made living in the last 20 years of the 20th century almost  tolerable. Almost. I don't want to get off an on rant here, but have you  seen the state of the modern comedy these days? An associate of mine  admitted that he frankly enjoys the banal, mindless gags that pass for  humor in an Adam Sandler flick! Jim Carey hasn't been funny since `In  Living Color' and Matt Stone and Trey Parker since `Cannibal: The  Musical'. 	Dennis Miller makes me laugh, his rants are among some of  the most original stuff to come around in a long time. Like Carlin, he  peppers his staccato-like speeches with witty and often contemporary jibes  at the system, but where Carlin tends to be more general, Miller names  names. Miller preaches moderation, common sense, compassion, but also wants  you to use that two-stroke weed whacker engine you call a brain for more  than just watching `Who Wants to be a Millionaire' or trying to assemble  the tiger puzzle found inside a box of Frosted Flakes. Dennis Miller: The  Rants is a good way do just that. 	Miller attacks the O.J. trial for  what it was, goes hunting Republicans, the legal system, the religious  right and drags them out into the harsh unfeeling glare of public sentiment  and holds them up for to examine and laugh at. I think Miller speaks from  the heart and he really does feel this way about a lot of things he rants  on. Admittedly the audio tapes of the rants are better than book, hearing  him say them is obviously better than just reading them, but the book  allows easier reference for quotes so you can make pithy comments in your  e-mails. You can also catch Miller's rants on his hit TV show `Dennis  Miller Live'. Have fun with it, that's what it's there for.
