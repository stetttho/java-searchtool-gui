 I bought this to use as a USB headset on PC rather than connect it to my PS2, because all of my othes are either lost or broken. I figured the size and the Logitech name would guarantee a little longevity. I'm not especially rough on my toys, but my gaming area is rather cluttered with numerous projects, games, books, CDs, computer parts, etc. so wires, mice, game controllers have a tendancy to get tangled and like any lynch pin, move one and they all come crashing down. While the headset works, it's a little wonky in its functioning. It sounds just fine, but the microphone shaft is too short and ends up sitting on my cheek a half-inch shy of my mouth and doesn't pick up spoken word all that well. worse, it's kinda flimsy, the plastic too soft. It has a bulky volume control with mute button about a foot down the cord from the headset while at the other end is a small box with the Playstation logo on it. I suspect its a pre-amp or a signal changer, but it seems kind of obtrusive and gets in the way. Is it worth owning? Not at its current price- if it were ten bucks cheaper it would be worth it. It does what its supposed to do, but not very well. There must be a better substitute somewhere. Just great! The headphone & mic just fell of my desk and broke! A grand total of 1 meter. Cheap junk.
