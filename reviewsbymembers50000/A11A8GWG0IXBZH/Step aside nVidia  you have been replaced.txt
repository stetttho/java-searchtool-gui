 Having owned a PC since the days of the 8-bit ESA bus, it amazes how far the technology has come along. My current PC has 128 times the ram and 666 times the hard drive storage. My very first video card was an awesome Trident 1 meg video card that could actually do 1024x768- my monitor didn't like it, but it could it. In those days there was no such thing as 3D acceleration, that was still four years away when the first Voodoo cards appeared and the PC games industry took off. My first 3D video card was a 3Dfx Voodoo 2 that had to be connected to my 2 meg Cirrus Logic card in order to work. Those were heady days! The performance increase was staggering and those games of mine that supported 3D looked as though they were totally new games. Since then I have owned a Voodoo 3 16 mb, GeForce 2 32 mb DDR, and GeForce 4 64 mb DDR. That as seven years ago. I have since owned two more 3Dfx cards, two nVidia and now an ATI Radeon 9700 Pro. First let me say that installation took all of five minutes, including a quick hop over to ATI's website for the latest driver update. The 9700 replaces my one year old nVidia GeForce 4 and what a happy day it was to see that card go. While the performance difference was not as staggering as when I went from my old 2D card to the 3Dfx, overall performance of games running on my Athlon 1900 XP+ with 512 mb of PC2100 ram was very real and noticeable. I could have gone with the new nVidia GeForce 5800 Ultra, but the half dozen or so reviews all said the same thing- it doesn't compare to the 9700/9800 cards. (The 9800 is basically the same card as the 9700 with a slightly faster core clock and RAM speed.) It [the nVidia 5800 Ultra] also makes a lot of noise- nVidia had thought it was a good idea to attach a hunk of plastic that directed all of the air flowing over the heat sink out the back of a PC- something that made a great deal of noise. The Ultra also takes up the PCI slot immediately adjacent the AGP slot. Good thinking guys! The 9700 Pro allows me to run Unreal Tournament 2003 at 1024x768 resolution with all graphics and effects settings to max. with my GeForce 4 I could do that resolution, but had to set everything else to `normal' or `medium' as far as effects are concerned or else I'd start dropping frames by the bucket. Every other game I own- Medal of Honor, Unreal II and Jedi Outcast have shown explosive performance increases over the nVidia card. It is also rock solid stable- no stuttering, frame drops or any other problems. In fact, I have had NO problems with this card. None. That said, I could care less how good Unreal Tournament 2003 looks- that's just candy. I got the card solely for Relic's upcoming release of Homeworld 2 and I wanted a card that could provide me with the best bang for the buck. I had toyed with getting the 9800, but I doubt I really would have noticed a huge improvement between the 9700. At this point, nVidia was no longer in the running- the 9700 Pro stomps it like a narc at a biker rally. I see no reason the spend the money to have a glorified leaf blower whistling out the back of my PC and taking up an extra slot. Get a 9700 or 9800 Pro - it's the nicest thing you can do for your PC.
