 Of the all Star Trek novels I have read, this stands as one of my personal favorites. The other really good ones are also by Peter David, `Vendetta' and `Q-in-Law', the former being the Borg movie they should have made  instead of that piece of trash, First Contact. Strike Zone deals very  simply with the Federation rushing to settle a dispute between the Klingons  and a new race known as the Kreel. For over a century the Kreel have been  nipping at the heels of the Klingons, who see them as parasites. Except now  the Kreel have found a stockpile of fearsome weapons and are now taking it  to the Klingons. The Enterprise is ordered to intercede and act as  mediators between the two waring nations before the rip themselves  apart. 	David has an uncanny grasp of the Next Generation characters  and presents them as we enjoy them most. Picard is the stolid no-nonsense  captain, Riker the dashing hero with a quick wit, Data as the often  perplexed android. It also presents Next Generation's least liked  character, Wesley Crusher, in a vulnerable light. Speaking for myself, I  liked the character and it was the writers' fault that Wil Weaten became a  casualty of the series. Strike Zone is decidedly light reading, and rarely  serious. It also does something rare in anything Trek-the characters  change, especially Wesley Crusher, and not the same person they were at the  beginning of the story.
