 Like the previous reviewer, Amazon sent this to me as a gift and asked me to review it. I watched it and can't say I enjoyed it, not because it was bad, but because it was 30 years beyond me. This is for kids, not for 35 year adults who like animation, but found it too juvenile. The animation is good and obviously digital, and I found the songs amusing and fun, but again, this isn't on the order of the Lion King or Disney's superb Hunchback of Notredame. This would be ideal for kids between the ages of 3 to probably 8 or 9 and recommend it for that age group.
