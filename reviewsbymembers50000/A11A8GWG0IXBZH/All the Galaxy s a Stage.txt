 This is a neat little catalog that depicts the dozens of worlds explored in the galaxy, often the homeworlds of many of the most common races depicted in the movies and in books. It covers almost a hundred places, gives great examples of flora and fauna found on the worlds, as well as the native intelligent life, if any. It also has a handy little time line at the front. Where this book falls apart is in the black and white line art usually used to depict the natives of each world or moon-it's sub-standard, very cartoony, and no where near on par with the art found elsewhere in other "Essential Guides...". Otherwise, though, it is an excellent book. Unfortunately, it doesn't really explain much about a native race's culture or history, but rather tends to simply explain what adventures were had there. For example, the planet Bimmisaari-a world created by Zhan, the entry spends 2 paragraphs describing the world and its natives, and eight or so paragraphs on what Han, Luke and Leia did there-I read the Thrawn trilogy and don't want yet another description of what went on, but rather want detail on the world itself. Since I usually put these books to use in role playing scenarios, I might have found actual planetary information handy to have.
