 ...the �Essential Guide to Alien Species� is, by a fair margin, the best of the �Essential Guides� to date, except for maybe �Vehicles & Vessels�. It covers more than 150 aliens and creatures, Amanin to Zeltrons, from Dugs to Verpine, each with a neat little capsule that details some biology, planets, and societies, if any. Each capsule is also accompanied by reports filed by all and sundry, like Luke Skywalker and Boba Fett, about encounters with these creatures. Some races and creatures are really interesting, like the Gand, whome authors like Michael Stackpole have done an excellent job in detailing. While others, like the Gank, are in my opinion, are dead wrong. I and others had always assumed that the �gank� in �gank killer� simply meant �bounty� or �trophy�, thus anyone could be a gank killer, like Boba Fett or 4-LOM, but instead they�ve made it a creature. Every picture that accompanies each entry is wonderful! R.K. Frost, the Illustrator, has done a marvelous job with each. Lines are neat and tight, and given the narrowness of limbs, etc. I am given to wonder if Frost�s usual artwork is a little more akin to the stuff that came out of Hellraiser the art of Brom- the Drovian on pp. 31, has a big-time Cenobite influence to it. Ultimately though, it doesn�t matter, because Frost�s work is superb cover to cover, vastly superior to the cartoony art in the �Essential Guides to Planets & Moons�. The are is clear and clean when it needs to be, dirty and gritty when it needs to be that as well. I have all of the �Essential Guides�, and every one of them would earn at least 3 stars in a review by me at Amazon-dot-com. This one gets 5,  because it�s that good...
