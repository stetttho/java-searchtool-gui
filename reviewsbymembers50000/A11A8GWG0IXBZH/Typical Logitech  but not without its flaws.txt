 All of my Logitech products still work and I still use the optical mouse I reviewed here two years ago. My wife and got Logitech wireless keyboard and mouse combo to go with a media center PC I cobbled together to go with our 50" Panasonic plasma TV. Typical Logitech- everything works flawlessly right out of the box and they're kind enough to supply batteries for both the mouse and keyboard, (NiMH rechargables for the mouse and Duracells for the keyboard). Basically, you get a recharging base for the mouse that also acts as a receiver for the RF signals. It's a little messy with the wires- power supply and USB+PS2 connectors that attach to the back of the computer. While I suspect signal range is a good 20 or 30 feet, it's doubtful that anyone has the vision to be that far away from their monitor, even a big one. The keyboard has several controls designed to keep hunting for icons at a minimum- volume control, CD/DVD control buttons, plus ones for e-mail, instant messengers, and search engines, it'll even turn on your web cam, and a neat-o scroll wheel on the left side. On the downside, the keyboard feels cheap- it creaks and wobbles slightly because it doesn't sit flat. The feel of all the keys is first rate. Another downside is the mouse- it works great and feels very solid, but it's heavy. Too heavy for gaming, making movements clunky. And unlike the Microsoft web mouse, the Back and Forth buttons that let you flip between web pages quickly are both mounted on the right side and somewhat what awkward to reach. The scroll wheel and everything else works just fine. All in all, a well designed and functional duo, but flawed. I would have prefered more solid construction and a lighter, better designed mouse. Worth owning for sure, and its price is very reasonable.
