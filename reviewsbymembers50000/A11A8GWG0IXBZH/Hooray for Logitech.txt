 I have owned so many mice in my life that I have bought an extra cat to deal with them. Seriously, I guage all mice I buy by how long they last when compared to the first mouse I ever owned- a vintage circa 1990 two-button Dexxa, which lasted me 4 years and three PCs. I have owned 3 Logitech mice-all with wheels, one cordless and finally, this blue and silver little gem...set up time was as long as it took me to get it out of the box and slapped into the back of my system, which was about 13 seconds. Computer users of the world, get rid of your ball-mice and buy an optical mouse right now! Gone are the days of poor response from your mouse pointer because the ball and/or internal wheels are gummed up with dust, Fritos or salsa dip. It's great for applications like PhotoShop, fantastic for games like Unreal Tournament, Elite Force, and Homeworld- where there are a lot of sweeping movements. Movement is precise and accurate, the feel in your hand is comfortable, unless you have really big hands, then it might be a problem- plus it glows bright red when in operation, so that might be a selling feature to people who like lots of blinky-winky lights on their equipment. Is there a downside? Sometimes, you may accidentally bring up the Logitech control menu in the middle of something else you are doing- no big deal. Buy this mouse now.
