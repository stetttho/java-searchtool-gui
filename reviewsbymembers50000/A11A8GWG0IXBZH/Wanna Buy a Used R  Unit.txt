 I have all of the Essential Guides and have been pleased with all of them to one degree or another. The Essential Guide to Droids, however, is one of the better ones. The author and artists have done their homework in  researching the novels, but for all their work-there are some really silly  designs in here, usually written into novels or whatever, because the  author thought it would be cute, but only comes across as annoying or dumb  (the C2-R4 comes to mind). Other designs have not been well thought out-the  M38 Explorer droid is too tall, it seems logical that if you want an  automated robot for planetary surveys, then something with a lower center  of gravity would be a much better design. I would recommend that everyone  ignore the fact that Anakin made C-3PO and keep his manufacturer as Cybot  Galactica, since that is a little more believable. As always The Essential  Guide to Droids would make an ideal addition to the Star Wars role playing  table as well, and it has a good spread of robots from domestic, industrial  to combat and medical droids. A solid effort with great art work and well  written.
