 Many reviewers are right on the money with their sense of bafflement at the existence of this shiny blue and black contraption. I bought it when I had to stick my working PS2, (my first one rolled over and died), when space in my office was at a premium and since I am rather klutzy at times, anything that kept it safe(r) could only be a good thing. Except for making a vertical Playstation 2 harder to tip over, it does nothing. It looks good, it's standy-ness cannot be denied. I can't wait for the Playstation 3 wall mount adapter or the ceiling mobile adapter or maybe an attractive PS3 hat ensemble. Sony is obviously preceding with the concept of `if you make it, they'll buy it.", which leads me to the horizontal stand... a beveled piece of blue and black plastic which sits under your PS2, now that makes no sense- who would buy such a thing!?! Oh... right...
