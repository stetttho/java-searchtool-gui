 This book provides the reader with a rare glimpse of a lot of concept art and even model making that ILM produced for the 3 Star Wars and 3 Indiana Jones movies. And unlike, the Art of Star Wars Episode 1 for example, there  is more text than simple art credits, and includes descriptions on how the  different tools (say, matte paintings), are used for effects in the films.  The book also provides an excellent look at ILM's story boards, which are  usually so well drawn that they would make ideal comic books. It has a  beautiful series of pictures of props-from Colt pistols to blasters, from  scimitars to lightsabers, all held together with great informative text by  Mark Gotta Vaz and Shinji Hata. This is one of my favorites.
