 I've always been a big fan of the Forgotten Realms' selection of godly powers with a nice eclectic mix of characters from our own mythology and some generally solid creations of the authors' own. Powers and Pantheons is  a good collection that expands on an already voluminous selection of  deities within the Faerun, and gives the player a very wide choice of gods  to choose from, be they good, evil, or indifferent. My only major gripes  are some of the special abilities the priests get are sometimes too  overpowering. Mostly, though it is the absurdity at the temple of Selune in  Waterdeep. Apparently the goddess gifts her faithful with great big gobs of  glowing white goo that resembles something that Cthulhu my blow out of his  nose. I have visions of this naughty tentacle monster chasing squealing  Selunites around the temple like some goofy Urutskodoji monster. Second is  the moronic assertion that a lich is anything but EVIL! And so ALSO at the  temple of Selune with the glowing goo is an arch lich...who is chaotic  good...who sustains her appearance by life leeching evil creatures...and  this is OKAY with people?  Come on, creatures are CONSIDERED TO BE EVIL  because they life leech other creatures, and a supposedly good aligned  creature doing it to evil creature DOES NOT make it okay.   Other than  that, this is a solid work and a good addition for any DM who wants to add  more religions to his or her campaign and maybe give players some new  choices for faiths. Well worth a look.
