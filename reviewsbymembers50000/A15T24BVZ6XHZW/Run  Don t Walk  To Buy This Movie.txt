 If you have never seen this movie you are truly in for a treat!  Not only is the story timeless, the music is supreme!!!  With songs like "Impossible", "In My Own Little Corner", and on and on, and actors, the likes of which we will never see again, Celeste Holm and Ginger Rodgers, and Walter Pidgeon.  But, as far as I am concerned, Leslie Ann Warren is Cinderella!  She is the most beautiful Cinderella that I have ever seen, and her voice is beautiful in this movie.   I can remember, back to 1965, as a child of 10 watching this movie on a black and white TV for the very first time, in it's theatrical debut.  It was so wonderful, and the memories of those times, flood right back I see it now.  This production is timeless...it survives the test of time. So, for those of you who have never seen this movie, you will most definitely enjoy it, and want to see it, and hear it again and again.  And for those of you, like me, it is an extra special treat to own it now, so that I can see it whenever I want!  You won't be disappointed with this one!  Enjoy!
