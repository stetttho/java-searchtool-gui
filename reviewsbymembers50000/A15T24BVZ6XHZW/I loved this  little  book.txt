 What a wonderful book, full of insightful comments on our everyday life's experiences.  A very easy read, but one that you will go back to for inspiration time and time again. I only wish I had had this book upon my graduation from College!  Alot of the chapters brought forth ideas and  opinions of my own to the surface of what seems to be a very busy life.  It  definitely is a must read for all of us who sometimes feel a little  overwhelmed by life's "little" dramas!  I wish Maria much luck  with this "little" book, and I will look forward to her next  work.
