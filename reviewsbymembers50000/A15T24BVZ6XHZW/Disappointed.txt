 I am a very big fan of Linda Eder's...and it pains me to say that this CD was a disappointment.  The songs were not that memorable, and I found myself longing for a "Vienna" in amongst them. While Linda's voice is still far superior to almost anyone else out there...the songs that she chose for this CD were just not that good.  My favorite out of the collection was "Smile", which by coincidence is also featured on Barbra Streisand's newest CD.  Linda's voice mirrors Barbra's and it was a pleasure to listen to this rendition.
