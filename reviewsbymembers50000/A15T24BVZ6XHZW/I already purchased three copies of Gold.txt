 Well, the CD has only been out two days, and I have already purchased three copies!  Okay, one copy is for myself, which has already been played from beginning to end at least 8 times, and the other two are for friends who are also fans of Linda Eder.  I think that this is her BEST CD since "It's No Secret Anymore".  The compiliation of songs is diverse as it is sweet!  Linda's voice resonates with "Gold"en tones throughout the CD.  Her personal rendition of "Here Comes The Sun" is charming, and her vocal range on "Gold" only proves to all of us who love her, just what a talented gift she has given us over the years.  My hope with "Gold" is that the songs on this CD will get better radio play, more coverage than previous.  She definitely deserves that.   Lastly, the song "If I Loose My Way" touches the heart, and reminds all of us how precious relationships close to that heart truly are.   Thank you Linda for a CD that that exhibits the very best you have to give!  I'll look forward to your next one. RUN, don't walk, to buy this one!!! You won't be disappointed.
