 I absolutely love this knife.  It's light weight, but can do a heavy workload in the kitchen.  Great for dicing, slicing, and paring.  I especially love how it easily cuts through onions, making the finest dice.  The manufacturer says that it is dishwasher safe, but I would definitely not run it through the dishwasher, may dull the blade.  The best thing about it is it's weight in your hand, and also the safety sharpness of the blade.  If you love to cook, and don't look forward to the dicing, splicing, chopping, and paring of your favorite recipes...this is the knife for you.  It will make those jobs fast, and accurate.  The price fluctuates on this item as well.  I've seen it on sale for as low as $13.95 at some speciality stores.  ENJOY!!!
