 I absolutely loved "Once and Again" and was so disappointed when the network cancelled it.  I hoped against hope that the public's outcry to bring it back on the air would spark Network Execs, but to no avail.  Fortunately, Buena Vista DVD brings to our DVD screens once and again, the trials and tribulations of this extraordinary storyline.  The episodes included are the first 22 including the Pilot episode where Lily first meets Rick...and the romance between the two of them ensues.  The quality of this DVD series is wonderful.  The pictures are crystal clear.  The only thing missing is more interactive materials available on so many other DVD sets (i.e. interviews with the cast, outtakes, etc.).  But maybe they are saving that for the next set (hopefully there will be another set - the next season).  I believe the price is relatively good considering the fact that you are getting 22 episodes.  And the boxed set does come with plastic inserted compartments for the DVD's themselves.  Very nice packaging. Overall, I give this selection 5 stars, and would recommend it highly! Enjoy!
