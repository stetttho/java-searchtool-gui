 I loved "Stuart Little", and I am 44 years young! I thought the use of special effects in this movie was very well done, you almost forgot they were there.  It was artistically pleasing to the eye.  And the  characters were fun.  But more importantly, Nathan Lane, as the starring  feline, was wonderful!   He stole the picture!  I bought this video just  for that fact alone.  But I would recommend this movie to kids and the kids  in us adults as well.  It was a feel good leaving the theater type movie!   Enjoy!
