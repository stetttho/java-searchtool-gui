 Linda's versions of "By Myself" and "Over the Rainbow" on this fabulous CD tribute to Judy Garland remind me of the way I felt the first time I heard "Vienna"...goose bumps a plenty!  The range of her vocal talent is unsurpassed.  She is absolutely phenomenal.  While there will never be another Garland, the world is more than ready for an Eder!  Thank you Linda for this wonderful gift.
