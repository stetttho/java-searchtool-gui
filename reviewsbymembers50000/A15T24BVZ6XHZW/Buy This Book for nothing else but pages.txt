 This is by far the VERY BEST Carrot Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting Recipe you will ever try!  Not only did my Mom try it years ago for parties etc. but she handed the cookbook down to me, and I used this recipe for a "Groom's Cake" for my then fiance, soon to be husband.  18 years later, it is still his very FAVORITE Cake of all time.   This recipe is a doozy...lots of ingredients, and it does take some time to put it together, but believe me, it is worth every minute of the baking experience.  Maida Heatter's directions are so easy to understand and the cake itself is foolproof!   That's not to say that this is the ONLY FABULOUS recipe in the book, far from the case!  This book is a treasure trove of wonderful dessert cake recipes.  You will not be disappointed. Thank you Maida Heatter for a Carrot Cake that is par Excellence!
