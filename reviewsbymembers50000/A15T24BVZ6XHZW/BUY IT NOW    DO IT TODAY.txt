 Linda Eder is the finest vocalist I have EVER heard!  Forget Streisand.   Forget Garland.  Forget Minelli.  Her vocal range is unstoppable, and the  heart and soul that she puts into each and every song allows the listener a  chance to share in the feeling.  I had the opportunity to see her perform  in San Francisco at the Orpheum Theater in July (2000).  When she sang you  literally got goosebumps, and when the concert was over you just could not  speak to explain your feelings about her performance...she was that  wonderful!  "Vienna" is the most beautiful song I have ever  heard, and the range and performance is amazing.  I also love the  orchestration behind the voice as well.  She is a talent not to be missed.   So, buy it now....and DO IT TODAY!  You won't regret a single minute of her  voice!!!!
