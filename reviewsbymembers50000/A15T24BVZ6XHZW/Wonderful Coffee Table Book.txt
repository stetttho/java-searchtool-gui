 For years, I collected Royalty Monthly Magazine, and any other source that  would include photographs of Diana, The Princess of Wales.  Now, there was  no need, as this book is a wonderfully complete compilation of photographs  taken of the life of the late Diana, Princess of Wales.  I enjoyed each and  every page, as well as the writing.  The text tells her fascinating story,  but the photographs are crystal clear and artistically pleasing to the eye.   Each photograph brings back a memory of a time gone by.  From her  childhood days, to the Wedding, to her life after Charles.  Included is a  photograph taken of Diana very close to the last days of her life.  It  tells it all...it shows a confident, newly born Diana.  The reason that I  gave my review the title of "Wonderful Coffee Table Book!" is  because it truly is the size of a large coffee table book, and a must have!   Enjoy!  I will treasure this collection of photographs always.  I  recommend it highly!
