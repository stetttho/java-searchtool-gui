 This is a must have book for all of us wanting to eat right and feel fit.   I began watching Kathleen on the Food Network several months ago, and am hooked!  Not only are her recipes quick, easy, and usually with very few ingredients...the best thing of all....they taste GREAT!   In June, I decided it was time to say goodbye to my weight gain over the years, and do something healthy and good for myself.  I saw Kathleen's show "Cooking Thin" and learned so much from her.  Her "tips" were wonderful...and made great sense.  And the recipes she demonstrated on the show were as easy to make in my own kitchen. The cookbook is a wonderful companion to the Show.  And not only is it just as valuable as my "powerwalking Reeboks" on my quest for a new lifestyle change and a new me...it is also just as valuable if you don't have to loose weight.  The recipes are nutritious, and complete.   The only drawback, and hopefully this will be corrected when she comes out with her next cookbook...photos of the completed dishes would be a wonderful addition.  But the book itself is chocked full of good advice.   So go out and get it for yourself, and do something positive for your life!  You'll feel better for it! Enjoy!
