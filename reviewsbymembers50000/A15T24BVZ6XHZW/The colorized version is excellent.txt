 You won't be disappointed if you chose to get the colorized version of the first season of Bewitched.  It's crisp, and very clear, and not at all distorted.  I loved this show especially the characters played by Paul Lynde!  He was wonderful.  Sorry he didn't live to see all of this happen to such a beloved show. Thanks to the studio for releasing this season, and hopefully we won't have to wait very long for future season releases.
