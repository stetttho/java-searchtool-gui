 I am a Genesis fan from back in the mid 70's, when the Gabriel-propelled songs made this band truly one of the pioneers of prog rock.  When they switched over to Phil Collins at the helm, granted "Seconds Out" was absolutely fabulous, extraordinary, BUT their studio albums began to become a bit too pop for me.  Towards the end, there were newer Genesis songs that were so sickly pop they would make Britney Spears cringe, and this was all Collins fault, in my opinion.   At this point, I still loved Genesis, but now ONLY the OLD Genesis (from "Seconds Out" on back); the new stuff I actually hated.  Yes, hated.   Along comes this album, and although not in the same league as pre-'78 Genesis, it's easily the best works to come out under the title of "Genesis" in a lonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnng time. It's good, quite good, and it's a shame that this version 3.0 of Genesis didn't have a chance to continue.
