 God I love this album.  It took many, many listenings before it grew on me, but now I literally can't go more than two days without playing it.  The vocals of Rob Sowden are great on this disc; Clive  Nolan's keyboards add such gorgeous sound, the drumming and bass fantastic; for me, the best part is John Mitchell on guitar.  The man just makes this instrument sing.  Incredible!  I discovered Arena completely by accident, purchasing first "The Visitor."  That is a wonderful album, but not quite in this league.  Then I got "Immortal?" and I was blown away.  "The Butterfly Man" and "Moviedrome" are epics, just classic, mind-blowing epics.  (Obviously I encourage getting that disc as well.)    Now enter the Contagion series ("Contagion," "Contagious," and "Contagium").  Ohhhhh Myyyyyyy Godddddddd!!!  Just about every song is an epic.  It is moving, beautiful, rockin', mind-blowing, and powerful all at the same time.  It is literally my favorite prog-rock album ever . . . in fact, probably my favorite album of any type.  And to give you an indication of the music I love, I'm a rabid fan of Yes, Porcupine Tree, Dream Theater, Pink Floyd, The Flower Kings, Transatlantic, and Radiohead.  So, if any of those bands stimulate your musical ear, then just get this album and hear it over and over and over again.
