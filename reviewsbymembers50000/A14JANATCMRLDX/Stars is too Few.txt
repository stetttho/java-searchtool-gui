 There were three discs which I simply thought could not be equaled or paralleled -- "Lightbulb Sun," "Stupid Dream," and "Signify."  Those three discs of Porcupine Tree are the quintessential brilliance of this band and Steve Wilson . . . . and then along comes "In Abstentia." As difficult as it was for me to believe that anything could ever be as great as those three discs, "In Abstentia" is just as fabulous!   To start off with "Blackest Eyes," I thought to myself, "Ah, it has the same grab you by the throat attention-getting as does 'EvenLess' from 'Stupid Dream.'"  And then "Trains," of course, is beautiful and poetic.   "Gravity Eyelids" has that heavy, brooding overtone which characterizes so many of PT's greatest heart-wrenching, gut-wrenching songs.  "Wedding Nails," "Prodigal," and "Dot Three," they are all great, wonderful, powerful songs.  "Strip" has that same brooding intensity as "Gravity Eyelids."   One of the many things PT does so brilliantly is ending their cd's with those beautiful, softer pieces which cool you down after the intensity of their disc's earlier songs.  "Dark Matter" ending "Signify;" "Fadeaway" at the end of "Up the Downstairs;" and "Stop Swimming" at the end of "Stupid Dream" -- they are all perfect bookends to complete and close POWERFUL cd's.  Well, PT does it again by ending "In Abstentia" with the haunting and yet beautiful "Collapse The Light Into Earth."  Wonderful, perfect placement. Now, there are a number of songs which I did not mention, but trust me, what I failed to mention in this review, they are all still wonderful! Porcupine Tree is absolutely a force to be reckoned with, and we will (hopefully and thankfully) hear much and much more of them in the future. GET THIS DISC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
