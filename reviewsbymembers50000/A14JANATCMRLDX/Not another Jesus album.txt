 I have always loved Spock's Beard, I love Transatlantic, and "Snow" is truly a remarkable achievement in music.  However, as much as I realize that Spock's Beard was really Neal Morse, I just couldn't get into this Jesus-has-saved-me album.  Musically, the album is fine.  Lyrically, a real turn off.
