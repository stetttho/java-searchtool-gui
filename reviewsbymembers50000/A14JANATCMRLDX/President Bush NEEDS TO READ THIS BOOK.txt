 In fact, every American citizen needs to read this book.  If this book isn't read by all, and if what Col. Hunt outlines here isn't implemented, then what's going to happen is that 20 years from now when the United States no longer is a prosperous nation -- or a nation at all! -- people are going to be reading this book and thinking, "Ohhhhhhh, so that's what we could have done to avoid this utter hell and misery which now is our lives and our nation."  READ THIS BOOK!!  READ THIS BOOK!!  READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  AND THEN GET EVERYONE YOU KNOW TO READ THIS BOOK!!!
