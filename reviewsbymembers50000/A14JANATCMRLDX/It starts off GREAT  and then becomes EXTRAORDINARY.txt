 Okay, Brittany Spears, the first time you hear her, it's cute.  The second time, it's annoying.  Any time more than that, you want to ... her. Marillion, however, is the antidote to the Britany's and  Backstreet's of the world.  With Marillion, you start off immediately  liking it, and then you start to gravitate to some certain songs as your  favorite, then you come to regard them ALL as great, and then you come to  love every last bit of music they perform.  The bottom line is this:  They  start off fantastic, and get better with each listening. I grew up loving  YES, Pink Floyd, (old) Genesis, the Beatles, and the The Who. If any of  those bands are your style, then you MUST get this disc.  Afraid of  Sunrise, Out of This World, Afraid of Sunlight, and King are some of the  most moving pieces you'll hear.  They're full of that great, brooding,  pained pure raw emotionalism, with just some of the finest musicianship  I've ever heard. I simply cannot stop playing this disc.  It just gets  better and better and better!   You cannot go wrong with this disc.
