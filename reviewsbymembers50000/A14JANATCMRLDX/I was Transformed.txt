 I'll come right out and confess that I've been a PT fanatic for over 7 years now . . . I'm sure a lot of people don't even realize that this band has been together (i.e. Steve Wilson writing, playing, and singing) for quite some time already.  I have LOVED everything that PT has done, with their last album "In Abstentia" top of the top of the top. So when "Deadwing" was due to be released I awaited with mixed feelings -- I couldn't wait to hear it but there's always that worry that the album won't quite live up to the other ones. I mean, eventually this happens to everyone; not every album can top the previous.  So I got the album, listened to it a few times, and I had the same reaction that a lot of people had -- good, even quite good, but not spectacular. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars. Now, don't get me wrong, I genuinely loved it and I listened to it regularly but I didn't think it was a masterpiece . . . until one day, that is . . . .  One day I was giving it a spin, probably the 20th time I was playing it, and all of a sudden it sank in -- holy crapolie, this *IS* a masterpiece!!!  4 out of 5 stars, baloney! This is 5 out of 5 stars, even 6 out of 5 if Amazon would allow that. "Deadwing" is just as spectacular as any of the others . . . just as classic as "Stupid Dream," just as passionate as "Lightbulb Sun," and just as kick-ass rockin' as "In Abstentia." It truly, truly IS a masterpiece and I cannot put it away.   I ask all listeners to give this album a fair shot and to disregard both (A) the 3 or 4 out of 5 star reviews and (B) your own initial reaction if you find the album a bit tepid. Give it some time and like fine wine, this just gets better and better every time you hear it.  Yes, this ALBUM IS PURE BRILLIANCE!!
