 I loved, absolutely loved OK Computer, and have been waiting for their "part II" of that disc since.  This is quite close. On another note, if you like Radiohead, THEN YOU MUST CHECK OUT . . . ."PORCUPINE TREE." . . . . They are like Radiohead and Pink Floyd intertwined, but better than both in my opinion.
