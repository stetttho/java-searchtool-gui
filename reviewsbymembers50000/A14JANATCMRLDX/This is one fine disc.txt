 Okay, okay, some of the tracks are a little sub par, but the songs "Don't Kill the Whale," "Onward," "On the Silent Wings of Freedom," and "Madrigal," well, those 4 make the disc worth the purchase!  And that is not to say that the other ones aren't good, but that list of 4 are superb! This disc is that one odd Yes album which is difficult for some Yes fans to like -- oh, yah, this and the "Union" album -- but once you get used to it, it'll really grow on you.  I promise.
