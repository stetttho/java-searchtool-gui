 This the first disc put out by Porcupine Tree when PT was really just Steve Wilson writing and performing all the instruments on all the songs. I almost didn't buy this disc, for the reviews marked it as uneven, and an indication of all the different directions that PT could have gone, but was still unsure of at this time.  I, however, like to think of this disc as a trailor to all the directions that Steve Wilson and Porcupine Tree HAVE gone! Yes, this is an extremely eclectic mix of musical styles, but that is not a drawback.  No, on the contrary, that is what makes PT such an amazing band -- each song sounds so completely different, yet all of them are fantastic. "Jupiter Island," "Radioactive Toy," and "Nine Cats" -- those three songs alone make the disc worth getting.  I mean, even if the rest of the disc were not great, I would still buy it just for those three songs.  Yet, the rest of the disc IS great. This disc marks the beginning of Steve Wilson's and Porcupine Tree's multi-direction settings, and it's easily the BEST debut I've ever heard by any band ever . . . . .  . . . of course, Porcupine Tree is one of the best bands on the face of this planet!
