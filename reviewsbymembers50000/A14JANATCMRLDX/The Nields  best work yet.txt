 Without question, this is the best work The Nields have ever done, and that is in comparison to their previous work which is fabulous in its own right.  Their melodies, their voices, the instrumentation, the songwriting,  the storytelling, all of it is superb.   Bottom line, folks:  Music  doesn't get any better than this . . . and when will Amazon finally allow  us to place ten stars for those once in a lifetime stellar discs such as  this one!
