 What amazes me in reading the negative reviews that some readers just don't get what Bill is trying to teach, and that is to judge an expression or an act on its own merits and NOT on whether or not you like the person him or herself.  In other words, the people who wrote scathing reviews of this latest book by Bill wrote such simply because they do not like the man personally.   The 1-star and 2-star reviewers for this book aren't reviewing the book; they're reviewing Bill O'Reilly's personality.  Such an approach is the exact antithesis of what Bill is trying to teach in his writings. What Bill does brilliantly in this book, as with his other two, is to get people to be independent thinkers and not just vote on party lines.  And by that, I'm not meaning "don't just vote Republican because you're a Republican," but it also means don't think one particular way or another because of your ethnicity or age or sex or religion. If the world could be run by more Bill O'Reilly's, then we would have a system of prosperity and fairness.  Yes, the fat cats who get rich at our (the average American's) expense would hate these "Bill "O'Reillys," but it has always been known that when you stand up for justice -- and this is exactly what Bill O'Reilly does! -- then the criminals will hate you.  When you think of it, being hated by the "bad people" is a sign that you ARE doing something right, and in Bill's case, in this book's case, he definitely IS sticking up for every (honest) American citizen.  To the greedy crooks, he's saying "Screw you!" 5 Stars is too few; this book deserves 10 STARS!!!!!!!
