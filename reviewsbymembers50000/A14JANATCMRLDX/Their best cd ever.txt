 I had always liked Rush, but never loved them . . . . until now, that is.  I was a huge fan of "2112," "Permanent Waves," "Moving Pictures," and "Hemispheres."  However, after those albums, I kind of fell off of the Rush trail . . . . again, until now.  "Vapor Trails" is easily Rush's BEST DISC EVER!!  They have now, for me, entered into that category of "I can't enough of this" style of music. Pick up this disc and give it a few listenings.  You'll appreciate it greatly.
