 First off, only 5 stars!?!?!  Let me put down 100 out of 5 stars! I have been elevated to a new level of musical appreciation and joy that I never thought possible before! I have seen YES 11 times in the last four years, and their Symphonic Tour is no exception when I say there never has been such an amazing band!  When I learned that YES was coming out with a DVD release of one of their symphonic performances, I was it absolute ecstasy knowing I would have the opportunity to watch over and over and over again a concert during a tour which brought me tears when I saw them perform live. First off, major kudos to Tom Brislin.  I have been one of the hugest fans of Wakeman since the 70's, but as much as I missed Rick on this (and other) tours, I thought that Brislin did a phenomenal job! Jon, always the voice of an angel! Steve, a master of guitar . . . although he does look a little bit stiff and too serious at times. Chris, he is a monster on the bass!  I'm sure that when he walks into music stores, the bass guitars quiver with fear.  Rarely will you ever see someone rock a guitar like that Mr. Squire! Alan, one of the most consistently perfect drummers ever!  He's not the fanciest of drummers (e.g. like Mike Portnoy of Dream Theater), but he is consistently, consistently perfect in what he does!  A buddy of mine is a professional drummer and he says the same thing! I am reticent to mention a highlight about this dvd because *ALL* of it is beyond outstanding.  I have chills every time I watch it, it's that moving.  However, if I *had* to cite a highlight, I would have to say the drum section in "Ritual."  One of my favorite all-time songs anyway, but they took this song to a whole new level! If you're going to be stranded on a desert island and you have only one dvd, make it this one! May YES continue to live healthily and happily and continue to bring pure joy to so many millions of fans! Thank you, YES.
