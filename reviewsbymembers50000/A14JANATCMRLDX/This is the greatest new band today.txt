 What can I say?  It frustrates me that I cannot use words to evoke the pure joy I receive from this most brilliant and genius of bands! My only wish here is that I could mandate that all people buy all that is Porcupine Tree.  This is truly one of the most exceptional bands to ever have grouped -- and, of course, that essentially states that Steve Wilson is one of the most purest of musical geniuses to have roamed this planet. I grew up loving Pink Floyd, (old) Genesis, Yes, King Crimson, ELP, and came to acquire a taste and love for Radiohead and Live in more recent times.  The sum total of all these aforementioned bands = the most incredible joy and moving musical experiences I could have ever dreamed of.  If that aforementioned list is all there was, then I would still be quite content.  I have experienced so much delight in the amazing genius of their musics.   However, even though I have been quite satisfied with the great songs and epics of that list of fabulous bands, I have to admit that I was never so blown away as when I first discovered Porcupine Tree. Pick up this disc, along with everything else by Porcupine Tree, and you will suffer from repeatedly burned-out cd players as a result of overuse.
