 I first heard this two-album set -- yes, I said ALBUM -- back in 1978, and was utterly blown away by it then.  Over the last 24 years, it has continued to one of my absolute favorite musical recordings ever . . . not just by Genesis, a fabulous band (before they went pop), but this is one of the best collections of songs and performances by anyone at any time!   Get this disc set.  You will love it!
