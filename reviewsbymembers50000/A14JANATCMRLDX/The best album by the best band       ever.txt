 I agree Chris Turk's thorough review, with one major exception: the album does NOT "go downhill" once you come to "Hatesong," no, not at all.  At this point, "Hatesong" is just the beginning of the best of PT's music!  It is an amazing piece with brooding lyrics and a wonderful darkness to it.  Of course, "Russia on Ice" is simply one of the most spectacular epic pieces ever written!  I liken this to Yes's "Awaken," full of body, length, emotion, and the most brilliant use of orchestra to back a rock piece you'll ever hear! I saw this band in concert, and I have never been so awestruck by the sheer musical genius of Steve Wilson and his band, Porcupine Tree.  Get this disc, listen to it, let it settle in, and once you feel that you love this disc so much that you wish it were twice as long, go buy "Stupid Dream."  Once you are so crazed by that disc that you cannot put it away and you just want more and more and more of Porcupine Tree, then get out your credit card, and pick up everything they have ever issued.  THEY ARE THAT GREAT!! In essence, Porcupine Tree is a blend of Pink Floyd, Radiohead, (old) Genesis, King Crimson, and ELP . . . . but BETTER!!!
