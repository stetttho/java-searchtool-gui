 The entire disc is fabulous, and the orchestral arrangements are amazing!  It's not straight-up rock like, say, "Fragile," and not as ethereal and mystical as "Tales From Topographic Oceans" or "Close To The Egde," but some of the songs there, all backed by a great orchestra, are the most beautiful I've ever head.   In fact, two songs in particular, "Give Love Each Day" and "In the Presence Of," are two of the most gorgeous, moving songs ever written . . . . ever!  The harmonies and melodies just make me melt. I love this band, and 33 years after they formed, they are still on top of it all.
