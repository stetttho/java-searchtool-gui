 What a waste of time, money, and energy I expended in reading this book.  I picked it up originally a year or so ago, read it then, hated it, and put it away.  I picked it up this week and read it again, wondering if I would find insight that I could not get the first time through.  All I came to understand is that Noam Chomsky loves to label everything a conspiracy, and he loves to purport that American capitalism is to blame for the 9/11 attacks.  I guess we incited the fundamentalist terrorists to be so offended by our globalization that they had no alternative but to fly airplanes into our buildings.   So, according to Chomsky's reasoning, if some neighbors move in down the street and I happen not to like their religion or their occupation or their way of dress or the color of their cat, then I can always bomb them and blame the bombing on the "offense" they caused me? Give it up, Chomsky!  America is not to blame for every ill that we experience.  Have you not heard of people hating us for our ideologies -- i.e. we are the "infidels" -- and *THAT* is why they attack us!?!  Have you not learned that there are true evils in the world, and it is not always an American conspiracy?
