 Not all of the tracks on this disc do I listen to, but of the ones that I do, they piece together one of the best prog albums I've ever heard!!  Outstanding, outstanding, outstanding!!! Like any truly great music, it takes a while to get used to, but guaranteed the music elevates from "like" to "really like" to "love" to "I cannot stop listening to this", and this occurs pretty quickly!! If you want a quick introduction into the superb guitar work of Stolt, go immediately to "Astral Dog."  It's a wailing guitar with a great blues beat, and you'll just melt in hearing it.  This was my first Flower Kings cd, and I purchased simply because I absolutely love Transatlantic, of which Stolt is the lead guitarist and sometimes vocalist.  As I said, it required a few listenings, but this disc quickly grew to become one of my all-time favorites! P.S.  I would also encourage you to check out "Retropolis."  Equally outstanding!!
