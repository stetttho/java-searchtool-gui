 I love all works by Asimov, and meeting him in person one time was a high of a lifetime for me!! This book is one which is informative beyond imagination, powerful towards one's understanding of the world and science at large, and so fun to read. I miss having Asimov among us since his passing, but his genius will live on always, and this book is certainly no exception.
