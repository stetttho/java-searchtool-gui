 Instead of being titled "YES: Union", it *should* be titled "The Union of Two YES's."   The two Yes camps are clearly, clearly different, and there are no songs I can find that are truly a blend of both camps.  There are songs from "Yes 1" and songs from "Yes 2."   I have to admit that I like most of them, but I will say that it's evident in this album that Yes was not a -- and I mean A, as in singular -- band at this time.
