 This man Ritter actually believes, he actually states, that Iraq should be allowed to develop a peaceful nuclear program, provided that Saddam promises -- yes, you heard it correctly,  PROMISES -- that he will not develop WMD.   One simple question: What on Earth is this man Ritter thinking!?!  Saddam is a torturous, murderous tyrant who seeks control over the entire Middle East, a dictator who cannot be trusted one iota.  He has murdered more of his own people than one can count, and he has already laid down plans to level Israel as soon as he obtains nukes, and Ritter finds it acceptable that this sadistic tyrant be allowed a nuclear program!?!  Is Ritter *that* naive!?! I don't know what Ritter's objectives are, but I am sure that being a true American Patriot is NOT the case.  Perhaps making some money writing books and being popular with the ladies might be his motivation, but the security of the world's future is NOT his modus operandi. . . . unless, of course, he is truly insane enough to believe that Saddam will voluntarily begin to comply with all the U.N. Resolutions.
