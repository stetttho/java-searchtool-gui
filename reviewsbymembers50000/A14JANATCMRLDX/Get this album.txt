 2 reasons to get this album:  "The Butterfly Man" and "Moviedrome."  Those are two of the most classic epic prog songs ever written and ever performed.  It is amazing, mystical, gorgeous, poetic, and John Mitchell's guitar work is magical.  Amazing.  Now for the ever better news:  *ALL* of the songs on this disc are fantastic.  Even if the two I mentioned were the only great ones, it'd be worth buying.  But all of this album -- and I mean ALL of it -- is amazing.  Arena is easily the most underrated band out there!
