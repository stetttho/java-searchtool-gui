 Firstly, The Flower Kings are just amazing, miraculous, moving, charming, wonderful!  I can't ever stop listening to them, both the brilliance of Roine Stolt's writing and the performances of all the performers.   Now, as much as I love their studio work -- and in general, I almost always prefer studio work of a band over live performances, given the difficulty in producing live all of the intricacies of their music -- but with the CD (and the DVD of this performance as well), the live version actually blows away their studio work.  Hard to believe, but they do. I was completely mesmerized by their performances.  The details, the quality of sound, the tightness of the band, the sharing of leads by all the different musicians make this a fabulous adventure to watch and listen to.  And when you consider that three of them had the flu during this performance, it makes this even more spectacular. If you are at all a fan of Yes, Dream Theater, Spock's Beard, (old) Genesis, Marillion, or Transatlantic, I GUARANTEE that you will LOVE this band and especially LOVE this 2-disc set!!!  Unreal!
