 Another great 2-video-collections-on-1-DVD!!! Just like the Def Leppard DVD's ("Historia/In The Round, In Your Face" and "Visualize/Video Archive"), Metallica gives the fans their money's worth with a re-release of this excellent video. There's almost 4 hours of material on this DVD, and while there are no special features, this DVD doesn't need any!!! Some suggestions to Lars, James & Kirk: re-release the video for "One" on DVD, and a re-release of the LIVE S---: BINGE & PURGE box set with the concert videos on DVD. Anyway, great DVD compilation!!!
