 These DVD's are yet another reason the lads from Sheffield will still be around for a long time time to come...their music still holds up - AND STILL ROCKS!!!  Getting 4 video compilations down to 2 DVD's (and throwing in the videos from SLANG and EUPHORIA - great videos by the way!...especially the video for "Promises") was a great idea; Def Leppard still gives the fans their hard earned money's worth! ... In the interview section, the band talked about pushing limits, getting better and better and staying on top (or as they put it "you snooze, you lose...and we ain't snoozing") ...they certainly aren't snoozing.  ... In the meantime, enjoy these DVD's...they are definitely worth buying! LONG LIVE THE LEPS!!!
