 The greatest rap album of all-time - and I know I'll have dissenters - Dr. Dre's THE CHRONIC kick-started a genre into the stratosphere. "Nuthin' But A 'G' Thang" and "Dre Day" take me back to the summer of 1993 when I was in high school, they still hold up a decade later. Lyrics don't matter, it's the music here that matters. Nobody does it better than Dre. NOBODY!
