 I have a message for T-Boz and Chilli - put the new tracks that they just did with Left Eye (we will miss you Lisa - R.I.P.) with all of their greatest hits on one CD because it's been 10 years since their debut CD. Also, as a compliment to the greatest hits CD they should release a DVD/video compliation with all of their videos and live performances. I heard that they planned to continue on as a duo, so doing this would close the first chapter of TLC. If anyone reading this message has any connections to the group, please pass this idea on to them.
