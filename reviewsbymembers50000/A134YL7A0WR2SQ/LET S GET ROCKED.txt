 Both of the Def Leppard DVD's ("Historia/In The Round, In Your Face" and "Visualize/Video Archive") are excellent; the high point of "Visualize/Video Archive" has to be the amazing live version of "Rocket" from the band's homecoming performance in Sheffield, England, with Joe Elliott throwing in a few verses from Led Zeppelin's "Whole Lotta Love", Phil Collen and Vivian Campbell tearing a hole in the sky with some killer solos, and Rick "Sav" Savage and Rick "The Thundergod" Allen proving why they are the best rhythm section in rock. Just do yourself a favor and buy these excellent DVD's - they are more than worth it!!!
