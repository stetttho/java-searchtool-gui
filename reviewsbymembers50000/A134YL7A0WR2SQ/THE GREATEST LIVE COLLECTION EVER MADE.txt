 This box set is just excellent!!! Three CD's of audio (Live in Mexico City, February/March 1993) and two DVD's of video (San Diego, January 1992; Seattle, August 1989), now in a more convenient package than the original, and a bit cheaper. Where most groups would just throw together a half-baked live compilation, leave it to a group like Metallica, who truly gives their rabid fans nothing but the best, to amass a thunderous set like this. The Mexico City set is really good, though there is a sharp drop in audio quality between discs 2 and 3. The San Diego set is pretty cool, but it's the Seattle set (taken from the "Damaged Justice Tour 1989") that is worth the price of this collection alone!!!! I don't know what else can be said about this killer live package other than if you buy it, you will want to watch it and listen to it all the time!!!
