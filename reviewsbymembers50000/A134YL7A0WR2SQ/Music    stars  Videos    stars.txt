 While there are already enough New Order compilations (SUBSTANCE, THE BEST OF NEW ORDER and RETRO) this one is the best and the most concise. Though there are only 14 tracks covering 22 years, at least there are the complete versions of "Blue Monday", "Thieves Like Us", "Shellshock", "Bizarre Love Triangle", "True Faith", "Touched By The Hand Of GOD" and "Crystal" in all their 6 and 7 minute glory (unlike THE BEST OF NEW ORDER, which were mostly single versions). This compilation does overlap greatly with SUBSTANCE and RETRO, but SUBSTANCE a two-disc set, and RETRO is an expensive four-disc set, so this compilation is the best for your money (and if you are not a fan, I still recommend this disc for "Blue Monday", "Bizarre Love Triangle", "True Faith" and "Touched By The Hand Of GOD"!!!). Also, for a limited time, this disc comes with a bonus DVD with 3 videos - "Blue Monday/LIVE", "True Faith" and "The Perfect Kiss". All of the videos are good, but why didn't they put all of their videos on the DVD? Message to record companies and artists: If your gonna put out a video compilation, please include everything!!! Anyway, great compilation.College
