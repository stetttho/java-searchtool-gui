 2002 was such a lame year in music - this was a rare exception. This isn't some boring introspective singer-songwriter folk album, or some artsy-fartsy lo-fi indie-rock trash that mainstream and modern rock has become; this is what rock should be - loads of variety, fun, fun, fun and hooks galore with more than enough to go around!! Shania and Mutt Lange can write insinuating hooks and sensuous textures unlike most groups with half-baked, thrown-together songs. Also, Mutt Lange produced such classic rock gems such as AC/DC's BACK IN BLACK, The Cars' HEARTBEAT CITY, and of course, Def Leppard's PYROMANIA and HYSTERIA albums, so when he started producing his wife's music I knew I was in for something that sounded so good. THE WOMAN IN ME and COME ON OVER were so well executed that its stratospheric sales are no surprise, and with UP!, Shania and Mutt go a step further by offering each of the 19 songs in both "pop" (the red  disc) and "country" (the green disc) mixes (and in Europe and Asia, a blue disc with "eastern" flavored mixes). UP! should no doubt match it's predecessors sales' figures, and is definitely the best CD of 2002!! ("I'm Gonna Getcha Good" has gotta be the perfect pop song!) Ignore the music snobs and go UP! with Shania Twain!!
