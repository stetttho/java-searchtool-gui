 ...this should be one disc instead of two. In fact, Warner Bros. or Rhino Records should remaster this and all of Prince's Warner Bros. catalog, from For You (1978) to Friends 4 Sale: The Vault (1999) and since there's too many albums to re-release they should put out double-disc sets to cover everything. Here's what should be: SET 1: FOR YOU/PRINCE (CD 1); DIRTY MIND/CONTROVERSY (CD 2) SET 2: 1999 + B-Sides; PURPLE RAIN + B-Sides SET 3: AROUND THE WORLD IN A DAY + B-Sides; PARADE + B-Sides SET 4: SIGN O' THE TIMES; B-Sides/unreleased tracks SET 5: LOVESEXY + B-Sides; BLACK ALBUM + B-Sides SET 6: BATMAN soundtrack + B-Sides; GRAFFITI BRIDGE + B-Sides SET 7: DIAMONDS AND PEARLS + B-Sides; SYMBOL ALBUM SET 8: BEAUTIFUL EXPERIENCE w/extra tracks; GOLD EXPERIENCE SET 9: COME w/extra tracks; CHAOS AND DISORDER/FRIENDS 4 SALE
