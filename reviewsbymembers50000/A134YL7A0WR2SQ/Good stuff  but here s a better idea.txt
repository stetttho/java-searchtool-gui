 Like THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION, this compilation collects her biggest hits of the past 10 years onto one disc, and while it is very good, there are flaws - such as the single edit versions instead of the album versions, and so many hits and good album tracks that were left off ("Fever", "Bad Girl", "Rain", "This Used To Be My Playground", "I'll Remember", "You'll See", "Nothing Really Matters", "American Pie", "Time Stood Still" - which wasn't a hit but was a very good but overlooked track from THE NEXT BEST THING soundtrack - "Impressive Instant", "Runaway Lover" and "Nobody's Perfect") Anyway, what Madonna needs is a six disc boxed set (4 CD's/2 DVD's) that collects every hit single, choice album cuts, soundtrack songs, remixes, and for the DVD's, every single music video that she's ever done in her 20-year career into one nice and tidy package.
