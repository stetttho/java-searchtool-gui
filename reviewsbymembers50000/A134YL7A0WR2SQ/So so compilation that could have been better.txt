 THE OZZMAN COMETH could have been alot better - first of all, the Black Sabbath basement tapes sound terrible (what was Ozzy thinking?), plus there are so many good songs left off like "Flying High Again", "Perry Mason" and "See You On The Other Side", and also, I don't like the the edit of "No More Tears". But it doesn't matter, 'cause Sony is releasing the 2-CD ESSENTIAL OZZY OSBOURNE on Jan. 28, 2003. I haven't seen the track list yet, but here's what I think should be on it: CD 1 1. Crazy Train 2. Goodbye To Romance 3. Mr. Crowley 4. I Don't Know 5. Suicide Solution 6. Over The Mountain 7. Flying High Again 8. You Can't Kill Rock And Roll 9. Believer 10. Diary Of A Madman 11. Paranoid (LIVE w/Randy Rhoads) 12. Bark At The Moon 13. The Ultimate Sin 14. Shot In The Dark 15. Miracle Man 16. Crazy Babies CD 2 1. No More Tears 2. Mama, I'm Coming Home 3. Time After Time 4. Road To Nowhere 5. I Don't Want To Change The World (LIVE) 6. Perry Mason  7. I Just Want You 8. See You On The Other Side 9. Tommorrow 10. Walk On Water 11. Back On Earth 12. Gets Me Through 13. Dreamer 14. Iron Man (LIVE)
