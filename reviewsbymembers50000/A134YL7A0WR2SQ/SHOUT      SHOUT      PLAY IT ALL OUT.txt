 [Others have] said that Tears For Fears were one of the worst bands from the worst pop decade ever ... , these British blokes created some of the most memorable and endearing music of the 80's (and yes, I am a big fan of 80's music!). Anyway, at 17 tracks in 79 minutes, you couldn't ask for a better collection. From "Mad World", "Change" and "Pale Shelter" to "Shout", "Everybody Wants To Rule The World" and "Head Over Heels" to "Woman In Chains", "Sowing The Seeds Of Love" and "Advice For The Young At Heart", this is an excellent collection for a group that didn't release many albums during their career. Get this and enjoy!!!
