 I'm watching this DVD as I'm writing this review and so far, so good!!!! The early videos are so goofy and geeky - like so many other early 80's videos - with Sting, Andy Summers and Stewart Copeland defintely lokking like a punk/new wave band; while the later videos are more somber..and before this DVD came out, the only video I'd seen was for "Every Breath You Take". Those are the pros, here's the cons: the sound mixing is a little weird, they should have added the Synchronicity concert video on this DVD, and if they really wanted to make this a must have not just for diehard fans but for casual fans as well they should have packaged this DVD with the best-of compilation EVERY BREATH YOU TAKE: THE CLASSICS. Anyway, great DVD, but here's what should have been: CD 1. Roxanne 2. Can't Stand Losing You 3. So Lonely 4. Message In A Bottle 5. Walking On The Moon 6. The Bed's Too Big Without You 7. Don't Stand So Close To Me 8. De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da 9. When The World Is Running Down... 10. Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic 11. Invisible Sun 12. Spirits In The Material World 13.
