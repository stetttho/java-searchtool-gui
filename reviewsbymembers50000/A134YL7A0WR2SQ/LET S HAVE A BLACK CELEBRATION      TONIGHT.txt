 WOW!!! A great DVD - not to mention a big improvement over The Videos 86>98 compilation, which suffered from a grainy picture quality and terrible sound mastering. Not so this DVD - the sound is great (mastered in Dolby 5.1 surround sound) and the picture quality is pretty good. My only complaints is that they didn't perform a longer show (given their long list of classic songs) and that they didn't include the promo videos for the songs from EXCITER. Other than that, this is a great concert. I saw them on the "Exciter" tour in Houston, TX (July 14, 2001 at the Woodlands Pavilion), and along with seeing U2 on the PopMart tour in 1997, ranks as one of the best concerts I've ever experienced. Also, like U2, Depeche Mode truly have a special connection with their loyal fans, and it really shows in this phenomenal concert. P.S. - this is addressed to the band and their label - please re-release all of their classic recordings with bonus tracks, lyrics, pictures and a digitally remastered sound. Also, why not re-release the classic 101 live video/concert movie as well as the DEVOTIONAL video on DVD? Oh well, just a suggestion. Anyway, great live DVD - go out and buy it, and enjoy the silence...AND THE NOISE!!!
