 ...coming from a band that created such unimpeacheable classics  as PYROMANIA, HYSTERIA, ADRENALIZE & EUPHORIA, this new CD is a total letdown. I know, I know, I know - they shouldn't be stuck in the past rehashing the same riffs, but given that we are in 2002, you'd think that rock would sound alot more modern and futuristic; instead, nearly every current rock band rehashes tired sounds from the '60s and '70s (why don't bands copy sounds from the '80s?  In a strange way, most music from that decade sounds alot more futuristic and forward-looking than most current music) Anyway, I hate to knock a band that was a big fan of for 15 years, but this CD nearly killed my interest in them. But hopefully they'll rebound from this album like they rebounded from SLANG when they released EUPHORIA...
