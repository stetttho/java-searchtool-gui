 Lionel Richie finally gets a fitting retrospective with THE DEFINITIVE COLLECTION, which covers more ground than BACK TO FRONT and TRULY/THE LOVE SONGS did. Besides his trademark ballads (which to be honest, I love "Hello", "Easy", "Penny Lover", "Stuck On You", "Say You, Say Me", "Do It To Me", "Ballerina Girl", and "Goodbye"; I can't stand "Endless Love" and "Three Times A Lady" because they're too saccharine and so overplayed, and the rest are ok.) But the uptempo songs are just terrific. "All Night Long (All Night)" was the first Lionel Richie song I ever heard; that song brings back so many good memories. "Running With The Night" sounds like a great slice of 80's synth-pop with all those layers of keyboards and the obligatory guitar solo. And "Dancing On The Ceiling" is a guilty pleasure, a goofily infectious new wave dance track (back in '88 I bought the tape of DANCING ON THE CEILING and it reminds me of long road trips between Houston and El Paso that I used to take with my family.) The two new tracks are decent; "To Love A Woman" is a soulful duet with Enrique Iglesias which sounds like a leftover from Iglesias' ESCAPE, while "Goodbye" is a classic Lionel Richie Ballad in the mold of "Hello" and "Truly". The limited edition bonus disc contains 5 tracks: "Zoom", "Oh No", "Can't Slow Down" (early working version), "Lady" and, as an unlisted track, "Brick House", which makes the bonus disc a keeper. This collection could have easily been a full 2-disc collection, maybe that will surface in the future. Anyway, this is the best Lionel Richie CD ever.
