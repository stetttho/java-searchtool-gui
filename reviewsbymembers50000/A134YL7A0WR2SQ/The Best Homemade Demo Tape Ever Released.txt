 DIRTY MIND is defintely the most straightforward album Prince has ever made - though at eight tracks and 30 minutes, it's more like an EP. Warner Bros. or Rhino Records should remaster and reissue this album as well as all of Prince's Warner Bros. catalog because the original CD pressings don't sound as good as they could be. In fact, since there's so many albums to cover, they should rerelease his music in 2-CD sets to cover everything - and the first four albums are short enough that they could all fit on two discs. Here's what should be: PRINCE/1978-1981 (FOR YOU, PRINCE, DIRTY MIND, CONTROVERSY) CD 1 1. For You 2. In Love 3. Soft And Wet 4. Crazy You 5. Just As Long As We're Together 6. Baby 7.
