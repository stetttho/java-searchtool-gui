 OK, first of all, this was filmed waaaayyy back in 1983 - which means primitive picture quality (for us DVD freaks!!!) and goofy hair & clothes (heh, heh!!!) but hey, it was the 80's!!!. That said, what a concert!!! Being a diehard U2 fan - I have all of their CD's, 2 DVD's, and 2 videotapes..."Under A Blood Red Sky" on VHS...Bono and the lads connected that good with audiences!!! Like I said, despite the picture quality and goofy 80's hair & clothes (good for a few laughs, though!), WOW!!! Here's a full track listing: Surrender, Seconds, Sunday Bloody Sunday, The Electric Co. (unlisted track), October, New Year's Day, I Threw A Brick Through A Window, A Day Without Me, Gloria, Party Girl, 11 O' Clock Tick Tock, I Will Follow, 40...
