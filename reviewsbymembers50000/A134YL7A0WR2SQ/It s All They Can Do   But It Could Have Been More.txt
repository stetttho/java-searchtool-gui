 I rented this DVD, and it's not bad, but it could have been better. The live concert sounds kinda grainy - couldn't they have released a show from their later tours like the Heartbeat City tour? The interview gives plenty of insight into a very unique and innovative band. I just wish there was more music. One suggestion - they should re-release their videos for songs like "Drive" and "You Might Think" and throw in any live performances that they can come up with. Rest In Peace, Ben Orr.
