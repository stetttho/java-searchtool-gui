 I am so into techno and dance music right now, because I am fed up with punk, rap and metal. Especially, given that we are in 2002, you would think that alot of popular music right now would sound futuristic and dynamic, and unfortunately, that is not true. So I have all but sworn off punk, rap and metal (also because I don't feel like listening to music that makes me feel bad) and fallen once and for all to the stylish and seductive sway of trancey techno. These compilations just keep getting better and better, and the crossfaded tracks keep the vibe going. About the only gripe I have is that there aren't more tracks to keep it going until the CD stops (CD's hold 80 minutes of music, by the way), but what is here is irresistable. Darude's "Sandstorm" and that brillantly trancey cover of Duran Duran's "Ordinary World" are definitely the high points, and hopefully, there's more where that came from. Enjoy.
