 This DVD is great - we finally have all of their videos from 1990-2000 (especially the clips from ZOOROPA and POP which I'd previously seen once or twice). That said, it could have been a whole lot better - U2 should have gathered every single video they've made in their career and put it out (The Best Of 1980-1990 video collection still hasn't been released on DVD, and even though they came out in 2001, the videos for "Elevation" and "Walk On" weren't included) Like I said this DVD is great but here's what should have been: U2: The Complete Videos DVD 1: 1.
