 I was so excited for this!  Finally, a live concert video from X!  I've seen them twice, both times with Tony G. on guitar (he was superb by the way).  But we all know you HAVE to have Billy Zoom in the band. I haven't been able to see them, but this DVD will do the trick.  This DVD is AMAZING!! One listen/viewing makes me instantly forget all the "power pop" "punk" bands that are around now.  Their sound is fantastic, full, fast, heavy, thrilling!  All the members sound excellent, period.  I'm hopeful that there will be a tour, come on X!  Us old fogeys would like to see you old fogeys play your beautiful music for us!!
