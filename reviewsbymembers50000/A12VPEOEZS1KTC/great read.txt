 This is a great book.  If you are a fan of Mr. Heston's work, then you will most certainly enjoy this book.  I read it because I love his movies so much, and I very much admire the man.  Reading this book just increased that admiration.  The book also offers many insights into the movie making process behind the scenes, directors, producers, actors, etc.  Heston's writing is easy to follow, with many observations about numerous topics offered for thought.  Lets face it, Heston is one of THE greats of all time, and will always be.
