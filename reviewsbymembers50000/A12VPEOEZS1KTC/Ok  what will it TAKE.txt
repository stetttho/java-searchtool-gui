 Just thought I'd put in an updated request for the DVD.  This way someone at the studio will notice this and tell their bosses to put this out.  They are looking at these requests right??  Or, maybe they're all busy planning the next Gigli, Catwoman, or the like.  As long as I'm here, might as well add that this is a great thriller, filmed in the incredible settings of Southeast Alaska, and, it has THE MAN himself starring.  Nuff said.
