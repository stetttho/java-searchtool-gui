 Ok music fans, Triumph usually dosen't get credit as one of THE rock bands, and I'll leave that question up to the masses to figure out, however, they were a kick-ass rock band when I was growing up in the early 80's, surrounded by new wave and Madonna, and if you loved Rock, then you were thankful for bands like Triumph. They DESTROY on this concert!!  Rik's guitar is alternately effortlessy shredding, and ROCKING power chords!  The man is obviously a virtuoso muscian.  Gil on drums is always fun to watch, he is an excellent rock drummer and I always find it amazing when people can rock out AND sing at the same time, and Mike on bass does a fantastic job as well.  So, if you like Triumph, you WILL love this, if you don't, then it may or may not convert you.  Enjoy.
