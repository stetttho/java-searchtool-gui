 Wow, we've got some people that are hard to please!  Haven't you been exposed to the ways of Hollywood enough yet?  When there is something you LOVE, and they are going to make a movie out of it, how often is it incredible?  The VAST majority of the time you have to lower your expectations because the movie version IS going to be worse than the book, comic, etc.  Aeon Flux does a decent job of showing the cartoon in live action picture.  Does it do it justice?  Well, probably not, but is it a good science fiction movie?  YES, it is.  The next question has to be what sacrifices were made to bring this to the big screen, and are they acceptable?  If you like science fiction movies that deal with post-apocolyptic Earth, then I truly believe you will enjoy this.  Films like Planet of the Apes (old, not new crap), Omega Man, Soylent Green, Mad Max/Road Warrior, Wizards and the Matrix, if you like these I think you will be entertained, and may even really enjoy Aeon Flux.  If you don't like stories like those  mentioned, then you will NOT like this, and if you think the cartoon was incredible, then you may be disappointed in this.  Hey, this is just because I care man.
