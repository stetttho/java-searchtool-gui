 Hello music fans.   First, you can't slag this off because of the very important cause the show is for, its like being upset with the biker gangs who give toys for sick children to the hospitals, you may dislike bikers, but they're giving toys to sick kids man!  So, that being said, some of this music is great and some not so great.  I appreciate that there is a diverse offering in the performers on this, that is always cool, even if you don't like them all.  My favorite performance from this is without a doubt Mr. Plant and Mr. Page.  They just RIP on this!  Yes, they're older, if you can't handle classic rock or "old man" rock, then you won't dig this, just remember all you fans who said Radiohead was BRILLIANT on this, they themselves will be "old man" rock some day, and then what will you say?  hmmm?!  Jimmy and Robert got together for two excellent tours in the late 1990's, and this is the only official material released on video from the second outing where they were just the power trio with singer format.  They were fantastic, and the Parisian crowd rocks out with them!  So, check it out if you dare, just remember, this is for Amnesty International, not just a concert. Cheers.
