 If you like the Lord of the Rings, then I don't understand how you can't like this movie.  It is one of the finest animated movies ever made, period.  Yes, they cram two books into one two hour movie, who cares??  It is still the Lord of the Rings man!  Also, we all have a picture in our minds of what things looked and sounded like from these incredible books, (as it should be) but are the drawings that far off??  Of course not, every single drawing I've ever seen from these books (about six artists worth) are all similar, and if you disagree, then you need to have your vision checked.  To conclude:  If you love Lord of the Rings, then you WILL enjoy this!!
