 I'm sorry, those of you who said you skipped this concert just plain screwed up!  I caught this tour and it was unbelievable!  The energy was incredible, the performance was outrageous!  If you like Fleetwood Mac then I just don't see how you will be disappointed with this show.  Unless of course watching Lindsey just GO CRAZY on his guitar, John and Mic kick ass, and Stevie do her thing (yes, she's "getting older too") isn't for you, then skip it.
