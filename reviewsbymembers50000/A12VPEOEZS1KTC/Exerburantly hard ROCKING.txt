 Yeah, this is the one that got me going on the Surfers.  I'd heard some of the earlier stuff, but when I heard this I was blown away!  The guitar, bass, and drums are ROCKING!  They really rip on this release.  I was shocked to hear that John Paul Jones was producing them, but then I found an article in Guitar World about the recording of the album.  I just love the part in the article where the interviewer is talking to the band about how this is by far their hardest rocking album and (I think) Paul Geary says that "well, John Paul Jones liked the harder songs, so those are the ones we put on the album".  And the interviewer says "you let a producer choose the songs on your album??!!" and Paul says HELL YES, its JOHN PAUL JONES MAN!!!
