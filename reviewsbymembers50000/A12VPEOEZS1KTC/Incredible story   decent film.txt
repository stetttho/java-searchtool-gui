 What a fantastic story!  Really unbelievable, but it is true!  Yes, the movie brings hollywood into the story (I always have to spell hollywood with a small "h" to show my respect) so, the movie is more thriller than classic, however, it still is good, and I totally disagree that you only need to watch this once.  What is amazing is that we still don't have a conclusive explanation for what happened 100 years ago.  I've read articles about how the lions were simply feasting on what food was available to them--humans.  However, it dosen't really explain why they killed so often.  I've also read the "rotten teeth" theory, about how the lions were being driven crazy with pain over decaying teeth, but to the best of my knowledge, none of these have been overwhelmingly accepted.  SO, what is the explanation??
