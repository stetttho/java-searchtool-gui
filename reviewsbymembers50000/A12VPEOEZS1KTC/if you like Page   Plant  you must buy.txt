 I love Led Zeppelin, and I've followed all of the solo work of Page, Plant, and Jones.  I have another friend who loves Zeppelin and the solo work as well, but we disagree with this album.  I think it is damn good, some of the songs had to grow on me however.  Sometimes when I got a new Plant solo album, I loved it, other times I needed to get into it.  So my friend likes all of Plant's solo stuff, but admits he had to get into it sometimes, so now I say, Hey, this is like a new Plant album, with one important difference--JIMMY PAGE IS PLAYING GUITAR!!!  if you like these guys, you must own this--I saw the concert twice and was it Zeppelin? NO.  was it incredible music?  HELL YES.
