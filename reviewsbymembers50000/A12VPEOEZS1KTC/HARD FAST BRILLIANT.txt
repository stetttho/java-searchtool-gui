 If you like hard music, then you must own this album!  Motorhead's early stuff is amazing!  The drums, bass, and guitar are really incredible, this cd has good enough sound quality to follow all of it.  Fast Eddie's guitar just rips, on many of the tracks he just GOES OFF, and you wish they didn't fade the song out because you could just listen to his jams all day.  Philthy Animal Taylor's drum work is so damn good, he is the only Motorhead drummer, he is fast, he hits hard, and some of the cymbal work is so intricate (I know, "intricate" to describe Motorhead???--but it is TRUE) And finally Lemmy himself, the core of the band, when he isn't playing speed metal or bone crushing chords on his bass, he is just smoking all over the thing!  Kids, put away the new metal, and check out some real metal.
