 This is an incredible video.  I was a huge Zeppelin fan, but had never seen Jimmy "live" before until I first saw this program in the early eighties.  This was his first performance since the breakup of Zeppelin, and it was very intense.  He performs mostly solo material from Death Wish II.  He uses Jeff Beck's band for the show, and they are great, especially the superb Fernando Saunders on bass.  I love the whole concert, Clapton comes on and does his thing, then Jeff Beck plays a great set, then Jimmy comes on, and even though there might be some rough points, his energy is great and he just goes for it!!  The opening 2 minutes of his set (called "prelude") is alone worth paying for this.  My tape is so hammered at this point, and I didn't buy the laserdisc ever, now my only hope is that they will put this on DVD??  PLEASE!!!  Also, even though this is PAGE-BECK-CLAPTON, there are a huge number of other musicians participating in this important charity event to buy a special machine for England to help treat those suffering from MS. (maybe the DVD sales could go to this cause as well??)  ps  Page & Beck are one part II, clapton and others are on part I
