 Yes, what an amazing performance by Steve, Fantastic.  Just had to throw in some comments about his singing however--I really LOVE it!!  Come on, if you like Yes then we all know that Jon is THE voice.  But the first time I heard this (I didn't know there were vocals on it)and during "excerpts from Tales of Topographic", when Steve all of a sudden started singing I was BLOWN AWAY!!  His vocals fit the performance perfectly.  Maybe it is just me, but I find them quite emotional and powerful.  Ok, buy this and enjoy!
