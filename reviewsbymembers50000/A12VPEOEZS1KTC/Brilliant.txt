 Anyone who has any interest in Punk music will love this incredible film.  For those who don't like punk but love hard, fast music, you will love this.  And for the rest of you, it just rates as compelling viewing/social commentary.  I've been trying to find a copy of this for a long time, I'm hoping it will be re-released soon.  I watched this originally for the Black Flag and X footage.  The several X songs that are shown played live in this are amazing!!  If you are an X fan, this is something that you HAVE to watch.
