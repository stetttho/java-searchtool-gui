 I don't know why I do this, just because I'm a Zepplein freak I guess.  I just can't let another "Zeppelin weren't very good this night" comment slide.  People who write that just don't know what they are talking about, period.  Yes, we thankfully have the new DVD, and the West Was Won CD, but to say that they couldn't cut it on Song Remains Same is just a flat out LIE.  To be fair, YES, there is some cutting of performances using video footage from different nights and things like that, and there is the "fantasy" footage that may or may not bug you.  BUT, there is plenty of live music and live video to show you Zeppelin flying high in all of its glory!  The bow sequence alone during Dazed is EPIC, Jimmy is channeling the music from somewhere, who knows where!  Anyway you cut it, the band is in AMAZING form, pure and simple, and if you are unable to be moved by this performance, that is ok I guess, but you should stick to your Sinead O'Connor records and other "brilliant" "artists" of the like.
