 Can NOT believe that nobody has reviewed this!  Well then, lets just set the record straight shall we?  I think of this as the third album in a trilogy of albums following Roxy's final release, the beautiful "Avalon".  Then comes "Boys and Girls", and "Bete Noire", which are both excellent.  Mamouna fills out the trio by sticking with the same themes, but filling them out perhaps as far as they could be taken, I guess that's up for debate.  For you as people looking for info, I say if you like ANY of the albums I've already mentioned, then do NOT wait, order this!  My first feeling when I heard it was "Oh, it is more of the same", but then I went on to feel that this is another brilliant entry in Mr. Ferry's fantasitc portfollio.  The musicianship is top notch!  His band is simply amazing!  I saw them play "Love is the Drug" on Letterman, and I was shocked at how it "rocked".  OK, I could go on and on, get this!  If you don't know any of the albums I mentioned, then get Avalon first, then try the solo stuff.
