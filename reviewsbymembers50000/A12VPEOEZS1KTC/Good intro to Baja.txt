 I did enjoy this film, however it was a little too much "MTV" stylee footage for my tastes--you know, where they cut every 2-3 seconds to convey "maximum action".  The Baja 1000 needs NO enhancement!!  What I wanted to see was more SUSTAINED footage of the vehicles in action.  Yes, there is some of that, but not enough.  Just like concert videos and other sports footage, WE WANT  TO SEE THE ACTION!!!  that means NOT cutting back and forth like a mainiac, hey, this is just because I care man.
