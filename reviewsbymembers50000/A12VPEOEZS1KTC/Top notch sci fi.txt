 Ok, hard to add things to the hundreds of reviews, but since I just watched this again last night, and just read through many reviews, here are my thoughts.  The space marines are what the starship troopers should have been like, and in fact, I believe this movie team used the starship trooper novel as the reference for the marines.  Yes, I agree with the nitpicks on them not using certain ammo or Paxton's crying, but come on, who wouldn't be crying after what they've been through?  I can't believe anybody would bag on the first Alien movie, Aliens is so excellent, but the first movie is incredible.  My friends and I often wonder whether or not we could write our own sequel and have it be better than what hollywood put out.  Part III was worthless, and part IV was OK.  I've always wondered how another installment would play out, and while I've put some thought into how it what and how it should be, I don't think I've come up with anything impressive.  Alien vs Predator was fair, although they really could have kicked ass with that one, a lost opportunity.  Alien V has potential, as long as it includes the Alien home planet, we'll see if it ever makes it out.
