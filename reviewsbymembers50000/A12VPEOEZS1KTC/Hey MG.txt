 MG, when I got this tape many years ago, I watched it and was horrified that there was NO Joe Perry guitar coming through on the tape!!  Could NOT believe it.  Anyways, I was playing on a early generation Hi-Fi VCR (an Akai) and when I played it on a different VCR it was PERFECT.  Don't know why, but it was.  As for the show, I love it, if you only watch one song watch Seasons of Wither--simply brilliant! If you are a Aerosmith fan, I can't see how you would be disappointed in this show, are there glitches?  Yes, do we care?  NO, it ROCKS.
