 Ok, two things here, first, the good.  Supposedly the budget for this film was $65 million, if that is true, I am shocked that the picture could look this good for that relatively low amount.  When was the last time Hollywood did anything cheaper?  Maybe this could be a changing point in the $150 million film with the $35 million advertising budget--insanity.  Maybe Catwoman and others will add fuel to this idea. (yeah right)  The Bad news, what is it with these directors who think that they are bigger than the story?  Screw them.  It must have something to do with them thinking that they can't just make the movie of the book, or the comic, or whatever, they will somehow not be an ARTISTE, if they just copy the Alien vs Predator comics.  It is that, or, the other possibility is that these directors think that their ideas are actually BETTER than the material they are turning into a movie.  Isn't this where we get the "The book is always ten times better than the movie" saying?  I think that is what you have here.  The movie isn't as bad as the hard cores are saying, BUT, a chance was missed here to make a film that could stand with the first two Alien and first Predator movies.  Oh well, if it makes enough money, maybe we can see more, especially at $65 million. That being said, I didn't think this movie was as bad as the bad reviews said it was, I did get enjoyment from it.
