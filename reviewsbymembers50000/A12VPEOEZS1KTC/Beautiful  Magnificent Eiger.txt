 I love this book, and I love all of the writings of Mr. Harrer.  The two Tibet books and this are must reading if you love Mountain books, and if you are interested in Tibet.  Another fantastic book to read about the Eiger is The Climb Up To Hell, by Olsen.  Mr. Harrer was on the team that made the first successful ascent of the North Face of the Eiger.  It is an incredible event, truly one of the most fantastic in the history of mountaineering.  I have to laugh sometimes when I see and hear about all the "extreme" sports and athletes, letting us all know how radical they are, using their thousands of dollars of equipment and guides to do these things.  Just wait until we can get helicopters to fly higher in thin air, then we'll ALL be able to get to the summits of these mountains and have a beer and a bratwurst.  Until then, do yourself a favor and read Mr. Harrer's books.
