  YES, Mr. Ferry gives us another brilliant piece of music!  I got to know Roxy through Avalon, then worked backwards.  So I bought Boys and Girls because I thought it was his first solo album, which was wrong, it was his first solo album AFTER Roxy Music.  Anyways, by the time of Mamouna, I first listened, and thought oh, it is good, but it is more of the same since Avalon.  Then after several months and spins, I came to just love it on its own.  That brings us to Frantic.  If you are a fan of his music, then you will love this!  If you liked Roxy Music, especially their last few albums (Avalon, Manifesto, Flesh & Blood) then you should check out his solo albums--Boys & Girls, Bete Noire, Mamouna, and now Frantic, you'll love them!  I always say, if you're not a fan, you should try one of those last Roxy albums, and if you like it, then go forward from there into the solo stuff.
