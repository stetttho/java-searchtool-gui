 I can't believe no one has reviewed this yet!  I think this is the best 80's Bowie video.  If you like Bowie, then you will LOVE this.  In this concert, Bowie and his kick-ass band play through a great song set.  His band includes the excellent Carlos Alomar on guitar, who comes out in the first couple of minutes and shows where Steve Vai and Joe Satriani got their ideas from, Carmine Rojas on bass, who along with the drummer, lay down incredible rhythm for every song, and of course, Peter Frampton, whose guitar is just excellent song after song. Bowie and Frampton are old school pals, and they used to hang out and play music when they were teens, where Bowie says Frampton was already an excellent guitarist--Bowie brings him along and kind of brings him back into the game here, and he delivers. Bowies vocals are incredible throughout.  He and a cast do try to do some theater/drama stuff, which sometimes is really cool, and sometimes kind of corny, but who cares?  It is the music that matters man.  enjoy.
