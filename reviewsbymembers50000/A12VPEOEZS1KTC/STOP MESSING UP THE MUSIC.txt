 Hello, good movie for what it is.  The two leads are wonderful in this film, and John Heder from yes, Napoleon Dynamite!, is really great in his small role.  My beef is why in the HELL is hollywood (it deserves a small "h") having nobodys redoing popular songs for the movies??  It makes me ill when I hear it.  I thought, perhaps they are trying to save money by not paying the artists for the tunes, they can just pay some unkown band to sing the song for $25.  For example, when the Cure's superb song "Just Like Heaven" came on, with some lady singing it, I was cringing.  But then, at the end of the movie, the song comes on again, and it is the CURE that are singing it!! Thereby canceling out my theory.  SO, to reiterate, STOP SCREWING UP THE MUSIC!!!!
