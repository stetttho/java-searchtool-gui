 Can't believe I'm the first to review this, am I the only guy who bought it?!  This was X's last proper studio album, the "Unclogged" was not all new material.  I am a HUGE fan of this band.  What can you say?  They are BRILLIANT.  John, Exene, & DJ are just incredible, and I love Billy Zoom's guitar SO MUCH, but he isn't on this release.  Tony Guillikson (spelling?) is the guitarist, and he is just SUPERB.  I've seen X twice, both with Tony on guitar (even chatted him up in Seattle once) and like I said, it was damn good.  X still tours and Billy Zoom is back in the band, which is great, maybe I'll catch them sometime.  Anyways, with regards to this album, I already had every X album, so had to get this, and there is some great material on it, I know it will fall into obscurity when looking at the legacy of the band X, I guess that is ok when you look at their other classic albums (first three must owns, Los Angeles, Wild Gift, Under the Big Black Sun).  But if you like X, then you will like this album.
