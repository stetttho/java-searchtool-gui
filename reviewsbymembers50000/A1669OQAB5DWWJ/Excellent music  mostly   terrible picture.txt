 This DVD now takes its place as the DVD with the poorest picture quality in my collection.  None of the moving shots are smooth; instead they flutter across the screen. When the camera moves too fast, the picture breaks up into pixels.  It's almost headache-inducing.  The pixels become more and more obvious towards the end of the picture, particularly in the "bonus tracks", which are merely selections removed from the concert and touted as bonuses.  The poor image is NOT because of your DVD player: simply pause the scene and count the square pixels.  Only "Old MacDonald" and part of one of the bonus tracks have some English captions; the rest do not, despite the false claim on the case.  The picture is widescreen but not anamorphic.  The "Limbourgeois" TV special is full screen compressed to widescreen, so everything is flattened.  There's no way to correct it.  Shame on Denon for manufacturing such a shoddy product.  Except for the little tyke who plays the violin (too cutesy and out of tune, but remarkable for such a little guy, and his water "trick" gets very old), the music is performed well (the organ pedal part is missing from the Intermezzo, track 3: bummer).  "The Last Rose", with the heartbreaking female solo, is truly the finest performance of that song ever.  Still, it's hard to recommend such a poorly mastered DVD.
