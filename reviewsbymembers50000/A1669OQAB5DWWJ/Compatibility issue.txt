 Five stars for quality because of its reputation, but a quick note here to say that these are not compatible with the Pioneer PDR-609 CD Recorder - a somewhat picky model.  I used TDK instead with that older machine.  Before buying a 100 pack of anything, buy a single disc or small pack with the rest of your Amazon order to check compatibility first.
