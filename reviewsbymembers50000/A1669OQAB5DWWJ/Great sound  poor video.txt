 This review is for the Brilliant Classics import from the Netherlands, as pictured above.  Andre Rieu and his orchestra have found a wonderful niche in the music industry, somewhere between serious classical and a "pops" concert.  This looks like an orchestra that would be a lot of fun to play in.  The musicians are all very talented.  The sound on this disc is very good.  Unfortunately, the video quality is the worst in my entire collection of over 200 DVD. The compression is so bad, especially for the background scenes, that the movie looks like a "stop-action" movie, with the picture renewing itself at only half-second intervals.  When the camera pans quickly across the scenes, the picture breaks up into little square digital fragements.  What a shame, as this is a great concert.  The entry of the bagpipers will give you goosebumps.  Get his Tuscany DVD first.  That one has excellent video.
