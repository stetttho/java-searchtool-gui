 Hard to believe this gem is 27 years old.  For you Kate collectors, the cover art of this CD (not illustrated by Amazon) is the "Red Socks" or "Kate in a crate" cover that was used on the first EMI-U.S. release (not the Harvest "Vogue" cover). Buy this CD! Kate is a creative genius. [This review is only for the Amazon listing; if it is bounced to other sites the cover art comment may not apply.]
