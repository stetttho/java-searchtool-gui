 Don't throw your vinyl version away yet unless it's unplayable.  This "remastered" version deleted 33 seconds off the end on the title track!  How could they do that?  I A-B'd the vinyl and CD versions, and the CD version wins only in better high end detail and the lack of surface noise (which Atlantic pressings had in excess).  The vinyl has a better low end (bass guitar and kick drum have a lot more punch).  When I purchase a "30th Anniversary Edition" that is 24-bit remastered, I expect a better sounding recording than the original.  Not here.  It was remastered at Chop 'Em Out Studios.  How appropriate!  Fripp chopped his own recording.
