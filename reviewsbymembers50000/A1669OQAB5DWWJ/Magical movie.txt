 This is a beautifully done, magical movie. The video quality of the DVD is fairly good but not great.  There are many times when non-moving images (background walls, etc.) become static and "refresh" only twice a second: very distracting when you watch for it.  It is also in the less desirable non-anamorphic widescreen, with two-channel stereo.  Rachel Portman's score is gorgeous, and at times sounds more like Ralph Vaughan Williams than RVW does himself (aside from the actual RVW piece used in the film).  The picture transfer is clean.  It deserves a better digital transfer, however.  Still, better than VHS.
