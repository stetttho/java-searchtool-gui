 A wonderful movie for both adults and children.  Laughs and maybe some tears.  Some tech details left off Amazon's page:  languages: Russian, also dubbed English and French; subtitles: Russian, English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, Italian, and Japanese. Remixed to Dolby 5.1 (variable quality, sometimes electronically reprossed for stereo, some mono); full screen; 84 minutes; among the extras: an interview with the grown-up lead actress (what a change!).  There are two versions: one with the title MOPO3KO on the cover playable in all regions (my copy), and this one.  The first you can find in Russian stores.  If you're learning Russian, this is probably beyond second year, but you can follow the subtitles.  Very good picture quality.  Totally enjoyable.  Now one of my all-time favorites. Buy it!
