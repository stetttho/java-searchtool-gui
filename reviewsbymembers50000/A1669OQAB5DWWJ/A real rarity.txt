 I never thought I'd see this on a CD.  "Rising Sun" was a minor hit single in Southern California, and the flip side, "Strollin' Blues" was just as great.  Both were performed by the group on the TV show Hullabaloo.  The liner notes are worth the price of the CD alone.  Steve Stanley did a masterful job of documenting the group's history.  The CD sound, however, is a disappontment.  It is not stereo, as indicated on the label, but mono with some stereo ambiance added (the mono sound, however, is good).  It is a mystery why they used a mono master, because a true stereo master was available: I know this because I have a studio copy of the master tape. The bonus tracks were mastered from vinyl 45s, by the sound of them; "Strollin' Blues" even sounds like it was from a single that was a bit off-center.  Still, it's good to have these songs available again.
