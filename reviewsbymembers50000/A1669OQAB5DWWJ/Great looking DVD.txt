 Okay, you don't watch this for a magnificient plot nor review it like you would a epic blockbuster.  That said, someone at Columbia Pictures must really love this film because the digital transfer is gorgeous, except for the opening credits (which start a quarter hour into the movie) and closing credits: these scenes have a lot of "dirt" on the print.  Other than those, it is a flawless transfer.  You get anamorphic widescreen on one side and full screen on the other. Subtitles in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese(!), Korean(!), & Thai(!!),(evidently the film is big in the Far East).  The music score is beautiful and far beyond what you'd expect for this kind of movie. Yes, there is a cheesy model helicopter crash and the horse is painted like a zebra; however, a great looking DVD for a "guilty pleasure" movie. Check your brain at the door and enjoy it.
