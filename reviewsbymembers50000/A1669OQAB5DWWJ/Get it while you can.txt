 If you were linked here from KCRW (Santa Monica, CA) because you heard on the remixes played on that station, be warned that this import is out of print and the major on-line stores have it back-ordered. You may not get it for months, if ever, so in addition to ordering it from Amazon, do a Google search for ["Breath Me" Mylo Ulrich Schnauss] and you may find a few remaining copies in stores specializing in dance CDs.  Order it now!  The Mylo and Ulrich remixes are superb!  Track times: 1) 4:34; 2) 5:03; 3) 5:00; 4) 6:24; 5) 4:38.  This is CD #2 of a two CD set.  Good luck hunting.  7/04/05
