 I am totally enjoying the DVD releases of Farscape. The sound is outstanding (listen on headphones!) and the picture quality is nearly perfect. Only briefly are there any unmoving background shots which take on a static, unreal matte quality. Alyssa-Jane Cook is wonderful as the PK Tech Girl; wish they could have kept her in the series. Like others, I miss the audio commentary on the later discs. Still, these are fantastic releases. Buy them now!
