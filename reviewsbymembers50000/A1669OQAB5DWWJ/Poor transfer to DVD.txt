 Others have reviewed the show; this is to review the DVD itself.  The previous three seasons of Farscape on DVD have looked fantastic for the most part, but these discs suffer from severe compression artifacts.  I don't know what ADV has done differently, but unfortunately it really shows.  In some scenes the compression is so great that the entire frame "refreshes" only at half-second intervals, giving the whole picture a sort of stop-action appearance.  Look at Disc 2, "Lava's a Many Splendored Thing", at disc time 34:58-35:01.  The clouds in the background just jerk across the scene.  And at 36:15-36:20, where Scorpy and John are talking, the entire frame just jerks forward at those same half-second steps.  What puzzles me is that excerpts from these same shows in the Special Features (Behind the Scenes with Rebecca Riggs) appear with much greater clarity, color, and realism, and without compression artifacts.  What's going on here, ADV?  A disappointing set of discs.
