 I cannot fault any of the music or musicianship.  Everyone is superb and all have a great time sharing their music with the audience.  When the Geyers join in at the end of "The Clock Ticks On" it is truly goose-bump time.  My only nit-picking complaints have to do with the the production.  First, Ritchie is on the right side of the stage (audience perspective), Candice is center, the drummer behind her, and everyone else is cramped together on stage left.  That makes it really difficult to get good camera shots of the rest of the band.  We hardly see more than a few moments of the Sisters of the Moon, and Tudor Rose gets no close-up shots even during her amazing solos.  Gripe number two is the frequent switching from camera to camera with some scenes lasting barely a second, and again the Sisters get little screen time even during their solos at the front of the stage.  Gripe three are the compression artifacts which are most obvious during red-lit scenes and some pixelization during fast moving scenes.  The extras on disc one should have been put on disc 2 to give the concert more "room". Like a previous reviewer, I prefer the production quality of the DVD sampler that comes with the Romantic Collection.  These gripes aside, Castles & Dreams still gets five stars because it is just so enjoyable to hear and see.  Highly recommended.
