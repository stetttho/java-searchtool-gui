 You can really hear Tony's contributions to Genesis on this album.  Those gorgeous chord progressions, even in their simplist forms, are so reminiscent of his work with Genesis.  The instrumental songs are lush; the vocal songs are very good.  "Lucky Me" is such a beautifully composed song, and "For A While" sounds instantly familiar even if you've never heard it before - it's just one of those naturally appealing songs.  My only gripe is with the horribly dissonant fourth verse of the chorus in "Somebody Else's Dream": for me, that just ruined an otherwise powerful song with magnificient chords.  The CD sound is a bit veiled and soft, but a great album anyway.
