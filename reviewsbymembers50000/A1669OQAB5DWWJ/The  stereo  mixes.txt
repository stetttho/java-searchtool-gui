 I agree with the other reviewers: the stereo mixes aren't the best.  Usually I prefer stereo versions, but mono (if you can switch your amp to mono) sounds better, with more punch.  "You've Lost that Lovin' Feeling" and "Just Once in My Life" sound like they were mastered from vinyl because of the surface noise during the quiet passages in the left track -audible on headphones.  And I wish they had engineered out the bass pops when the Bros. sang words with "P" and "T": they obviously didn't use windscreens on the microphones.  Just listen to "White Cliffs of Dover" when Hatfield sings "..and Jimmy will go TO! sleep..." The word "TO" pops out of the speakers like someone kicking the wall. Beautiful songs in need of a good remastering.
