 This is such a beautifully made documentary about humans' interaction with Yosemite.  Dr. Carl Sharsmith's last scene is so very moving (he was my botany instructor at San Jose State University).  Unfortunately, the VHS quality is poor because it is duped at extended-play speed.  This documentary deserves DVD treatment. Robert Redford, are you listening? DVD!
