 This is a terrible book on an interesting subject. Anecdotes do not data make. This is terrible science, bad social science, and I'm unconvinced by her analysis. There are other theories about gossip, for example, cf Robin Dunbar books for one--gossip is good and helps to strengthen  important social networks. There are other theories about female-female competition besides that it is pathological bullying (which it obviously can't be since it is so common). While Simmons notices interesting things, she seems to have had some unfortunate blinkers on while considering what it is she has observed.  Simmons should look more widely at the role of status-seeking in primates as well as in human cultures to better understand what it is she is observing. Hrdy's wonderful Mother Nature would have given her a great model for integrating unique observations with science and anecdote. Fellow journalist Natalie Angier's wonderful books would have also given her additional perspectives. And Simmons would have done well to look at this subject of status-seeking in the context of behavioural economics and evolutionary psychology and anthropology, where there is already a great and wide ranging literature on status seeking and interpersonal aggression and sex differences. I get the feeling she stumbled on a cool idea and was smart enough to write this book, but she is remarkably uniformed. This is not original territory and while her perspective is catchy, framed as it were in everyone's most memorable stage of life, but ultimately it leads nowhere.  It's dull. Repetetive. Did I say repetitive? And repetitive.
