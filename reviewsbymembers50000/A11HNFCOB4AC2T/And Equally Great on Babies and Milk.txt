 This book is the ONLY book I have ever seen that explains EXACTLY how to sterilize bottles and what the consequences are if you do not. That section alone should make it MANDATORY reading. It  also offers an excellent discussion of breastfeeding that is more detailed and more informative than any of those idiotic what to expect books. It has excellent info on formula pros and cons that do not make it into other books. Very clear, sensible and useful even before your baby is ready to come home! And you will use it well into the elementary school years!
