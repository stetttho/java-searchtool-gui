 (see also Agnes Mouthwash) A great CD!! I second all the positive notes. Let me add this: Family Reunion is pure GENIUS. This is a hilaroius account of what it is like to be a small child surrounded by adults at Thanksgiving listening to Auntie This talk about goiter and Uncle That gossiping about who knows what (as well as cousins who might punch you when no one is looking).  I am also a huge fan of The Duck, The Tiger, The Shrimp...the animals on parade by gum they march in front they bang the drum--this is a great animal song and, yes, being pre-PC, it does include reference to drunkenness. These songs and stories are truly great--free of all the smarmy moralizing book-of-virtues type of garbage that makes kids music and literature so painfully stupid and dull. Instead, these are complex, intelligent, some are even dark (Little Claude is about mean, negligent parents who get what they deserve) and some are poignantly melancholy. I love these CDs and the creative music and effects that these comic geniuses created in their basements with primative recording tools.  EnJOY!!
