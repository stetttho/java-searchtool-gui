 This is pure genius, this one. Brilliant, rich, complicated kids' music that isn't stupid, for a change. Copp and Brown come from comedy backgorunds. They made these songs in a basement using primitive recording equipment, lots of neat stuff for instruments and sound effects and many memorable voices. Some are stories, some are song stories and some are just songs. They are pre-PC but still sweet. A few of my favorites: Mary McGurky McGinty Maguire is a wonderful song about a girl who is too busy playing to eat."My choo choo train has jumped the tracks, I'm in the middle of a game of jacks, I'm baking me a big mud pie, I won't come in til it is dry...I won't be long.." Sung in a falsetto with a music box accompaniment. Odd, funny, and very moving in its own way. Cloudy Afternoon--a marvelous tale of a boy who loses track of his nanny in the park and the adventures that ensue... 	 Some songs are dark, with a hint of doom around the corner, other songs are downright melancholy. They capture perfectly what it is to be a small person in a big complicated world. They are not "clever" particularly, but deeply moving and sweet and also funny. Copp and Brown should be part of every kid's experience. Also...DAVID OWEN, a marvelous writer, has written the liner notes. Enjoy.If you like, check out FlibbertyJibbets On Parade, too.
