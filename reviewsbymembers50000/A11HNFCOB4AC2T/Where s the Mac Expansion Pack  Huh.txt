 Zoo Tycoon 2 is a fine and beautiful game but Mac users are getting a BAD DEAL!! As of right now it appears we are not getting the Zoo 2 Expansion Pack that PC users are getting. When a company starts treating its most passionate users (and Mac people are VERY passionate about their machines) as second-class citizens, you're going to get some very [...] users. Macs are used more widely by kids than PCs. Do you not understand your customers? This game is a good one and Mac users already pay twice as much for it than PC users, so you are really testing our loyalties here.  The least you game makers could do is let us KNOW if you will ever give us an expansion pack. It's incredibly disrespectful of your customers to leave us hanging.
