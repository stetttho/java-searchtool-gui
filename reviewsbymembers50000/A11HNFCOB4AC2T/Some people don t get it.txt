 This worst thing about this book is the stupid title. It is not a diet. You can eat anything you want--protein, omega threes, cake, whatever. There are reviewers here who don't seem to get this--the title is at fault! It is not a diet. It is not a nutrition plan. It's ridiculous to talk about nutrition since that is not what this book is about. It's not a life-makeover plan. And it's not about exercise. So stop yer whining, people.  This book is about ONE thing: Appetite. It is a way to control your appetite. What you eat is up to you. That's all it is. Nothing more. If you eat like an idiot and avoid veggies or protein, then this book will not help you. But if you want to control your appetite, then you have come to the right place. I've tried it and effect is AMAZING.
