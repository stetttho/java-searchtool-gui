 This is easily one of the most idiotic books I have ever read. I read plenty of business, economics, and evolutionary science books and there are at least 50 better books on this topic. I am just astounded that someone published it. It completely trivializes the topic. It's painfully chatty. And it's a waste of time. The presentations involving attributing behaviours to genes completely misconstrue what genes actually do. This book, and I use that term extremely "litely," is also unbelievable patronizing. The authors assume their readers are as bone-headed as they are. A mildly intelligent ten-year old child could read this book in about 30 minutes and instantly see how bad it is--can you say "lite!"  If you are interested in this topic, and it is a wonderful fascinating topic, please read Robert Frank's Luxury Fever first. Then read some articles in the area of behavioural economics--anything is better than this.  And if you are really interested in genes, try Matt Ridley's wonderful The Agile Gene instead. At least these guys don't treat you like an idiot.
