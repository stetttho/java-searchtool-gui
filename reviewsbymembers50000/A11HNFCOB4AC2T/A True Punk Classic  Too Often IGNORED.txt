 Okay. I confess I love this album and saw NOTHING about it here on amazon. Protest the lack of info!   Every punk worth his or her safety pins should own this classic. It has a heartbreakingly lovely version of the young and  angry Elvis Costello singing Burt Bacharach--more honest and also a little  meaner than on his other more recent album. Lots of fun punk stuff: Ian  Drury and The Blockheads doing Sex and Drugs and Rock & Roll, and the  Austin Powers of Punk, Wreckless Eric with great big power pop songs. Nick Lowe, too. Much more. Great fun. Happy bouncy punk with a streak of  explosive noise and madness. Kind of a classic. A great party album.  Looking back (it's almost 20 years old) it seems sweet, insane, and  wonderfully optimistic about music in the post-disco era.  You cannot go  wrong. Rock on!
