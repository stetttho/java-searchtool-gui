 This is a very nice overpriced hand cream that  allows one to show off good taste and a European sensibility without being too pretentious. Shea butter creams seem to work very well for me, and I love the scent of lavender and the consistency of this cream. But it is a bit greasy and some people are sensitive to lavender. Still, it makes a nice gift, especially for someone you don't know well, but would like to have think positively about you.
