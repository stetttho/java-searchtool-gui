 I read this to my 5 year old for the first time at age 40--and I found it astounding. The 1st half of the book is full of charm, humour, cleverness--but then it becomes much more sophisticated. Stuart becomes a  seeker and while his adventures along the way are interesting and extremely  entertaining, they are also tinged with a sense of loss. Stuart has dreams  that cannot be fulfilled. His quest for perfection prevents him from  enjoing the present. He becomes prideful and, while funny, it keeps him  from certain wonders. The ending is incredibly beautiful but does not  resolve the plot and is quite sophisticated compared to many kids books.  ADVICE: As you read, look for the discrepancies between the desired and  dreamed for and the actual. This is what gives this slim and beautiful book  its pulse -- it's  also a great way to talk about the book with kids. Think  Don Quixote.  Skip the flick! This is much more valuable!
