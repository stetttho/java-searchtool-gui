 I have spent many afternoons exploring tidepools and mudflats, so I looked forward to reading this book. What a disappointment. Sure the descriptions of marine curiosities are pleasing but they cannot bear the weight of the author's efforts at symbolism. It is a book that is built on some of the more beautiful aspects of science but really wants to be a New Age magical realism kind of thing. It does not "go." The dissonance is way too irritating. Like combining Darwin with mysticism. It hurts to read. And by the way, I'm astounded that the author does not credit all that barnacle info at least indirectly to Darwin who still rules as the greatest barnacle expert and especially in the area of sexual selection in barnacles.  Which brings me to the book's other obsession.  The sex lives of 13 year old boys are already embarrassing. But come on! Would that the writer had put the same care into writing about this topic as he does about polykete worms. It's boring, cliche, and sexist to boot. Yuck. The occasional misogynistic threads are irritating enough to want to toss it. And I am a forgiving reader who makes a point of reading debut fiction and buying it even in hardback.  Way too many smudges of sky and repetitive imagery. The side characters are underdeveloped. The center does not hold.  Not recommended. If you like bio-fiction, read Andrea Barrett instead.
