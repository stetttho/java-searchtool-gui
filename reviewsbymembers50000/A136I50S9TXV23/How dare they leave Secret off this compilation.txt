 This CD follows the same formula as other best-of collections, in that it repackages most of an older greatest-hits album, and tacks on some later material at the end.  This is very typical of many 80's bands, like Duran Duran and Depeche Mode.  I like the Best of OMD collection, but of course it was released before Sugar Tax came out, which was the first OMD album I ever listened to.  Pandora's Box was one of my favorite new-wave songs, and I was eager to find a CD that married it with the the older hits.  Unfortunately, the record company played a cruel hoax on us.  They did this repackaging, but axed what was one of the most tuneful and best highlights from the Best of OMD, Secret!!!  How could they?  This song is a hallmark of what my Asian friends affectionately call "Vietnamese New Wave" (an in-joke).  It has a great, killer hook, and is very danceable.  Every time I heard it growing up, it really lifted my spirits.   In the age of free downloads and CD burners, the recording industry needs to learn a valuable lesson: don't cheat the fans, they are they only ones keeping you afloat!!!
