 It seems a little odd to see a remix album for Mary J. Blige, who isn't as attuned to dance music as other artists like Deborah Cox and Ultra Nate. However, she has a great following as an icon- maybe because of her potential to look flawless. Anyhow, seeing this CD in the music store was a pleasant surprise. Of the ten remixes here, five are good enough to justify purchasing this CD. First, there is Family Affair. A synth-guitar riff (which reminds me of the one in the single mix of Depeche Mode's In Your Room) is laid under a disco beat. Next, there is You are My Everything, which recalls Lisa Stansfield, in my mind. Then, there are "killer" remixes of He Think I Don't Know and Your Child, which are pure club anthems. Somehow, songs about cheating men always make great anthems- think of Whitney Houston's successes with It's Not Right, but It's Okay and I Learned from the Best. Finally, there is Give Me You, which is a much lighter melody, but just as nice. Unfortunately, there are also some really [poor] tracks here.  Rainy Dayz is just awful, with Ja Rule's ... singing, and a lackluster remix by Thunderpuss, who also remixed No More Drama here.  Both remixes are substandard; these guys are capable of better than this. Anyhow, given the lack of albums and compilations there are to be excited about right now, Dance With Me is my vote for the best thing to spend your hard-earned money on.
