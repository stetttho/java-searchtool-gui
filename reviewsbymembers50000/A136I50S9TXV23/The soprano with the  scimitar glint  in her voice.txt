 Pilar Lorengar may not be as famous as her Spanish Counterparts, Victoria De Los Angeles and Montserrat Caballe.  But, opera afficionados still treasure her.  The reasons why are elaborately laid out on this two-disc recital.  The first disc is dominated in the first half by Puccini arias.  Since these are famous arias, it would be easy to sing them in a conventially pretty manner.  Instead, Lorengar offers wonderful interpretations of such arias as Un Bel Di and a personal favorite, Senza Mamma.  She may not be able to belt it out like some of her peers, but she invokes a true sense of artistry.  The same can be said for her Mozart- just listen to the aching way she sings the first line of Dove Sono- "E Susanna non vien..."  Another standout is Come Scoglio, which she sings with great flair and drama.  My only gripe, which is why I gave this recital 4 stars instead of 5 is that, alas, there is nothing from one of her greatest roles, Donna Elvira. It is very baffling why the linear essay makes mention of how successful her Met debut as Donna Elvira was, but nary an aria made the cut for the first disc.  However, if you want to hear her interpretation of this great role, buy the highlight disc of Don Giovanni, which is readily available, for budget-price. The disc also features Sutherland and Horne. Two other favorites from this disc are the moon aria from Rusalka, as well as the duet from Arabella, which is heartbreakingly beautiful.  Thankfully, she is paired up with Arleen Auger, an accomplished artist in her own right.  The second disc of Zarzuela is wonderful as well. Especially wonderful are the Tonadillas.  Just Lorengar's lovely voice, and Alicia Dellarocha's piano.  Very relaxing to listen to... Sadly, Lorengar is no longer with us, but her artistry is her, for us to treasure.
