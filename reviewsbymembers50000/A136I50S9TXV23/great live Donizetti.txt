 Those familiar with the popular recital aria "O Luce di'Quest Anima" would enjoy this full-length live recording.  Margherita Rinaldi was not as adept at coloratura as Joan Sutherland, but she did have secure notes and a good technique.  The opera itself is more dramatic than you would think if you were only familiar with O Luce... However, there are moments of pure bel canto enjoyment, such as when Alfredo Kraus sings (and encores!)Se Tanto in Ira agli Uomini.  This is an example of superior tenor singing, the kind that has all but disappeared.  Kraus is on a par with the "Three Tenors", even though he is not known by the general public (which is a shame). Given that this opera is rarely staged (La Scala mounted it 6 years ago with Laura Claycomb), and wasn't recorded by the greats (such as Joan Sutherland), this live recording is an excellent choice.
