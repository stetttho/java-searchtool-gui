 Okay, that's way too harsh, but I can't stand it when Fleming is paraded as God's gift to opera, when vocally she is a shadow of her predecessors! This is a nice recital program, mercifully allowing us to (mostly) avoid the torture of what happens when she tackles arias that call for the nth amount of coloratura and/or high notes.  The first sign of trouble emerges in the Jewel song.  To be fair, she does tackle the French diction, something that coloratura sopranos tend to fumble.  However, her voice just isn't bright and nimble enough to master the aria.  And, when presented with an extended high note at full volume, she can only do it by bellowing!   Besides the inability to "play" with her voice, she sings with too much self-consciousness.  In The Last Rose, she reminds me of the superlative Leontyne Price, except Price was never this self-conscious when she sang! If you can put all that aside, there is something to enjoy here, basically a collection of heartwarming arias, lieder, and vocalises that (mostly) allow Fleming's voice to stay in the middle range, where she isn't allowed to bellow like Bessie the cow. P.S.-  I am so SICK of her always being given the title of The Beautiful Voice.  Callas was La Divina, Sutherland La Stupenda, and Caballe La Superba.  Each of those divas deserved their monikers.  But to describe Fleming as "THE" Beautiful Voice is at best deceptive and at worst a sad example of the state of opera today.
