 This is a prime example of the a major recording label being fickle with the goods, in order to force you to continue buying other recitals and full-length studio recordings.  Of course, any Caballe fan would already want to own those other recordings anyway, so the point is moot. Other reviewers here have cried out against the exclusion of one of her most essential and artistic roles, Imogene from Il Pirata.  I would like to emphatically express the same.  In fact, I would even have settled for the exclusion of Casta Diva, in favor of Col Sorriso di Innocenza.   Some other stellar recordings not represented her are the Sleepwalking Scene from MacBeth, and Pace, Pace Mio Dio from La Forza del Destino.  Also worth mentioning is her O Patria Mia from Aida.  She might not be Leontyne Price or Martina Arroyo, but she gives a superb reading of this wonderful aria. Of course, brevity does require some editing- a true "Ultimate" Caballe collection would span four or five CDs, at least- but to include late-career and less-than-best selections at the expense of others is a crime.  Perhaps the major Opera labels should start letting fans put together the track lists for these "best of" collections!  We could do a much better job.
