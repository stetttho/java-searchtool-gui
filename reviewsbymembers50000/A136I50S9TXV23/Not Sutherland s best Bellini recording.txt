 I have to disagree with every other reviewer here- I find this studio recording to be one of Sutherland's weakest.  True, this opera is not as glorious as Norma, I Puritani, or La Sonnambula.  However, when compared with Sutherland's other Bellini studio recordings, one must accept that this particular outing has more minuses than plusses.  A large part of the problem is the fact that, in 1966, she was in her droopy/spoony period, something that would not improve until later on. True, she does produce some lovely high notes, and the axiom of "Sutherland's less-than-best beats everyone else's" still applies. Unfortunately, one only has to listen to the bonus tracks at the end of the third CD, taken from her first recordings of Puritani, Sonnambula, and Norma, to understand that Sutherland was capable of much better. It's not just a question of her dramatic capability- it's a matter of not wanting to hear at her mushy, droopy worst. This being SUTHERLAND and not any other run-of-the-mill soprano, it probably is still worth it to own this studio recording.  However, if you want to hear Sutherland in top form as a Bellini heroine, try her first recording of Norma (with Marilyn Horne), either recording of I Puritani, or her first recording of La Sonnambula.
