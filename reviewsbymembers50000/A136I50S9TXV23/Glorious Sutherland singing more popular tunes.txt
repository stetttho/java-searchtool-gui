 Why hasn't anyone reviewed this wonderful recital by the great Joan Sutherland?  For those more familiar with her operatic reperetoire, you will be equally amazed by her technique in this series of waltzes and popular songs.  This CD gathers up recordings made at different times during her career;thus, the vocal quality isn't always the same (yes, there are instances of mushy, garbled diction).  If you have the recently released La Stupenda compilation, you will recognize some of the material here.  However, you haven't heard the very best.  Why they left out the Gipsy and the Bird and Mattinata is beyond me. They are true Sutherland treasures. This recital is likely to go out of the catalog before too long; I suggest you buy it to round out your Sutherland collection
