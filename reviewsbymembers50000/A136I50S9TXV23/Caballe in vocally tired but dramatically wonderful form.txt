 Given that this was recoded live in 1979, it is hard to believe how vocally strained Montserrat Caballe sounds. Her voice sounds somewhat opaque, slightly wobbly, and very strained, much like Sutherland's near the end of her career. However, one cannot deny the dramatic power she lends to Mina's big aria. Those familiar with Caballe's tendency towards a creamy, expressionless tone will be amazed at what she does here. If you happen to own the Rossini Donizetti Verdi Rarities recital, you can compare the recording of Mina's aria she did in the studio to the one on this full-length live recording. The difference in depth of interpretaton and penetrating power is huge. As for Eve Queler's conducting, let's just say that it passes muster, but isn't at all thrilling. Her conducting sounds very geometric and dry, lacking the verve and passion that makes Verdi's music come alive. Just listen to the overture, and you will get a sense of what I mean.  The only other comment I would like to add concerns Juan Pons. He reminds me much of Sherril Milnes, whom I really enjoy. His diction isn't always perfect, but he plays the role of Mina's father very well. Just listen to his duet with Caballe, in what sounds like the prototype for the famous "Bella Figlia dell'Amore" quartet from Rigoletto. (It is track 11 on the first CD). While this isn't a stellar Verdi experience, it has enough qualities to warrant a place in your collection.
