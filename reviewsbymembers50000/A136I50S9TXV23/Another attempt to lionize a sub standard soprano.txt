 Many of the other reviewers here point to Fleming's past successes.  I, for one, never gave her a chance, after previewing another of her recitals on disc a couple of years ago.  When there is such a wealth of recordings by truly excellent sopranos (Callas, Sutherland, Tebaldi, Price, Caballe, Freni, and Scotto, to name a few), why waste your time and money on Renee?  When she opens her mouth to sing, it's just "Renee" singing and parading herself.  There may be others more familiar with her output in the studio and onstage to prove me wrong, but I don't really hear her getting into her roles.  She's way too self-conscious of a singer.  And a hypocrite, to boot, since she says that her voice isn't suited to Italian opera. For an example of how truly dreadful this disc is, try "Ah Non Guinge, Uman Pensiero".  She murders the cabaletta by flattening virtually ALL of the coloratura.  Then, she tries to bring to the table a verismo singing style which is totally out of context.  Finally, she breathes WAY too much.  Execution of bel canto requires superb breath control, the kind Caballe and Sutherland were famous for.  All this breathing leads you to believe to she is in serious vocal decline, which is pretty sad, considering that Vogue magazine made it seem, in a profile on her, that she would not suffer Callas' fate.  (And even at that, Callas left us with a number of great recordings!) Even the accompaniment here is color-by-numbers and non-spirited.  This is a dog of a recording, period.  The public will snap it up, because of her name familiarity. They probably will skip over other sopranos' recordings to get to it, which may mean that this will be their only exposure to Sonnambula, Lucrezia Borgia, Semiramide, and Lucrezia Borgia.  I can't imagine a worse fate for Bellini, Donizetti, and Rossini.  They must be turning in their graves.
