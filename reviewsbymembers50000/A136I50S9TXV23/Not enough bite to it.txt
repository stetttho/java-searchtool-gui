 I think this album marks the delineation between the "old" Erasure and the "new" Erasure.  Starting with the Circus, and continuing through the Abba-esque E.P., Erasure really hit pay dirt, with hits like A Little Respect and Love to Hate You.  Their cover of ABBA's Take a Chance on Me was also a hit.   Then, I Say... came out.  Always, the first single, is a great song, with its elegaic tone and sound, a natural follow-up to the Chorus album.  Unfortunately, Erasure didn't inject enough of that sentiment into the whole of I Say, I Say, I Say.  Granted, this album is upbeat, cheery, and sunny.  But a couple of "darker" moments would have helped.  Think of the two preceding albums- Wild! had Brother and Sister, and 10,000 Miles, while Chorus had Love to Hate You, and Perfect Stranger.  There is too much froth in I Say...  Take Me Back is a wonderful tune, but other tracks like Miracle and Man on the Moon are too saccharine; I can't stand to listen to them anymore.  All Through the Years stands out as a more somber tune, but that distorted "reverb" backing vocal mars an otherwise great song.   Erasure is at their best when they blend catchy, dance-oriented pop melodies with more somber soundscapes.  I Say, I Say, I Say, indeed.
