 I first found out about Fangoria from some friends of mine who are from Mexico.  I first heard their prior album, Una Temporada en el Infierno, and then Naturaleza Muerta a couple of months ago.  Overall, I find this album to be quite good.  Most of the tracks are very strong, with poignant lyrics.  Alaska isn't the most naturally gifted singer, but she uses her voice quite effectively, by singing some phrases in a minor key.  Sometimes, the music itself can seem somewhat spartan beat-wise, but it grows on you.  The only two tracks that I don't really like are Eres una Bendicion (with that goofy sound that loops throughout the song) and Por Que Todo Ha De Ser De Color Rosa?, which is kind of stagnant when you compare it to the rest of the album.  It's as if Nacho and Alaska are afraid to put out an entire album that is strong (Una Temporada... also has some bad tracks on it as well). This album is strongly recommended to those who are sick of the banality of the current latin-pop scene, and who like electronic music.  If you like this CD, I strongly encourage that you buy Una Temporada en el Infierno as well.
