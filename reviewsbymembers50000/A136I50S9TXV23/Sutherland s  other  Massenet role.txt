 This rare Massenet opera will undoubtedly never be recorded again.  This was one of those roles that was the whim of Sutherland's husband, one that she resisted, but sang and recorded. In her memoirs, A Prima Donna's Progress, she confesses to have had some degree of trouble with the singing line.  In terms of singing, it doesn't compare to her better known and critically praised Esclarmonde.  The opera itself is not nearly as grand as Esclarmonde, either.  However, for true Sutherland fans, it is a rarity worth owning, if you ever find it.  The second act is particularly lovely. She sings a lovely duet with Tourangeau, that sounds vaguely similar to the flower duet from Lakme.  Then, Tourangeau sings a very seductive aria, one that Denyce Graves would be perfect for, if not for the fact that she doesn't sing in the upper register very well.  Tourangeau sings those top notes, and mesmerizes with her chesty tone. A Canadian critic wrote that this opera is like an overstuffed bird, made more palatable when it tastes of Joan Sutherland.  It isn't exactly the best opera she ever sang, but it is a role all her own.
