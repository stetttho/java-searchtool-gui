 After having read Sutherland's autobiography some time ago, I wasn't sure whether or not it was worth it to read Norma Major's book.  Thankfully, there are enough anecdotes to set it apart from Sutherland's own account of her stratospheric career.  Norma Major depicts, at the beginning, an awkward, ungainly Sutherland, in a manner that is almost embarrassing, but brutally honest.  She also draws more parallels between Sutherland's career and that of Maria Callas.  Sutherland only touched on the subject in her own book when she recalled being angry at a conductor who inferred that Callas was more disciplined at rehersal than she was (to which Sutherland retorted, "and look what happened to her!").  Major dwells on the topic a little more, giving her reader the idea of the karma that both of these great sopranos created for themselves. Norma Major also, towards the end of the book, painstakingly recounts the tensions between Richard and Joan, and the Australian Opera.  Although it's been some time since I've read Prima Donna's Progress, it seems that Joan Sutherland glossed over this subject. In short, Sutherland's legendary rise to fame and operatic glory is certainly worthy of at least two accounts.  Futhermore, as Sutherland was not a great "interpreter" of her roles, she also was not that great at analyzing her own career.  Major goes beyond a simple listing of the many Normas and Lucias sung.
