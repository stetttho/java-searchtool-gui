 "It's always darkest before the dawn." That statement sums this book up beautifully. Dark, menacing and filled with young adult angst, this fifth installment in the Harry Potter series is a heavy load to carry. All the characters are coming of age and are torn by their own loss of innocence with the confrontation of evil and the disillusionment of their governering authorities. As old mysteries are cleared up, new mysteries are brought to light and the reader can feel every ounce of confusion that the characters feel themselves. Although this book doesn't stand up above the other four books and may disappoint those who had hoped for more answers, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix paves the way for the final two books splendidly!
