 I saw this movie for the first time my first year of college. I'd always liked Animaniacs and I had to see this movie. It definately was a great tribute to the series. All the favorite characters are back (with the exception of Mr. Skullhead).  The basics of the plot are the Warner Brothers (and the Warner sister) are orphans who are in a race against their village and a greedy king to reach a fallen wishing star and make their wish. It has alot of comedy (a must for the Animaniacs) and even some heartstring tuggers!  I loved the music (wouldn't be a Warner Bros. Looney Tunes without Franz Liszts' "Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2")  It's a great movie, filled with humour both parents and kids can appreciate. I watched it last night with my friends and the humour we laughed at on the series was even funnier in our college days! A big two thumbs to the cast of such a wonderful series and movie (special Hi to Rob Paulsen from another transplanted Michigander!)
