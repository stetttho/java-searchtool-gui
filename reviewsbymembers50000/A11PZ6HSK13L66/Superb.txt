 Record for me...started at 9 pm EST on July 16 and was done by 3:30 am! HBP is definitely worth the wait! I liked how the book seemed less drama and adolescent angst driven, but it was still the seriousness of the situation that made me never able to put the book down. No sooner are millions of questions answered from the previous book, but suddenly new ones crop up to make us wonder. The characters are all growing and accepting what life is throwing at them. Harry, too, is changing and becoming more mature and grown up that anyone should ever have to be.  I wouldn't say this book is as joyful as in the past (book 5 being very heavy), but it, to me, has a lighter side that shows itself.  What will happen next? I'll say this much about book 6. I'd no sooner read the last word of the book and was ready to pick up book 7!
