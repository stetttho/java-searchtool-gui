 When I received my first ever DVD player, this was the DVD I bought. My parents loved Bill Murray and Dan Ackroyd from SNL, so they had to get it on tape one day. And I got to watch it with them. Love the music, the comedy and, on the DVD, all the special additions, especially the dialouge from the directors.  This is worth the purchase!
