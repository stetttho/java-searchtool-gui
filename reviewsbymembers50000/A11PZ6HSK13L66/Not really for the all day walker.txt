 I walk alot at work. Step counters I've had in the past have been flimsy and fall off way too easily. I got this for a Valentine's Day gift and it worked fine for awhile, but all of a sudden, it started to reset itself. It works great, it keeps track of my steps well, records my calories, etc., but it resets itself for no reason.  I'm starting to regret the money I spent on it and wished I'd just gotten a small, cheap step counter. The only reason I got this one was my boyfriend has it as well and his works great.  I've tried to contact the company that makes it, but never heard from them. My guess is that it's not meant to be worn for the whole day, just when exercising or jogging.  Avoid this one unless you only want to use it for exercising and not the entire day.
