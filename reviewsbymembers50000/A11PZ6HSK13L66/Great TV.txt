 I've owned this set for almost half a year and it's great! I lost my Sylvania 13 incher and have found this set to be better than expectations! I enjoy all the little added bonuses of the radio, the timers and the easy-to-access TV options. The one downside is that some of my movies require stereo sound, which this TV doesn't have, but with adjustments to my DVD player, I can hear everything okay (I may invest in speakers eventually) Anyway, I really recommend this TV to anyone!
