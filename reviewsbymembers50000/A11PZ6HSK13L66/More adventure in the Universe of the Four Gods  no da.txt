 Miaka's quest continues in her search for the remaining warriors, as does her desire to be reunited with Tamahome, who still is waiting in Kutou with Yui, now the Priestess of Seiryu. Yui also loves Tamahome and refuses to give him up so easily, a fact which Nakago, the general of the Kutou army, uses to his advantage.  Miaka faces challenges of bandits, zombies and spies at every turn, but her resolve to find all the warriors and return Tamahome to Konan does not shake. But when all seems successful, a new trial strikes at Miaka's very heart, one that she may not feel she can return from.  Vol 3 includes episodes #14-20.
