 Just picked up the 3rd season today. So far, I'm impressed. No songs have been changed or removed and I really enjoy the extra scenes that I never got to see on television.  This season has some of my favorites, the top one being Shock Theater. I really enjoyed Scott's performance in this episode because he really got a chance to express his versatility as an actor.   The scenes between him and Al are always touching and funny to watch.  I wish they could have done more with special features, like cast interviews or commentary, as they've done with other series, such as Hercules: The Legendary Journeys. But overall, the 3rd season of Quantum Leap is a must for your collection.
