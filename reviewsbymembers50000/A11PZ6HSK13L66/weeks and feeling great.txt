 I've had the equipment for about a month and I'm doing really well.   The workouts on the DVDs are kind of corny, but the actual exercises more than make up for it.  The product comes with the 6 Second Ab machine, 4 weights (2 15 lbs and 2 25 lbs), and 2 DVDs. One DVD has the 6 second ab workout and the Total Body Workout (I had to go busy a strength band extra for the TBW...but thank God for employee bonuses) The other DVD has the Fat Burning Cardio Workout, which is also great.  All in all, this would rate 5 stars, but I gave it 4 because I needed to buy the band extra. I would recommend this to anyone who's looking for an effective, less pain-in-the-back way to workout on the abs and just overall burn fat and get a good cardio workout.
