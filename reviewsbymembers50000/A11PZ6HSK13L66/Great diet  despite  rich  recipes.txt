 I gave this four stars because the recipes that are in the book aren't exactly in my budget, but I get good ideas from them and the food lists.   Anyway, I've been on this plan for almost 2 weeks. My doctor recommended it for me and it's been somewhat successful so far. The scale is always hard to read because I'm exercising and weight training now as well, but my clothes seem to fit a bit better.   At first, it seemed like all I wanted was what I couldn't have. The first 3 days, I would come home at night and feel myself craving popcorn, which is my comfort food. Instead, I'd snack on something I could have. Eventually, I found ways to distract myself from thinking about food and the cravings eventually backed off. I don't say they've gone away, but I can handle them better.   I'm approaching the next phase and I can't understand why everyone is so negative about this diet. Yes, it's a fad, yes, I'm sure that the fact Dr. Agaston isn't minding the money he's made, but this plan really does work. If you watch how you eat and when you start to add the carbs back in (ie, you don't have a sandwich everyday, etc.), then the weight loss will continue.   The book itself is easy for me to follow. Everything is fairly straightforward and concise. There is a definte sense of humanity behind the writing and you feel you can relate to the author and to the testimonies in the book.   Honestly, it's a great plan, but not for everybody. I always felt I would die if I had to give up popcorn, and I'll be glad to add it back again with phase 2, but I'm proud of myself and I thank Dr. Agaston for his work and I hope that I continue to improve my health and one day look and feel like I've always wanted.
