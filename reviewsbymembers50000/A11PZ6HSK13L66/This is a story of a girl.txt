 Miaka Yuki is a normal teenager in Japan studying for her high school exams. Little more is in her life other than her two loves: her best friend Yui and food. One day after school, Miaka accompanies Yui to the National Library. In the library, Miaka encounters a vision of a flaming red bird that leads her to a book called the Universe of the Four Gods.  As the girls begin to read, they are pulled into the pages into the world of the book. They are met by Tamahome, a young man with incredible skills as a warrior. But Yui is pulled away from the book and returns to the real world, leaving Miaka alone.   Miaka suspects Tamahome of kidnapping, so she follows him to the city capital of Konan. There, Miaka is chosen to be the Priestess of Suzaku and learns that she will be given the power to make wishes. Miaka's one true wish is to return home and pass her entrance exams, but finds that she has fallen in love.
