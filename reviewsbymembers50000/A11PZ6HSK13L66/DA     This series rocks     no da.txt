 Hey, I love this series. Even though I am currently getting the dubbed version(*hissing* from die-hard otakus), I have seen the subtitled version. I may get it one day, but for now, I'm happy. This series has everything; action, drama, romance, comedy, friendship, killer music and dialouge and some of the sexiest guys you could dream of. (Yes, I KNOW they're cartoons) I just want to say that...CHICHIRI RULES no da!! I have nothing against the others either. Tasuki and Tamahome are tied for second, Hotohori and Mitskauke for third, Nuriko and Chiriko for fourth(only because I don't have the WHOLE series yet, these guys may still shift) Anyway, I seriously recommend this series to everyone out there. I'll let you decide on which type. To my fellow otaku, arigatou and sayonara, no da!
