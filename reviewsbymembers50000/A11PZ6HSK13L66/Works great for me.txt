 Hey, I read the reviews and was hesitant, but I trust my sister more than strangers. I just bought this product, used it last night and I feel great!   The workouts on the DVDs are kinda corny, but the actual exercises more than make up for it.   The product comes with the Ab cruncher, 4 weights (2 15 lbs and 2 25 lbs), and 2 DVDs. One DVD has the 6 Second Ab workout and the Total Body Workout. (I had to go buy a strength band extra...but thank God for employee bonuses!) The other DVD has the Fat Burning Cardio Workout, which is also great!  All in all, I'd have given this 5 stars, but I gave it 4 because I needed to buy the band extra. I would recommend this to anyone who's looking for an effective, less-pain-in-the-back way to work out on the abs.
