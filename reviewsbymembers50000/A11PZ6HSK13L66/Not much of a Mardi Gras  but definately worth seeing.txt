 I was skeptical of this movie at first. I was used to seeing Robert Davi as Bailey Malone from Profiler and was most familiar with his portrayal of villians, but I was impressed. The movie pits Robert Davi as a homicide detective up against the Devil. Most people didn't like the ending, but I think it was very ironic and, from a theological perspective, quite accurate.
