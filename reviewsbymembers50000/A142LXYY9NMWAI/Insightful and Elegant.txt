 I've read many books on close-up and macro photography. This one is different from the others, and perhaps the best of the lot. The stunning features of Davies' book is the author's compositional skill (the photos are fabulous), and his ability to relate the technical aspects of macro and close-up photography to the reader.  Among his artfull techniques is his extensive use of wide-angle lenses for close-ups.  How many other works on the subject explore this possibility? This alone justified purchasing the book for me, since I now make frequent use of the technique.    Though he doesn't mention it in the text, notice how often he under-exposes slide film by about one stop in many of his images. This is one other useful technique I picked up from the book.  I really reccomend this one.
