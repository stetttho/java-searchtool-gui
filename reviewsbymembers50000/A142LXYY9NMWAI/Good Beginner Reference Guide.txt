 This book serves as a good reference guide to the N-80, though I'm not sure if it's necessarily better than Nikon's camera manual. I think the book is at its best when used by beginner photographers, since much of the book covers the use of the camera and its features in practical photographic applications. It also goes into lens and flash selection, and the use of other available accessories. My first Magic Lantern book was their guide to the N-60. At that time, and as a novice photographer, I greatly benefited from the book. The N-80 book was less valuable to me, mostly because I was farther down the learning curve by the time I read it.  So, it's a great source for beginners, and it's value diminishes thereafter.
