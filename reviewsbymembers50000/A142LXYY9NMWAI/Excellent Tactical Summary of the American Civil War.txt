 Mr. Griffith extends several of the tactical themes he has developed in other works to this analysis of the American Civil War. While some of his conclusions are highly debatable, his analytical skill is best applied to  his tactical insights regarding such things as shock verses skirmish  warfare, and the temporal verses spacial effects of rifled weaponry. His  arguments on these points are highly original and supported by fact. His  conclusio that the Civil War was fought much like the wars of the  Napoleonic period is somewhat suspect. The observation may be correct in  terms of casualty rates, but ignores such things as the development of  Union military logistics as practiced by Grant, and Sherman's devastatingly  effective methods for bringing the war home to the southern populace.  Niether of these strategic innovations have precidence in the Napoleonic  venue (to my knowledge). Comparisons to the Napoleonic period are more to  the mark with respect to southern tactics, which were effective due to  aggressive application, but were otherwise not unusual or innovative from a  europian perspective. These issues, and ruffled feathers aside, Mr.  Griffith's book remains an excellent and thought provoking analysis on the  tactical aspects of the Civil War, and is best viewed within the more  general view of the trends and verities of military tactics over time (Much  as presented in his other book: "Forward Into Battle").
