 The author has written a good beginning reference guide for the small farmer. Just be aware that by small, he means very small scale. So, if the reader is contemplating part-time farming on 80 or 160 acres, this is a really great book. If the reader is involved in larger-scale operations, the excellent niche advice in this book won't likely do the trick. This isn't really a fault of the book, one just needs to know for whom it's written. The best advice in the book is that small farmers should have a business plan that will allow a farm to be financially viable. Forget stockmarket-like returns, farming is a tough business. Stand alone cash flows from land investment rarely are greater than maybe three-to-five percent at best. Most successful operations leverage equipment investment by tenant farming or land leasing in order to make a decent return. Passive land investment is even less lucractive. And, smaller owner/operators and part-timers have it harder still. The author offers a few excellent ideas that may help the really small farmer make a go of it.  This exercise in making a business plan is a very practical reality check, that will make aspirant farmers go into the business with their eyes open. --Jeff
