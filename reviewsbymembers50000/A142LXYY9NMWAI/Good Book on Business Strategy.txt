 This book is really a lesson in strategy. Many businesses view strategy as a static thing. They're doing something, it works, stick with it. In fact, a strategy works only as long as the ever changing environment favors it. Thereafter, it goes into decay.  The authors present a solid lesson in the need to a develop fluid adaptive strategy that can change as the business environment evolves. The book further goes on to explain how strategic advantages can be implemented. Strategic planners and marketeers would be especially interested in the thoughts presented here.
