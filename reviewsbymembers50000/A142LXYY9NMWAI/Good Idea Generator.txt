 I've read some of Lee Frost's other books, and really have enjoyed them. This book is probably best suited to the casual photographer who's wants to try a few things, but doesn't want to seriously pursue technique. At least, that's my best guess, judging from the format and subject coverage. I can't say it's my favorite photography book. Other options would be Frost's excellent book on low light photography, or the National Geographic Field Guide series.
