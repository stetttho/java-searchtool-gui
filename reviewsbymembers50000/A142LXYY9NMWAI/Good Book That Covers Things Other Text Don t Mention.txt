 This is one of the better texts on conservative options strategies.  It's the only book I've read that discusses the time and record keeping requirements needed to implement options strategies. This is particularly relevent to those interested in covered call writing.  Some specific recommendations in the text have been made obsolete since the emergence of online ($8 commission) trading.  This has greatly increased the profit potential of shorter term positions in covered call writing. In past times, longer holding periods, and rolling of options was needed to overcome the effects of high commission prices.  Now, shorter holding periods, even on in the money positions, usually yields higher profitability; contrary to the advice in the book.  This is still a very good text, and well worth reading.
