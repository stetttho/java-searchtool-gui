 This is an excellent source book for intermediate photographers who wish to better understand the principles of exposure, filters, composition and, of course, low-light photography. I don't know how other reviewers can claim that the book lacks detail. Frost covers a lot of ground, offers techniques for shooting many different subjects and situations, and does so in an entertaining manner. I'd place this above a beginner level text, but since it does cover a great amount of subject matter, it isn't as specialized as some other books. So, again, it's a good intermediate level text. In short, it's well written, entertaining, covers a good broad spectrum of low light issues, and the pictures are darn good as well!
