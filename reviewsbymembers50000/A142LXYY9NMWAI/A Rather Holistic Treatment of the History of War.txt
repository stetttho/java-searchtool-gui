 In general, the history of war as usually presented focuses on political causes and the documentation of actual battles and wars. Occationally, insightful analysts will lend to this a discussion of technology and its effect on strategy and tactics (Trevor Depuy and Paddy Griffith particularly come to mind).  John Keegan's excellent text takes a step back, asking the question of "Why war". He weaves an argument that includes the anthropological, social, and psychological impetus towards human aggression. His conclusion seems to be that war is a ritualistic activity defined by the varying social requirements of a given society. Perhaps so. Limitations on the use of crossbows, gunpowder and nuclear weaponry, and the definition of "total war", "limited war", "peacekeeping missions" and "policing actions" are indeed all forms of social limitations. Whether these limitations extend to the level of ritual may be stretching the analysis a bit. Even so, Mr. Keegan's insights are highly original and thought provoking. His book is a major philosophical accomplishment.
