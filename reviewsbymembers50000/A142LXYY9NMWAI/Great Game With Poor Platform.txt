 I truly enjoy playing this game. The simulation allows players to participate in historically accurate scenarios from the Normandy invasion. Very playable, historically accurate, and lots of fun. The game falls down on the quality of its programming. It can be rather slow paced (a typical scenario runs about 90-minutes), and the program tends to experience fatal programming conflicts that cause the game to crash --very, very frusterating. For the price it was great, but left me wanting more. --Jeff
