 I've used two HP calculators over the last 23 years; the 19BII and 12C. The 17BII+ is functionally similar to the 19BII, but much more compact, with better keys and build quality. It doesn't have unit conversions, which were quite useful on the 19B. Also, the 19BII had a very handy four line display that is missing from the 17B.  Some users lament the build quality of the 17B, and believe that it is not up to the standards of the older 12C.  I understand the complaint, but believe that the plastic 17B is actually more durable than the 12C, and the design and functionality is far superior.  Overall, I like this calculator alot.
