 Like the Gies' other works, this book gives a view of the day-to-day life of people in the middle ages for the non-technical reader. In this case, the book's about what it was like to live in a medieval castle. As with their other books, some serious historians will find the book to vague, while many casual readers may find the book to provide too much seemingly trivial detail. For me, it was a great light read, full of fun information. It's also a pretty honest little book. No high prose or deep philosophy here --just the facts. So you want to know what it was like to live in a castle, here are the down and dirty facts. Think of it as Castles 101. Great job! For those interested in a deeper treatment of medieval life, Barbara Tushman's "Through a Distance Mirror" is a really great book.
