 Martin succeeds in peeling back the veil of the preternatural, allowing the reader a terrifying look at its darker side. His explanation of possession and exorcism is lucid and understandable, though not technically  complete. The case studies graphically describe the subtle process of  possession, and put it in its proper place as a very rare, very real and  unusually overt form of evil influence. The book probably should be  considered a classic text on the subject. It would  be interesting if  Martin would write a follow-up text describing the technical aspects of  human-preternatural interaction and its application to our spiritual  existance. This would  more clearly explain the reasons why possession can  and does happen, and why it manifests itself in the way it does. For  further insight into this subject, the writings of Felicitas Goodman are  quite good, credible, and less dramatic. They also lend differing cultural  perspectives to the subject. Her books "How about Demons" and  "The exorcism of Anneliese Michel" are particularly  recommended. One final point to consider is that this is a subject of  truly dangerous potential. Those who dabble in ouija boards, seances, and  the like do so at great risk. The spiritual (mystical) journey is best  realized by experiencing and devoting oneself to god first, and exploring  the preternatural within that context.
