 I expected more from this book. It is basically a non-technical review of composition for the beginner. The photos are really great, but they don't list the usual information used to get them (lens type, settings, filters, etc.). I really didn't gain any insight from this book, and doubt that anyone other than a beginning photographer would either. For landscape photography, and for photography in general, their basic photography guide is much better.
