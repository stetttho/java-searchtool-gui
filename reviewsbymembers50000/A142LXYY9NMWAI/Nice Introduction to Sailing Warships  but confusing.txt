 I needed a primer on warships in the age of sail, and needed it on short notice. This was available, so I bought it. All in all it wasn't too bad. The book covered a wide range of subjects, and I walked away with the feeling that I had acquired a good base of information. In this the book excels. Still, for me the heavy use of period naval jargon hindered my understanding of the subject matter, and the illustrations weren't the best. As other readers have noted, there were a number of technical inaccuracies, many of which could have been caught through better proof-reading. Still, all in all I liked the book, and will keep it around for future reference. --Jeff
