 Over the years Griffith has established himself as a contraversial and insightful military theorist. His insight into the fundimental tactical principles of warfare, and thier application and mis-application under  differing combat venues is an interesting read. He continues his discussion  from his other books on the merits of shock verses skirmish tactics, and  the effectiveness of stand-off assault verses direct engagement. While his  opinions may be viewed as somewhat eurocentric, much of the history of the  western method of war is europian based, and this historical perspective is  necessary in order to understand the invariate human reaction to combat  tactics.  His findings in this book are less contraversial than those of  "Civil War Battle Tactics", but both books display brilliant  insight and are well worth reading.
