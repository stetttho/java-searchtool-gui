 While the N-60 is now out of production, most people starting out in SLR photography will likely buy its kissing cousin, the N-65. The two cameras are similar, and since Magic Lantern hasn't written a book on the N-65, this is the most useful reference for the N-65 currently available. The book gives clear explanation of the functions of the N-60, and how to make use of them. Better yet, the reader gets a good general description of photography technique, lens selection, and accessory equipment. This is well worth reading, probably moreso for a beginner than an experienced photographer.
