 I bought this book because I wanted to learn more about cutter and brig anti-privateering and sea-land battle tactics. Cochrane was a true master at both of these things, and this book did provide some useful insights. The author seems on a mission to put Cochrane on a pedestal. He spends too much time sniping at Cochrane's enemies, and whitewashing his misconduct. This makes an otherwise interesting story difficult to read at times. A much more indepth treatment of how Cochrane achieved his many victories without the political commentary would have been more interesting to me.
