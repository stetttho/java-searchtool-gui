 The title of Mr. Cantor's book: "In The Wake Of The Plague" seems a bit of a misnomer. More to the point is the book's sub-title: "the black death and the world it made". Here's the rub with this book. Those who expect a detailed account of the black death may be a bit disappointed, since the book spends a minimum amount of text discussing the origins, spread, biology, and mortality of the disease; at least, based on the title. Where this book shines --really shines-- is in Mr. Cantor's vivid explanation of the manner in which key aspects of medieval society were affected by the plague. This book is a rich, sensitive and insightful discussion of the social effects of the plague on medieval: clerics, philosophers, kings, gentry and peasantry. From these diverse perspectives the author adroitly weaves a picture of a society in flux, of class struggle, and of a new emerging world view. I wasn't expecting this, but was delighted with what I found. So much so that I'm ordering his other books. This book is especially suited to the general reader on the middle ages, someone who is already familiar with the history of the plague. Truly an excellent work!
