 Norman Cantor's book is an overview of medieval social issues for the serious student of history. The text is well suited to the intermediate level history scholar who needs to gain a broad perspective, prior to conducting more detailed analysis. The book is long, longer than it need be. At times Mr. Cantor strays from his subject matter with verbose asides. The text can also be rather dry in places. With this said, Mr. Cantor's work more than offsets these weaknesses of style by providing broad content and many excellent insights.
