 The Gies have made a career out of filling a niche in the medieval history market. Life in a Medieval Village gives a very detailed view of everyday medieval life to the casual reader. As a result, they walk a fine line. Some casual readers may find the text to be dry, and to lend too much detail to seemingly trivial matters, while specialist historians may find the work too general and superficial (not scholarly). I find their work to be engaging, and to provide a fairly good picture of the subject matter.  In terms of medieval studies, it's useful to provide a general knowledge base prior to more detailed analysis.  I recommend this book as well as their other works.
