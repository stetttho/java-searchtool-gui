 Being a big science fiction film fan, I just had to see this version of War of the Worlds. I read the original book by H.G. Wells some years ago and the premise of this movie being faithful to the book was promising enough for me to buy this DVD.   The movie is a disappointment but had its moments in a somewhat goofy way.  Good Points:  1. The story is fairly close to the book, more so than the 1953 George Pal movie which is one of my all time favorites.  2. I liked the music.  3. The martians and their vehicles looked very good and darn close to the descriptions written in the book.   4. I laughed at one of the scenes where a person gets squashed by the machine.  Bad Points:  1. The movie was too long. I echo the sentiment of the observations of people just walking around from place to place.   2. While the music was good, it was used quite overwhelmingly throughout the picture.  3. The CGI for anything other than the martian vehicles were bad, bad, bad. Particularly the naval battle scenes off the coast of England. Those warships looked like first generation color games that I played on my Macintosh IIsi in 1992.  4. If anyone is going to show this film on TV, it will probably be PBS or some arts cable channel.  These are my main observations after viewing this film last night. Buyer beware.
