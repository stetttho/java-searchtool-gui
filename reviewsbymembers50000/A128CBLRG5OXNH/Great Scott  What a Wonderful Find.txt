 I never heard of Linda Scott until 2001. Her music was a regular feature on an oldies specialty radio show here in Hawaii. I thought it was charming in an innocent "girl group" type of way, but was never hooked enough to it until I won this CD from the same radio station in an on-air contest. I was very impressed with the music on this CD as it sounded like a cross of a gentler Brenda Lee and Lesley Gore combined with a hint of Lennon Sisters thrown in. What most impressed me was the absolutely clean sound reproduction in this release from Eric Records. The 40+ year transfer from tape to CD is just magnificent!     As another reviewer noted, it is too bad that she is not very well known and her music not widely played. I think she can gain some new fans if her music is used someday in a movie or something. I can almost picture using the track "Who's Been Sleeping in My Bed" as an intro to a slasher type of movie.   I am sure it would click with a younger audience after they wonder who recorded this.    Best tracks: "I've Told Every Little Star", "Bermuda", "Never in a Million Year" and the cover of the Elegants' hit "Little Star" which I think is way better than the original.
