 I probably can't say anything new about this album that has so much already written about it. However I'd venture to say that of all The Beatles albums ever released, this 2 disc set has the most variety of musical styles from the romantic pop of "I Will" to catchy sing-a-longs like "Ob La Di, Ob La Da" and "Honey Pie" to the earth shattering, guitar rockin' "Helter Skelter." with Paul on the lead vocals. You'd almost think this would have been a John Lennon song!  All of the tracks on this album are outstanding including "While My Guitar Gently Weeps," "Birthday," "Back in the U.S.S.R." and the really laid-back version of "Revolution" which I have come to like more than the one featured on the hit single.
