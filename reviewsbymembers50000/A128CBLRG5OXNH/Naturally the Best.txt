 Of all the albums Three Dog Night released, "Naturally" stands out as their best recording. The Jesse Colin-Young penned "Sunlight" sung most eloquently by Chuck Negron was a real standout track, which caught on big time here in Hawaii. The entire second side (on LP) which starts with this track are all winning tunes. "Heavy Church" and "Liar" stand out as a couple of the best rock songs issued by the group, and of course "Joy to the World" is one of Three Dog Night's all time classics. Add the original first side with great tracks like "I Can Hear You Calling" and "One Man Band" to it, and you certainly have a solid, all around great album. This one is a natural to get!
