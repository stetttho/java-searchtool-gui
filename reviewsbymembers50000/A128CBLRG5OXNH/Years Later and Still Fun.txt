 I seen "That Thing You Do" in 1996 and didn't watch it again until I bought the video earlier this year. A few weeks ago I bought the soundtrack. I love it! I echo the sentiments of most reviewers... the soundtrack faithfully captures the fun, emotion and innocence of mid 60s pop music.... The fictitious WONDERS would have been right up there competing with The Beatles had they been a real group in 1964. All the tracks are great, with my favorites being the title tune, "Little Wild One," "All My Only Dreams" and the Diane Dane song, "My World is Over." Get this CD and the movie too!
