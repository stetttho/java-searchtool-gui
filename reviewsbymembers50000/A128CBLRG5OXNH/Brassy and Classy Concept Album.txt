 There's probably not much new to say about this album except that I love it and know this is a 5-star release. I first heard most of the tracks from Sgt. Pepper on a 4-track machine called "The Hipster" which played a propreitory tape format called "Playtape". It was like a small version of 8 track tape and held only about 20 minutes worth of music. That said the 4 songs from Sgt. Pepper that was featured on this tape were the title track and segue into "With a Little Help From My Friends", "Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds" and I think "Being For the Benefit of Mr, Kite." I was a mere 10 year old when this was first out, but I was already hooked to The Beatles.    I got to listen to the other tracks later in life and eventually bought the album on vinyl. Over the years it has grown to be one of my all time favorite Beatles album. This is a real brassy and classy concept album, a must have for every music collection.
