 Anyone who grew up listening to local top 40 radio in Hawaii will remember "Stuck in Paradise" and "Stella's Candy Store", the latter a great rocker which became a local top 10 hit. It is great that this album has finally seen the light of day on CD. The other tracks are pretty good too... especially "I Got That Feeling" and the remake of "Changes." Now if only some label would issue their first album which contained the single "Remember Mary."
