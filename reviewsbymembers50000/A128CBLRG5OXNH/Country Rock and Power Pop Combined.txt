 I won this album from a radio station in 1972. The only track American audiences may recognize is "Devil You", which was a minor top 40 hit after the huge success of "Sweet City Woman."  Don't let that fact stop you from buying this album.  If you like jangly country rock, this is a good album to get. It's got everything from the power pop flavored "Stone Blind" to an REM-like "The Difference it Makes." Good guitars on both songs. The best however is the hard rockin "Wild Eyes" which I understand was a big Canadian hit. Why this record missed the American airwaves is beyond me.
