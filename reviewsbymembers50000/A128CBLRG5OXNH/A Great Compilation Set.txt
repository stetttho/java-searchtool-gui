 If you are a Three Dog Night fan or just getting yourself familiar with the group, this is a great album to get. Even if you own all the regularly issued Three Dog Night albums, this one has a lot of single tracks that were hits and are indeed the single mixes. Many of Three Dog Night's single tracks were slightly different mixes from the song versions that appeared on albums. For example, the mixes to "Black and White" and "Joy to the World" are different. The 45 mixes are better as presented here.  Purhcasers of this set will also get a sampling of several album tracks such as "You," "Cowboy" and "Midnight Runaway". Also appearing are "Going in Circles", the B-side to "Family of Man" and the funky "Our B-side" which was a B-side to the single "Shambala" I believe. All great music.  The CD set is superbly packaged with very good liner notes and track information.  About the only thing that I can find fault with this collection are the songs that they left off... namely "Sunlight" from the "Naturally" album and "Rock n Roll Widow" from the still-out-of-print album, "It Ain't Easy." Otherwise this is a great compilation.
