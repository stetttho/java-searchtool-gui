 It was so refreshing to hear these long lost tracks on CD. My first  introduction to Middle of the Road came in 1971 when their hit,  "Chirpy Chirpy Cheep Cheep" became a number 1 record on a couple  of radio stations here in Hawaii. Always liked that song and have 2 45s of  it... now on CD, the song is better than ever. Several outstanding tracks  on the CD are pulled from Middle of the Road's "Acceleration" LP,  which I found in a used record store several years ago. Among the standout  tracks getting the digital treatment here are "Sacremento,"  "Samson & Delilah," "Queen Bee," the majestic  "On This Land" (it sounds really great on CD) and "Soley  Soley," which was the group's only other hit in Hawaii. In addition  to the tracks I already knew and loved, this CD introduced me to songs like  "Kailakee Kailakoo" and "Everybody Loves a Winner".....  I also loved their cover version of Christie's "Yellow  River." Overall this is a good compilation and serves as a good  introduction to a group that should have and could have been great here in  the United States.
