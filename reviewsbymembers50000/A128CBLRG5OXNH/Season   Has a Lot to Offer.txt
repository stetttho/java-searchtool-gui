 Don't believe any of the negative reviews written about the 4th season of Babylon 5. I think this is the 2nd greatest season of the series. Lots of plot twists, action and resolution to many of the series' storylines. Earth vs. Babylon 5, Vorlons vs. the Shadows, the fate of Mr. Mordon, the ascendence of Sheridan and Delenn, and the departures of some very endearing characters. Babylon 5, Season 4 has it all.
