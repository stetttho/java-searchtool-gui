 I bought this CD in 1991 and still play many tracks from it, especially "Valerie Loves Me", "Diane" and "Very First Lie." Of all the songs I used to listen to in the early 90s, "Valerie" still holds as one of my all time favorites as I used to know someone by that name many, many, many years ago.  It is too bad that the rest of Material Issue's Mercury catalog has gone out of print because Jim Ellison and his band had the ability to write and record in a fairly wide variety of musical styles.  If you ever find a copy of "Destination Universe" buy it because it has some of the best power pop ballads that I ever heard in the 1990s. Mercury should reissue this as well as "Freak City Soundtrack" and put out a greatest hits compilation that feature the cover tracks "Bus Stop", "Bad Time," "Cowboy Song" and "Blockbuster" that have long been out of print.
