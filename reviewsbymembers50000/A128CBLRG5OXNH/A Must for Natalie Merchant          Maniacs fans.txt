 This is a good compilation of nearly all the major videos 10,000 Maniacs released with Natalie Merchant... and then some. I was delighted to see video clip representations of songs that I knew, but never knew existed on video.... "Wildwood Flower" is such a gem. It is great to see a video for that song. I like the little cow on the dashboard. You gotta see the video.  As I mentioned the major video hits are here including the wonderful signature song "Like the Weather" and the Maniacs' "Unplugged" hit version of "Because the Night," truly Natalie's great swan song as she departed the group shortly after.   About the only thing I am disappointed with is that I know there is a video for "Peace Train" that I used to like to watch on the old TBS video show "Night Tracks." As I vaguely recalled it featured Natalie and the group floating on some raft in the middle of a river. Too bad this will be a lost gem forever it seems.  For that reason I can only give this collection 4 stars.
