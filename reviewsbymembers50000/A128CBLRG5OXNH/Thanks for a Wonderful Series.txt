 Anyone who is a fan of Babylon 5 will or has already bought this 5th and final DVD set. This was the year that almost was not. Thanks to TNT, Warner Bros. gave JMS the go-ahead to complete this wonderful story. The 5th season set of Babylon 5 wraps most of the major plotlines that all B5 fans have watched unfold through the entire series. The last few episodes from "The Fall of Centauri Prime" right on up to "Sleeping in Light" are all stellar pieces of good story telling. The sense of family and a bond between all of the major characters can be felt as each go their separate ways only to be reunited some years later in the touching finale. Thanks J.MichaelStraczynski for giving us such a wonderful TV series. I don't think I'll ever see anything like this in my lifetime again. Just wonderful.
