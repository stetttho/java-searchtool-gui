 I like this album so much that I own 3 copies on LP, a copy on 8-track, a few copies on cassette, and 2 different releases on CD. This is Elton John's all time stellar masterpiece, the zenith of his and Bernie's musical career.     Here you got a great collection of straight on rock (Funeral For a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding, Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting) to great ballads like "Candle in the Wind," "Harmony," and the title track, "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road." "Bennie and the Jets" is pure pop genius, an unforgettable piece with a funky little beat and a very memorable hook.    What made this album special besides the great music within was the original album packaging and graphics, complete with a sketch or logo that went along with the lyrics to every song and credits for every musician playing on this tightly produced opus. Elton and his band were in stellar form here.    "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road" is an album not to be missed!
