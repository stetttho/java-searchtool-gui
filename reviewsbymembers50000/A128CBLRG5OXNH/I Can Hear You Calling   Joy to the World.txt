 What more is to say about this wonderfully happy song? It was a #1 Billboard Hot 100 hit for more than a month in 1971. The B-side is a killer rock n roll track called "I Can Hear You Calling," which is also featurd on this CD single. Purchasing this single is a good but abbreviated starting point for beginners to be introduced to this wonderful musical group of the 1970s. If you can, get the album on which "Joy to the World" appears: "Naturally".
