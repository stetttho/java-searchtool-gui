 Cecilio & Kapono's incredible debut album positioned the venerable duo as a force to reckon with when this came out in 1974. Almost immediately, nearly all the tracks became local top 40 radio favorites. The original lead single was "Gotta Get Away" backed with "Song For Someone." Both tracks got heavy airplay among top 40 hits of the day like "Band on the Run" and "The Joker." We're talking 1974 here. Additionally, "All in Love is Fair," "Sunflower" and "Friends" became faves too.
