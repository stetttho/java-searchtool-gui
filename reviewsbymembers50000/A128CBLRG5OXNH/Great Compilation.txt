 The main reason why I bought this CD was to get a clean copy of "Where Evil Grows." This is a superb song that should have been a bigger hit when released in 1971. Susan's voice is marvelous and the production is very good, despite other reviewers claims to being overproduced. Other favorites on this album include "Evil Overshadows Joe", "That's Where I Went Wrong" (both mixes), "Beyond the Clouds" and the perennial fave, "Which Way You're Going Billy?" Now if only somone would issue Susan's "All The Tea in China" on CD!
