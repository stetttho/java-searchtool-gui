 OK. Everyone knows Walter Egan for his hit "Magnet & Steel." Indeed it is a great song. You'll be treated to some great pop-rock stuff here. Besides the hit, tracks that should have been hits are also included: "The Blonde in the Blue T-Bird" is one of my favorites and for some reason it makes me think of Suzanne Summers in the (white) T-Bird from the movie "American Graffitti." The track "Hot Summer Nights" was probably the next single from this album, but guess what? A group called "Night" released it and that version became the hit.  Now that this is on CD, Walter's "Fundamental Roll" and "Hi-Fi" should also be issued.
