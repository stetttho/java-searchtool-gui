 I bought this album when it first came out in 1976. While not the best McCartney album out there, it still has its own charm. Everyone likes the 2 big hits on this: "Let Em In" and "Silly Love Songs" ruled the radio airwaves in the spring and summer of 1976. They were the perfect songs for that time.  To this very day I fail to understand why Capitol Records put "Beware My Love" on as a B-side to "Let Em In." That song could have stood on its own as an A-side and a rock n roll hit. As a B-side I don't remember it getting any airplay, not even on album rock stations, which is a shame since this classic rock song will fit in any AOR format.  While many criticize the songs written and sung by other members of Wings, I grew to like them... even "Cook of the House" by Linda McCartney which I think is a total riot. She did have a minor hit of her own a few years after this album with "Seaside Woman" which was released by under the monicker of Susie & the Red Stripes (which was more than likely this band with Linda on lead vocals).  For me the bonus track "Sally G" is a great add-on as that was the B-side to "Junior's Farm" and became a hit in its own right on both the Hot 100 and country charts. This is a great country song if I ever heard one.  "Wings At The Speed of Sound" is not a bad album and has enough variety to keep a listener's attention.
