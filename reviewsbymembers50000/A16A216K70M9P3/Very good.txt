 I tell you, Thomas Harris can write a good book. In Red Dragon, the prequel (although also written before, not as an gimmick afterward) to Silence of the Lambs, we follow Will Graham, a former FBI agent brought back to investigate a serial killer who chooses suburban families as his victims. He's also famous for being the man who caught Hannibal Lecter, who also gets a bit part in this story (not nearly as extensive as Silence or Hannibal). I thought I'd be disappointing with the fact that Hannibal isn't in this novel as much as Silence (although he makes the most of his limited time, for sure), but this is offset by a nearly equally interesting villain in Dolarhyde. Whereas Buffalo Bill plays second-fiddle to Lecter through much of Silence, Dolarhyde steals the show. We really get to see the factors that have molded his thinking and the way they conflict with each other within himself. And he's an interesting villain in himself. On several occasions Thomas steps into Dolarhyde's mind in everyday occurrances. What does a serial killer think when he's on a date? Driving a car? It's a fascinating look at a fascinating character. He's not quite Lecter, but he more than carries this story. The plot was also a very pleasant surprise. There are enough twists to keep the story from ever becoming a standard copper/killer story. It delves right into the minds of the characters and I found it took me to some places I'd never been and never thought I'd go. It was surprising (and shocking) until the very last page. Otherwise, the dialogue is crisp, the characters are rich, and the prose is superb. In comparison to The Silence of the Lambs, I would just simply say that they're in the same league, if that says something. It's almost an insult to the other to pick a favourite. They're both must reads. Matty J
