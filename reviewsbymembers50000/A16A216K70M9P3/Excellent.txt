 Wow. Looks like I'm in the minority. At the risk of disillusioning everyone, I'll become the second person in the first three pages of reviews I read to give it a perfect 5 out of 5. The story is, on the surface a fairly simple one. Two brothers, Ray - a law professor - and Forrest - a recovery alcoholic in between jobs - are summoned home by their father, an old and ailing retired Judge in Mississippi. When they get home, they find him dead, and Ray finds over $3 million hidden in the house - odd indeed, considering his father's by-the-books way of dealing with life and his past generosity to charities, which has left his bank account nearly dry. The story follows Ray as he attemptings to find the source of this money, wondering who he can trust, and envisioning himself with a new house and a bigger plane to fly around in. This story, unlike most of his recent works, takes several twists which left me guessing and, on the whole, satisfied. This isn't, say, the Testament or the Partner, where you know in the end that everything is going to work out just peachy from the beginning, and it's just a matter of how the story gets there. I was with Ray the whole time, wondering what I would do in his situation, wondering where the money came from, wondering how he was going to get out of several situations. As a reader, that's all I can ask for. I read this novel in a day. I couldn't set it down. And by the end, I was still pondering over the message. For his moral works (The Testament, A Painted House, etc.), it's among his best, because it's not cut and dry. There's one side of the ending, and then there's the other. It was left pleasantly unresolved -- pleasantly in that the reader can still think about it and what they would have done long after the story's done. If you trust anybody from such a strong minority as this, I say read this book. It's not Grisham's best, but he's given me plenty of reason to believe he can still write. Matty J
