 Life of Pi tells the story of an Indian boy, Piscene (Pi), the son of a zoo owner, who becomes stranded on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger after a shipwreck which kills, among others, his entire family. I don't think there's any way to describe the story further than that. It has to be read to be understood. Read it! In the end, the story is more than simply a story of overcoming the odds or unusual circumstances. Finishing this novel is like having your eyes opened to a new aspect of humanity. I tend to take a more philosophical mindview, so I wasn't overly swayed by the book's claim that it can make you believe in God (we should always believe what we feel to be true, not what makes us most comfortable, in my opinion), but the book is a searing look at human savagery - and more importantly, how we deal with it. The book's metaphors run deep, although I know I'm going to have to read this novel again to fully grasp them all. And don't be intimidated by the book's lofty spiritual claims. This is not a theological book - it's simply a book about how one boy comes to view the world. Faith is used in a liberal spiritualistic sense, not a religious one. All in all, this is a book not to be missed. Matty J
