 This is the first book I've read from Greg Iles. I read it on the recommendation of a friend and intend on reading more of his work.  This book takes us into the life of John Waters, a geologist who scouts potential oil well sites near his home town of Natchez, Mississippi. He has a successful business, a beautiful wife and daughter, devoted friends, and everything seems perfect until one day he catches a veiled signal from Eve Sumner, a signal from a past relationship that John had tried to forget. Unable to shake the curiosity from his mind, he starts down a path that leads him towards adultery, murder, and threatens to tear his life, and his family, apart.  The best elements of this novel are the characters, who are for the most part generally likeable (in spite of themselves) and well fleshed out, and the mystery-novel like suspense that permeates the first two-thirds of the novel. We get particularly good insight into John's past relationships and the insecurities all the main characters seem to have about sex. There is also a good dynamic through the bulk of the novel between plausible naturalistic explanations to the what happens and the feeling that it just has to be supernatural.  Where the novel suffers is in carrying the story into the final act where Iles seems to almost get carried away with his own premise. What had driven the characters early in the novel - compassion, dissatisfaction, hidden histories, etc. - suddenly takes a back seat to elaborate schemes and plot twists built around a premise that nobody seems to take as anything but granted anymore. (I also just had to wonder that, if what happens in the book can happen, just how often it happens, if only one person can do it, or if anyone can but they don't know how.)  At any rate, though, this is an entertaining book, if nothing too deep.  Matthew D. Johnston
