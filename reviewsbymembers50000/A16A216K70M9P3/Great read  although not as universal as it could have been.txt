 I've always been a Stephen King fan, and this novel ranks right up there on my favourites list. The main character, Johnny Smith, is very strong and is given relatable and lengthy characterization. The format is also quite good. King allows the piece to fall as they may, showing hints of things to come, but never giving too much away. Early in the novel we're introduced to a lightning rod salesman at a bar, but this isn't pivotal until a great deal later (between 250 and 300 pages later, actually). And pivotal is it. Two things that bugged me, though. King sometimes seems to foreshadow way too much. I know it's just his style -- as I've seen this used in all of his great books, particularly "Eyes of the Dragon", my favourite of his -- and I don't generally mind it too much, but he'll often end several consecutive chapters with clear indication of what happens in the next. In a society that dwells on cliffhangers to keep on reading, I suppose that is one of the reasons he's so popular, but I personally would prefer him allowing the story to tell itself rather than having to end chapters by telling us that the main characters would not meet for another four years. Sure, it gets the reader's interest, but only if the reader's supposed to be uninterested in the first place. Also, the ending fails to be as universal as it could have been. I loved the questions it raises about assassination, but by having Johnny unsuccessful, King fails to keep the question on a real level, something that could be used in consideration of Lincoln or JFK. If Johnny had succeeded without the speculation, notes and scandals associated with it all afterwords, it would have kept the motives mysterious, something which real life assassins are in many cases.
