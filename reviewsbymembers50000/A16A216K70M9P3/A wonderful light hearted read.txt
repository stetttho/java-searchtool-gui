 Someday we may see families curled up on couchs on Christmas Eve, the television for once turned off. Rather than watching It's A Wonderful Life or Miracle on 34th Street, they'll each have a copy of Skipping Christmas in their hands. It took me a while to warm to this novel, but when I did, it was inescapably ensearing, and quite humourous. (It's rare for me to laugh out loud while reading a novel, but I certainly did with this one!) The story takes us into the lives of Luther and Nora Krank who have decided, for one year and one year only, they're going to skip Christmas all together. They've just sent their daughter away for a year with the Peace Corps, no family's around, and they'd frankly rather take a cruise than worry about buying gifts and decorating the house. In the end, they find skipping Christmas isn't as easy as they had envisioned. As I said, it took me a while to warm to this story. The first half of the novel didn't really click with me. I got the feeling Grisham was just going through the motions, writing a weak satirization of Christmas commercialism, but it turns out he was just setting the stage for the rest of the story. So, while I understand this was part of the story as well, I can't give the story a full five because I felt he did fall into an uncustomary lull at the beginning. Still, this is a very worthy Grisham novel, and one that should brighten everyone's holiday spirits. Recommended for everyone, especially if you like light-hearted Christmas fare. Matty J
