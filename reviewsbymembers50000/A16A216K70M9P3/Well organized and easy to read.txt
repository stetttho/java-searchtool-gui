 Sdorow's text is perfect for any introductory College or University level course. The chapters are organized clearly, with roughly equal weight (30-40 pages) given to each of the subtopics (which is good for course design). Also, the range of topics is broad enough to give any first-year psychology student a comprehensive look at what the field has to offer. There isn't overwhelming depth in any one of the chapters, but they do provide enough information, and enough of the pivotal studies and hypotheses, to give students a fair understanding of these psychological subfields. Most importantly, though, Sdorow is an incredibly easy read, which should go down relatively easily for any person even with a fleeting interest in psychology (like myself). Diagrams supplement nearly every study or hypothesis. A colourful "emotion wheel" may seem ridiculous to some, but it really does illustrate their point! Studies are also supplemented by pictures, including photos of many influential psychologists (and usually a key quote), charts and graphs. Keys point in the margins and concise chapter summaries make for easy studying. A great introductory psychology text, and one of the few first-year textbooks I intend on keeping. Matty J
