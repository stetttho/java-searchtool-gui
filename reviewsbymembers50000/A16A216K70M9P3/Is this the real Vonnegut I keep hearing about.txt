 As a first time Vonnegut reader, I've got to say that I'm deeply disappointed. Mind you, I do intend to read more of his working, having received a more specific list of his better works from my dad. The idea of this novel, I suppose, is interesting, but it's neither compelling enough to fill the reader's imagination for 300 pages as a story or a concept. The chronology is completely abstract. There is no protagonist, or antagonist. No relatable characters at all, now that I look back. Vonnegut even admits that the only enemy in the novel is humankind's big brains, but this isn't embodied at any point in the novel. There is no Hitler-esque type 'big-brained' person with which to drive this farcical point home, just broad speculation about the harm lies and such have done the human race. It reads like a mock textbook. There isn't any great personal experience to drive this point home, no face-off between big-brained and small-brained, just little tidbits here and there about man's actions in contrast to evolutionary theory. Very abstract, and as a result, impersonal. The biggest disappointment here is how poorly I feel this story is told. It's abstract when it doesn't even need to be. Vonnegut adds asteriks before the names of the next person to die, which is both unnecessary and distracting. He even made me so detached from the characters of the story, citing their big brains as huge evolutionary mistakes over and over again, that I didn't care at all about them, even in a superficial sense, when they died or mated. Perhaps this was the intent -- to distract the reader from the more sentimental, emotional and real ideals of man in place of strictly evolutionary ones -- but in that case he should have re-enforced man's need for sentiment even more, as to draw some sort of contrast. As it is, it's just a meaningless read. However, as I've said, I do intent to read more Vonnegut. Bring on "Sirens of Titan". Matty J
