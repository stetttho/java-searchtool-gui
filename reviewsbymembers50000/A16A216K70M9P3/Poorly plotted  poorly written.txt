 I'm guessing, as others have, that Gayle Lynds did most of the writing with this one. Not that I've read anything else by Gayle Lynds, but Ludlum seems so much superior to this. I'm hoping so, anyway. There aren't very many redeeming factors to this book. Most of the writing is very, very laboured. I could see the writer(s) trying to dig for the most dramatic way to put things, and the most dramatic circumstances, even if they would never happen. It never felt really natural. The relationship and loss, which is described on the backcover, is an over-drawn cliche that left me shaking my head. They knew they needed the relationship to be a strong, lovey-dovey type to make the suffering and loss seem real, but they never let the relationship develop on its own. It was just a gimmick. Similarly, there's a conflicted character who reallly baffled me. He's made a conscious decision to take part in a plan that could forseeably kill millions and millions of people, but finally sees the light when he realizes one of his former friends would be affected. WHAT???? You didn't think, with *millions* of people dying, that it *might* get personal??? They really force it. As they do the plot, which takes a few turns, but never really takes off. There are many cliches and few genuine surprises. With how many times this plot (big company starts epidemic, sells cure for big bucks) has to replicated in the past few years (MI2, multiple video games, Tom Clancy novels, etc.), there needs to be some new insight into it. This novel does not even come close to offering it. As far as the prose goes, any novel that can get away with saying "Some madman . . . decided to play God. Or Satan, if you will" just isn't worth reading. Pick up "The Bourne Identity". It's much much better overall. But, if you're looking for a fast-paced if cliched and occasionally groan-inducing read, you could do worse than this one. Matty J
