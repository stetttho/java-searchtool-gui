 I was curious how a few years might change the perspective I had on this book from the first time I read it, in grade 10. Indeed, I think I have benefitted from having a more grown-up view to this material, given how much weight it carries, even if the story is told from the point of view of a youth. "To Kill A Mockingbird" tells the story of an Alabama family, the Finch's, who get caught up a racial battle in their small town as Atticus, a father and widower, defends a black man against the charge of rape. The story is told rather wonderfully from the point of view of Scout, a naive and hot-headed young girl with a nose for a fight, who wanders among many stories, from the eccentric Radleys, to playground fights, to wondering why her father continues to defend that man everyone seems so intent on lynching. "To Kill A Mockingbird" is a wonderful story. It's sweet and poignant and principled without ever being schmaltzy or loaded with sentiment. Among the strongest points, in my opinion, are the little conversations Atticus has with others explaining why he's doing what he's doing, the court sequences, and the subplot with Arthur Radley. There is a pervasive theme of not judging others before getting to know them which is a lasting, timeless message. Recommended to everyone. Matthew D. Johnston
