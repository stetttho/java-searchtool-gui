 The Partner tells the story of Patrick Lanigan, an ex-partner at a firm who has been on the run for four and a half years after faking his own death in a car wreck and stealing $90 million from his law firm. The story picks up with Patrick being caught in Brazil, and the fun begins as the reader is slowly drawn into Lanigan's world, before and after his "death". This is a strong novel, although not among Grisham's best. It's interesting to see the ways in which the legal system are manipulated, and which deals are struck and how, even if there is little doubt from a hundred pages on as to what kind of person Patrick is -- and therefore how the questions about his past are going to be answered. Patrick also seems a little too smart to be bought at face value (DNA tests of his daughter? bugging his own office?), but I guess novels are, at heart, romanicized reality at best. The Partner doesn't fully investigate everybody's fantasy of taking a vast amoung of money and running to an exotic locale, but it comes close. When all the facts are laid on the table, you'll wonder whether you would have done things any differently. And, as always, this Grisham is an easy and fast read. Very enjoyable. Matty J
