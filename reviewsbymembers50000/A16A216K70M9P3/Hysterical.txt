 High Fidelity tells the story of Rob, a thirty-something record store owner who is growing increasingly unsure of himself. Not only has his girlfriend, Laura, just moved out, and his business started to suffer, he's begun to look retrospectively on his life and realized that his relationships have never really worked out. Confiding in the reader, he takes us on a journey to find out just why that is. High Fidelity, I found, works on a lot of levels -- although they're perhaps levels that you wouldn't expect a novel to work out. As a love story, it's not going to touch your heart. As a tragedy of everyday living, Rob's story isn't going to make you cry (Rob doesn't deserve much sympathy very often -- and he certainly never demands it!). As an epic, well, it's just a story of an everyday guy. But High Fidelity undeniably strikes a chord. It's contemporary and legitimate and everything a modern novel should be. It deals with issues of growing old, when to start a family, our own insecurities (and the insecurities in others we often don't see), measures of success, money and relationships, friendship... all the good stuff. And it's one helluva ride getting there, too. Hornby's prose is wonderful -- brisk and hilarious. Hornby has a good eye for the ironies of everyday life, and the ironies of Rob's life. The story's told in the first person perspective, which is handled flawlessly. Everything's pure Rob, and as anybody who's seen the movie (which rightfully, stays true to its source material) knows, he's quite the interesting person to be around. It's a novel that's hard to critisize. If you're not a fan of contemporary writing and stories about modern urban society, you're not going to like this. There's little I would call timeless or objective about this novel. It's not Romeo & Juliet. But if you're looking for something contemporary, something hilarious and touching, you're not going to find a better novel than this one. Matty J
