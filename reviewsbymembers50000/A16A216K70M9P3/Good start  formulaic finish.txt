 "The Broker" tells the story of Joel Backman, an imprisoned former stock broker, who receives a suspicious last-minute pardon from an outgoing President. The idea behind the pardon, as the book's backcover will divulge, is that Joel has secrets the CIA hasn't completely figured, and they're interested in who will take the first shot at Joel now that he is a free man.  The books strengths, as with any Grisham novel, are the gripping introduction and fast-paced, tight prose. The strongest moments in the story, however, I thought were the ones spent in Italy when Joel was trying to learn the Italian language, even though the pace was slower. A lot is revealed about his character during these scenes.  On the other side, the story suffers from a lot of the same pitfalls as many of his recent works. The ending felt anticlimactic and was devoid of the subtle commentary on how things work (commonly the main character gave up practicing law after the ordeal) that was commonplace in his earlier works. Grisham also wades in well over his head in the technical aspect of the story. He gives a disclaimer at the end that he's no technical wizard, but it's really unnecessary - it's thoroughly obvious from the way the plot unfolds. I can't even begin to imagine how he supposes three Pakistani students would be the only people in the world who could find and hijack (hack) a rogue spy satellite. And don't get me started about the overuse of the word "hack". Note to Grisham: Giving your user name and password for your email account does not qualify as "hacking".  But I digress. A worthwhile read for those devoted to reading everything Grisham publishes (like me) but, for new Grisham readers, pick up "The Rainmaker", "The Firm" or "A Painted House" before this one.
