 Where do people come up with this garbage?    It is so obvious she's about as real an artist as her sister (rich & dumb Jessica Simpson-Lachey).  The music is so vapid, phoney and devoid of any real content; the lyrics remind me of love notes scribbled on the back of a trapper keeper. I enjoy great, entertaining music like the next person - but this stuff just insults the intelligence.    Come on now?  Why can't people get behind real artists, people with actual talent and interesting things to say?  Not talking depth, but just plain reality?  It's disheartening, one, that this is the kind of stuff the industry seems to always get behind - cash cow potential;  but on the other hand, people buy up this rubbish?  This seems to be one of the hoofprints of our culture: toss anything into the troth and we eat it up.  Maybe it really doesn't matter in the end.  Life is short, so who cares?    Yeah, who cares: buy more, buy now.          www.hopeinamerica.com
