 I recently bought this CD brand new.  I knew that it has gone out of print - so put down my other selections and bought this in case I never come across it again at the ridiculous price of four dollars (and change)!  I'm a fan of the original series; I watch it whenever it's on the Sci-Fi Channel.  I was surprised to find this compilation in a local record store?  I was driving home with it in my CD player; the snow was falling, cars passing in and out of the darkness... The music on this CD succeeds in getting under your skin and makes the banal things in life more sinister, more disturbing.  I don't have the show deep enough in my brain to recall scenes as I listen to the music - so in that respect, the music becomes creepier, attaching itself to life around as I listen to it.  Kind of putting me in my own twilight zone, and that's OK.   I highly recommend this collection - if you can find it?
