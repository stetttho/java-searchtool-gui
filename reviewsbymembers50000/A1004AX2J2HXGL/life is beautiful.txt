 Or is it?  I first saw this when I was maybe twelve or thirteen - I was alone in a hotel room somewhere in New Jersey, my parents were out by the pool.  I watched this movie from beginning to end - I was frightened, terrorized and very, very sad - I couldn't really describe what I went through.  I didn't want to watch this thing for years afterward.  Eventually I revisited the movie & it has become one of my favorites.  It is the only film that makes me cry, even to this day.  It is solid proof of the possibility that cinema could be the most powerful artform ever created - the closest to directly describing the carefully blended chaos of the dream.  Mel Brooks - if he made any right decisions in his career - it was hiring on David Lynch to direct this film.  Just as perfect as Tim Burton directing SLEEPY HOLLOW.
