 One evening, my friends and I were witnesses to the belly dancer's art in full swing at a local Middle Eastern place.  I always had an idea of what it was like - but the reality was amazing.  It took me away to another time and place.  The music seemed to sweep her around the room like a whisp of seductive smoke and bells.  The belly dancer later told me she usually works with tracks off DIASPORA, in addition to other artists.  The title is a word that refers to Jews living outside the promised land - the dispersed, essentially. I've heard most of Natacha Atlas' music - and will state flat out this is her best, most hypnotic album.  HALIM is my second favorite - and the rest kind of fade out from there.  An artist does what an artist does:  she apparently is moving towards the R&B and hip-hop genres that are popular in the United States and Europe.  Not sure why?  She may be trying to cut her teeth in these styles and try to make a bigger break?  How unfortunate.  If you listen to samples of her later albums, you will know what I'm describing.  Sounds like the junk I hear on European variety shows and MTV.  Wherever her career has been moving toward: DIASPORA is still simply magic - very refreshing, full of a sensual and erotic life all its own.  I wish that Natacha would return to this more traditional style, but alas she has seen the future and it will be... Get DIASPORA and be whisked away.  If you have a work out schedule, enjoy cheesey house music or third-rate hip-hop, then by all means explore her other efforts.  I will stop here, thank you very much.  I had to purchase a USED COPY of this album, as it is now unfortunately OUT OF PRINT.
