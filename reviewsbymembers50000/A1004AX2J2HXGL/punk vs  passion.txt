 First time I heard this album, I was ready to toss it out the window or use it as an ashtray.  I put it away - then pulled it out again several months later when I took a third shift job... the punchline is I love this thing!   I can imagine dark streets, flying carpets and industrial wretchedness.  Perfect!  It sounds like third world music being played on conventional rock instruments.  Lots of sprawling, tribal-like drums coupled with J. Lydon's screeching, odd voice - all other sounds fill the gap between the two.  Lydon's voice seems more at home on this album more than anything else he has done.  "Flowers of Romance" is an aggressive antithesis to popular music of that time.  Not surprising.  I especially love the track entitled PHENAGEN - beautiful, almost religious chanting. I wonder if PIL will ever get their due?  Maybe one those instances, much like the Stooges or VU before them, when twenty years later someone decides this is actually great music?  I'm glad I found out sooner than later...
