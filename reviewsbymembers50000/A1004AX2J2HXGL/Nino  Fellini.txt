 I guess they don't make 'em like they used to? This disc is a great introduction to the collaborative effort of Federico Fellini & Nino Rota. The music moves from the exuberant, care-free joy of La Dolce Vita, to the sadness of La Strada, to the strangely moving pieces from Satyricon & Roma - well, each track contains all those moments and more. I'd give this thing five stars - if only they'd have selected longer tracks of music from each film! As it stands, some are mere fragments, and sadly understated. But all in all, worth a listen - if you end up seeking out the complete, original soundtracks - it will definitely be worth the trip.
