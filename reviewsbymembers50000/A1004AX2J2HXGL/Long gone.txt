 Well, I've been enjoying this album, along with the other two Syd Barrett albums for a few years now.   If you like one, you'll like them all.  Syd Barrett was NOT a genius, but a very talented songwriter who "lost himself a bit", shall we say?    I try to imagine walking into a pub late one night, and suddenly faced with this guy just playing his spacey music to a pair of drunks,  a few empty bottles and a bartender smoking a cigarette.   Pure magic.  The unique music from a guy who seems to have fallen down the rabbit hole and may still down there for all we know.  I remember hearing once he was alive and sort-of well, writing a history of art never meant for public consumption.  It would be a strange come-back for sure.  However, these albums somehow leave blanks for the listener's imagination to fill in.  I've heard REM do a cover of "Dark Globe" - and if nothing else, it amplifies the uniqueness of Syd Barrett.  It was less REM taking a song and making it their own, and more of REM trying to capture the mood of the source material by walking into Syd's territory.  I've heard Skip Spence's album OAR several times;  in comparison to MADCAP LAUGHS, it's musically richer and grounded in something closer to his peers.  But somehow Syd Barrett's music has a charm that the other loonies of rockdem lack:  It's kind of childish, it is kind of love-lorn, sort of romantic tipping back into the tragic.  The albums capture that delicate balance perfectly - amidst all the imperfection.    "Dark Globe" is the definitive Barrett composition - not necessarily the best.  If you need clarity and meaning in music, if you need demographic, if you need a genre and something that is identifiable as this or that - Syd is not for you.  This is one of those curious albums that you come across very rarely.  Like finding an old record in your grandmother's attic and listening to it constantly - a sonic snapshot of a few random moments that will never be again.
