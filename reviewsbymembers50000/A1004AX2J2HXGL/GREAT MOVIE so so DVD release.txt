 I agree with all the other gushings about this movie listed here.  I saw it several times in the theater when it was first released, and was simply mesmerized.  Like few other movies, I was involved in the story, felt as if I was floating above it like some waiting spirit.  Jim Jarmusch has some fairly good movies to his credit - this is my favorite.  When will they release "Down By Law" on DVD?  Anyway, "Dead Man" has the standard fair of extras - a couple of deleted scenes, a music video, but no trailer?  On chapter eight of this DVD, the movie seems to get staggered, apparently a bad transfer into the digital format.  It looks as if frames were removed, making the scene (one of the best in the movie) seem like a silent movie.  I returned it several times, and all copies had this problem.  I haven't seen anything out there about this, but I wish they would correct it.  Oh well, I imagine this movie will go out of print in a year or two anyway.  The paying audience should be satisfied it was released on DVD at all...
