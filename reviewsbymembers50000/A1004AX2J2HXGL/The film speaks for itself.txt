 The only thing missing is a presentation of the original 78 minute film "Some Folks Call it a Sling Blade" (1993) which later the feature length film was created from.  Can't have it all, I guess.  Perhaps when they release the extra-special edition?  If you like Bill Bob in this film, you should also check out "Dead Man" (he's in exactly one hilarious scene) and "The Man Who Wasn't There".
