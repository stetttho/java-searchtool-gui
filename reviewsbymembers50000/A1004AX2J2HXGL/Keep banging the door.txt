 Three discs that collect the "Bollocks" album, b-sides, studio out-takes, an entire concert and some rare live tracks:    There is one track, a cover of the Creation's "Through My Eyes" which is more like a warm-up that lasts about a minute or so.  If only they had actually recorded the song full out, it would have been great fun!  Some of the well-known covers such as "Stepping Stone" and "Substitute" are presented differently; the vocal tracks are the same, but the music is an early, rough mix.  An improvement to the over-produced versions previously available.  "No Fun" is pretty much the same, they just cut it off a few seconds later so we get more studio conversation.  Virgin provides some live tracks, in addition to the complete live show, that sound more like set fillers and audience agitation; mostly moaning, improvisation and feedback.  The version of "Belsen Was A Gas" offered is far better than what I heard on the GREAT RnR SWINDLE.    The booklet is great, usual stuff about the Pistol's place in rock history, what they were about, theatrics vs. bare-bones rock, blah blah blah.  The track-by-track commentary by the band is, I believe, pretty much what was published in a later chapter of Lydon's autobiography "Rotten: No Irish, No Blacks, No Dogs" and on the KISS THIS CD insert.    If you're a fan, this is really the best collection available.  Hopefully, this will be the last time you'll have to plunk down hard-earned cash to own some Sex Pistol's product.  As they say, the swindle continues.  Enjoy...
