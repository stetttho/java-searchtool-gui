 A wonderful, wonderful collection of music.  I always loved the music for both SATYRICON and FELLINI ROMA - to have them available on CD is a treasure beyond belief!  I've always been dissatisfied with only the two minute suites previously available on other Fellini/Rota score collections.  SATYRICON's music definitely creates an other-worldly quality.  Ethereal music that stands up well on its own; seeming more at home in a science fiction film, rather than an exploration Rome's decadence.  In places, you can hear crackles, as if the recording was taken off an LP.  But this is not distracting at all; in fact it seems to enhance the distant mood of the music.        FELLINI ROMA is marvelous!  The score is more ambient and moody, less variant than SATYRICON; however, it creates a dark, dream-like ambiance incomparable to most soundtracks.  The music for the Catholic fashion show is strangely upbeat, very much like the organ music heard in most Roman Catholic churches.    TOBY DAMMIT is the most standard of the three.  It is an amazing work - and one in a long line of film music that is evidence enough of Nino Rota's haunting musical genius.  Playful and dark, it works very well to build and sustain the mood that Fellini intended for the film.  Highly recommended for avid listeners of film music.
