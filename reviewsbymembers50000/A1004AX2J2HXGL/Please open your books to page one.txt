 I've been a fanatic over Federico's work since I first saw FELLINI ROMA in a classroom one Friday night in college.  I came across a poster advertising the scheduled screening; it was an image from one of the last, most unsettling scenes in the film - a very Catholic fashion show.  My interest was piqued enough to spend an evening in a classroom rather than other social pursuits; and what a classroom it was.  I was one of maybe three people in the room that night.  I can't explain in words what I saw on the screen - it was simply incredible.  It felt like my world opened a little bit more; my own dreams and ideas didn't seem quite so ridiculous. I started to hunt down other films by this director, reading articles, reviews, anything.  I eventually came across Mr. Bondanella's book, and found it to be a wonderful companion piece to the work of Fellini.  It reads like a textbook, but his incites into the craft and visions of Fellini are wonderful.  That said, I didn't take his interpretations as gospel - this book provides an excellent jumping off point into understanding Fellini's world - the fantasies and the world that inspired them.     I recommend this book highly to fans of Fellini and students of film in general - a fantastic document.  It attempts, and I think succeeds, to capture the story of a rare kind of brilliance.
