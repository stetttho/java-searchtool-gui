 I keep thinking this sounds so much like a mutation of T. Rex - instead of the psychedlic/glam thing, we hear blues/punk.  The first time I listened to the White Stripes, I had a wild surge up my spine similar to when I first heard Nirvana; they have related sounds - razored down and raw, which makes sense because they share a similar musical pipeline.   The brand of rock 'n roll here is very visceral,  sometimes sensitive, intensely energetic and just plain cooks without apologies.  Good enough.  Much better than the bucket loads of the rubbish that's been in circulation over the past few years.    Another reviewer denounced the band as sell out material and pandering to the tastes of blank Americans?  Maybe. They're damn fine sounding sell-outs & manage to walk along some interesting fences.   LITTLE ACORNS is one of my favorite tracks off this one, followed closely by Girl you have no faith in medicine, ball and biscuit & the AIR NEAR MY FINGERS.   And so now that they've enjoyed some success after kicking around a few years, interesting to see where they go.  The White Stripes are a band I think I could still be enjoying a long time from now. As a side note: some of the b-sides and rare tracks out there are fantastic & hopefully we'll get a collection of them in the future?
