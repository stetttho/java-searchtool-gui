 This is a fantastic DVD for any longtime fan of the SEX PISTOLS, anyone curious about the beginnings of English "punk" or anyone just passionate about rock music.  We are treated to candid and relaxed interviews with the important characters involved in bringing this great album to life.   I think this makes a great companion documentary to THE FILTH AND THE FURY; a fine documentary, kind of using the anti-gloss, cut-up approach for highlighting the influences, the rise, the fall and impact of the SEX PISTOLS.  For me, NEVER MIND THE BOLLOCKS has never grown old, the music brilliantly simple.  In addition, knowing the history of the band, it makes the music that much richer.  On this documentary - John Lydon speaks fondly to the comic, almost camp feel at the heart of this album.  Steve Jones laments that if they hadn't kicked Glen out, if they didn't do the Bill Grundy show - there may have been more albums from the SEX PISTOLS.     The bonus material is simply stuff that was excised from the main event of this DVD, because it strays away from the subject of the album itself.  It is possible this was originally aired as a series on television, and they had to trim everything for interest of time?  Whatever the case, I wish they just presented it as a whole - all included.  The bonus material can only be viewed section by section, and that can get tiring after a while.  Not a major complaint, really.   I'm glad I bought this DVD; it provides a fresh view to a notoriously underrated band.  I recommend it highly.
