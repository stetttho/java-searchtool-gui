 Like many others, I first viewed Enrique Iglesias with some skepticism.  After all, it would be very easy for the son of Julio Iglesias to get an album made, regardless of how talented he was.  Well, Enrique pretty much blows that cynical theory away with the very first track on his self-titled album, "Rhythm Divine", and the songs that follow for the most part don't disappoint. Although this is undeniably pop, Enrique injects enough emotion and salsa flavor to keep the album from sounding too sugary.  The only songs that seem too pop-ish are "Sad Eyes" and "You're My #1".  "Oyeme" is the most superficial track on the whole lot, but I still find myself singing along to it, so it can't be that bad.  The duet with Whitney Houston "Could I Have This Kiss Forever", is better than expected, though she does her best to dominate the song for herself. Latin pop is all the rage right now, but if "Enrique" is any indication, this artist has enough talent and emotion to survive on his own merits.
