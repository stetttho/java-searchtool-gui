 Given Peter David's unswerving talent for dialogue and characterization, the "first-hand" storytelling style of Mackenzie Calhoun's ill-fated tour of duty on the U.S.S Grissom is--not surprisingly--a real  page-turner.  Calhoun is the best character to come out of David's  "New Frontier" series, and this story will probably convince you  of that, too. "Once Burned" is a tale which revolves around the  darker aspects of human nature, and as a result the Starfleet characters do  not fit the 'almost-perfect' molds of their "Next Generation"  counterparts.  In fact, a few of David's characters are downright shallow  and thuggish--a little too much so.  However, despite this drawback, this  book contains enough of that familiar Trek flavor to make the story  enjoyable. This is a must-read for "New Frontier" fans, but  it's accessable enough for new readers as well.  Either way, this is a Trek  book worth reading.
