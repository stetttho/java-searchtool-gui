 The original version of Tempest was on my top five list of favorite arcade games--and Tempest X is even better.  The game play is basically the same as the original,  but there are also some colorful power-up features, and a great techno music soundtrack! There are only a couple of drawbacks to Tempest X.  The original arcade version of Tempest is included (if you'd ever care to play it), but it's also sluggish and crude.  Also, Tempest X is so colorful that you can lose track of what's happening.  However, in the higher levels, you'll be running mostly on instinct anyway. That's the real appeal Tempest X really has for me.  Once you fall into your own little zone, this game can swallow you whole!
