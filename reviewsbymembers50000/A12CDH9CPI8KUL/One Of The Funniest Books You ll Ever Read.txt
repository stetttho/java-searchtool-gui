 Joe Keenan has an incredible talent, not just for keen comic timing and rapier-sharp dialogue, but also for constructing a hysterically labyrinthine story in such a way so that the reader can actually keep track  of it!  Lies, manipulation, extortion, greed--this book's got it all! All  the characters manage to be lovable somehow, even though they have few (if  any) redeeming qualities. I couldn't stop turning pages because I was dying  to see how these people would deal with each seemingly-insurmountable  obstacle that gets thrown their way.  It reads like an episode of  "Frasier" on acid--which makes sense when you realize Keenan went  on to become supervising producer of that television show. I would LOVE  to see a movie based on "Blue Heaven", but I'd much rather have  Keenan crank out another crackpot adventure with Gilbert and Phillip!   "Blue Heaven" and "Putting On The Ritz" are great--but  I want more, damnit!  :)
