 My pointed sense of cynical humor just about matches Joe Queenan's to a tee--I thought I'd just reveal that bias now and get it out of the way.  "Red Lobster" is a surgical expose of Queenan's foray into pop  culture, but let's face it--it's also snobbery to the nth degree.   Insightful snobbery, sharply written snobbery, downright enjoyable  snobbery--but snobbery nonetheless.  For that reason alone, "Red  Lobster" is not going to be everyone's cup of tea. But it sure as  hell was mine.  Queenan's skewering of pop culture icons is pretty thorough  and pretty hysterical (I just wish he waited for the "Titanic"  phenomenon before he wrote this book), but it's almost unrelenting.   However, he's forced to admit that at least a couple of those things he  expected to hate really aren't that bad after all--chiefly because those  things don't pretend to be anything more than they are.  Queenan doesn't  have a problem with simple, chinzy and shallow--just as long as it isn't  pretentious. That is Queenan's real gripe with most pop culture--shallow  stuff wrapped up as high art. The best chapter by far deals with literary  hacks, and delivers the finest backhanded complementary essay I've ever  heard in my life!  His tirades on such things are often poisonous--but come  on.  In your heart, you know he's right.
