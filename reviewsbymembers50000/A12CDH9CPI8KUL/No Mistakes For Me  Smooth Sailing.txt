 Previous reviews have mentioned errors in the clues to this book, specifically the astrological room, and have referred readers to gaming magazines for the "true" clues.  In my case, the reverse was true.  The magazine clues for the astrological room were worthless, while this book got me through that puzzle with no problems at all! I'd wager there are two "versions" of Silent Hill, each with slightly different puzzle solutions.  For the version of Silent Hill I have, this book worked great.  Unfortunately, you're not likely to figure out which "version" of the game you have until you follow either the magazine cheats or the cheats in this book.  I don't know if the other Silent Hill strategy books are any better in this regard.
