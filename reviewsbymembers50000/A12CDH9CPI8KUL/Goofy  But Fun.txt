 Roger Moore's fourth outing as superagent James Bond ranks among the goofiest in the 007 film series.  In fact, "Moonraker" is like a 007 parody--and the story is so similar to the film which precedes it that it should have been called "The Spy Who Loved Me 2".  Every single little thing in this flick is over the top: the high-speed amphibious gondola, the gratuitous use of sexy bimbos, the mid-air hijacking of a space shuttle in the movie's opening scene--and let's not forget the return of the unstoppable,        metallic-mouthed Jaws (the legendary bad guy role that made Richard Kiel famous). Obviously, "Moonraker" is too silly for it's own good, but it's great fun to watch.  Lonsdale's evil Drax delivers some of the funniest lines in the whole movie without even a hint of a smile.  The scene where Moore is pushed out of a plane without a parachute ranks among the best action sequences in the whole series.  The sets and models are fantastic, too.  It's pure escapism; watched on those terms alone, Moonraker is a hoot.
