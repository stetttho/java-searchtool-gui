 Beyond the first two tracks, "Breakdown" and "Angels Would Fall", I didn't think much of this album--at first.  However, the entire album grew on me the more I listened to it.  As said in Amazon's  review, there is a sameness of tone in places, but as Etheridge herself  edges closer to happiness, her songs (at least her lyrics) become more  fascinating.  She's one of the few artists today who expresses the complex  politics of love so deftly.  "Angels Would Fall", "Stronger  Than Me" and "Enough Of Me" weave love, devotion,  frustration and futility together so seamlessly she makes it look  simple.   "Cherry Avenue", "Beloved" and "Touch  And Go" are surprisingly good, considering most bonus tracks are  "leftovers".  The limited edition is definitely worth the extra  couple bucks.   The only weak link is, unfortunately,  "Scarecrow".  Naturally, it's the darkest track on the whole  album, but it feels too much like venting.  The song isn't really about  tribute, it's about pain, frustration and eventual forgiveness, and it  doesn't express Etheridge's conflicted emotions nearly as well as the other  songs.  I know Etheridge's heart was in the right place, but I could only  think about how the imagery in this song would probably open old wounds for  the Sheppard family.      However, this album is very much worth  listening to.  Don't be surprised if it takes a few listens to grow on you,  though.  I can't wait to see Etheridge on tour!
