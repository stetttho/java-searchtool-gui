 Most music anthologies have as many bad tracks on them as good ones, so I was reluctant to buy this album.  However, Summer's official greatest hits album ("On The Radio") doesn't have her post-disco hits on it, so  I bought the "Donna Summer Anthology" and crossed my  fingers. My gamble paid off.  "Anthology" not only contains her  familiar hits from later years, but it also contains gems I've never heard  before, like "I'm A Rainbow", "I Don't Wanna Get  Hurt"--and a surprisingly good rendition of "Don't Cry For Me  Argentina". Donna Summer will never shake her disco legacy, but we  often forget this woman has range!  "Anthology" proves that  beyond a shadow of a doubt.
