 The story goes like this: a bishop is held captive in a prisonchapel and is forced to watch a re-enactment of a romanticrelationship between two young men that took place years ago--and is forced to deal with the repercussions of it's tragic end. Quite frankly, the greatest strength in "Lilies" is it's clever presentation, and it's efforts to put a slightly different spin on what might otherwise be a predictable story.  Since all the parts being played in the re-enactment are portrayed by prison inmates, all the women are actually men in drag.  Add to that, the segues between the confines of the prison stage to the authentic locale of the flashbacks we're witnessing are seamless to the point of being unnoticable.  I've never seen flashbacks presented in such a way, and it's very much appreciated (thank you, John Greyson).  Also, while it would be easy to take pot-shots at organized religion in such a story, "Lilies" doesn't take that route.  Human weakness, not religion, is the villain in this film.  Rather than the church being the tool of the tragedy which unfolds, it winds up being a refuge. All the actors do a decent job, but Jason Cadieux is a stand-out as Simon.  He does a great job at conveying the turmoil he feels (and he's damn sexy, too!).  The one glaring weakness in the story is the character of Simon's lover's mother.  At no point does this woman make any sense to me at all.  In short, she's a loon and I don't know what real purpose she serves. However, "Lilies" isn't about her.  It's about the bishop and a love he took part in destroying.  The story isn't exactly new, but the presentation is so compelling you can't help but get swept up in it.
