 First the movie: "Star Trek III" is a decent installment in the "Star Trek" movie series, even if it is just one big segue.  First-time director Leonard Nimoy does a servicable job in helming the  story of Spock's rebirth.  The premise of the story is quite compelling  (Kirk's crew mutinies against Starfleet and sends the Enterprise to it's  destruction) and the special effects are fantastic.  The movie, however is  far from perfect.  At times, the story isn't too--well--logical, and all  the sacrifices Kirk and co. make in "Star Trek III" are pretty  much undone or forgotten in "Star Trek IV".  Add to that the  wrong-headed casting of Robin Curtis as Saavik--and especially Christopher  Lloyd as Kruge--and you get a flick firmly entrenched as the "middle  child" of the "Star Trek" movie franchise.      As far as  the DVD version, given how much money Paramount rakes in from "Star  Trek" would it KILL them to make a Trek DVD with some special  features?  A director's commentary would have been great; a triva section  would have been outstanding.  Instead what do we get?  The requisite  widescreen and theatrical trailer and that's it.  This disk doesn't even  have foreign language captions, for goodness sake!  Like all the Trek  releases before this one, Paramount put as little work as possible into the  DVD version, and frankly that stinks. If SOME effort had been put into  this, I would have rated this 3 stars instead of 2.
