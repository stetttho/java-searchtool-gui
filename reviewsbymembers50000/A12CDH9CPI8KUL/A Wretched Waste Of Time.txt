 3001 is a thin little book which spends 80% of the time marvelling at all the technological achievements made since 2001.  Almost zero attention is devoted to the mystery of the monolith, actual characterization is marginal  at best, provocative theological questions are quickly mentioned then  ignored, major developments are summarized in a trivial second-hand fashion  totally bereft of any depth--and the ending is manages to be arrogant,  simplistic AND boring at the same time.   It's pretty clear dollar signs  were dancing in ACC's head when he wrote this claptrap.  He should have  titled the book "3001: All Right I Wrote Another One--Now Quit  Bothering Me"
