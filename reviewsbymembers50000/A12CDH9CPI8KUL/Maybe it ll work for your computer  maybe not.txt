 Ghost is not only cumbersome to use (two seperate boot floppies for CD-writing and CD-reading operations!?), but surprisingly spotty for a DOS application.  Even Symantec's support site admits a long line of possible hardware compatibility problems with not only CD-RW drives, but with CD-R disks themselves!  Although Ghost will record backups on 700MB CD-Rs on my computer with no problem, it has great difficulty reading off of those 700MB CD-Rs afterwards.  It works okay with 640MB CD-Rs, but since those are becoming increasingly scarce, I will have to opt for much slower backups on 640MB CD-RWs.  Bottom line: if you buy this tool and backup on 700MB CD-Rs, you better verify the backup afterwards.  Symantec makes a lot of great products; Norton Ghost is not one of them.
