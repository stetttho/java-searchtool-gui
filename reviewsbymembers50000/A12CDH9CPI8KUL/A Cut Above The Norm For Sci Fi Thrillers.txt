 Looking at the premise alone, Pitch Black is basically Alien in the desert.  However, the execution is surprisingly solid.  The characterization is usually two-dimensional in pictures like this, but just about everyone in this movie has an ample supply of virtues and flaws.  The heroes certainly aren't perfect (one makes a decision to save herself that nearly kills everyone else, while another is a drug addict), and neither is the villain.  Diesel's Riddick turns out to have a certain amount of nobility to him, while staying true to his own evil nature.  The darker side of the characters' human nature contributes just as much to the tension in the film as the albino monsters flying over their heads, which goes a long way toward making this more enjoyable than expected. As far as the DVD extras are concerned, the 3 minutes of footage added to the unrated version will probably go unnoticed by anyone who watched the movie in the theater (I only figured out what they were by listening to the Twohy/Diesel commentary).  The "Pitch Black" premier dance party footage is a waste of both time and space, but the "making of" documentary is fairly good, and it includes the movie trailers, which I always like to see in a DVD.
