 Those who order this book may be surprised at its relatively small size (the book is actually 198 pages long, instead of the 320 cited above).  "21st Century Gay" manages to walk straight down the middle of the gulf between gay seperatists and gay mainstreamers by pointing out how both sides in the end truly need each other (even though they often find themselves thwarting each other).  Pivotal events, such as the Shepard tragedy and Rock Hudson's AIDS revelation, are described in overtly practical terms that lends insight into the social climate that made these episodes turning points in gay america--in ways I never fully considered. If you're looking for a book that endorses either mainstream or seperatist approaches in the continuing struggle for gay rights, you won't find it here.  However, I believe the uncommonly balanced coverage in "21st Century Gay" makes it one of the most valuable primers of gay rights issues you'll ever find.
