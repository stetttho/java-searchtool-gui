 Those expecting any details regarding the loss of the Excalibur and Captain Calhoun will be disappointed (We'll probably have to wait until "Excalibur: Restoration" for that).  However, "Requiem" is notable for focusing on some of the "New Frontier" characters who've gotten little attention: Zak Kebron, Mark McHenry and especially half Vulcan/half Romulan Soleta.   The Kebron & McHenry plot is rather whimsical, but it winds up adding a whole new layer of mystery to McHenry's character and gives Kebron a faint hint of genuine feeling.  While I look at McHenry in a whole new light, I wish author Peter David had concentrated more on Kebron and the toll his solitary nature has taken on him.  However, I expect we'll see more of that in the future. The standout story in "Requiem" by far is the Soleta plot.  Since "New Frontier" began, Soleta has been a character with great potential that was never utilized--until now.  David has taken this character's blood lines and created a personality that is distinct from that of Spock, yet quite natural, and I for one look forward to seeing more of her.  There is also a little sub-plot involving Si Cwan and Kalinda which, although interesting, doesn't shed any new light on either character. All in all, Peter David is making the most of the Excalibur's destruction by concentrating on what's really important: characters.  Once the crew reunites (you don't really think they won't, do you?), it's going to make future stories that much more interesting.
