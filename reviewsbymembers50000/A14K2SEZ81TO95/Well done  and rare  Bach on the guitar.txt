 Like some other reviewers who rate this recording at 5 stars, I too might prefer some other performances in the Chaconne from Partita No. 2.  On the other hand, Russell's playing is so extraordinary, I decided to suspend my prior preferences and attempted to hear that one movement as if for the first time.  What I heard was a joyous and brilliant expression of pure freedom and mastery.    Rather than try to build to an intense sound in the climax, as one often hears (certainly from Milstein's or Grumiaux's violin), Russell seems to accept the limitations of his instrument, steps back, and seems to say, "Well, then, how CAN I bring off this beast of a piece on six plucked strings?"  The answer is that instead of trying to make his superb, but limited, guitar match the decibel intensity implied by the music, he understates the whole thing, freeing up his monstrous technique, which he then applies toward the subtlest shades of tempo and dynamics, while racing toward the climactic conclusion (which anticipates the actual anti-climactic conclusion of this piece) with utter abandon.  The effect is that the "missing" intensity echoes in the very deep respect Russell has for the sheer volume of notes that the music conjures.  He deftly and clearly picks out the tune over that subtley sonic verbiage in a way that leaves no doubt of its intent.    I found myself urging Russell forward, but while some who play such music in an understated way leave it hanging, Russell somehow cleans up the loose ends, ties the knot, and truely brings it off--just so.
