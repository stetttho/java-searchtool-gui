 Without a doubt, this is one of the finest recordings of the Goldberg Variations and one of the finest solo Piano recordings, period.  It justly deserved the Grammy nomination it received when it was first released. Konstantin Lifschitz was, indeed, 16 when he recorded it, and shows all the brilliance of the young Glenn Gould when Gould first recorded it, with even greater maturity than the elder Gould when he recorded it for a second time.  First, unlike Gould, he takes all the repeats.  This provides an opportunity for frequent and inspired variations on the variations, as well as the chance to reveal the foundations of the score itself.  Lifschitz's variety of touch and articulation combined with a solid command of tempo and the broader shape of the music can fill an encyclopedia.  At the same time, his rhythmic intensity, whether slow or brilliantly fast, is always hot. The overall conception culminates in the final variation where Lifschitz beautifully renders each of the two complementry themes as the main theme and then as subordinate with each repetition.  I never tire of hearing this recording and have listened to it many more times than either of the two brilliant Gould efforts.
