 The word "Sufi" still elicits a range of reactions from the mystified to the parochial to the impractical, and you will likely view this book accordingly, unless you actually read it. In a curious way, it assumes that you are seeking an understanding of your motivations, and of life in general, as if "Sufi" were an everyday preoccupation. Yet, without attempting to define "Sufi" in any direct way, "Knowing How to Know" will likely challenge your assumptions regarding most any approach to knowledge that you have ever undertaken. If this book is to be believed, any real increase in understanding requires fundamental changes in characteristic patterns of our thinking, patterns of which we are typically unaware. However, the complexity of our minds means that each of us has unique needs that must be satisfied before effective changes in our thinking can occur. The process is not hit or miss, but involves human operations as precise as any required in the physical sciences, including all of the elements of love, action, and attention to which we are appropriately disposed. "Knowing How to Know" lays out, in very stark terms, just how we might hope to apply these necessary requirements to aquire deeper, broader, and higher knowledge in our own lives.
