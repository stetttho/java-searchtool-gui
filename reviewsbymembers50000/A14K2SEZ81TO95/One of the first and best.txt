 I will focus on the Nielsen Symphony, here.  This is one of the first and truly great widely-available recordings of this work, which I prefer to others I have heard, including the popular Leonard Bernstein recording.  Notable is the second movement (which is my acid test), where Sir John takes ample time with the theme introduced by the clarinets.  It is a noble, contrapuntal, theme that demands a full hearing.  But other players, such as Bernstein, seem to glide over it with barely a nod.  Equally impressive are the strings, especially the deep basses, and also the tympani, which the estimable player weaves with a controlled ferocity through the rest of the orchestra. Several recordings of this symphony are readily available, and I know that this one was only re-issued a few short years ago on CD after a long absence since its demise on vinyl.  Like other former LP masterpieces, this recording benefited greatly from its transference to CD, with the anticipated greater dynamic range and fidelity available from the original tapes.  It is to be lamented that it is no longer in the active "catalog" (along with so many other great performances). Perhaps this review will help make it more visible, increase its demand, and return it to the circulation it should never have been denied.
