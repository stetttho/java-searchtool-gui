 My review seconds everything said about the 3rd Symphony reading, and I would add that the 5th Symphony reading seems not to have been quite matched by anyone else.  Along with the overall polish and power of the first movement, the tempi of the final movement are generally faster and more difficult to sustain than others have ever attempted on record, especially in the Presto fugue that introduces those astounding clarinet and wind figurations.  This leads eventually and with equal intensity to a towering finale that Bernstein ends on a huge sustained brass chord, which truly stands apart from all other performances I have heard.  In two words, I would call this recording of the 5th far and away the "most uncompromising" of any I have heard.  For those who have not found it in their search, this entire recording seems still to be available on Sony Catalog No. 44708 (ASIN B00000DSAX) and can be found on Amazon at: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000DSAX/qid=1146761626/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/104-4972447-7733563?s=classical&v=glance&n=5174. I had to use "Nielsen, Symphony, 5, Bernstein" to make it come up on my search page.
