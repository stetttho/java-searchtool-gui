 While I pretty much concur with every word written so far on this page, I highly recommend the 1995 "six star" recording by Konstantin Lifschitz (Denon Records - #78961) as a worthy successor.  Lifschitz offers a performance every bit as powerful and precise as Gould, with a fuller tone and greater lyricism in selected voices.  Even more, Konstantin's layering of voices and flexibility of touch adds shades of Sviatislov Richter to the mix, his spiritual predecessor, being especially reminiscent of Richter's Well Tempered Klavier. Finally, Konstantin takes all of the repeats to great effect, with some inspired creative variation to the variations. Gould's will always represent a gold standard among any recordings of this piece, but Lifschitz adds perhaps a healthy dose of white and pink to the yellow gold that Gould provides.
