 I have both the old and new versions of Life.  I bought the new version this past Christmas, and it is different than my old 70's version.    For one thing, setting up is much more involved.  There are many different cards that weren't in the old game.  Also all of the plastic houses and the wheel have to be put on the board because the board folds flat.    There are changes to the careers, which are more fun.  You can choose career cards  and salary cards separately with more modern salaries.  You can also choose your house.  All of these are chosen without looking.  There are also different spaces that when landed on you can take other people's salaries, and get paid according to your job - like buy a sailboat, and if someone is the salesman they get the money.   The one thing I do not think is more fun is the life cards.  They are basically worthless until the end of the game, and all they are good for is to get more money. You can't even look at them until the end of the game.  There are no revenge spaces and you do not receive presents like the old game, just life cards.    My first grader can count his own money and pay bills with no help, now.  I was impressed at how fast he learned. Both are fun in their own way, but the classic version is worth holding on to.
