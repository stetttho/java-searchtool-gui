 I devoured these books when I was in 2nd grade.  My mom bought me the complete set in 3rd grade.  I think that these books helped me to become very interested in museums and history, which I still am to this day.  The only gripe I have about this set is that it does not include "Farmer Boy" and "These Happy Golden Years."  They are very important books to be read along with this series.  For the curious, "The First Four Years" lets the reader know what happened to Laura when she married Almonzo.  Also, there is a diary of Laura's journey to Missouri with her family, "On The Way Home."  Please do not let your children grow up without reading these books!
