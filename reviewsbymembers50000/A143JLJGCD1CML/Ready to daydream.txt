 I bought this on impulse in a museum giftshop and have never regretted it.  I am an art teacher - if you are an artist and need music to work to, this is some of the most enjoyable music I have ever bought.  Even the kids enjoy it!  "Fragile" is the only song I skip - I usually go straight to #2.  But all of the songs are woven together in a tapestry of wonderful music, so don't skip around.  Some may be based on the same songs, but are done differently.  Many are instrumentals. We play it while driving - we go to the ocean.  I didn't realize how many of Sting's songs had to do with the ocean until I listened to this. Some may say that "Love is the Seventh Wave" doesn't belong, but I disagree.  It wakes you up if you are too relaxed, and it has a good beat. Very tropical.  Buy it!
