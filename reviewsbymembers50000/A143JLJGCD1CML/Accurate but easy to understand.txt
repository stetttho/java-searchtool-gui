 If you have trouble like I do with the wordy KJV, here is a bible which is even more accurate - translated straight from the oldest existing manuscripts, which were not available when the KJV was written.  There are footnotes explaining different biblical terms if you are not familiar with them.  It is supposedly written on a third grade level, and comparing the different verses to the other translations available today are interesting and give the reader a different slant on the passage.  I bought my Bible when I attended church at Richland Hills Church of Christ in Fort Worth, Texas.  They sponsored the making of this particular translation.  I know firsthand that they would not put out anything paraphrased, or adjusted to their beliefs,  but a true accurate translation.  If you can find a copy, you will be glad you bought it, especially if there are low  or young readers in your family.
