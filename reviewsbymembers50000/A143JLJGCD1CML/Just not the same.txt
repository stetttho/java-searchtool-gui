 When I played with Spirograph about 25 years ago, they were made with this really tough plastic and the wheels were not dark colored.  The different sizes had different colors.  There were many sizes and shapes to choose from.  Not any more.  I bought the beginning Spirograph set for my daughter and then thought she was old enough for the bigger, more advanced set later.  The set I received had warped wheels that would not roll in the grooves when you wanted them to, and turned into a really frustrating experience for both of us.  The wheels were a dark blue and was hard to see the lighter colors we tried to use (gel pens). I could not even use it right.  ....
