 I have all 5 of the videos.  They each contain 2 episodes for a total of 50 minutes long per video.  This guy is really funny, with a dry sense of humor that gets the adults snickering along with the kids.  He has quick wit when it comes to the animal "bites," which are several seconds of many different wildlife videos. He has a cool vintage Winnebago and sends his videos to an unknown colleague named Beatrice.  He presents it like he was taking the videos with his own camera,  making his own "commentary," and calls it his "video diary."  He has other things he does with the animal videos like Moments with Buck (like Deep Thoughts with Jack Handy on SNL) Staghorn Awards, Bleacher Creatures, and more.  The movie is continually hopping from scene to scene, and keeps the kids and adults entertained.   I would recommend these for anyone!
