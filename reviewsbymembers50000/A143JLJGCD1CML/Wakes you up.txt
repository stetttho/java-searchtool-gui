 I had Information Society constantly in my cassette player when I was in college ("I want to know - what you're thinking") but I never heard any of the songs off of this album.  I bought it purely by impulse because I liked one of their other albums.  This is definately 80's club music, with the hard pulsing beat and electric sound effects.  I liked most of the songs, especially the title track - I loved the intro. A really catchy intro is important to an 80's music lover, and all of the songs pretty much stay in the same beat. Enjoyable!
