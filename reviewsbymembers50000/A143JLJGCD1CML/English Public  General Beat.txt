 I found this CD to be the ghost of groups past.  English Beat's album "Special Beat Service" comes to mind, with the reggae sounds and bouncy music.  I had General Public's "All The Rage" tape and this does not sound like that style music.  More funky is a good way to put it.  Well, I liked both, and really liked English Beat, but they also try to convince you that this is a comeback album with at least 2 of their songs. Also, what is the deal with the photos?  I couldn't decide whether they were trying to be nasty or not with the title combined with the photos.  Well, anyway, you will enjoy the bouncy songs -if not, at least it isn't full price, and they are ok to exercise to.
