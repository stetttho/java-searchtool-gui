 This CD ranges from the old classic "Jingle Bells," peppered up by Benny Goodman and Fats Waller, to great swing songs like "Santa Claus Came In the Spring".  (Santa Claus came in the spring, Santa Claus came when the skys were blue, I heard his sleigh bells jingaling, the day that I found you)  You'll be singing to this one after you play it several times!  My kids love it, and we even get it out in the summer when we long for Christmas!   It is a very long CD and it starts out with the semi depressing Harlem blues of the 20's and goes in chronological order to the Louis Armstrong of the 50's.  After the first 3 songs, it picks up to the big band and jazz sound of the 30's and 40's, which makes up well over half of the CD.  It will become one of those family classics.  If you do not care for bouncy music, this CD may get on your nerves, however.  It is not for the people who long for a calm, soothing CD!
