 I love English Beat - it is just perfect beach music.  This particular album I have worn out - my tape is 15 years old and I thought I would never get another chance to own one.  If you are into funky reggae style music,  this album is for you.  My favorite tracks to jump to are "French  Toast" and "Get a Job".  "Drowning" and  "Doors of Your Heart" are very smooth and you want to sway to  them, or close your eyes and soak up the rays, mon! Of course there is  "Monkey Murders" which is the only song I remember listening to  on the radio.  Great stuff!
