 For those interested in decision theory, the author does a sterling job of tracing the impacts that different approaches to decision-making, by different parties, has on the development of a complex and unique mixed use  project:      "But like it or not, the power to make these final  decisions rested with the various public bodies overseeing the compliance  with the city's regulations" (p.106)      "It was that an  architectural decision had been made by a political body that appeared to  care little about archictecture..." (p.105)      "Still  undecided, however, was the shape of the atrium. This delay was having  troubling consequences for the entire construction schedule because the  city refused to issue a demolition permit until it saw the final design  drawings..."      "The developers knew they were unhappy with the  atrium but they did not know why" (p.154)      "They bungled it  because they wouldn't do anything without having three decisions"  (p.184)      "The debate over the colour of glass dragged on for  months" (p.202)      "Mancini said he would take the matter under  advisement. He was not ready to make a decision on the spot" (p.209)       "While Johnson applauded group decisions intellectually, he felt  strongly that there was not always a 'right' decision for every  dilemma" (p.229") The book clearly articulates the dialogue  between the different decision-making parties and makes for an interesting  case study.
