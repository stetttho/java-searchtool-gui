 This book is jam packed with detailed analysis and synthesis of almost every facet of the office development process. The editor has assembled a package of 32 excellent contributions from experienced writers with  backgrounds ranging from property appraisal, architecture, contracting,  loan underwriting, and much more than can be listed here. When I first saw  this book in the library I had to go out and get my own copy for continued  reference purposes throughout my career.
