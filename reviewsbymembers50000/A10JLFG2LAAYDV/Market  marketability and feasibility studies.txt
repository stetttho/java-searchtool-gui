 This book so clearly articulates the pivotal role of the triad of market, marketability and feasibility studies in the field of real estate development. While the book does not attempt to be all encompassing, the  text is dense with financial and other risk analysis distilled from the  experience of the authors and contributors.  Although at times it felt  like the shudder of taking an ice cold shower, I finished the book feeling  refreshed and invigorated to tackle the challenges and opportunities of the  risk-reward tradeoff in the development business.
