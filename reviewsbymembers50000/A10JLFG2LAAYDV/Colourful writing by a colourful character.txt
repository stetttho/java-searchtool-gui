 This little book provides a very personal and sometimes colourful account of the chronicles of the rise and fall of Webb & Knapp, with particular emphasis on Zeckendorf's companies role in the early years of urban  redevelopment. Some extracts: - On travelling: "We travelled in high  style in a chaffeur-driven car through France, across Switzerland, and down  to Italy, sampling wines, museums, cathedrals and vistas" (p.25) -  On socializing: "...the Rocky Mountain News gleefully produced a  picture of me a la cowboy and some of the wedding guests al fresco"  (p.130) - On leverage: "I was often in debt, sometimes little more  than two jumps ahead of the sheriff, and forever scrambling for some way to  turn an extra dollar. Whenever I did get a little money ahead, I tried to  put it to work" (p.32) - On ideas: "That night I could hardly  sleep as I chased my own ideas, tied them down with facts and figures,  altered them, made compromises, returned to original notions, and finally  realized I was no dealing with fantasy but with genuine possibility"  (p.66) - On testosterone: "...with our great, masculine building  standing up against the Montreal skyline like a man surrounded by  boys..." (p.195) - On attitude: "We hereby offer to the UN  approximately 17 acres...for any price they wish to pay" (p.69) Many  more interesting accounts. A good read. Enjoy.
