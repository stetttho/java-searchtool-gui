 I believe the author has done an excellent job of articulating the concessions and compromises made by all the parties in the development of a skycraper. To illustrate the delineation of some of the roles, responsibilities and concomitant frustrations, I quote from the  book: "In an earlier world the architect got on with the drawings.  In todays world it's left much more to vendors to produce documents which  the architect checks" (page 242) "We can never work in the  final medium of our art, as painters or sculptors usually do, so it's  frightening to see the final thing come together being crafted by other  hands than your own" (page 299) "The architects were pretty  confident that it wasn't a design fault. The masons were pretty sure that  they had built the wall to specifications...The window manufacturer was  fairly happy with the windows he had fabricated and shipped...for the  mockup. The testing company, which had supervised building the mockup,  seemed confident that all the instructions had been followed...As they all  talked among themselves, rumors spread." (page 202) The interface  between the consultants, trades, vendors, managers and developer makes for  interesting reading with some lessons to be learned.
