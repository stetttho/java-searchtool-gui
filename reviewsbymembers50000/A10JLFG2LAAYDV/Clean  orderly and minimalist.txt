 The book is a little like the architecture -- "The structure draws upon the platonic concept of purity and reduction of information. It is a pair of simple geometric shapes. It allows no multiplicity of readings.  What you see is what you get. It is an identifiable object because there  are two towers." (p.179) What else can I say.
