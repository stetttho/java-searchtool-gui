 This is not a carefully structured text book! The buyer is cautioned that the book appears to have been derived from "very" quick shorthand notes that often lack meaningful detail and beg repeatedly for clarification. Page layout is also poorly structured and is not easy to  read. The author may well be a good practitioner but is not, in my opinion,  a good educator in the written format.
