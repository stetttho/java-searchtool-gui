 Truly an amazing DTS CD.  It is recording in discrete 6.1 channel sound but is compatible with 5.1 channel.  For those with a 6.1 channel DTS discrete system (currently only Denon consumer products), the CD actually starts in the rear center channel.  That is one of the few times the mix is "gimicky".   Compared with many unbalanced DVD-Audio mixes, this DTS CD is truly a treat.  And, unlike most DVD-Audio releases, this artist is still recording. Excellent music, excellent mix.  Couldn't be recommended more.
