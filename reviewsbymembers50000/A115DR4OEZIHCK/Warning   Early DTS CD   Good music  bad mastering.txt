 The "Band on the Run" DTS CD is one of the earliest DTS releases.  It is a 4.0 mix (that's right, no center or LFE channels) based on a quadraphonic mix from the early 70s.  It also sounds like the equalization is for a quad record rather than a DTS CD - extra treble, very little bass.  The DTS CD starts earlier than every DTS decoder can "sync up", so assume you won't hear at least the first two notes of the title track. Obviously the "Band on the Run" music is some of the best and has been critically aclaimed for decades.  Hopefully this will be one of the first multichannel SACDs or DVD-Audio discs released by EMI.  Until then, while seriously flawed, this is the only multichannel version available.
