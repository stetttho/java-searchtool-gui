 As with the DTS CD of "Band on the Run", the DTS CD version of "Venus and Mars" is a very early DTS attempt.  It is presented in 4.0 quadraphonic sound (no center or LFE/SW channels) taken from a mid-70s quadraphonic mix.  Everything that was wrong with the "Band on the Run" DTS CD is multiplied with this release. Unlike the stable mix in "Band on the Run", the "Venus and Mars" DTS CD has instruments flying around all four of the active speakers.  Even the background vocals make trips around all the speakers by the time the "ooohhhss" have finished in "Magneto and Titanium Man".  You can almost get tired listening to all the movement - talk about a band on the run! The equalization is even further off than the "Band on the Run" DTS CD attempt.  Also, the DTS CD's song running order is different than any other version of the "Venus and Mars" album.  It takes a while to get used to tracks running in different orders.  I suspect that the different order had something to do with the original quad record mastering process but should have been reversed for a DTS CD. I guess the different running order makes this CD a collectors item.  However, if you want to listen to "Venus and Mars" music, stick with the regular CD until a newer multichannel SACD or DVD-Audio disc is available (sometime).
