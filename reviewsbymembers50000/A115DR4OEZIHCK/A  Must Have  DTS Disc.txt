 Excellent music, excellently mastered.  This is a 5.1 channel DTS CD.  It is playable on any A/V system that can decode DTS and has a digital line back to a CD or DVD player (even ones that can't play DTS movies). The surround mix has been critisized for having the horns in the rear channels.  However, the mix is consistent in the location of the instruments (no flying trumpets), so I really like the use of the surround channels.  The bass is punchy and well defined. Overall this disc is highly recommanded and I still use it to show up what an A/V system can do (even with DVD-Audio discs available).
