 It took what seemed like forever, but Sony Music has started to release 5.1-channel SACDs.  Billy Joel's "The Stranger" is one of the first.  The multichannel version has catalog number CS 69384.   The disc is presented in 5.1 channel packed DSD sound as well as stereo DSD.  There is no CD layer, so the SACD is only playable in an SACD player.  Multichannel requires a multichannel SACD player such as the Sony SCD-CE775. Unlike early DVD-Audio discs, the mixes and mastering process on this early multichannel SACD are all excellent.  The vocals are extremely clear and the disc is easy to use.  Unlike a DVD-Audio disc, which acts like a glorified DVD-Video disc, a multichannel SACD acts like a CD.  Press 'play' - it plays.  Track skipping is easy.  As a bonus, the name of each track appears on the player's built-in display - no video display required. Standout tracks are "Moving Out" where the vocals are full and extremely clean sounding.  The low bass on "Just the Way you Are" is excellent and warm.  There are no use of instruments that "fly" throughout the channels, just a very good mix. I'm on my fifth play now of this disc.  An excellent start to the world of multichannel SACD.  May there be many more discs like this. Note : Earlier SACD versions of "The Stranger" were stereo-only.
