 Marshall Crenshaw's music has been described as being "too good to play on the radio".  I have to agree.  This is an excellent way to sample his recorded performances throughout the years. Some of the selections are better known ("Someday, Someway") than others ("Crying Time").  However, they are all good.  For Crenshaw fans this collection also offers some of the more rare songs, such as "Somebody Like You" which was originally a B-side (!).   It is also interesting to notice the different sound from each of the albums sampled in this collection.  For example, the songs off "Downtown" sound very warm compared to the earlier songs due to the recording techniques used as outlined in the liner notes. Overall this is an excellent collection of songs throughout a 20 year career.  For all, this collection is highly recommended. For those trying to figure out whether they would like Marshall Crenshaw, if you like the Beatles or newer artists like Matthew Sweet or the Continental Drifters, then you really like Marshall Crenshaw.
