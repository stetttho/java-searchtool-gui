 Alan Parsons (note : No "Project") DTS release of the "On Air" CD was heralded as the first of many releases where the 5.1-channel DTS version would appear at the same time as the regular CD.  That was not to be, but the results are still enjoyable. All the songs on the CD are about flying in one manner or another.  The songs include tributes to hot air balloons, powered flight, Apollo missions to the moon and the Space Shuttle.  The album makes excellent use of the six channels.  At times a little too much use of the six channels. As with mid-60s stereo, much of the sound is mixed completely to one of the 5 main channels.  A little more blending would have helped this DTS CD.  However, it is interesting to hear a vocal pan around a room once or twice.  To be fair, the "gimicky" use of the surround channels only occurs a few times. It isn't hard to believe that the music on this DTS CD was created with 5.1-channel sound in mind.  The music would sound much less "natural" in any stereo format.  While maybe not quite a "must have", it is good enough to recommend for any DTS CD collection.
