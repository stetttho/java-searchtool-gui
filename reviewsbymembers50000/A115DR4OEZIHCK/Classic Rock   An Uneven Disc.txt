 This DVD-Audio disc is a collection of rock music from the EMI/Capitol/Chrysalis collections.  It includes 11 tracks, such as George Thorogood's "Bad to the Bone", J. Geils Band's "Centerfold" and Billy Idol's "Rebel Yell".  5.1 channel mixes are presented in 96kHz 24-bit PPCM, DTS and Dolby Digital.  The 96kHz mix can be automagically mixed-down to stereo on most DVD-Audio players. I wish I could say this is a excellent mix.  Unfortunately, the first three tracks ("Bad to the Bone", "Rebel Yell" and to a lesser extent "Green-Eyed Lady") suffer from a loss of high-end treble and extra LFE/SB.  Compared to Warner Music DVD-Audio discs, the LFE channel levels are extremely high. On the plus side, once track 4 starts, this is a very listenable disc.  The mixes are consistent even though they were done by five engineers.  Surprisingly, the 1960's "Time Won't Let Me" by The Outsiders sounds very good given the source material.  The cheesy organ music sounds like, well, very clean cheesy organ music. The highlights from a mix standpoint may be "Centerfold" and "On the Road Again" by Canned Heat (never thought I'd write that!). The disc has the usual DVD-Audio problems - long time skipping between tracks.  On early DVD-Audio players, you'll see (but thankfully not hear) the Silverline promo before the music.  The Pioneer Elite DV-38A plays the music before any promo and without the need for menu selections (no video required). The disc does contain still photos of the various bands.  These photos will sequence as the music plays.  Quite frankly, I just want to hear the music and don't really care about the "video extras". In any event, if the first three tracks were mixed properly, this would be a five.  With the lousy mixes included, particularly "Bad to the Bone", it's really a three and a half - closer to a four.  Let's hope they did better on the recently released "Inside the Music : New Wave".
