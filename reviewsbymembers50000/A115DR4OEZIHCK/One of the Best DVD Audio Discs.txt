 Steely Dan's "Two Against Nature" DVD-Audio disc is tastefully mixed in 5.1 channels with excellent use of the surround channels.  The surrounds are mostly used to expand the listening space but also are occasionally used for discrete sounds, such as glistening chimes. The music is pure "Steely Dan".  An excellent return to the present for the duo (and band). A couple of items are unusual for Warner discs.  First, the disc contains a DTS track for playing on a DVD-Video player.  The larger jewel case is also used.  There is also no explanation of the video content in the booklet.  But for those of us who just want to hear music, that is a blessing. Overall, one of the better DVD-Audio discs that have been released.  It is also one of the few DVD-Audio discs released where the artist/group has had any new material in the last 20 years (unfortuantely). One warning - some DVD-Audio players require the use of a video monitor to enter menu items before this disc will play.  These older players also play the record company's logo (commercial) prior to the music.  Newer players, such as the Pioneer DV-38A do *not* require the use of a video monitor - just hit 'play' and the music starts (no commercial until the end of the disc).
