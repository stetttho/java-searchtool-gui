 This is so close to a perfect DVD-Audio disc from Warner Music that it is disappointing it isn't.  The tracks have been meticulous remastered and the sound is sharp and "new".  "Riders on the Storm" has the storm in all the channels and is extremely effective.  I played it in a local home theater store that had overhead rear speakers and that was very interesting. The one track that still needs work is "Love Her Madly".  The drum solos fly around all the channels per beat.  An interesting effect but somewhat annoying after a while.  But, the real disappointing part is the LFE (the .1 low bass channel).  The LFE level on "Love Her Madly" is almost non-existent on the DVD-Audio version but powerful on the Dobly Digital version.  Unfortunately, this means the Dolby Digital version sounds better than the DVD-Audio version of "Love Her Madly".  I find it hard to believe that this was intended. So, with the exception of the one track, the disc is excellent.  Too bad Warner Music can't fix that problem and make this a fully enjoyable disc.
