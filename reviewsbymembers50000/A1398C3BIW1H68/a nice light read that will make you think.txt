 This is certainly not the greatest management book ever written. It pales compared to stuff like "Good to Great" or even "Peopleware". Nothing is supported by data, and some of the stuff especially toward the back you've already heard a dozen times before. But it makes a fun, quick, read, and it will make you think. Check it out. It's worth investing a few hours of reading.
