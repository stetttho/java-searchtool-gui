 If you want to understand how things work at the data link and networking layers (layers 2 and 3) then this is the book for you. The author makes very clear the differences between bridges, routers, and switches - something that the marketing literature does not make clear :). She has a very readable and detailed descriptions of the most important protocols used in layer 2, especially the spanning tree algorithm used by bridges - as you might expect since she invented the algorithm! The descriptions of layer 3 protocols are also good, though not quite as readable. The book contains a good mix of introductory concept oriented discussions and technical details. The author explains the technical, commercial, historical, and political ideas that lead to different protocols - adding context and colour with her own well thought out opinions. You can also find details at the level of packet layout information for many protocols. Really good stuff.
