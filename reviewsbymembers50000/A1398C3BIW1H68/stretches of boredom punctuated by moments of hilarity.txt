 Most of the book is about the author's journey from what he calls a "dilettante" (Pulp Fiction's Vince would have said "bum") to dot-com corporate drone wanna-be and back. It's generally bland, though the few funny bits are laugh out loud funny. I especially liked the 5th letter to Jeff ("Accident") and the description of the Pets.com business plan at the end of "Fiscal Wonderland". If you want to save a little time and money, read these two sections in a bookstore and you'll get the best of it.
