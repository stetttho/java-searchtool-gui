 I strongly recommend this book to anyone who is a C++ expert. Someone at work recommended the book to me, and it took me a while to get to it,  thinking it would be just another book of familiar C++ ideas and idioms.  Nope, far from it, this book is thought provoking, challenging, and  enlightening. It is organized as a series of challenging C++ questions. I  consider myself pretty expert in C++, but I don't think there was a single  question where I completely nailed the answer. Check it out!
