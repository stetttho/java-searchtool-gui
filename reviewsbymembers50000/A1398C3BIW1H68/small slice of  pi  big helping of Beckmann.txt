 This book is more of a chance for Petr Beckmann to give his personal opinions on historical regimes and figures than an exposition of the history of pi. That's not all bad - much of what he has to say is interesting and on target. I really enjoyed his skewering of Aristotle, the Romans, and the Spanish; as well as the homage to his heroes Archimedes, Newton, and Euler. But go in with your eyes open: pi is a sideline, not the main event. The book also comes across as quite dated in two respects: First, Beckmann has a hard time writing more than a few pages without vehemently slamming the Soviet regime. Unfortunately, these diatribes border on McCarthyism. Second, the section on computer computation of pi is decades out of date. I found the math somewhat terse and not particularly well explained. Some of the derivations were quite difficult to follow. All in all, this is an interesting book, but not for anything to do with pi!
