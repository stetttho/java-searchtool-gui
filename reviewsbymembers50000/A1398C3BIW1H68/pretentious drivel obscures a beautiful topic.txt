 This book has good potential - explain in a non-technical way the fundamental theorem of calculus, why it is important, and the history of it's development. The mathematicians who discovered and refined calculus are a fascinating lot, and the mathematics itself has proven to be perhaps the most effective engineering tool yet discovered. Sounds like good stuff. Unfortunately, Berlinski choose to shroud this simple theme in page after page of self-important, over-written, pretentious drivel. One of the reviews on the jacket puts this book in the same category as Godel, Escher, Bach - holy smokes! Nothing could be further from the truth. Buy GEB, stay away from this book! I give him 2 stars instead of one because the material underlying the terrible writing is interesting and worth knowing. Hopefully someone will write a readable book on this material!
