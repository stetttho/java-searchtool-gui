 The secret to enjoying this book is to take it for what it is: a quick, entertaining read to introduce the ideas and history surrounding the revelation that mass and energy are different manifestations of the same basic stuff. If you are looking for any kind of depth, or complete scientific accuracy, or full historical colour, then you are going to be disappointed. On the other hand, if you start with the idea that this book is a sketch, not a painting, then you'll have a fun few hours cruising through it.
