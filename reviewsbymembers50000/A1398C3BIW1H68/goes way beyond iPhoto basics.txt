 This is a must have for any digital photographer planning to use iPhoto. Many books of this sort aren't much more than an explanded version of what should be in the program's help files. This book goes way beyond. One of the co-authors is a professional photographer; the first quarter of the book is his well written explanation of the essentials of composition and (digital) photography. The bulk of the book describes not just how you can use iPhoto, but how you ought to use it and why. I found the advice provided practical and non obvious; it has made me much more productive in my use of this software. As well, the authors provide pointers to some downloadable plug ins that make iPhoto much more useful - I can't imagine going without the iPhoto library manager and the betterhtml plug in. The only downside of the book is that it will be much less useful in a year or two after Apple has updated their product - but in the meantime, but it, use it, and enjoy it.
