 I bought this book first, and then later bought a copy of a competitor book: David Pogue and company's "IPhoto, The Missing Manual". There's no comparison. This book will teach you the mechanics of how to use iPhoto, but not much more than that. The Missing Manual goes much deeper, telling you how iPhoto works and techniques for using it effectively. My quickstart guide is now collecting dust while I refer to the missing manual frequently.
