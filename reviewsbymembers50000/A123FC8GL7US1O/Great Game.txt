 Yu-Gi-Oh: Dungeon Dice Monsters is the 2nd YuGiOh game for the GameBoy Advance(GBA). It is different than the regular YuGiOh card games, but its still fun.  In Dice Monsters, you battle various opponents in tournaments and free duels using dice. Dice can be monsters or items. 15 dice are used for each battle.  The rules are pretty simple to learn. You choose 3 dice and roll them. If 2 or 3 of them match up with the same number of summon stars, you summon a monter and "dimension"(place) it on the field. Each dice has 6 sides, so even if you don't summon, you can still get attack crests or other ones to use later on.  Each monster is a certain type, and has 1 type that its strong against and 1 type its weak against. Very simple to remember, since there is only a few types of monsters in the game.  Your goal is to attack the "Die Master" of your opponent, and kill its 3 heart points. To do this, you must summon monsters and build a path to it.  There is over 100 dice in the game, and about 100 opponents in all in the game!  Opponents are fought in tournaments first, then once you beat them, they are in free duel. In free duel, you can battle them as much as you want. Each win, earns you 1 dice. You can buy or sell dice from Grandpa at the shop at anytime. Once you beat more tournaments, you will unlock more dice to buy at the shop, and even more tournaments will appear.  Alot of replay in the game, very fun for YuGiOh fans and non-YuGiOh fans also. Simple rules and pretty fast most of the time. Only downfall is some duels can last a while, the dice rolls are random and it sometimes can take a while to summon the right monsters.
