 this movie is about an offbeat guy who turns a deadbeet TV station into a raging success. broadcasting Wierd Al's hilarious brand of humor.  George Newman is a daydreamer who's hyperactive imagination keeps him from holding a steady job..... Untill his uncle hires him to manage channel 62, a station that's losing money(and viewers) fast. But when George replaces the stations re-runs with bizzare programs like "Wheel of fish" and "Rauls Wild Kingdom" (Where Poodle fly from three story windows). Ratings begin to soar. can george find the money he needs to keep this awesome TV station? This was one of the funniest movies ever, and with weird al, it makes it even mor funny, with his immitations of Indiana Jones and Rambo.
