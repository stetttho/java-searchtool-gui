 This is a very cool item i have to admit, but i already have a regular game boy advance. me, personally am not going to buy it, cuz i have an advance already, why spend 100 for just a cooler look, i don't mind the regular advance. i say wait untill the price drops to buy. P.S. go 2 freewebs.com/troys_cool_site
