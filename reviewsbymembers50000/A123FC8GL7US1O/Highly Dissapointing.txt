 This movie was not all that wonderfull, it is about five billion times woorse than the previews amke it out to be, and also the plot takes einstein to understand-for example, what was up with the Hulk's dad (toward the end of the movie) turning into a giant bubble and then blowing up, and also why did the hulk's girlfriend's dad try to kill him with the weird giant dogs? those are only two of the many very difficult to understand parts of this lame movie. I saw Spiderman and X-Men 2 and other Marvel movies, and those were pretty good, but this one is a discrace to the marvel name, so all of the people that were going to buy this twisted movie, you might want to think twice before you buy, get any other movie by marvel and i assure you that it will be better than the Discracefull "Hulk"
