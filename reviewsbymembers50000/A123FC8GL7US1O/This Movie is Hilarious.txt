 From the snowy mountains of mammoth to the insane surf of the baja peninsula get ready for an extreme action movie like no other.      After graduating from Junior Colledge four life-long friends, Will, Brian, Corey and Matt decide to embark on one last road trip adventure. With only a couple hundred bucks beetween em', they pack up and set off on a journey to surf, skate, and snowboard the west coast. Not far into the journey the trip takes a turn when the travelers happen to come upon a beautifull damsel in distress, Jessie. They offer Jessie a ride and together they hit the road.      The California coastline will never look the same as these hardcore friends plunge powder, ride glassy barrels and get down and dirty with motocross in a free wheeling road trip like you've never seen before. I really think you will find this action and comedy packed movie to your liking.
