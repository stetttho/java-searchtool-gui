 This DVD will bring you closer to P.O.D. than ever before... From thier humble beginnings in Chula, CA garage, to the years in a van bringing the warrior movement to kids accross the country, to their global multi-platinum success and sold out tours around the world. This DVD also features never before seen footage shot by the road crewduring the 2002 youth of the nation tour, as well as over 200 pictures from the bands personal collections. Also has 10 or so Music Video's that are very cool. Plus the awesome P.O.D. documentary. I think that whoever buys this DVD will like it a lot.
