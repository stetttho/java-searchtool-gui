 This is the worst movie of all time, well, i say that about pretty much every Disney movie(Exept Pirates of the Carribean).Hillary should stick to doing... ummmm...well... what does she do good at? Well i can tell you that it is not acting or singing for SURE. I only watch this movie when i want to fall asleep, but i stopped because it kkept giving me horrible nightmares. This movie was just a huge, crappy publicity ad for Duff. And i'lll guess she is gunna be the next Britney spears, I'll give her 2 years untill she starts swearing and wearing skimpy Clothes. So basicly we have all had enough of Hiliry Duff.
