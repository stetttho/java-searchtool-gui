 From M. Night Shyamalan, the writer/directer of "The Sixth Sense" and "Unbreakable, comes the story of the Hess family in Bucks Country, Pensyvania, who wake up one morning to find a five hundred-foot crop circle in their backyard. Graham Hayes (Played by Mel Gibson) and his family are told that extraterrestrials are responsible for the crop circle in their field. They watch, with growing dread, the news of crop circles being found all over the world. Signs is the emotianal story of one family on the farm as they encounter the terrifying last moments of life as the world is being invaded. It is easy for a film maker to blow up the world, but Shyamalan does it much riskier. He tries to blow our minds up with this amazing movie that i think you will all enjoy very much.
