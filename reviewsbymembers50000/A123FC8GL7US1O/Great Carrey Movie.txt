 "Bruce Almighty" is the divine intervention Jim Carrey's career has needed ever since the disastrously treacly "The Majestic."  Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, WKBW-TV's go-to guy when there's a breaking story about Buffalo's largest cookie. However, like Joel McCrea in "Sullivan's Travels," he doesn't see any value in merely getting people's mind off their troubles for a while. He aspires to the anchor job which, instead, goes to his rival, Evan Baxter ("The Daily Show's" irrepressible Steve Carell).  Nothing is going right in Bruce's life, from his job to traffic jams. So he gives God a piece of his mind and God (Morgan Freeman . . . who else?) gives him the chance to do a better job. Bruce is made God-for-the-week, while the Almighty takes a vacation. When Bruce protests that God never takes vacations, the Lord winks, "Ever heard of the Dark Ages?"   Carrey is utterly delightful, whether pulling off some hilarious pratfall or energizing the most mundane piece of dialogue. The casting of Freeman -- the actor most likely to be voted to play God by everyone who makes movies or watches them -- doesn't hurt either. He and Carrey are criminally funny together, playing off each other like a classic vaudeville team.  There's some trouble near the finale when the picture doesn't know how to end itself, but that's quickly righted. Otherwise, "Bruce Almighty" is the feel-good movie by which all this year's other feel-good movies will be measured.
