 This movie was very funny i have to admit, but i think the acting was about as bad as the lunch lady's gooolash crap. The story-line was ok, not too bad, but they could have done a better job. The graphics/visuals were sooo fake, for example, at the end where the alien-type thing comes out of the guys stomach was about as fake as those "Hulk Hands". The only thing that was good about this movie was the mocking of star-wars and all of the funny jokes. But they could have done a way better job on the acting, and of course the visuals/graphics, but it was made in the 80's, so it's understandable.
