 I think that this starter deck is a very good deck for more addvanced dualists, but it is way too complicated for yugioh begginers. This is my favorite deck out of the four. I reccament that if you are just starting to get the Yugi Starter deck, then, after you can understand the game a lot more, then i would get Pegesus' deck. The three holographics that come in this deck are Relinquished, Gracefull Charity, and Gryphin Wing. I really think that every one who buys this starter deck will like it very, very much. here is a list of all the cards that come in Pegesus's deck: Relinquished Red Archery Girl Ryu-Ran Illusionist Faceless Mage Rogue Doll Uraby Giant Soldier of Stone Aqua Madoor Toon Alligator Hane-Hane Sonic Bird Jigen Bakudan Mask of Darkness Witch of the Black Forest Man-Eater Bug Muka Muka Dream Clown Armed Ninja Hiro's Shadow Scout Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon Toon Summoned Skull Manga Ryu-Ran Toon Mermaid Toon World Black Pendant Dark Hole Dian Keto the Cure Master Fissure De-Spell Change of Heart Stop Defense Mystical Space Typhoon Rush Recklessly Remove Trap Monster Reborn Soul Release Yami Black Illusion Ritual Ring of Magnetism Graceful Charity Trap Hole Reinforcements Castle Walls Waboku Seven Tools of the Bandit Ultimate Offering Robbin' Goblin Magic Jammer Enchanted Javelin Gryphon Wing
