 This game station is definately the best video game counsel out there, first of all it has the best games, way better that gamecube(Gamecube only has little kid rated e mario games that suck), and it is also better than xbox i think, because i would say that the games are equal (in the xbox and ps2) but the xbox is way too big and hard to move it around like if you are going to go on a vacation, also the controllers(PS2) are a lot easier to use than the big, bulky controllers of the xbox, plus i am used to the controllers of the playstation two because they are the same as the regular playstation.
