 This game looks so kool. the first one was a huge hit, and the expansion packs made it way, way better, i like superstar the best. this looks so kool, i hear you can have like 4 floors and stuff. This looks like it will be 5 times better than the regular 1rst sims.you would think," How much better can they get?" well i am guessing that we will be suprised. i also hope that they work on graphics and sounds. i can't wait any longer till' this comes out. I heard a rumor that there is going to be a crapload of expansions for the second sims, although, i really can't think of much they could do, they have covered a lot. Besides School, and...... well, that is all i can think of. I guess we will have to just wait and see how electronic arts will suprise or please us next.
