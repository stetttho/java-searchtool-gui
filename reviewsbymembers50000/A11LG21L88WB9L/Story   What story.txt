 I gave the book two stars because I did actually finish the book but that says more about my desperation for something to read than the "interest holding power" of this Nora "Light" book.  Definitely an early work, it is the first time I found absolutely nothing to like about her hero.  And how can you like a heroine who would fall in love with someone who does nothing but snap, snarl, and bite at her?
