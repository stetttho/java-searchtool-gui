 I love LKH and will definitely be buying her next Anita novel. But I bought THIS book expecting to get a short story about my favorite characters. A short story has a beginning, a middle, and an END. Nowhere on this book does it say one word about her offering being an excerpt from the upcoming Incubus Dreams. Her story is called "Blood Upon My Lips" and is presented in a short story anthology, but it isn't a short story at all. I think that is a gross misrepresentation and dirty pool on Ms. Hamilton's part. If she wanted to advertise for her newest novel that's fine, but we should have been able to make an informed choice before spending eight bucks. Instead we are just left hanging and got as little satisfaction from our encounter with Anita, Nathaniel, and Damian as they did.    Hopefully, the other stories will make up for being rooked by LKH. I haven't read them yet because I was so mad after reading her story I pitched the book over the back of the couch.
