 Usually their books are roller coaster rides but this one is just, oh how I hate to say this, but it's just a little boring.  All of the usual suspects are on board but they don't interact with each other, they are all off on their own little tangents.  I would have enjoyed the book more if they'd all been allowed to conspire together to help Pendergast.  Instead each is not telling the other about the problem to try to protect each other.  Ho hum.  Pendergast is confounded here by his almost too worthy of a foe brother.  Diogenes is clearly Pendergast's superior.  After seeing him in action I doubt Pendergast's ability to defeat him.  I'm certain he will accomplish that in some future book, how convincing the authors can be in bringing that about we'll just have to see.  And even though this book was a bit of a drudge to get through I am still eager for the next installment.
