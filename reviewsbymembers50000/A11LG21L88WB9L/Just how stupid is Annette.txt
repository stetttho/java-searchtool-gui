 Apparently so stupid that she ignores her own health care to the point of tragedy.  Up to that point I had a bit of sympathy for her but she has no one to blame but herself for what she does to her baby.  I had no sympathy for her from this point on at all.  I can't believe I read the whole dismal book, something in common with those train wrecks you can't quite turn away from.  But there wasn't one person in the book that was even likeable much less admirable.  If this is the European Sensibility you can have it.
