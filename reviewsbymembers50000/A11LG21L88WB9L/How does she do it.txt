   I've read a lot of series fiction and I have never seen one just continue to go from strength to strength like the In Death series. J. D. Robb/Nora Roberts is truly something else as a creative mind and a writer who can turn them out yet keep them fresh as spring daisies.   The dialog in her books is first rate. I actually find myself smiling, laughing out loud and yes, wiping away a tear when reading this author. This isn't just mindless page turning, she pulls you into this world and makes you love these characters as much as she obviously does. Roarke and Dallas have one of the strongest love stories, truly the REAL THING, yet it doesn't get cloying or yucky, just moving and real right down to the bare bones. I think Roberts is a genius, a rare one indeed.  And if you want a real treat, try one of the audiobooks. Susan Ericksen brings these characters alive, giving each an authentic voice with a genius of her own. Sure she has great material to work with, but she is remarkable in her talent for voices and character.
