 If you liked the first Guardian novel then you should like this one too since they are the same book.  Aisling is delivering an object, someone tries to steal it, twice.  People start getting dead, she is blamed, and must be the one to solve the crimes, OR ELSE!  She's NOT the dragon's mate but does him a few times anyway....wait, which book AM I reading?  The mystery here is why I have read two of these dreadful books. Thank God for libraries so I'm just wasting time and not my money.  Aisling is still irritating, immature, and an idiot waiting to make a mess happen.  I have no idea why Drake wants her, there isn't a single bit of honest dialog between them that would indicate a growing understanding of each other.  They just have this inexplicable desire to have firey sex since she was MADE JUST FOR HIM.  Otherwise I have no doubt he would give her the boot since she is entirely more trouble than she's worth.  And then there is Drake's big "betrayal."   Just a plot device to leave the lovers in a cliffhanger for the next book.
