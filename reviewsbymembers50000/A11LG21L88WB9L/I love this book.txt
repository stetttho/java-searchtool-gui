 I checked this book out of my library twice then decided I wanted to have my own copy.  I don't know many of the stars in the book but still found their knitting stories warming as they captured the essence of what knitting means to those addicted to it.  And though the patterns are simple it shows what amazing beauty can easily be created with the wonderful yarns we have today.  While I wouldn't have paid $25.00 for it, I find I can't resist it at Amazon's half price offering.  I'm gathering up all kinds of different yarn at the moment to make Daryl Hannah's beautiful scarf.  Mine will be black and whites.  And then I want to make Nora's scarf.  Then that quirky pink and red one by Bridget.  Using the pocket as a hat?  My daughter will love it!  I already have just the right yarn to make Julianna's......I love so many of the patterns I will definitely be getting my money's worth.  The stitches are the easiest ones in knitting but the way the colors and yarn combinations are arranged adds all the style and creativity you could ask for.   Yes, the patterns are definitely beginner fare but there is a beautiful spirit in this book and that's also what I am buying.
