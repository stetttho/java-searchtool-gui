 I cannot even believe this book got published but clearly there is an audience for it.  I don't see it.  Speaking of "it?"  That was one of the most ridiculous things she did in the book.  There is a demon named Jim in the book, ok?  This demon appears in the form of a large, black, male, Newfoundland.  Which is a dog.  But she refers to this dog as "it."  Giving us such pearls of grammar as this:  "Jim's eyes almost bugged out of it's head."  Or this:  "Jim flung itself on him."  Over and over she constructs sentences so that she can flaunt what she obviously thinks it a cute plot device but instead it's just irritating.  However, the dog is about the only interesting character in the book.  Except she threatens to castrate him every, excuse me, castrate "it" every twenty seconds and that gets even older than the misused "it."  And then there is Aisling.  I guess she is supposed to be a lovable madcap along the lines of Lucille Ball.  Messes up everything she touches but you just gotta love her anyway.  But there is nothing lovable about Aisling.  She just comes off as stupid and clueless.  And romance?  Well, she clobbers the hero in the nose, giving him a nosebleed, and that causes such instant lust in the both of them that they go into the next room and have at it against the wall.  While a club full of people listen in the near vicinity.  Be still my beating heart.   The book tries so hard to be clever that it's as embarrassing as the girl who tries too hard to be liked by everyone.  Why I read the whole thing I have no idea.  I guess I thought something in the book had to be best seller worthy and I didn't want to miss it.  I must have missed it.
