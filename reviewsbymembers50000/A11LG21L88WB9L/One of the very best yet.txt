 I am amazed that this series is still going strong after so many entrees.  What a testament to Ms. Robb's creativity.  And this one is truly one of the best.  I can't give away too much but I have to say that I was so afraid during the middle of the book that  hardass Eve would make the wrong decision about how the case should end up.  But she didn't and I find it so great that she could do the right thing for all involved.  The book really makes you do a lot of thinking about the ethics involved in being the "best you can be."  I did have a few moments of cringe in how  badly Eve treated Mira.  I didn't think Mira deserved that kind of disrespect but that's our Eve.  Rough Edges R Us.  I do expect the love of Roarke, Peabody, Mira, Nadine and crew, woops, forgot the wonderful Mavis! to eventually soften Eve up and allow her to be more giving and loving to those who love her, I guess it wouldn't be realistic if it happened too quickly.  Afterall, she and Roarke have only been married for a little over a year.  And at least she is now telling Roarke freely that she loves him and missed him while he was gone.  This is a big deal for our cop!    But it wouldn't kill her to relax and enjoy a good massage, facial, and girly night once in a while.  She has to keep up with the gorgeous Roarke.  Enough with the whinging about female upkeep!  And Mavis is STILL pregant!  This pregnancy is running soap opera length!
