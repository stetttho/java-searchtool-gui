 I'm terrified it may be so because his latest offering is well written but oh so boring. Sandford's an excellent writer so that aspect of his story telling is never in question but Lucas is phoning it in on this one. Will he listen to Weather and start building Big New Houses? I sure hope not. Nor do I really want Sandford to get rid of Lucas' new family happiness so he can have "edge" again. (However, wouldn't some rolling around in the sheets between Lucas and the horny Russian have been lovely? Lucas could have made her so happy if he was still single, dangit.) I don't think I could like him if he was out cheating on his new wife and baby son, but something has to be done. Lucas is way too young to be put out to pasture. Here's hoping that Mr. Sandford can regain enthusiasm in him and for him. The Porsche driving Davenport is one of the Greats. Too many TV shows have died off after the main character gets married. Hoping this isn't Davenport's fate. Who really likes Weather anyway?    By the way, the best scenes in the whole book are Weather driving through the garage door and the cat fight in the restaurant. Hilarious.
