 I agree with other reviewers that this well is dry and the family is no longer interesting.  But that disappointment is mild compared to the disgust I felt that she used the Twin Towers tragedy to plump up her character's adventures.  First time I'd seen our national tradedy experienced by fictional characters and it is in very poor taste and so lacking in sensitivity that I won't read her again.
