 Preston and Child's earlier books are such hard acts to follow.  BRIMSTONE is a good read but not quite as good as their earlier work.  It just rather drug along for me at times but as always it is a joy to see our favorite sleuths off on new adventures.  I always learn something new and interesting in a P & C book and this one is no exception.  Their use of language is always fresh and rich as chocolate.  Can't wait to see the next one, Happy Writing Gentlemen!
