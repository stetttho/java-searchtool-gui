 But I just couldn't like either one of the main characters.  I loved the concept, it should have been a great story but the dialogue was lackluster and each of their encounters generated no sizzle for me.  They had no discernible chemistry that I could see.  The female just gets herded along without asking any questions about what he wants with her.  Then she betrays him?  He might have understood but I sure didn't!!  Maybe the next one will be more interesting.
