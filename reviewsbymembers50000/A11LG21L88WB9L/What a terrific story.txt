 I just made my way through all the Prey novels and enjoyed them so much that I went back to his early Kidd novels too.  These are such wonderful characters I can only hope that there will now be just as many Kidd adventures as Davenport's.  This one will go on my keeper shelf.  Sure, much has changed in the computer world now but it doesn't interfere with the story at all.  I can't wait to work my way to the Hangman now!  More Kidd and LuEllen please!!
