 I always enjoy Ms. Rice's books but this one disturbed me.  I don't think it was necessary for her character to disappear like that.  If she wanted to leave her husband she could have left a note that she felt endangered and was disappearing, some kind of note to keep the police from wasting years of manpower looking for her.  She would have been just as safe, maybe even safer without her picture being all over the news and papers.  It was no small thing to me that the detective, Patrick, had his marriage ruined because of his obsession with Mara's disappearance.  All that could have been avoided, but it seems Mara didn't care what the fate was of those left behind, just as long as she and her baby were safe.  It rather ruined the book for me.
