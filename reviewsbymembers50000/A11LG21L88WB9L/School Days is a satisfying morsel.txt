 While not the most convoluted of Spenser adventures this book is clean, sparse, and refreshingly Spenser through and through.  I didn't mind the exclusion of some of my favorite characters when Spenser shines like he does in this outing.  Spenser at his wisecracking best digging away like Pearl with a bone, impervious to all obstacles when he's on the case.  And what a case.  No shining happy ending here, but a satisfying conclusion nonetheless.  Poor, poor Jared.  I don't understand why so many reviewers were glad Susan was gone for the entire book.  She's not my favorite character but I certainly don't wish her gone.  Spenser's mature certainty that she is the one for him and not ashamed to announce it to all and everyone is one of the things I admire most about him.  I loved it when Mrs. Ellsworth asked if he would put her grandson's interests above all else and Spenser unashamedly replied that he put Susan Silverman's interests above all else.  Ahhhh.  My hero.  What a guy.
