 I really had a difficult time with the first half of this book.  The "hero" was so hateful and treated her so bad that even though I knew the romance was coming I had a really hard time accepting him.  The things he said and did to her were too over the line for me to backtrack to sweet nothings later.  Actually there weren't any sweet nothings.  He was a jerk to the very end.  It is a testament to Ms. Robards writing style that I kept reading this book even though I found the hero not living up to that title at any point.  I guess some women love that kind of rough and angry man but he didn't give me shivers at all.  And I really had a difficult time with him calling her a b*tch every time she dared to try to escape from the very probable rape and murder he threatened her with constantly.  The very nerve of the heroine for trying to protect herself.  I like this book even less the more I think about it.    I'm still giving it two stars because I did manage to finish it and I really did like the secondary character "Tunafish."
