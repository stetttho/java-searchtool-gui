 Maybe it's not such a good idea to have the author read her own book aloud.  Ms. Reichl is a much more talented writer than reader.  I found her delivery so nasal and monotone and gasp--Boring! that I didn't even finish the first disk.  Now I shall go in search of the book to read myself as it does promise to be interesting.  Just not read aloud by the author please.
