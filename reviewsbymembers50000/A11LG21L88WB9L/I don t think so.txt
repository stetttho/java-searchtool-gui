 Give me a break. I like Mr. Child's Reacher so I'm willing to suspend quite a bit of disbelief to get a good read. But the idea of the FBI threatening to let some mob person beat up your girlfriend if you don't serve them and then keeping you in a locked room while you're helping them? Hello Mr. Attorney General? Hello CNN? I don't think that's going to be happening in America. Not to mention them standing around watching as Reacher beat up a couple of hoods while under surveillance. I'm sure that broke a few laws too. Pull the other leg please.      And then we have the MO. Please. I doubt that scenario could be pulled off once much less four times. And I have no doubt whatsoever that it couldn't be accomplished without the victim thrashing around and getting paint on the floor. Certainly wouldn't be a quite, peaceful death.      And if Jack doesn't start changing his clothes and practicing some better hygiene all his women are going to be singing is Hit the Road, Jack.......  OK, I'll have to say that even with one preposterous thing after another I still read every word.  Mr. Child is a talented writer and I look forward to continuing improvement as he puts Jack through his paces.  Maybe I should have given this one three stars afterall.
