 I would usually give her books a five star rating but this book I should really give only two because of the abrupt ending, but I'm giving three because this is Berg.  Even writing a book I find to be deeply flawed, her rich voice and prose pushes that rating on up there despite so many questions left hanging.  The biggest one?  That the old woman looks at her hand and gives the spooky pronoucement:  He's coming.  Who came?  No one that I can see, surely she's not talking about the few abortive dates with Tom.  Then there is the mystery of why her new friend Matthew will allow his girlfriend to be so rude in throwing Betta out of the room she's rented.  This is Betta's friend?  That was extremely annoying and then we never find out what came of their little plot to make the girlfriend jealous.  Hmmmm.  I guess Ms. Berg was showing us how erratic widowhood makes a woman but so many actions by Betta are inexplicable.  The worst being the screeching she did at her friend Lorraine after she simply does what Betta asks her to do.  I did enjoy the book despite the lack of reality of many events, but the ending was rushed and way too abrupt.  Perhaps because there will be a sequel?  I would love to learn more about her three old/new friends. (I chose to overlook the implausibility of their coming running after 30 years of silence from Betta.)  The store sounds like such a wonderful place and I wanted to hear more about all the merchandise.  But the ending has Betta spinning into a bunch of erratic behavior then the book is over just like that.  Very unsatisfying unless there is a sequel.
