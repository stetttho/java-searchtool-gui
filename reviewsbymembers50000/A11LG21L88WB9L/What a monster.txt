 Am I talking about the boss?  NO!  Though her exploits were laughably over the top it's ANDREA that really shocked and appalled me.  Why did she think it fine to rip off the company for personal expenses?  Why did she think it was cute to tip a hundred dollar meal into the trash and throw away china, silver, and accessories away as well?  Why did she feel obliged to wipe greasy hands all over her boss's expensive clothes?  All of these petty little acts just turned my stomach.  She was the real monster of the book as far as I'm concerned.  If she hated her job and those around her so much she should have quit.  I found nothing admirable about her or her high horse.
