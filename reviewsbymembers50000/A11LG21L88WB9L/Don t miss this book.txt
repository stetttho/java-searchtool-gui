 What a wonderful voice this writer has.  Ms. Moriarty goes on my list of "read anything by this author immediately."  She's fresh, she's witty, and her characters are so well drawn that I could picture them perfectly.  With her gift for description I could share Lyn's stress, Gemma's confusion, and Cat's pain.  I truly felt their emotions, it's a rare writer that can touch you so deeply.    I especially loved the clever little "asides" where strangers describe a moment where the triplets impacted on their own lives and made a cherished memory.  I won't forget these wonderful women either.  Thank you Ms. Moriarty for such an incredibly well written book!  I can't wait to read your next one.  Well Done!!!
