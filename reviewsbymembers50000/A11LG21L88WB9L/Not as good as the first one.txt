 I thoroughly enjoyed her first book but this second one left me cold.  150 pages in and I still didn't really know what the plot was.  Too many characters (Did we really need Beanie and her fecal artwork?) and too much wandering around with scenes that didn't build up to anything at all.  It was as if the author couldn't decide who or what the book was supposed to be about so she just hopped around hoping something interesting would come out of the mix.  It didn't.    I finally got so bored that I turned to the end just to see where it all settled, something I NEVER do.  I usually have to read every word of a book, but that would have just been more torture than even the Brethren can dole out.    I like her ideas so I'm still hoping for more from the third installment.
