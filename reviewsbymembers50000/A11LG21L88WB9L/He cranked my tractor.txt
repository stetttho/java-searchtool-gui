 When I read that line I knew it was going to be downhill all the way.  Is this really Linda Howard?  If it is, it reads like an early manuscript that got rejected three dozen times and now that she's famous, oh, what the heck, let's publish it too.  I couldn't even LIKE the heroine and the supposed hero never added up to much either.  I kept reading because of my faith in Ms. Howard's ability to tell a story but sadly, this time my faith was not rewarded.    He cranked my tractor?  Yes, that line is really in the book. Enough said.
