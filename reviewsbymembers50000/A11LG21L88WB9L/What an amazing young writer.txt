 This book is an exquisite, rare treat.  Her writing is described as lyrical and that word barely does her justice.  I've read all of her books and they just keep getting better.  She has the ability to touch you way down deep, primally deep, until you find yourself sobbing out loud.  Long after the book is finished I find myself thinking of her characters and pondering her themes.  I will be eagerly following the career of this talented artist.
