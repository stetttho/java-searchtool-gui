 I've so enjoyed each of the "Slightly" books and love all the Bedwyn's so much-- but reserved the most special place for the cold and austere Duke of Bewcastle. His story was well worth the wait.  It was so good to see him paired with such a warm and generous woman, perfectly designed to bring out the boy in Bewcastle.  It's a wonderful story and watching Wulfric thaw out slowly as he woos her was such a treat.  Well done Wulfric and Mary B!
