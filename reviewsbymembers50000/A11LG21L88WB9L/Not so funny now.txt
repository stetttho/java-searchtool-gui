 I didn't realize that this book was a big lie.  I found it interesting until I began to look up each "artist" on the internet wanting more information about their "art."  Hmmmmm, not one person is to be found anywhere painting anything.  I no longer think the book interesting or funny, I just feel ripped off and mocked for my interest.
