 After reading several sections from a friend's copy, I know for a fact that this is the book on finances I've been waiting for.  If you have trouble focusing and end up drifting into space before making it through a sentance in any book- let alone one about dreary finances- I think you'll be wanting your own copy of this title as well.  As if she had the ADD personality in mind, Susie is direct and to the point without being crass.  The book is also highlighted with coloring which is another ADD friendly technique, along with short summeries to sum up the already to the point chapters.  She also gives very simplistic examples behind her reasonings to make sure even the most clueless college co-ed or financing novice can understand it, but she breaks things down in a way that doesn't make you feel like a dumb-ass for not understanding it earlier.  The PERFECT gift for a highschool graduate who's about to embark on to the world of college loans and credit! And great for anyone who wishes there was such a thing as financing 101 in H.S. or College.  Highly Recommended.
