 I don't know if the good reviews on here are from stock holders, people who suffer from wishful thinking, or if this product really does work great for some while not at all for others.  Like ME for instance.  What I do know is that for me the ZENO actually makes things worse not better.  There is another review on here that mentions the same reaction and I can relate.  I have very mild acne, but my face is never clear.  There is always one or two on my face somewhere.  The acne I've used the device on has taken 14 days to clear up so far, while the ones I haven't used it on went away in the usual 7.    Will Zeno work for you?  If you want to find out before purchasing it might be a good idea to get an oxygen type facial at a spa where they use a device that sends electrical heat pulses into your face (it makes a strong electrical sound but it isn't painful).  That device is supposed to keep acne at bay longer and it seems to have simular qualities to the Zeno.  Well, it never really worked for me like it was supposed to either so maybe that should've been a sign that the Zeno wasn't going to.  I wish I could return it, but I made the mistake of being so sure about the investment, I threw away the box.  If you're going to buy it don't make the same mistake I made.  KEEP the box!
