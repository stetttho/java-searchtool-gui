 All in all I liked this printer... It worked almost perfectly until one month after the 1 year warrenty was up. (How convenient). I say almost perfectly because there were a few bugs a couple of times where I had to reinstall the software.  Installation on my computer took only 15 minutes so it wasn't really any trouble.  However HP customer service is HORRIBLE.  There were times when I swear to you I knew more about the problem than they did!  Once when I had a problem with my keyboard the customer service rep actually told me to drop it on to the floor.  Swear to God that's exactly what they told me to do!  I realize that sometimes electronics seem to improve under a good swift hit now and then, but I expected more from someone in technical support.  I did drop it on the ground as I was told.  A tiny piece broke off and it still wouldn't work.  At least they were kind enough to send me a new one express delivery after that. The software for this printer isn't the best, but if you have alot of memory and space on your computer it shouldn't give you many problems.  Currently this printer is freezing up at startup and isn't functioning properly.  I called support, but since my year is up they wanted me to pay a $30-$50 fee for assistance.  I thought about the last time they gave me 'assistance' and opted not to pay.  I can smash the printer onto the floor without paying 30 bucks thank you!
