 If you're tired of tripping on or just laying eyes on all your charging cords, this is a nice way to keep them all tucked away while keeping your devices in a safe, orderly way.  It has enough room to fit 3-4 devices depending on their sizes.  I am able to fit my Treo 650, My mini ipod, my Jabra A210 and my bluetooth Jabra earpiece with cradel. (To charge more than 3 devices you have to use a 2-plug adapter on one of the slots- There are only 3 slots available for 3 devices) My only gripe is that it collects dust like nothing else in my apartment.  Probably because of the devices.  Electronics do tend to collect alot of dust.  However, since this is also in a way a display device that catches attention, a dusty looking ipod can really spoil the display, not to mention make it feel 'icky' when you go to pick it up.  The power station could use some sort of dust repellent or an easy access protective covering.  A protective cover would keep your dog from putting slobber all over your expensive gear too.  In any case, it is also great for those who constantly misplace their devices as you will always know where you placed your things and that they've been charging safely.  I paid about $20 for mine.
