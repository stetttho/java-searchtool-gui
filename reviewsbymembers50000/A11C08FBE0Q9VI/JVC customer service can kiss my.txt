 Bought this VCR.  Is it any good?  Don't know.  Tried to hook it up to my PC like I did with my older VCR, but to no avail with this one.  Called JVC customer service and as usual got ZERO help from them.  Had the same experience with previous JVC products.  You'll probably get more answers from the store you buy their products at then from the very people who made them.
