 I had previously written a review about this VCR and gave it only two stars because I felt it had only lasted a few months before some tapes started acting funny.  There's another review about this VCR that mentions the same thing. So I wrote a not great review about it and bought another VCR from Circuit City and immediately had the same problem with it.  I found out that it wasn't the VCR, but a Macrovision/copywriting problem.  Some VCR tapes, give off a signal to prevent you from illegally copying them on VCRs and so VCRs start acting funny.  Trouble is I didn't realize this was the problem because I don't copy tapes.  I only rent them or buy them brand spanking new.  But the copywriting deal on VHS has become so strict that even non-copies are mistaken for copies with Macrovision and the picture gets all scewy.  Especially if you don't connect the VCR directly into a tv.  (which I can't do because I watch VHS and TV via my LCD computer monitor so I can only hook it up to the TV tuner of my PC)  All this is not the VCR's fault, but Macrovision's. Thanks to Macrovision, if you want to make copies on VHS tapes or just plain VIEW alot of the tapes out there nowadays like I'd like to do, you have to either pay $450-$500 on a "digital VCR" or buy a seperate signal transformer for $60-$125 and hook that up to the VCR (aparently the SIMA CT-2 is pretty good converter so I'll probably go and get that.)  Otherwise Macrovision technology is bound to give you problems at some point with any VCR. P.S.  Macrovision can kiss my Butt!@ I called the company directly and complained.
