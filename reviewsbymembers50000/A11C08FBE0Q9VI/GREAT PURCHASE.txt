 I have spent alot of money on trying to improve the cable television reception on my computer monitor... which was pretty bad at first.  In order to improve it, I bought a somewhat costly surge protecter for power conditioning, A $30 Monster gold plated splitter, and 3 Monster gold plated coaxial cables that were only 3 feet long, but were priced at $30 EACH.  They did make significant improvement in the picture and sound quality, but nothing like the signal booster which improved my signal to near PERFECTION.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because there is ONE channel that doesn't come up perfect & that is channel 2 which has only average picture and sound...but considering the fact that before i had the booster I couldn't even SEE and hardly HEAR channel 2 at all, I am EXTREMELY happy with it.  I don't often write reviews for products even though I shop Amazon alot, but I am so happy to finally have great tv signal that I had to say something. :)
