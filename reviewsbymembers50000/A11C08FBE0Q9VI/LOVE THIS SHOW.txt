 This show is great.  Completely agree with the previous reviews on how CBS screwed with it's momentum.  The only thing I'd change is that by season 4 the show becomes just a little bit predictable.  Doug becomes dumber and hungrier with each episode and Carrie becomes angrier and bitchier.  I wish it was more like the first couple of seasons where Carrie would be really sweet some times and totally explode other times.  Kept you guessing.  By the time I got to season 4 you knew what was going to happen.  Doug was going to do something not so smart, and Carrie was going to Whip him into shape.  The only character that continues to be unpredictable in his antics is Artie.  You can see seasons one through 4 all in one shot and still not get tired of Jerry Stiller in this role.  The Deacon Character is great too.  Still a great show and will be getting season 5 when it finally comes out.
