 I love my new treo 650, but this headset is the pits.  The sound is ok, but you practically have to yell for the other party to hear you... and if you're speaking to an automated system just forget it... not only do you have to yell, but you also have to hold the mic up to your lips with your hands and anunciate every syllable.  I purchased a Jabra headset and it works great.
