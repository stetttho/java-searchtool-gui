 Alright, it seems to me that Pachelbel was definitely a talented lad.  But I'd rather hear his stuff with the origional instruments used- or at least in classical format.  This CD sounds too much like elevator music to me.  I guess if you like that sort of thing this CD would be for you.  Me I'm sticking with classical.  Just as relaxing but ten times as inspirational- and it won't put you to sleep.
