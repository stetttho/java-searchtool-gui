 I have a Treo 650, which already has bluetooth capability... Bluetooth 1.1 that is.  I wanted Bluetooth 1.2, and this adapter gave it to me! People buy phones like the Treo because they want the ability to do everything at once with only one device.  With Bluetooth 1.1, you have the ability to go wireless for phone conversations, but you CAN'T listen to anything else (audio books, music, etc.) via a wireless headset.  I couldn't believe it.  This means that you have to go back and forth between a wireless headset for phone conversations and a wired headset for everything else.  Not very convenient.   But with this adapter you can turn your bluetooth 1.1 phone into a bluetooth 1.2!  Meaning you can listen to it all wireless.  Needless to say, this rocks! Before I always had to decide prior to leaving the house, whether I wanted the ease of wireless communication without being able to listen to mp3s and recordings or whether I wanted the distraction of a wired headset that would allow me to also hear those extras.  Now, with the Jabra A210 I don't have to choose.  And it's tinier and lighter than I even expected which makes it even better.  I had a question for Jabra Support and they got back to me the same day!  Great products and great support.  For me, it really doesn't get any better than this.
