 It's not that it's boring.  It's that it's an advertisement. I recieved this book as a freebee with the holosync prologue.  It's got some nice information which is why it's so annoying that the author has to mention how great his program is and why you should get it just about every 5 sentances.  I'm up to chapter 3 and I just can't take anymore.  If you have the patience to read the constant commercial I guess it's a good book.
