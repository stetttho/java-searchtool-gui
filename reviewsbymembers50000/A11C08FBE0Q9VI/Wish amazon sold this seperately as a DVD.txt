 Definitely the best of the three movies.  If you like over the top acting, lots of stunts with little plot- as some do- you'll love the second one, Temple of Doom.  If you like action movies that are like 80% of all the other action movies out there, Raiders of the lost ark has plenty of stunts for you too.  (Okay, maybe Raiders spares a tad more originality than most action films), but if you're into movies that tell a great story- as only good movies do, get this one.  The Last Crusade is one of those rare films that takes a whole bunch of genres and skillfully puts it all into one film.  It's an action film, A romance, a comedy, an adventure film- all into one.  If they had put in a little sci-fi/horror in there you'd have the whole damn video store.  It's the perfect film for when you have a bunch of people over with different tastes.  Sure to satisfy them all.  Not related:  Amazon should really remove some of the reviews that customers give on certain products.  There are one star reviews for this movie by people who mention scenes that aren't even in this movie... they are mistaking this film for one of the other IJones films-Temple of doom.  Just goes to show you really need to read the reviews before passing judgement.
