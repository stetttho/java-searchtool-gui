 I'm giving this book 5 stars because it truly is very informative and WILL work.  However the techniques in this title won't help by themselves!  In other words, it is very effective at treating the symptoms of procrastination, but not very at treating the underlying causes.  As a result you will find yourself going back to your habits time and time again... and repeatedly trying to get yourself up from that by using these great techniques.  Not a lot of discipline is needed to follow the suggestions- but enough that undisiplined procrastinators (a.k.a procrastinators) may have trouble sticking with it.  My suggestion would be to get this book after you have looked into the root of the problem- either with other books or as the author suggests- through therapy.
