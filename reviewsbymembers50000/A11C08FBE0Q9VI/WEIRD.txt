 This book is weird.  I did find it an easy read for the first half of the book and then a bore the second half.  It is about a High-End Escort who makes... wait.. only $350/hour?  From what I understand that's hardly high end in most US cities.  In NYC where this escort is supposed to be living it's barely above low-end.  The way the character describes her schedule there's no way a girl who charges that little can afford the high priced restaurants/bags/shoes/apartment, etc.. that the character lavishes herself in.  In fact, after doing the math, a person can probably just about make ends meet in NYC under those circumstances. It reminds me of the show Friends.  Here all these poor young people trying hard to make a living at acting/catering/ etc...are still able to live in these Amazing NY apartments... plus they and all their friends and extras in the background are caucasian... Yeah.. That's JUST what NYC is like.  RIIIGHT. I found the book to have its moments, but mostly it was just plain inplausible.
