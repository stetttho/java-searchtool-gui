 Though many of the points the author mentions are important enough to bear repeating, this short book could've easily still been cut in half if redundancy was kept to a minimum.  He says the same things so often throughout the book I felt like he was treating me like a retard that needed to be reminded of something 50 times within the SAME chapter. Still, it is a very informative book on the psychology of money and the relationship people have with money.  It's great for changing your attitude towards money and financial goals, which is the first step towards wealth. However, it doesn't go into how to learn about investment basics, etc.  You'll have to go elsewhere for that.  I just have a thing against supreme redundancy and repitition, since that kind of thing drives me crazy- but It is after all very informative and I would definitely recommend it.   P.S.-After reading the book if you log on to the rich dad poor dad website, the author has a free mini audio book which you can download.  I really like these mini audio programs and especially enjoyed the one which complemented the next book "Cashflow Quadrant."
