 As a woman who is still in her early twenties I have played a lot of video games since I was a kid.  Problem with Video games is that they actually drain your energy.  I could never figure out why even in the rush of winning a game, you turn off the screen to find yourself drained, unfocused and tired.  I don't believe they are a good habit to pick up for anyone.  This game has the oppisite effect.  With each game you play you'll find yourself to get more energy, focus, and peacefullness.  There will be times when you will be amazed at your own abilities during the game and the amount of energy within you at your disposal.
