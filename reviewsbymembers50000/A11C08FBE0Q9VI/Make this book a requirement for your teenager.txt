 Even at that age they will most likely have already dealt with a sociopath... or are dealing with one at this moment... and neither of you know it.  Could it be your son's best friend? your daughter's teacher? Your neice's boyfriend?  Paranoia?  Not at all.  I got this book specifically because I could see all too clearly the sociopaths that run through mine and my friends' paths.  What's scary isn't the sociopaths themselves, but the people who vehemently support them should you or anyone else try to challenge this individual.  Thankfully, the author mentions this in the book.  The more experience you have with sociopaths, the more this book will ring true for you.  It is good to start teaching at an early age that titles such as Doctor, Police officer, Lawyer, Judge..etc do NOT = person you can trust.  Not by a long shot.  You're gut instinct knows more than any title society gives someone. Unfortunately however, the author throws around percentages without going into the details of how the studies were done which effects...well, everything really.  And it isn't written as concise as it could be, but it is great for the laymen.  I would recommend it.
