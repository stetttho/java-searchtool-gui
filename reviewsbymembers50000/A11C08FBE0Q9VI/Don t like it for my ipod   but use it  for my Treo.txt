 I disagree with Miguel who obviously has arms like Mr. Universe because this armband is in my opinion much too big and bulky.  It even looks big on the model they have wearing it on the cover of the box... and you know that fitness model was somewhere around 5,9 or something tall like that anyway.  If it looks big on her just imagine how it'll look on average sized women.  It'll look big on men too, but it'll be worse for the smaller build of women.  Everyone will wonder what that big black thing is strapped to your arm.  It looks cumbersome and feels a bit that way too.  The good thing is that if you do get it after reading these reviews, you will be so prepared and bracing yourself for the size, that once you recieve it, it won't seem that big to you.  This in my opinion is what happened to Miguel.  In any case- It's large. You can't access controls easily, (which for me is a huge problem) but it will protect your ipod.  Can't say I totally regret buying this.  Even though I don't use it for my ipod, it's great for my Treo 650 Smartphone!  I just cut a little piece away from the top to make room for the antenna and wallah!  An armband for my Treo 650 phone!  I would never take my Phone with me while I was jogging unless I was on Call or was expecting an important contact.  Needless to say, having to carry a large pda/cell phone with you while excersising is a pain.  A slightly cumbersome armband to hold the PDA/phone is a small price to pay as the phone itself is cumbersome anyway during certain activities like jogging.
