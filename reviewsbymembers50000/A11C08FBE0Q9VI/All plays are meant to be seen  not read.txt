 There is a review here about this play being better to see than to read.  This should be true of all plays, since that's their purpose.  In fact, if you really enjoy reading a play, in the same exact way you enjoy reading a novel- it very likely may not be a good play & should in fact be a novel instead. Having said that, I believe Anna in the Tropics is a great and beautiful play.  Reading it I can see how wonderful it would be to see on the stage; watching these very real characters go through their vulnerable journeys; I enjoyed my copy thoroughly.
