 ... than several phone companies COMBINED!!!  Please keep this in mind when you buy this phone!  THE Treo 650 gets 5 stars- there isn't much you can't do with it.  Read books, play games, organize email,.. the list goes on. Cingular Wireless however, gets zero stars!  I have never worked with a more frustrating company.  I was a Verizon customer for years and rarely had a problem.  I have had to stay on the phone with Cingular Wireless a total of 16 hours (count 'em 16!) since I got this phone only two months ago.  Honestly, the sound and reception is crystal clear here in nyc, but as long as I can understand the other person on the line I could care less about their voice quality.  They keep screwing up my bill and countless other things.  Hard to believe, but too many things have gone wrong with my account for me to even print here in only two months time.  Do they always fix the problem?  Absolutely.  You only have to call them about 5 times for the SAME exact issue and stay on hold for 20 minutes each time.  Each time they tell you they've fixed it... and then you see your online bill showing that they didn't... so you call again...horrid CYCLE.  Don't believe me?  By all means, do your own homework.  I know there are some great reviews here for Cingular, but if you do your own online research to confirm the above stated fact about complaints and listen to some of the negative reviews (in regards to Cingular, NOT the phone) you'll see after doing your own research that the people who are happy with Cingular Wireless are more the exception than the rule.  And who knows, maybe they're Cingular reps. The number one company for complaints is not a title to be proud of and not a company I want to do business with.  I wish I knew sooner.  I'm giving Cingular two more months to get my bill and my features right and if they can't pull it off, it's back to Verizon for me!  A great phone like this is supposed to make your life easier, not harder.
