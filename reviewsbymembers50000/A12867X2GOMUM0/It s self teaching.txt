 I wholeheartedly agree with some of the other reviews that state that nothing will help unless your child is ready to learn. When I first purchased this book, I tried to help my (then) 4 year old daughter through  the first lesson. She hated it and wasn't ready to move forward. So we  left the book out and after a week or so she picked it up and to the  amazement of my wife and I, she worked her way through the first 10 lessons  with a minimum of assistance from us. Granted, I do recommend that parents  take part in the instruction, but I use this story as an example of how  well thought out and easy to use this method is. Our daughter (now 5) has  successfully completed most of the book and is actively reading on her  own. While the methods do focus primarily on phonics, I found that it  worked best for us when my wife and I were able to insert whole language  methods, explain usage, etc. as our daughter asked questions. Overall it's  been a lot of fun and it's wonderful to see her proud of her  accomplishments and to realize the immediate gain she has from reading.
