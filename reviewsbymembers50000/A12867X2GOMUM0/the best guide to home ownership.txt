 This tale exemplifies the difference between a 'house' and a 'home'. Teaching the simple truths of being honest to yourself (and how that can have a positive impact on the people around you), to enjoy life and the odd way in which an accident can often be a blessing in disguise, I  wholeheartedly recommend this book for everyone. Non-homeowners included.
