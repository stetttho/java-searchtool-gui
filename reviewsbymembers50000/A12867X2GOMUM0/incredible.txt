 I first heard the song 'Brave Captain' on a Santa Cruz skateboard video in 1989. I scoured the credits to find the name of the band and spent a good month hunting down this album. The entire recording is simply inspired and  one of my favorite albums of all-time. Ed, Mike and George are amazing  musicians in their own right and each contribute accordingly on this album,  giving a very full, unified sense of arrangement. They really take their  jazz, punk and folk influences to heart and create something beautiful and  lasting - and not to mention that they freakin' rock.  This album kicks.  Chemical Wire and Brave Captain will stick with you forever.
