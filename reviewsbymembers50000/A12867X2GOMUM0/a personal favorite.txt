 I started playing Myth:TFL when the demo came out in 1997 and I have been playing both Myth:TFL and MythII multiplayer on a regular basis ever since. Never before has a game, or a series of games, kept my attention for such a  long period of time. In addition to great gameplay, graphics and  excellent storyline (a Bungie trademark), the multiplayer community is one  of the most fun, devoted and interesting group of people I have ever met.  Something like this is hard to market, but playing on Bungie.Net (the free  multiplayer service) is a lot of fun because the people make it so. My  only complaint is that the ranking system on Bungie.Net is inherently  flawed, which makes it (somewhat) easy for people to cheat and alter their  scoring. But if you stick to unranked games, you'll find a much better  breed of player.
