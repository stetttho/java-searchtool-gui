 I just finished reading this book to my daughters for what seems to be the thousandth time, and I never get tired of it. The beautiful and humorous illustrations are simply wonderful and the extremely sparse text allows them to create their own stories surrounding this surreal adventure. This  is a must-have book for parents and children of all ages. It's required  bedtime reading!
