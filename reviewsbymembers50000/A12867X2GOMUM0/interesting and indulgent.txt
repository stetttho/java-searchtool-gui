 The blend of traditional and modern instrumentation is fraught with peril, but Ekova pull it off in a manner that is both refreshing and utterly stunning in its delivery. The songs range from moody and wistful, ala Dead  Can Dance, to danceable and frolicking (reminding me of Rachid Taha). This  album is a must have for fans of middle eastern music and eastern  instrumentation - or those who just wish to experience something different  and wildly beautiful.
