 This is chock full of great advice when you don't know what to say, or are feeling slightly shy or uncomfortable. Just curling up with these study cases in how to tell someone their colon is infecting their entire body and they only have a few weeks to live, or that a hemorrhage in their daughters  brain will keep her in a state of vegetation for the rest of her ... life is enough to make anyone feel better about their own situation. Not  sure what to say at a party? Just imagine yourself in one of these terrible  situations and you'll thankfully be chatting up a storm.
