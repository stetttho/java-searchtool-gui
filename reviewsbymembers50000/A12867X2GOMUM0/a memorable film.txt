 This isn't so much a movie, but rather a poem placed on celluloid. A chilling tale of an angel willing to part with his existence to become human - to experience life and love. Beautifully elegant, understated and  utilizing a surprising cast to achieve a transcendant visual and  thought-provoking piece, this film imparts a sense of childhood and an  understanding of what truly matters.
