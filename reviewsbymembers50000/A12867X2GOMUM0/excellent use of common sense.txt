 This is a fantastic book, and highly recommended, if you are looking for reassurance or guidance in how to approach programming tasks with forethought. The authors touch on several methods to incorporate in the  planning and design phase, as well as guidelines for daily use in how you  choose the development environment or languages you should work in. This  is great stuff, accompanied by excellent examples from the author's  experience and eloquently written (for a technical book), interspersed with  wisdom and humor. My only complaint is that the book is too high-level  (but this is explained early on in the book). I found myself wanting to go  more in depth in regards to specific languages or tools suggested in the  book and the references they cited were not very helpful. All in all this  book is very good, and I see that some people have been using it as a group  study guide - what an excellent idea! This book is great for teaching good  general purpose programming habits, but not for in-depth study into a  single method, tool or language. Nevertheless, you'll find yourself  referencing the wisdom it holds again and again.
