 I'm sad to say that I actually spent money on this book. I did manage to finally slog my way through the trite passages on how humanity's only hope is achieve the simple nobility of the savage/tribal lifestyle, but that was after my fourth or fifth attempt. I really had a hard time getting past the telepathic ape schtick. So let me just say this: Quinn makes some very interesting observations about humanity and our evolution as a society and comes to a conclusion that is so simplistic that for the most part seems like a rational and revolutionary way to approach life - i.e., take care of the earth and each other. Who would have thought? But it falls apart when you realize that his clarion call for change cannot realistically happen without the complete decimation of modern society. Sorry Quinn, it just ain't gonna happen. What he gets at is good, and nice to hear. But it sounds vaguely familiar... Oh yeah! He just repackaged the core teachings of Jesus and other religious leaders and prophets and wrapped them up in a new image. Unfortunately that image is a telepathic ape. Nothing is more annoying that retyping the 10 Commandments and selling it as Chicken Soup for the Simple Minded. And the least enjoyable part of the book is that it is so poorly written. His style is utterly smug and pompous, coupled with a terrible grasp of narration and no sense of how to nurse a good storyline. Ultimately it just sucks. I guess maybe someone could read this book and have a life changing moment when they realize that they should probably be responsible for how they take care of things and the people around them. But after they realize that, I hope the next step to self-actualization is the realization that they have just been fleeced a fair amount of cash to read a trite exposition of nothing new.
