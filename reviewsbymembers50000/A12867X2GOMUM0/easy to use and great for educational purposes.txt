 The Autostar is so decadent! I almost feel guilty for using it. But it is so easy to use and enhances the ETX-90EC scope so much that I use it all the time.  Set-up and locating the reference stars is fairly easy, and it  is so much fun to take the tour of the sky. I've used this several times in  an educational setting and it is fantastic for quickly pointing out stars  and other celestial objects. In addition, it expands on the standard  controller, giving you nine variable speeds instead of the standard  four. Once you use the Autostar you will never go back.
