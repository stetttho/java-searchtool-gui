 The original album, Heaven's Dust, is one of my all-time favorite albums. It's brilliant - an amazing arrangement of Middle Eastern instrumentation with creative and elegant vocals. So I was excited to hear that the album  was being remixed and curious to listen to the finished project. Let me  just say that after the first track, it's nominal at best. This is mediocre  electronica. The vocal tracks fit securely within the groove of the  original arrangements on the first album, but removed and placed upon a  disparate collection of drum tracks and effects it loses all sense of  wholeness. Some of the remixed tracks are creative in their own right, but  do not stand out among such a dynamic genre. You are much better off  buying the original Heaven's Dust. Soft Breeze & Tsunami Breaks is a  nice compliment to the original, but not worth owning without the reference  to the first album.
