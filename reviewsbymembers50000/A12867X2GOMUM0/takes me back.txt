 Indicative of a time when the punk rock DIY spirit was in decline, N.O.U breathed life into an otherwise dead genre. Pulling from various gospel influences (if not musically, then in tone and intention), 13-Point Program  was a wake up call to get off your ass and do something. Self referencing  high school dilemmas and the realities of being a kid (exemplified in 'A  Kid Who Tells On Another Kid Is A Dead Kid' and 'Today I Met The Girl I'm  Going To Marry'), the youthfullness of N.O.U comes through with such  passion that you almost want to relive the torture of high school all over  again.
