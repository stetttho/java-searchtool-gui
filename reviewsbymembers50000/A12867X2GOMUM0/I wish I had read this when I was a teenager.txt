 As a drop-out of the educational system, it was very hard for me to adjust to the embarassmemt or the feeling of being an outcast. Structured school never held my attention, and I was often bored during the advanced classes  and near drooling during the regular courses. Needless to say I was able to  learn on my own and succeed in the areas that I pursued, but I wish I had  had this book as a reference back then so that I could have known about  other people and forms of alternative education and not struggled on my own  so much. The author does a great job at encouraging the reader about the  decision to take on the task of self education, but she sometimes goes a  little too overboard and negative toward the public school system. That  attitude is understandable, though, in a culture where a certificate that  says you've finished some classes is actually worth more than a body of  work. But that was the only downside to this excellent manual on how to  successfully remove yourself from the school system and excel in your  studies, including how to cope with the negative stereotype of a  'drop-out'. She covers several learning/teaching styles and references  various home schooling and unschooling publications and organizations that  provide all sorts of means for which to learn the things that interest you,  as well as learn productive habits for self learning that will last a  lifetime. I can't recommend this enough, especially for people who have  completed high school or college and are suddenly thrown into the workforce  and are struggling to learn in unstructured environments. This books  provides the methods for creating a structure that works for you and steps  towards success. It really opened my eyes.
