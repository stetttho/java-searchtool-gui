 The ETX-90EC was a breeze to set up. Within 20 minutes I was viewing the moon in my backyard. The optics are fantastic for the price and the standard eyepiece is great for terrestrial peeking as well as  stargazing. The motor works well and the variable speeds are very  effective, but mine is a bit noisy. It tends to growl as it idles and I  have not been able to determine if this is normal or not. Other downsides  are the vertically exposed eyepiece (I ended up using a plastic cylinder as  a protective cap) and the six screws on the spotting scope, which make  centering very difficult. You definitely need the tripod because the  standard base is unstable unless you are placed on solid rock, so prepare  to add another $200 to the price. And the erecting prism is a must for  terrestrial viewing. All in all this is a great scope. The few  limitations are far outweighed by the line of eyepieces and accessories  available for the ETX-90EC such as Autostar and the 35mm camera attachment.  This is a great deal for beginning and amateur use, expandable enough that  this could very well be the only scope you will ever need.
