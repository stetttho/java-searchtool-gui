 I just read this book in an afternoon. Not because it is short(it is fairly compact), but because it was so compelling. I couldn't put it down. Almond's imagery is breathtaking and his ability to take you into the moment with Michael and his not altogether acknowledged or undertood anxiety about his life, the recent move and the ill-health of his infant sister is instantly alluring and involved. Almond manages to beautifully capture moments in adolescence with a rare maturity that gives life to the characters and reminds us how children are more receptive and adaptive to change and the unknown than adults give them credit for. Wonderful, wonderful story. An instant favorite.
