 This is one of my favourite knitting books.  Why? + Great patterns, about 90% of the stuff is on my "to knit.." list + Full colour pictures of what final knitted item looks like for EVERY pattern + Nice design and layout + Simple to read + Very clariofy instructions and illustrions on how to learn new techniques + For all skill levels + Amusing commentary about knitting This book is fantastic.  If you haven't already bought a copy I would highly recommend it.
