 The only reason we bought this calendar (and half price at one of those calendar shops after the new year) because it feature Burmese Cats.  The cat on the cover looks like a bombay.  The pictures are unprofessional and tacky and some of the cats barely resemble Burmese at all.  There are only a few cute pictures. Save your money unless you find it in the dollar bin somewhere.
