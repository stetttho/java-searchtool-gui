 For those of you that aren't familar with Dame Darcy or her Meatcake comics you are in for a treat.  Granted there is a certain audience, her comics are a mixture of gothic horror, romance, intrigue, and novelty, so not everyone may appreciate this series.  If you like yr comedy noir and can appreciate the idea of mermaids and siamese twins being "normal" girls this should be right up yr alley. This compliation covers Meatcakes #s 1-7.  #0 is missing, but luckily Fantagraphics has reprinted it and it is widely avaiable.  (Just go to damedarcy.com for more details.) The presentation of this edition is stunning, it is hardbound with creamy thick pages and excellent reproductions of her comics.
