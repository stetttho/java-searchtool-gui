 LUCK IN THE SHADOWS is the perfect tip-off to the Nightrunner series.  I was hooked by the second page and could not put this book, or the next two in the series down. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes contemporary fantasy.   Reasons I adored LUCK IN THE SHADOWS: + It was very simple and entertaining to read but it was also clever and witty and amusing and satisifying. + The main characters are very interesting and endearing in the way they create mischief and scamper around and are spies, nightrunners, aristocrats, and thieves. + The battle of good vs evil was very much at the forefront especially in Skala vs Plenimar, but the cliche did not take away from the plot or mar the book as a polar good vs evil theme does in many fantasy books.
