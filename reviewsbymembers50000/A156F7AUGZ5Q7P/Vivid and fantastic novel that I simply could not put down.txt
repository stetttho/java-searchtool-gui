 This book has mixed reviews, like all great books until they are deemed classic.  I thought the book was fantastic, perhaps it's a matter of taste.  However, if you like books that have neat endings with all the loose ends tied up, I would firmly suggest you stop reading this review.  In fact stop looking at this book and get a choose-your-own-adventure or anything by John Grisham.  Also, it is a thick volume, it has many pages, if you like the novels you read to be short and fairly non-descriptive this is also not the book for you.  You can read a description above, I will not comment on the story line. Reasons I liked this book: - The scope of it was very grand and very all encompassing.  Sugar's inner thoughts, secrets, and emotions are all divulged and explored and brought into context.  As a character she was very interesting.  She was selfish and flawed but I also understood where she was coming from and the events in her life that characterised her.  I am one of those people who do not have to particularily *like* all the characters in a book for it to be a good book.  I enjoy rather realistic depictions of human nature.  This book has plenty of it. - I like having to imagine the ending for myself.  With a book this large it was completely unexpected, but there was enough resolution between William Rackham and Sugar's relationship that I felt *satisfied*  - It was very beautifully written.  Faber took the time to let his characters breathe life and unravel instead of stick to plot structure charts.  I devoured all the descriptions and read it compulsively and will probably read it several more times this year. - I like long books if they are well written. I have eccelectic reading tastes and this book was dense, serious, irreverant,  satirical and pulpy fiction.  It had several tones to it instead of being written in a one-dimensional way. - I don't know if you will enjoy this book as much as I did, but it is definately worth a try.
