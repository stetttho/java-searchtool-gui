 YMOYL is one of my top ten books of all time.  Why?  Because it maturely and rationally analyzes your personal relationship and attitudes about money, status, and life style and basically forces any sentient human being to realize that living within his or her means is a plausible and desirable way to live. By doing a personal inventory and finding what we really want to do and cutting all the unnecessary crap out of lives that isn't fulfilling.  It encourages you to reduce your consumption, reevaluate your career path and dare to do what you really dream to do, or even work less.  You rethink the American Dream, maybe you don't need to have a house or a fancy car.  Maybe you'd rather have your time. Maybe you just know that the way you are living isn't how you want to.  The books teaches you to see money as your life energy.  To think of every dollar as an increment of your time.  And it teaches you how very precious your life energy is. In our hectic, status-fueled, mad world this book is a breath of fresh air.  It offers a lot of information on how other humans simplified their lives and to open up the possibilities for you to live this way as well.
