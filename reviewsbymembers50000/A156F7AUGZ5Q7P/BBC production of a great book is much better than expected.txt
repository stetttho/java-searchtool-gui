 Of course the book is always better than the movie.  But you already knew that.  I rented Tipping the Velvet on a whim, after reading the book, though I thought at the time that the movie may be disappointing and low budget.  However I was pleasantly surprised about the quality of production. The movie starts on the shores of Kent in a oyster parlour where a young girl is on the verge of coming of age and sexual exploration.  The catalyst for this is Kitty Butler, a music hall performer in drag who iniates a series of awakings for Nan.  They develop a close friendship and evetually Nan moves to London with Kitty to be her dresser.  This begins a labile romp in Victorian England.   The screenwriter stuck pretty faithfully to the book, in fact I noticed some omissions but no creative liberities until the very end and I am assuming it was for dramatic impact. There were some cheesy special camera effects that ditracted from the movie, but they were minimal. I am heterosexual, but I felt little chemistry (especially Diana) in a few of the frank love scenes, but that could be my personal taste as well.  Other than that, it was a highly enjoyable movie.
