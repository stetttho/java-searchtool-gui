 This album is back when Corin still dated girls, back before she and Carrie were in a band together,  a melodramatic and raw album in classic riot grrrl mode, these songs will take you back to high school, even if you never have heard it before. It's an unrefined diamond, down to it's anatomy depicted cover, a zine in pure audio form. It's not for everyone, but if you let it get under yr skin, it is definately worth the experience. "Axeman" is the strongest song on the disc, a dirge of rage on football and hormonal craziness and the "punk-white priviledge scene. ***** a "must-have album
