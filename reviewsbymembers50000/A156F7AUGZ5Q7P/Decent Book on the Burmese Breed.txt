 This book would mostly be of interest to someone who is unfamilar with the burmese breed.  It has sound and informative information about burmese and cats in general, but it is definately at the "novice" level.  The pictures are better than most (most pet books seem to have terribly unflattering pictures of burmese) and it is laid out well. If you are new to the burmese breed, this book is a good start.
