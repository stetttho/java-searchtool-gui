 This book is very lovely and I use it for more inspiration than actual patterns for home decor. Hand-knitting household accents is an enjoyable and relaxing task.  They give yr home a comfortable and lived in look and you have complete creative control in colours, patterns, texture and size instead of purchasing something readymade in a store.  They also make extremely thoughtful gifts especially if you make things to match the gift recipent's colour scheme and decor. My favourite pattern in this book is for a lush shaggy bath rug. I also like the beaded accents on the throw pillows. This book is appropriate for every skill level, in fact more advanced knitters would just finish the project that much quicker and easier, while the novice knitter would have a fairly easy time knitting the mostly rectangular patterns and most of them call for fairly bulky yarn. I would suggest purusing a copy at a bookstore or library before purchasing because it is a little pricy and the best aspects of it are the ideas and presentation. Most semi-experienced knitters would not even need a pattern if they saw a picture and then could knit from their mind's eye. On the other hand this book is so lovely and provokes creativity for me in decoring my home that it is worth having and keeping and flipping through.
