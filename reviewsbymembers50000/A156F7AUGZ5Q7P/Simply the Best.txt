 There is a reason that people are willing to pay $150+ for the collectible book that is out of print.  Luckily my fiance and I won it at a local cat show that had a raffle.  We had no idea it was worth so much at the time, but devoured it and thought it was excellent. This book is nearly a complete resource for all breeders, if I could choose only one cat book to keep this would be the one. It is well written, thought-out, and VERY informative.  Any question you have about breeding is answered here.  It is simply the best cat breeding book I have ever read.
