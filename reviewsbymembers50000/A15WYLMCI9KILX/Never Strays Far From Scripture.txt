 As a philosophy major, I am well aware of vain philosophy.  None of it in here.  Logical, consise  argumentation. He rips the proverbial heart out of the Arminians.  His biblical commentary is insightful, and White is  grounded in the knowledge of those great saints that have come before with  much wisdom. I would suggest Sproul's "Chosen by God" to start  if one wants to learn the Reformed doctrines of grace (if you are a  newbie).  This is more in depth, and I would read this next. Stands on  its own, but I am going to read Chosen but Free now.  I didn't feel  hindered from not reading Geisler's book first. A job well done.
