 Trying to prove what actually happens in subjective experiences and Near Death Experiences (NDE) is inherrently a hard thing to do.  Dr. Rawlings was personally affected by one of his patient's NDE which led him to  document negative NDEs.  It is abundantly clear that we cannot hold that  all NDEs are bliss.  This stinks for a lot of people because people want to  live their lives with no consequences.  So they go to two extremes.  Either  all go to bliss or there is no God.  (I would suggest the book "If  there is a God, why are there atheists?" for a Christian analysis of  that or read Jean Paul-Sarte's No Exit for an atheist who expresses those  emotions.)  New Age authors who make money holding out fals hope will not  welcome this. I leave off a few stars, because of all the non-NDE info in  the book.  It is interesting and worthwhile in its own right, but it seems  to be a tangent to the main thrust of the book.
