 A wonderful Puritan jewel.  This book clearly shows how easy it is to be almost a Christian.  As one, like all believers, who struggles for sin, it really gives one pause.  We must be committed to put away our sin and strive in God's power to be fully committed to Jesus.  Discipleship is not an easy thing.  The cost is very high.  And our flesh pulls strongly against us.  This book shows us the depths of true commitment.
