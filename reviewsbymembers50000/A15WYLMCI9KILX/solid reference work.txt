 I've heard a lot of critics.  We must keep in mind that critics, just like believers, are biased.  They need the Bible to be untrue.  They need it, because they need to live in rank sin.  (Please reference RC Sproul's "If There's a God, Why are There Atheists?") I've never seen an alleged contradiction that hasn't been either resolved or enough reasonable explanations given that it remains a problem for me.   This book helps aide those who want to examine these difficulties.  I do not agree with the author all of the time.  I've seen others give better answers to the same questions.  But I must say, when he is on, the author is spot on.  And he's on a lot.  The book is also not as exhaustive as I would like.  My only other problem with the book is that it would have benefited from more people writing in it (to give it more of an encyclopedia feel).  However, it is a wonderful resource I highly recommend.  I also like how the book deals with some passages that are difficult to understand, not just alleged contradictions. I highly suggest reading his passage on the critics of Daniel, and how these critics completely ignore the evidence to give it a late date.  Why did they give the book a late dating?  Because if they didn't, they would be admitting to fulfilled prophecy.  That is the bias believers are up against.  And that is why I feel justified in saying what I said in the first paragraph of this review.
