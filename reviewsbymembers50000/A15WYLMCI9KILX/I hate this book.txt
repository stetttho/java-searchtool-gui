 I had to unlearn what I learned from this book.  I was in the middle of college, I had a horrible professor, and she assigned this book.  The book  is horribly confusing for one reason.  The code examples.  The editors take  huge sections of code out and leave in "..." in its place.  Well,  you know what?  I'm new and I need a freakin' example in context to figure  it out.  That's how I learn best.  You have to string together code  fragments from all over the book just to piece together one program.  I got  so frustrated with this book.  I finally read Sam's Learn C++ in 10 Minutes  and everything fell into place.  That teaches you something, don't it?   They had good examples and I learned right away.  At least I know now I'm  not an idiot.  I actually saw someone's copy of the first edition and it  was a good book.  But it didn't have the imfamous "...".  I  assume like many computer company HR departments the editors don't know  anything about programming.  My advice is to do yourself a favor and get  another book.
