 The danger in understanding Edwards is that all too few know anything  about him except for this sermon.  He spoke about the excellency of Christ  more than any other topic.   The editor was wise in noting that Edwards  gave this sermon to a church that was playing around with God.  Jesus'  example is that He was very harsh with the religious hypocrites, and He was  gentle and sweet with the "sinners." It should be noted that  without law there can be no concept of grace.  When the doctrines of grace  were recovered in the Reformation, respect for God's law was likewise  recovered.  If someone is coming to Jesus not based on because they need  forgiveness and atonement with a Holy God, they are coming on false  grounds.  That is why this sermon is needed today.  There is too much  felt-needs sermons.  Come to Jesus because He will make you better.  No,  come to Jesus and escape the wrath of God.  If you come on other grounds  than that, you are endanger of not being a true disciple.  That last  sentence may sound weird.  If it does, I would read "The Gospel  According to Jesus" by John MacArthur.
