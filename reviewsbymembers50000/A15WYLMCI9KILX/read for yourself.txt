 Even if you aren't Reformed, this is a must.  This was written for  everyone from kings to the street sweeper.  Calvin is amazingly bright.   Institutes consists of four parts: God the Father, the Son, the Holy  Spirit, the Church.  Book four contains devastating critiques and  historical analysis of the Catholic church.  Calvin also uses early church  fathers and Scriptures to show what the church looked like before the rise  of the archbishops, esp. the bishop of Rome.  His quotes of Jerome will  make Catholics irate. This book is also historically important, as it was  mightily used by God.  You don't have to agree with Calvinism to appreciate  or find this book useful.  You don't even have to like Calvin.  People  should focus on the work, not the man.  What you will find is the author  loved God and His Word and endeavored to never stray far from either.
