 This songs on this CD are great, soulful songs.  But when the songs are performed with synthesizer, drum machines, etc., that takes the soul out of thim.  And their primary quality is SOUL!!!  Aesthetically speaking, it doesn't sound quite right.  These songs should be done with "real" instruments, including voice.  I'm not sure if that is economically feasible for the producers of this CD, but it should be done or not done at all.  I'm not against getting this CD, but I do think it could have been a lot better.
