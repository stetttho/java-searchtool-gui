 The reason why there are atheists, from the Christian perspective, is that men hate God and what to live a life as their own masters.  There is nothing worse than being faced with the real God.  Therefore, if we are to  have God, natural man will try to dress him up in our image.  The book is  not meant to address alternative theories and it is not designed to prove  that God exists.  It exists to turn the tables on the most common objection  to Christianity by atheists: it is a crutch.  Well, the crutch is on the  other side as well.  Before evolution, the atheists jumped on spontaneous  generation.  It was joyous because they no longer had to explain the world  without a Creator.  Spontaneous generation has long since passed, but the  lesson should be learned.  Men will leap on anything if they can avoid  God. So if we want to debate the existance of God, let's do so...but with  the knowledge that bias exists on the atheist side as well.
