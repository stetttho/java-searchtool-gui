 King's style wraps you up into the characters.  I genuninely couldn't put down the book because I was always interested in what happened next.  This is one of the best King books I've read, and I've read quite a few in my  time.  The psychological prose of the narrator is engaging and keep the  book humming along, even when its just the character's musings.  I found it  much better than the movie, but I read the book first.  King dealt with  race and other issues well without being preachy or losing focus in his  narrative.  At the same time he was able to touch deeper spiritual issues.
