 Christianity in Crisis provides clear documentation on the heretics in the Word of Faith movement.  While they sanitize most of what they say on TV, they hide poison in the skin of the truth. The movement clearly panders  to a wicked and adulturous generation that demands signs.  Selfishness  surrounds this movement.  What the church needs to do is focus in on the  glory of God as our chief end.  Our chief end is not to have God as a  cosmic bellhop.   The focusing in on giving in order to get more and  more...and name it claim it...reveals this selfishness.  In the final  analysis (overlooking other major theological problems), a gospel of  prosperity is not the true gospel.  It is no gospel at all. This book is  a valuable resource to not only show error, but to point us back to the  heart of real Christianity.
