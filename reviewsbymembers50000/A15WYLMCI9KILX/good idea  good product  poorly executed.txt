 This product is a great idea.  And it works fairly well.  I have a few problems with it.  The User Interface (UI) is a tad complicated.  Alarms should be intuitive.  This one is not.  You absolutely need the instruction manual.  In the morning, when it is still dark, and the alarm goes off, you won't know what buttons you are pushing.  There are so many of them so close together.  Sometimes I hit buttons and I don't know what I'm doing in the dark.  Snooze stops working, CDs are playing...dogs and cats living together...  Maybe I'm an idiot.  I don't know.  I just want an alarm clock that is more intuitive.
