 I can sum this up pretty quickly.  This book explains the importance of getting the Gospel right, the unity found in the Gospel, and the particulars of the Gospel.  It was written in reaction to the Gift of Salvation document between some Catholics and Evangelicals.  Sproul is a master of easily explaining rich theological issues.  Very compact and straighforward.  I used this as a primary source when I gave a lecture on "what is the Gospel."  If you like this, I would suggest getting Sproul's "Faith Alone."  Also take a look at John MacArthur's "the Gospel According to Jesus."
