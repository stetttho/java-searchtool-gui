 It is 5 stars for what it is.  It is not exhaustive, but that is not what  it is trying to be.  It is a wonderful little book.  I programmed in C for  about 5 years.  I tried learning C++ in a class in college, unfortunately I  had a horrible professor and I only got more confused.  I tried relearning  C++ a few times, but to no avail.  Finally, I got this book and everything  fell into place.  One concept at a time and I picked up everything easily.   It explains everything well, and the book provides good examples.  For the  novice, but highly recommended.
