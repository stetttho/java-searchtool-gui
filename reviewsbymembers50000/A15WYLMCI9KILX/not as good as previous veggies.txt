 I'm sorry to rain on the parade.  I love Veggie Tales.  Come to my house and look at my clock.  Come see my cups and my keychain.  But in all  honesty, this video was flat.  It is definitely not their best work.  The  silly song is very good and very catchy.  My fiancee has taken to calling  her stuffed manattee "Barbara."  But that aside, the video was  subpar for them.  I hold them to high standards, and I was disappointed.   The music wasn't that memorable.  The lesson is good, but the writing is  uninspired.  The songs seemed forced.  Maybe Big Idea needs a sabatical to  recharge the batteries.  I hope this is an aberation and not a sign of  decline.  The impression I got was a lot of hard work went into this, but  something did not click.  Reviews like this one, especially revolving  around humor, are necessarily subjective.  But without any doubt, I would  not hesitate to get this for a child.  This is far superior to the normal  pap and dribble coming out of the industry.
