 I used this book primarily to investigate how to use Corba, independent of  whether I wanted to use Java.  I ended up using Java, but I never got  around to using Corba.  This book was very helpful in weighing the  different technology options available to me.  I used it to learn Java RMI,  which is related to Corba.  I use that as an illustration to show how this  book covered competing technologies well, so you can pick which technology  is best for you.  This most helpful.  When learning and picking  technologies I come in with a whatever-works approach.  This book is  aligned with that philosophy.  If you are thinking about using Corba or  something similar, esp. with Java, I would buy this book in a heartbeat.   It comes in handy as good reference.
