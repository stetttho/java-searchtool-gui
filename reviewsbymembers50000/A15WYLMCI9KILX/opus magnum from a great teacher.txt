 There is a reason this book (as I am writing this) averages 5 stars for a review.  It is worth every star.  In the subject of theology or philosophy, the greatness of a work is not due to the author coming up with a novel  theory.  It is due to the accuracy of his work. Sproul's work is so  spot-on, I am ashamed I never saw the holiness of God more clearly in the  Scriptures before.  It even helped explain some of my own experiences.   This work should be read and re-read.  It should be given as gifts.  It  should be in our library.  If begging and pleading will get you to read  this, I'll do it. Understanding the holiness of God helped me systamize  many theological questions, such as the Cross, God's judgement, and our  reaction to God's holiness. But above all, what I carried away from this  book was our natural repulsion to God's holy character. This book has  been a help to many, and I'm sure it will be to any believer who reads  it. One final note:  I liked the original version better.  The final two  chapters in the revision are worthwhile and good.  But in my mind, chapter  9 is so impactful, ending right there has better flair.  This in no way  diminished my admiration for the new chapters.
