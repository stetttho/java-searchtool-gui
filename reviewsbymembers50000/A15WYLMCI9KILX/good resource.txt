 Having this book in my library is quite valuable.  It allows me access to sound theological and reasoned answers to many question that pop into my head.  This is not meant to be a highly technical book, but of the more  general question variety.  It is very good at what it does.  I would assume  Sproul wrote this so he wouldn't have to answer so much mail on the same  questions.  So if you like the wit and wisdom of Sproul, I highly recommend  this book.  Not so much to read through, but for reference use.  Especially  if you question a lot and desire answers.
