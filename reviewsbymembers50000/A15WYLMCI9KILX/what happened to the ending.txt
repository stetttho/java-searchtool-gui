 The film, probably not intensionally, is a good morality play concerning the negative effects of greed and the moral choices we must make.  Affleck  is not on the screen long at all, unlike the trailors.  Everyone puts in a  fine performance.  And the plot and pacing of the film are wonderful.  I'm  getting into the film and getting interested in what's happening and then  suddenly... the film just abruptly ends.  It was like they ran out of  film so they just put up the credits.  Did they run out of money to shoot  the film?  I don't understand.  There is more story to tell, but not enough  to force a sequel.
