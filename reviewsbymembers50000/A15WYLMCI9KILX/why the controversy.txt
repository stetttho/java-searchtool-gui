 I really do not understand why this book was so controversial.  MacArthur  does not believe in works-righteousness as part of the gospel.  But works  is a natural outgrowth of genunine faith.  This is Gospel 101.  Anyone who  is even remotely familiar with the Protestant debates with Rome would know  this.  All you have to do is read the book of James.  A faith without works  is a dead faith and it cannot save.  The other view only has false  assurance for unbelievers who fool around with Christianity.  The demons  believe in the facts of Christ.  Their problem is they don't trust, which  is shown in their works.  From Luther to Calvin on, this has been  emphasized.  Those who oppose MacArthur may be good people, but they are  really wrong. MacArthur is a wonderful Bible expositor.  I greatly  benefited from his insights on Scripture.  He is a man of great passion and  it shows.  For a complete view of the gospel, I highly recommend this book.
