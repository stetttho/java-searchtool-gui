 The hallmark of a James White book is going to the texts of Scripture, using the original languages, and seeing what the text says.  He does this so well.  Instead of the Trinity being just another doctrine, or something  made-up at Nicea, or a possible interpretation, White shows us that the  doctrine of the Trinity is forced upon us from the Scriptures.  One must  engage in mental gymnastics to get out from under this view.  The book does  not focus too much on why it is important (it does some at the beginning  and end), but it does a tremendous job in showing the Trinity from the  Scriptures using the whole of God's Word.  Use this book to pick the mind  of James White's scholarship and knowledge.  You will not be disappointed.
