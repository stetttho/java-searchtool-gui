 This commentary is very good.  I would echo the two reviews that come before me.  It is a very valuable resoure that brings out the Jewishness of the New Testament text.  Additionally, it is good for dealing with  "problem" passages which have been alledged to have anti-semitic  overtones in the New Testament.  His Jewish perspective helps us to see  that when you view the passages without bias and from its original Jewish  viewpoint, there is no antisemitism in the New Testament.  Consider Paul in  Romans saying how much advantage there is to being a Jew.  So this  commentary is a must-have for people in Jewish ministry and would be very  helpful to any student of the Word.
