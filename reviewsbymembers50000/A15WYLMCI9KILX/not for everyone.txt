 This film was a lot like the Kaufman.  It had its moments of brilliance,  and it had times that left you underwhelmed.  If you do not care for  Kaufman, do not bother with this film.  No one could figure him out, so  that is reflected in the film.  He was a strange character.  There doesn't  seem to be an overall point to his life, other than to ammuse.  Likewise  for the movie.  For what it is, it is good.  But there are other biopics  that are much more interesting.  More because of the subjects than the film  making. On the plus side, Jim Carrey gives a wonderful performance.  I  thought he was robbed incredibly by the Oscars for not even getting a  nomination.  He won a Comedic Actor Golden Globe for this role.  Comedic  role???  It alone is worth seeing.  Worth renting, not buying.
