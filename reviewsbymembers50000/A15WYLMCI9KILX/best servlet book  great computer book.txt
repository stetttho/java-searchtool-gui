 Unlike most of the reviews here, I actually started using this book with only a couple of weeks of Java experience.  I found the book easily readable.  I use servlets on the job and any real-life problem or question  I've faced has been dealt with in this book.  The general introduction to  servlets chapters were great for comparing the technology to CGI, and they  helped convince my management that my choice of servlets was a wise one.   Also, the oreilly Java servlet classes that come with the book were helpful  too, and I have relied on them for real business use.  Servlets touch on  many other Java APIs in the course of use and it was not the authors  intention of putting in everything you need to know, but just about  everything you need to know about servlets.  For example, the chapter on  JDBC doesn't exhaust JDBC, but it will give you a taste so you can figure  out how it affects servlets.  The author's website which complents the book  is quite helpful as well.  I would suggest that this computer book covers  its scope better than any other computer book I've read.  I highly  recommend it.
