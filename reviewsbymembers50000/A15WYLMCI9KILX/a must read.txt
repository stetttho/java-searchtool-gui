 Even if you aren't Reformed, this is a must.  This was written for  everyone from kings to the street sweeper.  Calvin is amazingly bright.   Institutes consists of four parts: God the Father, the Son, the Holy  Spirit, the Church.  Book four contains devastating critiques and  historical analysis of the Catholic church.  Calvin also uses early church  fathers and Scriptures to show what the church looked like before the rise  of the archbishops, esp. the bishop of Rome.  His quotes of Jerome will  make Catholics irate.
