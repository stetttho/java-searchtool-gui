 It is formulaic.  It is predictable.  Tommy Lee Jones does the "Fugitive" for the bazillionth time.  But it's just plain fun.   The movie is meant to be cathartic.  Don't come expecting Citizen Kane,  because, let's be honest, this was pure pulp.  The wonderful woman is  framed by a louse for a husband and she's going to go after him.  (and he's  officially dead and already convicted for the crime, so she has  double-jeopardy protection)  How silly, but it I enjoyed it.
