 This book packs a lot of material.  As an anthology, as the other reviewer has ably mentioned, this is wonderful.  This book would be extremely useful to the student of Christian theology (Roman Catholic or Protestant) or to the student of historical philosophy.  If you are studying the works of Aquinas for history, a few words of caution.  A lot of his philosophy is based on Aristotle.  If you do not understand basic Aristotle, this can be painful at times. "Actualize" and "potential" and sufficient causes, etc. will appear a lot.  If you are unfamiliar with what this terminology means, you will have slow going.  This is just a problem with some philosophy.  Kant, another member of the big-5 team of greatest philosophers, also suffers from a language barrier to modern readers.  But like Kant, you can still get a lot out of it. The editor of this book has put in a lot of useful and wonderful theology of Aquinas.  This is good b/c not many people believe in his metaphysics anymore.  So his theology may have more modern usefullness.  Given his influence over Western Christianity and Roman Catholicism in particular, Aquinas is definitely worth the read.  One of the small gems (and unexpected) was a part of Aquinas' commentary on I Cor. 15.  Sections on the Problem of Evil are in here as well.  I was surprised, but glad, to see that the editor left in a section on the problem of using language to describe God.  This was a typical 20th century problem.  It's good to see that there aren't many new philosophical problems. If you are just getting into Aquinas (and you have some background in philosophy) this is a good place to start.  If you are interested in theology, there is much in here for you as well.  Given the structure of the book, you do not have to read straight through.
