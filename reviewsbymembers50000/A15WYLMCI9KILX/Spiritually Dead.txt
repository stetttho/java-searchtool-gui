 Great book.  R.C. Sproul helped turn me to Calvinism.  I read some of the Arminian reviews and am distressed.  The best illustration of Calvinism is thus: go to a cemetary and ask the dead to rise w/o God's help. Sproul  uses his background in philosphy to lay the groundwork for cogent and  logical arguments.   I didn't like being a Calvinist at first, but I know  realize it's sweetness and beauty.  Our original sin, our orientation,  justly condemns us, but due to His mercy we are saved.
