 This book is a wonderful historic resource on Islam and Muhammad.  If one wants to study Islam in depth, one should read this book.  However, the reader should know that this book contains one of the most embarassing  moments in Muslim history, the Satanic verses.  Not the novel.  That is  when Muhammad confused verses from Satan as verses from God.  This presents  Islam great difficulty in the biblical test for a prophet found in Deut. 18  as well as general epistimalogical [sic] problems.
