 While I am not Jewish, I have gleaned a lot from this resource.  The interlinear translation style is extremely wonderful resource, esp. for people trying to pick up the language or to see the underlying Hebrew.  The Rashi commentary is easy to follow.  All the texts are well laid-out and extremely readable.  I find the resource valuable for helping someone pick up Hebrew.  The translation is more word for word than thought for thought, but that is appropriate in this context, given that it is an interlinear translation.  Rashi adds valuable insights.  His text being there in Hebrew and English is done just as well as the Torah text.  The use of a the more readable font for the Hebrew is easier for people like me who are still picking up Hebrew.  The only thing, as a Gentile, I have a struggle with in the English translation is the transliterated words as opposed to the Anglinized words.  Not a big deal, just takes some getting used to.  This is well worth the price, esp. for the serious student or scholar.
