 The main point of the book is that the Catholic and Reformation positions cannot be bridged.  And if this doctrine was important enough to merit the  council of Trent, that council's anathema must be removed before there can  be any unity.  Sproul does a wonderful job in documenting the two  positions, and he does do a fair job describing the Catholic position.  I  still don't understand how people can read James and not see that James was  railing against easy-believism.  "Demons have faith."  Obviously,  James is not talking about the saving kind of faith.  And frankly, I do not  understand how you can read John, Ephesians, Romans, and Galatians and come  up with the Catholic position.  Catholicism has other doctrines that are in  error, but this one can keep people under chains.  Even if you are  Catholic, this will at least explain the Reformed position to you and clear  up some easy-believism misunderstandings.  I really do not understand why  people will give only one star if you disagree with the position.  Like  there was nothing else in the book that at least raised it to two stars.   That's the way people rate things on Amazon.  I mention this only to  encourage any Catholic to at least see what the other side is saying,  unfiltered through other mouths.  Sproul is one of the premier theologians  of our age, who studied under a premier theologian.  He is worth your time.
