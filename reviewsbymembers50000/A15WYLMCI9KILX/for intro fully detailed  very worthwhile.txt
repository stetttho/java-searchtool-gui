 This splendid little book gives a lot of information for an introduction  to church history.  It does two things well.  It covers the important  events of church history.  And it tells you why those events were important  to the church, so you can feel the influence of those events today. I did  not find the book too scholarly, but maybe that's because I'm a nerd.  I  don't know.  I wouldn't use this as my only church history book, but I  would highly recommend it.  I would give it 4 1/2 stars, which rounds up to  5.
