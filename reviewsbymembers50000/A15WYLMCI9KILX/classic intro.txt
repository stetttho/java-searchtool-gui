 This is a great book which discusses Christianity's foundational beliefs.   Just four parts.  Jesus' person.  Our sin and need for a savior.  What  Jesus did to rectify the situation.  Our response to that work of Jesus.   Very foundational, very good.  If you are looking for another like it, read  Lewis' Mere Christianity.
