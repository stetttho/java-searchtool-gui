 No guitar heroics in the album, but that is fine with me.  Not nearly as good as "From the Cradle" but this is a richly satisfying album. Keys to the Highway was my favorite song, esp. if you remember the  song as performed by Derek and the Dominoes. The best way I can describe  the album is that it has a good vibe.  Clapton and King complement each  other very well.  Clapton lays back on the guitar, but that makes it better  for me.  The songs seem to take precedence over the artists.
