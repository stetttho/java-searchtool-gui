 For a long time I have been looking for an album that does classic hymns in a manner which not dressed-up.  In other words, I wanted something I could get into and sing along with.  This fits that bill perfectly. Modern Christian praise music can be largely summed up with one word: innane.  The theological content of most worship or praise songs is shallow.  Most hymns, not all but most, are not.  The words are rich and weighty.  That have intellectual content.  It is important to worship God with mind as well with soul.  The traditional music for most hymns, which I like in church settings, is hard for people to get into.  This CD should help those people become acquainted with the great songs on this album. My only critique of this CD is actually the music.  A lot of the music sounded very similar from song to song.  And many times the tone of the music did not seem to match the words.  The tone of music does express theological content and themes so this is important.  Also, most songs are very upbeat.  Some of these hymns would do better with a little more mellow music.  On the other hand, most hymns I hear recorded not of this style are hard to listen to on CD.  Done in a church setting, they are more easily participated in.  But this style lends itself towards the recorded medium more readily. All in all, a very good CD.  I highly recommend it.  A lot of these are old favorites.
