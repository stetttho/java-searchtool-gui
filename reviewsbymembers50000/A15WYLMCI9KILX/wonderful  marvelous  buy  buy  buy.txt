 There is a reason this book is rated so highly.  It is worth every penny  you will spend on it.  I would pay double the price, but don't tell the  publisher.  This is my favorite reference book, and my Java programming  would not be as productive without this book.  The book is huge, because it  covers every class within the standard library (io, net, lang, etc.).  As  much as I appreciate the O'Reilly Nutshell book, this is far superior to  that book.  This has something Nutshell doesn't.  Context.  Not only does  it have all the classes with all their methods, it puts each method in  context.  It shows you how they are used by providing relevant example code  and descriptions.  And the descriptions in the book are wonderful.  You  will look up a class and find a related class that will work better for  your needs.  I especially recommending getting this book for a team of  developers.  Leave the book in the room for office use.  If you can so  afford, get it for each developer.  This is like the Post-it note.  You  would never live without it, even though you managed and may have even done  well before it came along.
