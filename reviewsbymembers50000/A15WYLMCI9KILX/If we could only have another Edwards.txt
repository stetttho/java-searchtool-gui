 Edwards is the greatest mind America has every produced and his stuning logic, acumen, and biblical knowledge are on display here.  Edwards, unforetunatly, is only known today for hellfire and brimstone sermons.   This is unfortunate because this does not represent the totality of what he  talked about.  His 'hellfire' sermons are in here.  Unfortunately for  humanity, he was correct.  If you do not understand God's holiness and  justice, these sermons will seem cruel and sadistic to you.  (I would  suggest you read R.C. Sproul's Holiness of God.)  However, if you are  willing to be challenged with the extent of your own sin, read on.   Jonathan Edwards is a giant among men.  I wish we could have another like  him for today. This book is not for those who want a light read.  Edwards  doesn't write like that.  Bring your thinking cap.  You must also remember  he was speaking and writing in the 1700's.  The style of the prose reflects  that.  But his genious still comes through.  I thank God for Edwards and I  highly recommend this book.
