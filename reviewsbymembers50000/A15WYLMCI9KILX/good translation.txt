 Unless one is using the original Greek, which I don't, one should try to have a few translations at hand.  This is one I fully recommend having, because it will bring out the inherent Jewishness that is already in the  text.  This is long overlooked, and it is great that this translation  exists.  One should be warned that it is only one translator, so bias can  more easily creep into the translation.  But for what it does, it does  well.  I would not use it as my sole New Testament, but I would and do use  it.  I especially love reading the four gospels in this translation.
