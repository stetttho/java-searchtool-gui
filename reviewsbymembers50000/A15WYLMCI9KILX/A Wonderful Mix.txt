 The book is short and so are the sections.  And for some reason, it gives the book a certain charm.  You can take a minute or two and read the next section, and if you want put it down.  There is a lot of information in  each section.  The first part of the book is biographical in nature. The  more interesting part, in my opinion, is the second part.  This is where  the editor really shined and his admiration and understanding of Lewis  shines through.  Each section deals with Lewis' thoughts on certain  subjects.  It is not really biographical...it is picking the brain of a  giant.  The book is truly wonderful and I suggest it for all Lewis fans, or  for those serious about becoming more acquainted with his thoughts.  Would  make a great gift.
