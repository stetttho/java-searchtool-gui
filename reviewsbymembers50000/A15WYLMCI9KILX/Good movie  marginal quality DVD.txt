 The movie tells a good story, albeit one revolving around porn.  My  friends tend to like it because Heather Graham is naked in the movie.  I  know she is beautiful, but I tend to like it because the film has wonderful  camera work.  I was lucky enough to see this film in college, while I was  in the middle of a film class.  The first scene at the night club will show  you what I'm speaking of. Now, onto the DVD.  The DVD doesn't add much  features.  It isn't well produced at all.  It just seems that someone  wanted this as a DVD release and they had two days to put it on the disk.   Now, naturally, this doesn't detract from the movie.  And if you want the  movie on DVD format go ahead and buy it.  But I would think about waiting  until a better version is put out.
