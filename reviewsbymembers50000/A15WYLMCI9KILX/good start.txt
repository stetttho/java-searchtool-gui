 I have normal complaints about events not on the list, but all in all, it is a very good place to start.  I think it is very helpful in identifying recoccuring patterns in church history.  The rise of monastic orders, the  decline of monastic orders, the tension between freedom of worship in  letting the Spirit move and a structure to move within.  These ongoing  patterns are mentioned again and again.  The authors are not very critical  in some spots, where they should be.  Charles Finney, even though he  belongs on the list, was a heretic and should be mentioned as such.  The  negative ramifications of his thought and practices are not explored.   Likewise, the significance of World War I in destroying postmillenialism  and the significance of the Holocaust are not explored.  But what it does,  it does well.  It gives you a good cursory overview of church history by  giving you a lot of short vinettes.  I highly recommend it, but I would not  rely on it solely.
