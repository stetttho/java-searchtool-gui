 I have talked to Kubrick fans who just didn't like this movie.  He is a hard cookie to crack, but even for those who normally like his work, this  isn't that good.  I'm sorry he had to end his life with this movie.  The  acting is good and the set design and costumes are worthwhile.  The music  stinks.  If you notice the music throughout a movie, it is subtracting to  the film.  The score's role is to draw you into the film.  This does  nothing of the kind.  It's jarring.  I understand that is what the theme of  the movie is about.  You are jarred from your perception of the world, but  when I'm jarred from the movie I get upset.   The biggest problem of the  film is the overall point of the movie.  Things aren't as you know them to  be and how do you react.  The Matrix is the same thing, only fun and  futuristic.  This is just belly-button watching.  No dramatic conflicts.  I  don't care how the characters react, because psychologically it's not very  interesting.  The overall feeling is "that was great."  You have  invested too much time for no payoff.  I will not be drawn into liking this  because it is fashionable to like Kubrick, like it is fashionable to rebel,  etc.  I am not anti-intellectual or anti-slow pacing.  I'm  anti-pointlessness.
