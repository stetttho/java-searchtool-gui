 I'm coming to this from a Reformed perspective, but when I first got my Quest Study Bible I was an Arminian.  I tell you that in order to say that the Bible is good for all Christians wanting to engage the texts.  It is a  starting point and should be treated as such.  Namely, it will not take  definitive stands on issues Christians can reasonably disagree, like  election.  But it will give you the differing views.  Many in the Christian  community may think all Christians are pretrib, premil, Arminians.  That  isn't the case and the editors knew this.  It is also good for dealing with  specific difficult verses, besides addressing the big picture questions.  A  mini-concordance in the back is also useful. After you start here, I  would suggest getting a book or two on Bible difficulties.  When you tackle  passages you don't understand, you will be amazed at how accurate and  beautiful the Bible is.  If you are too lazy to wrestle with those  passages, you miss out.  People should also move onto commentaries by the  giants of our faith: Calvin, Luther, Spurgeon, John Owen, Matthew Henry.   I've mentioned all Reformed commentators, but I'm sure you can find good  non-Reformed giants as well.
