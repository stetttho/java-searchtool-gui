 A little background first so I'm upfront.  I'm a Gentile believer who has  been involved with the Messianic Jewish/Jewish-Christian community for the  last 7 years.  In the summer of '97, I was an intern for Moishe Rosen,  their founder.  I also got to know several of the staff members well,  especially their executives and heads of their different branches. This  book is really accurate.  Many of the stories I have heard before.  The  story of Jews for Jesus is primarily about proclaiming the gospel.  For all  the flaws of this organization (or any organization) or the people in Jews  for Jesus, people are missing the point.  This group of people are  incredibly committed to proclaiming the gospel.  From being around them, I  can tell you it is downright infectious.  This is what the book, and their  story, is all about.  They are incredibly serious about Jesus and His  gospel.  Hardworking, but fun-loving. Having worked under Moishe Rosen  closely for about two months, I would like to say that this book is  inadequate.  He is an incredible personality, which cannot come accross in  a book.  Being discipled by him is an amazing experience, and I feel  blessed by it.  His concern for people is genuine, and I believe it shows  in this book.  But I did want to point out that this book cannot capture  him fully for the reader. This book does not gloss over problems, but it  does not gloss over the wonderful things as well.  The author's background  in investigating other Christian and cultic groups served her well here,  esp. because of all the "cult" allegations against the group.   She helps to give a well-balanced, historical perspective. Lastly, she  also does not fully capture the friendliness of the people I met and worked  with.  They are people who you can make very close, fast friendships  with. If you want a good, balanced, and accurate record of Jews for  Jesus, buy this book.
