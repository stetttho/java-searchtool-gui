 I do not wish to resay what previous reviewers have said.  Needless to say, this book is about clarifying the relationship between Scritpture and tradition; clarifying what sola scriptura actually is, saving the doctrine from Rome and from modern evangelicals in a balanced, historical perspective. Mr. Mathison has done the church quite a service.  For those who hate the authority of the church and for those who elevate the church above Scripture, this will not be a popular book.  It will produce a lot of dialogue, I hope, but it won't sit well.   The book is methodical in its historical overview of the role of Scripture.  Many things will become apparant from this book: 1) Sola Scriptura or Tradition I(as it is in the book) is the early church's position 2) numerous (and I mean numerous) examples of the fallibility of infallible Roman Catholicism are on display in this book. Rome is ruled by the magesterium of the moment.  Since they are assumed to be infallible, they cannot be corrected.  Even though any reasonable unbiased person can see that some of their current positions are not ones the church has held in the past. Although, in the end, it is admitted that Rome is part of the visible church. 3) The individualistic notions in modern evangelicalism is really really bad.  Too much of the Anabaptists and not enough of the Reformers. Along the way, Mr. Mathison deals with objections and raises many issues.  This is highly deserving of his five stars.  It is time to place Scripture, tradition, and the church in its proper and historical place.  Towards that end, we should pray.  And towards that end, I highly recommend this book.
