 If Catholics want to understand why unity is impossible, I would read this book.  Protestants should read it and try to figure out how much truth should be sacrificed on the alter of unity.  The most important sections  was how the false claims of the papacy rose.  I would suggest Calvin's  Institutes as another reference.  Michael Horton is also an engaging  writer.  Also deals with core issues such as justification and Catholic  veneration of Mary.
