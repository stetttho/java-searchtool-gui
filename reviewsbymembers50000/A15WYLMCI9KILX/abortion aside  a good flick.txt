 The trailors, the Oscars, and any other advertising will not tell you that abortion is a primary issue in the movie.  That is not to condemn or praise  it being in the film, but people should be aware of that fact.  It is a  Hollywood-liberal flick.  So Homer will only fulfill his destiny once he  sets aside his pro-life, pro-adoption feelings and starts performing  abortions.  It is indeed a propaganda piece, and Irving himself would  concurr.  If you are pro-life, I would not let this deter you from watching  the film.  It has many good qualities.  I just the movie companies should  actually be upfront about it. Abortion aside, it is not quite as good as  the amount of Oscar nominations would make you think.  Michael Kane gives  an ok performance, but an Oscar win is a joke.  Toby MacGuire does a fine  job and is very likeable.  It is an engaging film with many fine qualities,  I just don't see it being excellent enough to merit four stars.  3 and a  half is posibility though.
