 The Dixie Chicks are THE group for putting the soul of good country music back to mainstream audiences.  So much country music is just pop rock with a twang and a slide guitar.  The Dixie Chicks, esp. on this album, have tapped into that soul.  And of course old country was influenced by blues, bluegrass, etc.  You definitely hear the bluegrass influence in all Dixie Chicks efforts. This album was their first effort after fighting their label, Sony.  As a result, they have much more control of their music.  And oddly, they do more covers on this album with about 4 originals.  The cover of Landslide is a standout.  A solid country version of the classic rock song.  Different enough to justify remaking it.  Similar enough to make it a familiar favorite.  Long Time Gone, their popular single, is great and upbeat and takes a dig at country music radio.  White Trash Wedding is hilarious fun.  I also thought I heard something that was on my Deliverance soundtrack. If you are a Dixie Chicks fan, this is a must.  The group really evolves and that is a healthy sign.  If you don't think you like country music, give this a shot.  At one time I would have agreed with you before finding acts like the Dixie Chicks--don't let their success fool you! They are good.  If you like the Dixie Chicks try O Brother Where Art Though? soundtrack, best of Johnny Cash, best of Hank Williams, or be adventurous and try some delta blues, bluegrass, or oldtime gospel.
