 I came to the album as a huge Zep fan and a person who liked the Black Crowes but wasn't too familiar with them beyond their hits.  I came away with a great appreciation with the Black Crowes.  One of the most  overlooked facets of Led Zeppelin was how subtle some of their music was in  places.  For example, John Bonham, who will always be sorely missed, could  do so many little things on the drums.  The Black Crowes are extremely  talented and provide a lot of umph (that's a technical term) I haven't  heard since Appetite for Destruction. The selection of songs is  wonderful.  A lot of Zeppelin songs one doesn't hear too much on the radio.   Besides "Whole Lotta Love" and "Heartbreaker", these  are the Zep songs I love but don't get overplayed.  The raw energy in their  performances is evident.  Jimmy Pages has his licks back.  He sounds like a  man rejuvinated  by his mates on the project.  The old blues tunes come off  well and are fun.  I am especially fond of the rocking version of Oh Well,  which was a Fleetwood Mac tune.  This album just plain rocks.  I miss  hearing good guitaring so badly in today's whiny post-grunge, alternative  world, and this sorely fills that need.  Buy it if you love fun, rocking  music.
