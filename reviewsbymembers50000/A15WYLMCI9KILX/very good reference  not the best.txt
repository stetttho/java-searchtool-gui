 _The_ best Java reference is "The Java Class Libraries,"  published by Addison Wesley.  That book is good for all levels of Java  experience.  This book is a runner-up.  This is not to detract from this  book.  It is extensive, and it has a good introduction to Java in the  beginning of the book.  If you are new, pass this book by...for the time  being.  The only flaw I have with this book is that the methods of the  different classes are not put into context.  If you come across the  pertinent class and method to use, and you are still unsure of how to use  them, you'll still need to move on and find more info somewhere else.  That  is why I suggested the above book.  They actually complement each other.  I  would not do without this book.  It's widespread use is no accident.  With  O'Reilly you know you are getting nothing less than good, even if you are  not getting the best book in a given subject area.
