 This is a very good early VeggieTales.  They didn't quite hit their peak  yet with this one.  They do 2 segments instead of one larger segment.  In  between there is no song, but the Forgive-o-matic section is still good.   It's just no Silly Song.   This is a very good lesson for kids.  When  someone asks for forgiveness, give it to them.  I would note only one  thing.  A person who is truly sorry will do more than say he or she is  sorry.  That isn't mentioned in the video, but I also think it is an  oversight.  However, I have to keep in mind that it is geared towards kids.   Big Idea is trying to get the general message across, which they do very  well.  The parents need to be around to make sure the message in their head  doesn't become one of cheap grace.  We don't want our kids coming up to us  asking forgiveness when all they really want is to get out of trouble and  they genuinely aren't sorry.  But, as I said, this is more of a note than a  critique.  I highly recommend the video.
