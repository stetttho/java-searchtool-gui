 Sometimes someone is trying to get a message across just too badly.  This was a fine movie with some great writing and acting.  I even like the plot a lot.  I only have two qualms with the movie: 1) the alienation in the  suburbs motiff has been done before.  It's just too much.  The plus side is  that the message is multi-layered so it is worth repeat viewing to just  examine what exactly the story is critiquing.  You know it is complaining  about something, but the story is too engrossing to bother thinking too  hard about it on the first viewing.  But after you see it again and you  think about it, I found it too preachy.  In a liberal, holier-than-thou  sort of way.  Maybe I'm reading too much into it, I don't know.  The movie  aimed high and achieved a lot...    That's why I leave off a star.  You could see this coming a mile away.  You  just have to acquainted with leftist dogmas.  You see, everyone who  disagrees or hates gays is just self-repressing their own emotions.   Shallow, shallow, shallow.
