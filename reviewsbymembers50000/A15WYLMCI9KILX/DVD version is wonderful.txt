 I'm not going to review the movie, because if you are buying this I'm  going to assume you've already seen the movie.  I do want to comment on the  extraordinary quality of the DVD.  Most DVDs I've rented or bought are  horrible, except for the quality of the movie.  The companies just jam it  on a disk.  This disk is has high production values.  When you go to the  menu, it even has an errie visual and music.  The deleted scenes are  wonderful.  The director is taking you into the editing process of the  film. I agree with the director's decisions to delete the scenes he did,  but they are also wonderful.  The rules and clues, which I believe are also  on the video, are also wonderful.  The director seems to genuinely be a  happy man who likes his fans. A big negative is that Buena Vista makes  you watch previews for other films.  Fortunately, you can skip over them.   It is really annoying and I'm tired of living in a culture in which culture  is advertising.
