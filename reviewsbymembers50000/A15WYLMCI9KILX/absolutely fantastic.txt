 This is an absolutely fantastic product.  It has totally revolutionized how I cook.  I make everything from sandwiches to fajitas on this.  It cooks vegetables, meat, you name it.   Not only does it reduce fat and grease, it cooks well.  Really well.  Cooking times are shortened.  Meat comes out great.  Not dried out at all.  Even if it weren't for the obvious health benefits, I would use this.  It cleans up really well.  A damp rag is all that is needed.  Junk comes off really quickly.   This model has a slightly larger surface area than the original model. It  comes down to this: no one and I mean NO ONE who has this doesn't like this product.  This is a great product for those who don't have time to cook, those who love cooking, and everyone in between.  You'll eat healthier, well, and you'll have a lot of fun cooking.  Now go buy one.
