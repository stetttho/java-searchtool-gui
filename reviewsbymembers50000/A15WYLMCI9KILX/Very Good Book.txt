 I've been all over the Internet trying to find how to setup a brand new repository.  My book came.  I went to chapter 2.  After a few pages, everything was done easily. Pretty much all you need will be in here and it reads pretty easily.  I don't think every cvs user will need this.  But someone on a team of developers should have this around.  And the cvs admin should definitely ahve this book.
