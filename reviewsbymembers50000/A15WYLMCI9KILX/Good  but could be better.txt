 I have revised my opinion of this work.  It is quite solid with a good amount of analysis.  It covers a lot of topics and it covers them well.  I leave off a star for a variety of reasons which would make my rating 3 1/2 stars. 1) The book is weak where Dr. Geisler is weak.  As was shown in Chosen but Free, Dr. Geisler does not have a good grasp of Reformed theology.  This weakness appears from time to time. 2) It is not an encyclopedia.  It is a collection of Dr. Geisler's notes.  If he has problems with a position (Van Til comes to mind) he will let you know.  I like that, but that does not seem in keeping with the spirit of an encyclopedia. 3) As was mentioned earlier, this book desperately needs an index.
