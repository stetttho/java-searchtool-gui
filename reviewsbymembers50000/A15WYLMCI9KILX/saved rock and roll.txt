 This album was like D-day.  Nothing was the same since.  And as soon as it was released bands like Poison and Bon Jovi were doomed.  They would stick  around for a while, but it was only a matter of time before they were out  the door. The album is a celebration of raw energy.  While their later  Illusion albums are great as well, Gun n' Roses would never equal the  brilliance of this album.  But you know what?  No one else has since  either.  This was written by Guns when they were poor, angry, and not well  fed.  It shows.  It's gritty. Welcome to the Jungle is well known and a  great intro.  Nighttrain, Paradice City, Sweet Child o' Mine...all have  great guitaring by Slash, who is a guitar god.  Out ta Get Me, It's So  Easy.  There is barely a weak song on the album.  Which is pretty  impressive in itself.  Axl does a great job.  On many tracks it was hard to  tell it was him. You don't need many reasons to get this album, but I'll  sum up.  It has at least three songs you want to listen to (Welcome,  Paradice City, Sweet Child o' Mine) that you know of.  It has other jems.   If an album has at least 3 great songs, buy it.  Lastly, it is a historical  album.  It means so much to rock history.  In that regards, it is like Sgt.  Pepper's.
