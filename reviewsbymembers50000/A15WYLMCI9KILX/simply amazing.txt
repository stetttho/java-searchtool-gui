 One of the definitive works concerning the Soviet gulags.   It's first hand point of view completely draws one into the thoughts of the prisoners.  The utter despair of the situation is conveyed clearly.  It is simply  awful.  The psychological depths of this work are the most intriguing  parts, especially how loyal Communists deal with a situation caused by  Communists.  Reminds me a lot of Jews in Germany, pre-Kristalnacht, and the  thoughts and denials that ran through their minds. May the world please  give up the idea which is communism.
