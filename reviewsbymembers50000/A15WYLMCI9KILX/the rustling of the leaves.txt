 As I was watching the film, I was constantly reminded of the old Luther quote: "the sinner is frightened by the rustling of the leaves."   This film is about the piling on of lies and the consequences thereof.  It  is interesting from that moralistic point of view.  I would consider it a  modern-day morality play.  No matter what Ripley gets away with (lies,  etc), he is constantly haunted by his conscience.  Superb acting, a  top-notch cast.  Jude Law's big break.  We shall be seeing a lot of him in  the future.  Gweneth Paltrow does well in a supporting role.  Her elegance  and charisma doesn't overwhelm the other players.
