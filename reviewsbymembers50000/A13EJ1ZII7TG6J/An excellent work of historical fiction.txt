 In the 1550's when young King Edward was on the throne, a 14 year old Jewish girl and her father fled from Spain to make a new life in London.  It was the time of inquisition, and Hannah must put aside her faith if she wants to live. Her father is a Bookkeeper; and he teaches Hannah to read and write in many languages. Some of her knowledge she must keep secret; it's a dangerous time to know too much.  Hannah is more than just intelligent.  She has the sight; an ability to glimpse into the future. Enter the famous, driven, and headstrong Robert Dudley who instantly realizes how valuable Hannah is, and takes her to court to meet the King.  Young King Edward is delighted and moved with Hannah's direct and honest answers, and he orders her to remain at court working as a Holy Fool.  Before long, she finds herself Dudley's spy and a heretic, using her sight to tell Dudley the future. It's not long before King Edward dies, and Mary takes the throne, which is constantly in jeopardy with her half sister, Elizabeth, and Robert Dudley plotting against her.  Hannah remains Mary's closest friend and confident while fighting for her throne, at the same time she also Mary's greatest enemy, for she is still working for the Dudleys', and ultimately, Queen Elizabeth.  gde
