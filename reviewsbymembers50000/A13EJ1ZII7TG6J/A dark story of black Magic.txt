 In 16th century England, in the middle of the night, a Catholic Abbey is burned to the ground.  Alys is the only survivor.  She flees the burning abbey without waking any of her sisters.  Consumed in guilt, she finds her way to Morach; the village Wise Woman who takes her in and teaches her another religion...a darker one.  Alys hardly needs teaching; she is a natural witch, and a powerful one. Before long her healing skills are talked about all over the country, and the lord of the land, Sir Hugh, summons her to be his personal Healer and Wise Woman. There she captures the eye of Hugh's son Hugo, and she becomes obsessed with being the Lady of the Land.  She begins to practice a frightening form of Witchcraft so she can rise up the ranks, and put Hugo's wife; Catherine aside. Acting as best friend to the Barren wife of her lover, Alys aids her in conceiving, and the pregnancy ends in a terrifying birth and death. She soon finds herself so deep in black magic and evil; the only way to stop it comes about in a shocking yet fitting way.  gde
