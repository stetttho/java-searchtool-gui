 Thousands of years ago, 2 different peoples; the Neanderthals and the Cro-Magnons overlapped, and shared a space in history.  This is an amazing story of the end of one race, and the start of another.  The story begins with a young girl who lost her family in an earthquake.  Cold, hungry, and injured, she is picked up by the Medicine Woman of a traveling Clan of Neanderthals, looking for a new home.   Alya is made part of the Clan, but her way of thinking is not the Clan way.  She is constantly learning, and thinking for herself.  The Clan does not learn; they go through life "remembering" what their ancestors knew.  They are driven by tradition and superstition, and Alya's presence and instincts challenge the Clan, forcing the leader to make exceptions and changes.  This puts Ayla in the constant struggle with the next leader in line, who would rather see her dead then change the Clan way.  Graphic, heartbreaking, and a late night page turner, Clan of the Cave Bear is one of the best works of Historical Fiction I have ever read.  gde
