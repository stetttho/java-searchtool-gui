 Zach Braff writes, directs and stars in this gem of a movie.  His character is Andrew; an actor living in LA who has been estranged from his family and has been on some form of anti-depressants for the last 10 years.  When his Mom unexpectedly dies, he goes home to New Jersey and decides to ditch the prescription drugs.  He meets up with old and new friends while trying deal with unfamiliar emotions, with hilarious results.   He meets Samantha, a girl with her own quirky problems played by Natalie Portman.  These two unlikely and strange people form an honest and wonderful relationship that wakes up Andrew and saves them both.  I'm looking forward to more of Zach Braff's work.  An excellent start!  gde
