 Beverly Cleary has an amazing grasp of how youngsters perceive the world around them.  She never fails to add those important details that kids pick up on.  Her Beezus and Ramona books have been read and loved for decades.  Ramona the Pest is one of my favorites. Today is Ramona's first day of Kindergarten, and the biggest day of her life.  She really likes her young teacher Miss Binney, and she already has a crush on a little boy named Davy.  She is excited to learn about all of the important things her big sister Beezus already knows.  So why is everyone always calling her a pest?  Why is she always getting herself into so much trouble?   Reading about this imaginative little girl's antics will take adults back to their own youth, and young readers will love Ramona's simple but extraordinary life.  gde
