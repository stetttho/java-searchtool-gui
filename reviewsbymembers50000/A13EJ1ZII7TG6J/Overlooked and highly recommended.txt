 Beverly Cleary truly goes into the mind of the housecat in this amazing book. Meet Socks; a gray Tabby who has "chosen and trained" his adoptive young owners; the Brickers.  He is petted and spoiled.  He has a warm lap to lie on whenever he pleases, and is the protector of his domain, the Bricker home.  Just when life could not get any better, things begin to change in a big way.   The Brickers are expecting a child, and Socks suddenly finds himself second priority.  After a heartbreaking failure to run away, Socks and his family eventually find a way to live, well...happily ever after. This book is a must-have for your Cleary collection.  gde
