 I have always loved books about orphans.  Brothers and Sisters on the run, fending for themselves with no adults telling them what to do...this is what I wanted to read about! This book delivers all that, but with that nice 1940's politeness that you fall in love with.  Four siblings just ran away.  Their parents have died and they have taken the notion that their grandfather (their only living relative and guardian) will not like them.  This turns out to be just the opposite, because Grandfather loves them and is looking for them the whole time.  He has a bit of a hard time of it at first, because his grandchildren have taken up residence in an abandoned boxcar in the woods.  Benny is the youngest of the four.  He is very lively, and doesn't really understand what is happening around him.  He just knows he is on an adventure with his Brother and Sisters, and they make it a game for him. Violet comes next, and she is the sweetheart.  Very good and dear and pretty, she just wants her family to be safe.  Henry and Jessie are the oldest siblings, and they are incredibly resourceful.  Henry takes a job as a handyman for a mysterious young doctor in town so he can buy food, and Jessie is an excellent outdoor cook.  For a while, things seem to be ok.  When one of the kids get sick and the doctor has to make a boxcar call, things turn out for the absolute best! A fairy tale happy ending that will keep you smiling and launch a whole Boxcar mystery series reading frenzy!  gde
