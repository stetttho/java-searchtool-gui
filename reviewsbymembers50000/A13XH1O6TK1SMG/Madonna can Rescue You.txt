 Rescue Me is undoubtly one of Madonna's best songs to date. It is so powerful and full of energy. This single is the best version that has been released. It only has three versions, but the versions are somewhat differnt, compared to the U.S. Maxi that has five versions sounding very much alike.  The Tracks: 1. 7" Mix: This is the same version called Single version on the U.S. Maxi. I like the Immaculate Collection version better. It is longer and has a better ending.  2. Titanic Vocal: This is the best vocal of Rescue Me. It is basically an extended version, with some extra vocals thrown in.   3. Demanding Dub: This is the only single you can find the Demanding Dub. It is not spectatcular, but decent. Most of the lyrics used are not even from Rescue Me. They are lyrics that were put in, on the remixes.  This cd is becoming very rare, so you find it, I would Grab it.
