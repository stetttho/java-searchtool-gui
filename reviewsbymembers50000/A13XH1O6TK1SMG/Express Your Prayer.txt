 This is cd is fine cd, for the avid collector, die hard Madonna Fan (Like Myself) and just a lover of 80's music. You get 5 mixes of "Like A Prayer" and three of "Express Yourself". You will also find here the local mix of "Express Yourself", which was included on the orginal Vinyl, but not the remastered cd.   1. Like A Prayer (12"Dance Mix): This is a great version of Like A Prayer and is the version, the one that appeared on The Immaculate Collection was based on.  2. Like A Prayer: (12" Extended Mix): This mix is wonderful, because it is based on the orginal album version. The only thing I do not like about it is, that the first verse is left out, that is the best verse in the whole song.  3. Like A Prayer (ChurchApella): Okay this is not a true apella. It has softer vocals than the orginal, with little music. It is a very gorgeous version and wonderful for the lover of tame songs.  4. Like A Prayer (12" Club Version): This version is my fav version of Like A Prayer, it is based on the orginal and includes the first verse.  5. Like A Prayer (7" Remix/Edit): This is just an edit of the 12" Club Version.   6. Express Yourself (Non-Stop Express Mix): This is the version of Express Yourself, that would fondate the one that would make it to the Immnaculate collection. This version is very well done and turned out to be more popular than the Album.  7. Express Yourself (Stop and GO Dubs): Notice that Dub is plural here, that's because there are two dubs here. At about 6 minutes the first dub ends and there is about a 2second pause and new one begins. How Awesome!  8. Express Yourself (Local Mix): This version is a mix, that is based on the Abum version. I like it a lot, beause it is based on the orginal Album.   This cd is by far a Madonna must have, so you son't have this cd, then click "Add to cart" and BUY IT!
