 Madonna's anti-war song, American Life, is a wonderful song and the cd single is a great acommpy to the song.   1. Missy Elliott's American Dream Mix: The weakest of all the remixes. This remix is okay, but Missy Elliott's beats may work for her songs, but not Madonna's.   2. Oakenfold Downtempo Remix: The best remix here. This version keeps the orginal version, but adds some electronica sound to it.   3. Felix Da HouseCat's Devin Dazzle Club Mix: This a good remix of the song, but the song it sped up way too much.  4. Paul Oakenfold American Anthem Part 1: This is another good remix. It is by Paul Oakenfold, so you can't go wrong. It has an electronic feel to it and clocks in at over 10mis.  5. Paul Oakenfold American Anthem Part 2: This version is better than part 1. It always stays hot and never gets boring.   6. Die Another Day (Richard Humpty Vission Electrofield Mix): I dont' like this remix of Die Another Day, it is too slow and boring. The mixes on the Die Another Day maxi are better.
