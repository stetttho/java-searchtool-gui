 I must say, that this song is one of Madonna's best!! This single is a great single, too.  1) Single Version: Just the Edit Version, w/o the 1:00 of music at the begining, it just goes straight into the beat of Vogue and Madonna says "What are you looking at" and "Vogue" a few times, then the song begins.  2) 12" Version: This is proably the best mix on this cd. It is nothing more than an extended remix clokcing in at 8:19.  3) Bette Davis Dub: This version sounds much like the 12" version, but in dub form. Not the best mix.   4) Stike-a-Pose Dub: This dud sounds a little different from the Bette Davis Dub, but not enough to be a different track.  Vogue is of Madonna's best songs! I do wish that there would have been remixes that sounded different from each other and differnt from the orginial.
