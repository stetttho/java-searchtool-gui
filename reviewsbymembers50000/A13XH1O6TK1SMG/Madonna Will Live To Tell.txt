 In 1986 Madonna released the song Live To Tell, the first single from her third studio album, True Blue. In this song we hear Madonna vocals have deepened and she is singing with power and loss. This song saw the door opening to a new Madonna, the balladeer we love today. The songs here are mostly repeats, but this one still gets five stars.  1. LP Version: This is the best version. It is the full length version that appeared on True Blue.   2. Edit Version: I don't Like This Version. It is cut short by about 45 seconds. This version is the one that made to The Immaculate Collection.   3. Instrumental: I love this version. It is just the music to this gorgeous song.
