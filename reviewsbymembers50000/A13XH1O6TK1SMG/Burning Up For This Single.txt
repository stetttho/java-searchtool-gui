 Burning Up is one of Madonna's best 80's dance tracks. It's got great lyrics and a great beat. The single only has two tracks but it is still hot.  1. Burning Up: This is actually a remix (the 12"remix). This version has a heavier sound to it and uses more synthesizers. I prefer this version to the original.  2. Physical Attraction: This is the album version. This song is a great dance tune, but it's over 7 minutes long and gets a little boring toward the end. 5 minutes would have been a good cut off for this song.   This single is great to have if you don't have the re-mastered version of Madonna- The First Album.
