 This cd is Very good, except that all the songs, you can get on other collections/Cd's. It would have been nice if there was some songs that were not on other collections, here, but oh well it is still hot!!  1)La Isla Bonita (Extended Mix): A very good mix of this song, I love the song and an Extended mix is great, but it could have been longer, like 10 minutes.  2)Open Your Hear (Extended Mix): I really like this version, it is a good mix of the orginal. And it also sounds a little differnt than the orginal.  3)Gambler: I adore this song and it is wonderful that is song is on an easily to obtain EP. Truly a marvelous 80's classic.  4)Crazy For You: The classic ballad appears here to accompy the other Vison Quest, song. This is a Madonna classic. This version is a little bit longer than the one that appaers on the Immaculate collection.  5)La Isla Bonita (Instrumental): A nice ending to this EP. I love the song and the Music. This is not a real true instrumental, it has a few background vocals. This is the instrumental to the Extended Remix, not the album version, so that is a plus  This is a very good cd, to complete you collection and is priced better than the True Blue Ep @19.99.
