 The song "Take A Bow" is one of Madonna's most gorgeous ballads to date. The song brought her back to the top (atleast in the U.S.) and showed the world she has talent.   1. In Da Soul Mix: This is my favorite Remix. It has a very R&B/Soul feel to it. Some much R&B/Sould, this remix sound very sensual.   2. In Da Soul Instrumental: The instrumental to the previous. The music to this remix is gorgeous, so an instrumental is A+.   3. Album Version: The orginal version We all know and Love. Simply perfection.   4. Album Instrumental: The beautiful music that only Madonna and Babyface could create, is housed hear, alone.   5. Silky Soul Mix: A very tame remix. It has a soft beat and says Soul unlike any other.   This cd is a must-have for your Madonna Collection!
