 If you want a version of Bad Girl, this is the one. This one has three mixes of Erotica and one of Bad Girl.  1. Bad Girl (Edit): Again, this version takes away from Bad Girl, so I don't like it that well.   2. Erotica (WO 12") William Orbit, was the perfect canidate for this song. His beats are the perfect compliment to Erotica. This is my fav mix of Erotica, beacuse is uses the lyrics the version of Erotica, Madonna used on the Sex Book Version.   3. Erotica (WO Dub): A Dub version of the 12" mix. A really good dub. One of My Favs.  4. Erotica (Madonna's in my Jeep Mix): A Decent version of Erotica, but not my fav. William orbit's is much better.  This cd is becoming more and more rare, so buy it while you have the chance
