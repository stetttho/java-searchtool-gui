 The song Resuce me, is by far, one of Madonna's Best Songs EVER. But this single could have been better, Much better! The song is so powerful and full of energy, but these remixes are weak and and degrading to orginal, not to mention they all sound simmilar, except for the S.O.S. Remix (The only remix, I really like). I only recomend this song to the Die-Hard Madonna fan. Go for the Immaculate Collection, it has the longer Studio Version of Resuce me.
