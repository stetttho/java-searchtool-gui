 Despite this cd does not have the Video Version (Edit One) of "Fever" it is still a Really good cd!  1)Album Edit: Just an Edit of the Album Version 2)Hot Sweat 12": Good Dance Mix, but it does not deserve the name "Hot Sweat". 3)Extended 12": I do not like this version that well, because I do not like the album version that well, and this is moreless an extended album version. 4)Sheps Remedy Dub: My Least fav on this cd 5)Murk Boys Miami Mix: A great dance mix, I love it! 6)Murk Boys Deep South Mix: A great mix, but not as good as the Miami Mix.
