 I Love the Song "Rain" it is my favorite song Madonna has ever released and this Ep is incrediable. 1)"Rain" (Radio Remix): An okay version of the ballad, but to me, it takes power away from this gorgous song. 2)Waiting (Remix): a nice little additive to the U.S. Single and this Ep. It has a more hip hop/Kinky feel to it, than the orginal. I, however, like the Album Version the best. 3)"Up Down Suite": Included on every single of "Rain", Madonna must like this one. This is a 12 Min. Dub of the song "Goodbye to Innocence", which appeared on the abortion/womens right to choose compilation "Just  Say Roe". But I'd Go for the orginal, it is much better! 4)"Rain" (Album Version): The orginal and best version!  5)"Bad Girl" (Extended Remix): I love this mix. I wish this version would have been the album version, because it is so wonderful. It is basically an extended version of the orginal, but Oh So Awesome! 6)"Fever" (Extended 12"): Not that great. Nothing more than the extended Version of the Orginal (that appeared on the album Erotica) 7)"Fever" (Sheps Remedy Dub): decent, but not awesome. 8)"Fever" (Murk Boys Miami Dub): A Dub Version of the Murk boys Miami Mix. 9)"Fever" (Oscar G's Dope Mix): The only place you can find this Truly "Dope" Mix. This version is quite horriable, it is not really a mix, as much as it is a Dub. I'd give it 1/5 Stars. 10) "Rain" (Video Edit): an Edit of the orginal. Just like the one that is used in the Video for "Rain"
