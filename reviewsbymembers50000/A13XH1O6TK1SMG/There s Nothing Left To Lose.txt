 The Power of Goodbye is one of Madonna's most beautiful songs to ever come out. This cd is the second best version you can get. The best being the Jappensse version because you get another Remix (Luke Slater's Filtered Mix). All the versions here are great.   1.Album Version: This is my favorite version, of all. No matter how much you remix it, you can't tamper with perfection.   2.Dallas' Low End Mix: This a good version of the song. It is a more simplisitc version. You hear more of the acoustics in this version.  3. Luke Slater Supper Lupper: This is proably my least favorite version. This version sounds like it should be played in a wild dancing club. The only vocals from POG you hear are "Freedom Commes". This  version is great to dance to, but not to be considered a remix to "The Power of Goodbye"   4.Fabian's Good God Mix: This version is another dance version, but better than the previous. This version has more lyrics and sounds more like the orginal.   This is a very good version of POG. It is rather hard to find, as most versions of the single are, so if you see I would grab it.
