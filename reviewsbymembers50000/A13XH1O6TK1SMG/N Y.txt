 This is a must have cd for any Madonna fan, it is GREAT!!  1. Laugh to Keep From Crying: A good song, not my fav. This song really shows that Madonna could have an 80's Rocker Chick!  2. Crimes of Passion: A Very typical 80's Madonna song. Has a simmilar feel to the Orginal version of Into The Groove. Still a Great song.  3. Ain't No Big Deal ('97 Edit): A shorter Version of the 97 Version. Not that good, I really don't like any version of this song that well.  4. Everybody ('97): I like this version. They slowed it down from 117 to 105 bpm, which really works. This version has the same vocal tracks as the '81 version, but with the slower beat, it has a more tropical/regaee feel.  5. Burning Up: This is basically the blue print to the final cut that made it to Madonna - The first Album. I personally like this version the best, it has this Joan Jett sound to it, which again prooves that Madonna could have been an 80's Rocker chick.  6. Ain't No Big Deal ('81): The orginal version of this song. Like I said earlier, I really don't like this song that well, but this version is okay.  7. Everybody ('81): The orginal version of this classic. I really like this version, but the conversion from cassette to cd, did okay, but it really has that just getting started sound to it.  8. Stay ('81): Part of the two songs that made the "Like A Virgin" version of "Stay", this song does not sound too much like the '84 version, but it is still okay.  9. Don't You Know: The other song that was used to create the 84 version of "Stay", this where the chours comes from. I do like this song, though.  10. Ain't No Big Deal ('97 Extended Version):Just the full version of the '97 version of Ain't No Big Deal.
