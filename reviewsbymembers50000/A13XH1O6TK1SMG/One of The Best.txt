 In 1986 Madonna's third studio album was released. With the promotional song "Live to Tell" a new sense a maturtiy was seen in Madonna. Her voice had deepened (and she lost her resembelence to Minne Mouse) and her songs had a more "close to home" feel. After the success with "Live to Tell", next came one of the Material Girl's biggest hits ever, "Papa Don't Preach" an anti-abortion song that created somewhat a spark with some fans. Next the title Track was released, "True Blue" a teenage love song, with a catchy beat, made for one hell of a hit, but not enough to later make it to her first Greatest Hits album: The Immaculate Collection. The Fourth single to be released was "Open your Heart" another great song, that racked up success for Madonna. The final song to come from True Blue was "La Isla Bonita". This was Madonna's first stab at Musica de latina and this song gave Madonna her first #1 in Japan and another #1 in other Countries around the world.  The songs that did not make it to singles are still really great. They Included "White Heat" a great song dedicated to Jimmy Cagney. "Where's the Party" the dance anthem of True Blue, no Madonna cd would be complete without one. "Jimmy, Jimmy" another love song that has a repitious sense and Finaly "Love Makes the World Go 'Round" a song that discuses war and how we need to learn to love one another, "before it gets too late" 1986 proved to be one awesome year for Madonna, with her most successful Studio Album EVER.
