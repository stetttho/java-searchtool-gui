 This cd is deffiently sizzling! There are two differnt songs portrayed here: Bad Girl & Fever. Both songs are really great.  Track One: "Bad Girl" (Edit)  The radio version of Bad Girl, clocking in at 4:38 about 40 seconds shorter than the orginal.  Track Two: "Fever" (Murk Boys Miami Mix) A really hot remix of Fever. The beat has a lot of bass in it and is great to dance 'till you get the Fever.   Track Three: "Fever" (Extended 12")  Just an extended remix of the Album version, which is not that good, because I do not like the album Version of Fever as good as I do the Video Version (edit one).   Track Four: "Bad Girl" (Extended 12") A Beautiful version of Bad Girl, clocking in at over 6 Minutes. To me this version would have made a better album version. Because I love the song "Bad Girl" and the music is beautiful.   Track Five: "Fever" (Murk Boys Deep South Mix) A decent remix of Fever, but not as good as the Miami Mix. This song has a very strong bass but nothing to go with it, so it degrades the song, somewhat.  Track Six: Fever (Hot Sweat 12") A good dance version the classic sultrious classic, but not one that will give you "Fever".  All in all this single is really good. I wish there would have been more mixes of "Bad Girl" espically an instrumental, because like I said, the music is awesome. All the mixes of "Fever" found here, can be found on the "Fever" cd single, so if you just want "Fever" Mixes that single is better, you get these mixes, plus two more version of "Fever"
