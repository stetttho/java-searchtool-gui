 This is a rare version of Bad Girl, so if you can find it, buy it. The cd only has three songs, but it is still good.  1. Bad Girl (Edit): This is the edit of Bad Girl. I do not like this version, beause I love this song and edit, just ruins it.  2. Deeper and Deeper (Sheps Deep Bass Dub): This cd is the only place I have found this version. This version is decent, but not the best.  3. Deeper and Deeper (Sheps Deepstrumental): This is the instrumental to Deeper and Deeper. I love ths music to the song, so this is a plus for me. You can only get the instrumental on this cd and the U.S. cd single (which is also hard to find.)  This is a nice thing to add to your collection just because it is rare.
