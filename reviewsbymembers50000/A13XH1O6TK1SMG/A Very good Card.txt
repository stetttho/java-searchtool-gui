 When I ordered my new Olympus Camera I bought this card to go with it and I am very satisfied. I found this card to be rather fast saving images and loading them. And of course it will support panoramic pictures, which I love to take. To my knowledge this card uses a different technology than the x-D Cards that are less than one gb so be sure to check a camera compatibility list to see if yours will work. Also, I print many of my pictures at home, but if you take your pictures to your local photofinishing retailer, their machines may not be compatible with this card either. This card is definitely a step up from the smaller x-D Cards, but the photography world needs to update their selves to provide you with all the features this card has to offer.
