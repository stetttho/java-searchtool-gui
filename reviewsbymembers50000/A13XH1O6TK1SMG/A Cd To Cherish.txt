 This song is a classics 80's Tune by Madonna. It is has a very typical Madonna sound to it.   1. Cherish (Extended Version): A pretty decent remix of this classic tune, not much differnt from the orginal just longer.  2. Cherish (7"Mix/Edit): The radio version, that appeared on The Immacualte Collection.  3. Supernatural: An unreleased B-Side. This song is truly wonderful. This ranks as one of Madonna's best B-sides. The cd is worth the money for this song.
