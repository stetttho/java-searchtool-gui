 In 1999 Madonna released the Final single from the Grammy Winning Album Ray of Light. This single is Nothing Really Matters. This is a wonderful song, that has become overlooked.   1. Album Version: The orginial version of NRM. This is proably my favorite version. It has a haunting techno feel to it. This Version was very well Done.   2. Club 69 Radio Mix: This is a radio friendly remix, from Club 69 (Peter Rauhofer). This version has a more techno feel to it than the album version.  3. Kruder & Dorfmeister Mix: This is not really a true remix. It is more of a dub or an instrumental, because the only vocals are when Madonna says "Nothing takes the past away like the future". But none the less, it is still awesome. This is the most techno influnced version on this cd.
