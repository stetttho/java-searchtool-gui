 I aboslutley adore the song "Justify My Love" it is sensual, lustful and artistic. Madonna is one of the few artist that can see sex as an art and this song prooves it. The cd I am reviewing is the Five-Track U.S. Maxi single, which is better than this 3-Track import. This import contains The Album Version and William Orbit Mix Of Justify my love and Shep's 'Spressin' Himself Remix.    1. Justify My Love (Q-Sound Mix): This version is the same one that appeared on the Immaculate Collection.  2. Justify My Love (Orbit 12"): An early callboration with William Orbit. This version has an early techno sound to it. It is hot and sexy!  3. Hip Hop Mix: This version is the best one. The beats here are hip hop and hot!   4. Express Yourself (Sheps 'Spressin' Himself Mix): The best remix of Express yourself. I love it! You can never go wrong with Mr. Pettibone.  5. Justfiy My Love (The Beast Within Mix): This version could stand alone as song. It is completley differnt. The beat is incrediable. The lyrics are taken entirley from the Bible's book of Revelation. This song was also performed at the Girley Show and The Re-Invention Tour.   This is one of Madonna's best Singles, because all the songs are so differnt, unlike one of it's preceding Singles, Vogue.
