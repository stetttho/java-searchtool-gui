 This cd has only two songs on it, but is well worth your purchase.  Track One is the Extended Dance Mix of  Angel, which is okay. It is pretty much the same as the orginal, but longer and has a false clapping sound, like it is live. TRACK TWO: The main reason to buy this cd!!! INTO THE GROOVE, the orginal version, that appeared on the movie Depsretley Seeking Susan. This version is by far much better than the Immaculate collection one or the You can Dance Version. This cd is worth 12.99 just for Track Two. Do not hesitate about buying it!!!!
