 This is the, now rare, Japan Release of Vogue. It is a nice single to have. The songs here you can get on the U.S. Maxi's of Vogue and Hanky Panky. The nice thing about this is that it is rare, includes the lyrics and the more durable Japanesse jewel case insert.   1. Vogue (12" Version): This is an extended remix of Vogue, clocking in at over 7 minutes, it will keep you on the dance floor. The best remix of Vogue.  2. Vogue (Bette Davis Dub): Egh. I don't dubs that well and I do not like this one. It starts off like the album version and then goes into the beat of Vogue, but doesn't change. This is a very boring remix. It does not deserve to have a wonderful name like, Bette Davis, on it.   3. Vogue (Stike-A Pose Dub): This dub is better than the last one. This version starts off with the beat of Vogue and a groove that you will make you want to get on the dance floor, but it gets boring twoard the end.   4. Hanky Panky (Bare Bones 12" mix): This is basically a single mix of Hanky Panky. It sounds very much like the orginal, with a few more instruments.   5. Hanky Panky (Bare Bottoms Single Mix): First of all, This version should be the 12" mix because it is over 6 minutes long and the previous one is only 3:42 Oh well. This version is a little differnt from the orginal and a little longer, but still rather simmilar.   6. More (Album Version): This is one of the songs that appeared in the film Dick Tracy. It is very swing and has a very 30's sound to it. I love it.
