 This a neat single. It comes housed in a cardboard sleeve and then inside the cardboard sleeve, you will find another cardboard sleeve w/cd and a poster. The Poster is of the horse image, that is seen behind the cd in the U.S. Maxi. The tracks here are all found on the U.S. Maxi w/the exception of the Album Version.   1. Album Version: The One that appeared on the album, Music, not the  video.   2. Calderone & Quale Dark Side Mix: This remix is differnt from the others. It is has a tribal sound to it and it slower. In this version you hear more of Madonna's Vocals come out.  3. Above & Beyond 12" Club Mix: This version has a very techno/electronic feel to it. This version is great for dancing. The Above and Beyond Radio Edit (Not Included here) is the version used in the controversial Video of What it Feels Like For a Girl.   4. Paul Okenfold Perfecto Mix: This is a great version to play in a club or dance to, but not one to show off Madonna's vocals. They are very scarce here.  5. Richard Vision Velvet Masta Mix: The best remix I have heard. This one starts off Slowly and about a minute into the song, it burts into a differnt mix, that you will want to "Boogie Woogie" too.
