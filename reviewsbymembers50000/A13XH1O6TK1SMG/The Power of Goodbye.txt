 This is a real gem to have. The Japanese version is the best one of The Power of Goodbye. It contains all four commerical remixes Available and a supperior Jewel Case/Insert, as do all Japanese cds.   1. Album Version: The orginial version. You can not improve on perfection.  2. Dallas Low End Mix: This is a more simplistic version. You will hear more of the acoustics in this version than the album.  3. Luke Slater's Supper Lupper: NOT Supper. This version sounds like it should be a club version of Ray of Light. The only lyrics here are "Freedom Comes" and the are repeated over and over and over. This version is okay, but should NOT be a remix of The Power Of Goodbye.   4. Luke Slatter's Filtered Mix: Exclusive to the Jappanesse/Australian Version. This mix is a bit more "dark", shall I say. It has a real electronica feel, but I don't like the way the lyrics were done, at all.  5. Fabian Good God Mix: This version is decent. It is another club mix, but better than any of Luke Slaters
