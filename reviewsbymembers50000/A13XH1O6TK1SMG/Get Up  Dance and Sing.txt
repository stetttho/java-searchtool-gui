 Wow, this sounds so wired to say, but this is Madonna's first commerically released single. The song is quite good, to be Maddy's first. This song is actually one of my favs. The beat is really good and has a real club feel to it.  Track 1: is labeled instrumental version, but it is is not. This is a German misprint. Track one is actually the album edit.   Track 2: Another misprint. This is actually the dub version of "Everybody" but the cd says it is 9:28 seconds long, but is really 8:58. I am not too fond of Dubs, so this is not of my favs, but it is still okay.  The song itself, is wonderful, but the cd and labeling are poor, and needs to re-released correctly.
