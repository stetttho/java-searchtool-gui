 "Bedtime Story" is one of Madonna's most artistic and misunderstood songs, to date. The song and video are completly spectacluar and this cd is NO exception.   1. Album Edit: This is the video version to the Song.  2. Junior's Wet Dream Mix: This is one of the best mixes on the cd. It starts of tame and gets more incrediable by the second. This song has a lot of electronic sounds to it and will keep you on your feet all night.   3. Junior's Dreamy Drum Dub: This is another hot project from Junior. Junior uses many drums (Hence "Dream Drum Dub")that make this dub an awesome one.    4. "Survival" (Album Version): This is a B-Side thrown in to compliment the cd. This song is wonderful, but doesn't fit in well with "Bedtime Story". I would have chosen "Sanctuary", but oh well.  5. Orbitial Mix: This is the best mix on the cd. It starts off slow and quite and gets more energized by the second. The electronic and techno sounds used in this version are hot, hot, hot!!  6. Junior's Sound Factory Mix: Here we have another hit from Junior. This is the longest mix on the cd, clocking in at over 9 minutes. It is hot and great to dance to.  7. Junior's Single Mix: This is a shorter version of Junior Wet Dream Mix.  This is one of Madonna's best songs and the single is even better to go with it!!
