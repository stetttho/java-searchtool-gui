 Bye Bye Baby was the final single to taken from the album Erotica. It was primarly used to promote the Girlie show in Australia. The song itself is not one of my favorites, but I do like the single.  The Tracks: 1. Album Version: Just what is says. 2. N.Y. Hip Hop Mix: A pretty good DJ Mix. 3. California Hip Hop Jazzy: Not the best mix on the cd. 4. Madonna's Night on the Club: This is my fav mix on the cd. It is longer than the others and has a real club feel to it. 5. Rick Does Madonna's Dub: A decent version. 6. House Mix: This one sounds like the Madonna's Night on the Club Version. 7. Madonna Gets Hardcore: okay, not spectacular.  I gave this cd 5stars because I really like Madonnas Night on the Club.
