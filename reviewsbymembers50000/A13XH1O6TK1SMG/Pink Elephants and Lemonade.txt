 This song is highly overlooked and degraded, but it is a pretty decent Madonna song. I agree that is the video for this song was atroucious, but the song is okay. This song does kind of fit in with Like A Prayer, in the sense Madonna opening up to her childhood. The cd here is okay, but there is no remix, no unreleased b-side, or anything spectacular.  1. Dear Jessie (Album Version): This song is exactly like the Lp Version, except it does not fade into "Oh Father".  2. Till Death Do Us Part: Madonna's comeback song to former husband Sean Penn. This song goes well with Dear Jessie, but could have been more hardcore, if it's a comeback song.  3. Holdiay (12" Version): The full length version of Holiday.
