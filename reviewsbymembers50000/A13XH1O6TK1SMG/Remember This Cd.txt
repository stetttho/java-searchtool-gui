 In 1993, after the relapse with Madonna's Sex-Era, she needed a hit song. This song helped put her back on the top, where she belongs. I love the song "I'll Remember", it is a very simplisitc, gorgeous song.  1. Album Version: The best version and my favorite.  2. Guerilla Beach Mix: I don't like this mix. It is too long and it gives the song a differnt sound that just doesn't work.   3. Why's It So Hard (Live From The Girlie Show): This version is by far better than the album. In the album version, Madonna is singing softly and simplistic. In the live performance, her voice is full of power and energy.   4. Orbit Mix: This is my favorite remix of I'll Remember. It stays will the orginal song, while adding a little William Orbit sound to it.
