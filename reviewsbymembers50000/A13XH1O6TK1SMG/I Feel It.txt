 In 1993 Madonna released the Final single from her album EROTICA, Rain. Rain is proably one of Madonna's most powerful ballads and best! Madonna and Shep Pettibone composed a true masterpiece here.  This maxi is defintley a good one! The only version that is better than this one is the German Version, only because it has the Video version of Fever.   The Tracks Here are really good! 1. Rain (Radio Remix): This version is much more tame than the album, they take out some instruments. Then in the middle of the song where Madonna starts talking: "Waiting is the hardest thing..." the secondary vocals are removed. I prefer the album version to this one.  2. Waiting (Remix): An exclusive to the U.S. single and Jappanese/Australian EP. This version is a bit more Kinky than the orginal. The lyrics are the same, but the vocals were completly re-done. This version also features a rap from Everlast. I like the album version the best. 3. Up Down Suite: This song is not that good. It is nothing but a 12 minute dub of Madonna's song "Goodbye To Innocnce", included on JUST SAY ROE. There are basically no Vocals on this song, except for some words from the first verse of "...Innocence", which you can't understand and Madonna singing "Up Down,Down Down, Up, UP..." 4. Rain (Album Version): There isn't much to say about this one, other than, this is the best version that we all know and love!
