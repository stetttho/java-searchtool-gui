 This cd is one of my favs from Madonna. All 7 songs are hot. 1)Album Edit: Just the radio version 2)Shep's Deep Makeover Mix: the best mix on the cd!! Really hot! 3)David Klub Mix: another great mix! It'll keep you dancing all night long! 4)Shep's Classic 12" a pretty good 12" but not my fav on the cd. 5)Shep's Firece Deeper Dub: a decent version and not bad to be a dub. 6)David's Love dub: I am not a fan of Dubs, but this one is an execption. This is proably the best dub, I have heard. A must have!! 7) Sheps Deep Beats: This is proably my least favorite mix, on this cd. It is just Shep mixing some radmon beats, while Dubing Madonna saying, "Gretta Garbo", and is only 2:57 long.
