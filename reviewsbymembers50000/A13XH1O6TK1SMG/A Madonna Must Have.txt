 I love this cd and Part 2. They are both great cds to add to your collection 1. Drowned World (Album Version): Version that appeared on Ray of Light 2. Drowned World (BT & Sasha's Bucklodge Remix): This remix is wonderful. The album version of the song is very mellow and slowed down, whereas this remix gives the song power and strength.  3. Sky Fits Heaven (Sasha Remix Edit): This is a shorter version of the remix that is on Drowned World pt 2. I personally like the longer the best, but this one is still good, for anyone who is not a fan of longer songs.  I do wish that there were more remixes of Drowned World, thoguh, but this cd is still great!
