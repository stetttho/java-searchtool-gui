 This cd is a great release. This is the Jappanese version of Keep it Together. It is like having two single in one (as most Jappanese singles are). Also the lyrics for Cherish and Keep it Together are included, and the Jewel case insert is a stronger more duriable paper than the ones in U.S. Releases. The mixes here are also great.   1. Cherish (Extended Version): This is a longer version of Madonna's cheeky pop hit. It clocks in at 6:18 and is better than the orginal.  2. Keep It Together (12" Remix): This a longer version of the single Remix (Not included here). This is a softer version than the orginal. I am not too fond of it, but it is okay.  3. Keep It Together (Dub): Not included on the U.S. Maxi, this version is pretty good to be a dub. It is a dub of the 12" Mix.   4. Keep It Together (12" Extended Mix): This is my favorite remix. It is based on the orginal and has a very late 80's early 90's sound to it.   5. Keep It Together (12" Mix): A Shorter Version of track 4.  6. Keep It Together (Bonus Beats): Another exclusive to the Japan single. This mix is very short, only like 3 minutes. It is basically just beats from the 12" Extended mix and a few new ones with few vocals.   7. Keep It Together (Instrumental): The instrumental version of the 12"Mix
