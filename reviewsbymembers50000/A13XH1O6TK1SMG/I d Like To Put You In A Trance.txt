 In 1992 Madonna would shock the world, yet again, with the Dominatrix Style Song, Erotica. This song is a very good song by Madonna, despite it's controversy.  1. Album Edit: Just what is says.  2. Kenlou B-Boy Mix: This version is okay. I am not too fond of the instruments used. An alternate version of this song, was used on The Girlie Show.  3. WO 12" - The Best mix of Erotica. One thing I love about this version, is that it used the lyrics from the Sex Book song "Erotic". William Orbit's famous beats and tunes fit in perfectly with "Erotica".  4. Underground Club Mix: A Pretty decent version of the song. I do like the hissing at the begining.  5. Masters at Work Dub: Proably the worst version of Erotica. This version was not a great piece of work, it sounds like they made it in 2minutes.   6. Jeep Beats: This version is a really good version, because it included lyrics like "You Thrill Me, You put me in a Trance" these are lyrics from the orginal version of "Erotica" which was titled "You Thrill me".  7. Madonna's in My Jeep Mix: I don't know why this version was even included here, it is almost exactly like the Kenlou B-Boy mix. This song comes in right behind Masters at work dub, being my second least fav. version.  Overall This cd still gets 5/5 Stars
