 This cd has been very overlooked, but it is wonderful. All the tracks are great. 1. The 12" Formal Mix: Despite this version is nothing more, than an extended remix, it is still very good!! It is a little better than most 80's mixes.  2. The Casual Instrumental mix: This is this instrumental of the Album Version.   3. Sho-Bee-Doo: I really like this song, and it is a nice B-Side. You have to listen to more than the first few seconds to really like the song, but once it gets started it's great.  This cd also was the first single, in which, Madonna was titling the remix something associated with the song (i.e. The 12" FORMAL mix or CASUAL Instrumental mix.)
