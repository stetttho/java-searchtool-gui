 Love profusion is a great song by Madonna. The lyrics are beautiful and the tune is great. The U.S. Maxi is the best version, because you get six mixes of Love Profusion and one of Nothing Fails. The best thing about the UK set of Love Profusion is that the cover has a picture of Madonna; whereas, the U.S. Maxi just has a picture of flowers.   1. Love Profusion (Album version): Not included in the U.S. maxi. This is nice if you just like the song and don't want to buy the album.   2. Love Profusion (Ralph Rosario House Vocal Mix): This version is a good dance mix of Love Profusion. This is good, but The Blow Up Mix is the best (you can find it on the U.S. Maxi).   3. Nobody Knows Me (Above and Beyond 12"): This is the best mix of Nobody Knows Me. It has a great trance feel and great for a club. You can also find this version on the U.S. Maxi of Nothing Fails.
