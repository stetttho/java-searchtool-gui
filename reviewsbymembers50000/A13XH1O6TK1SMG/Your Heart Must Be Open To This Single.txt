 "The Power of Goodbye" is one of Madonna's best songs to date. This cd has no spectacular songs on it, but the cd is the real gem. It is a picture cd. The cd has the same image as the cover, but with a blue background; it is gorgeous. All the remixes on this cd, you can get on the German Single and Japanese Remix Cd.   1. "Power of Goodbye" (Album Version): The best version I have ever heard. You can not improve this version.  2. "Little Star" (Album Version): This song is from the album Ray of Light. It is a nice song about Madonna's daughter.   3. "Power of Goodbye" (Dallas Low End Mix): This is a mix by one of Madonna's producers on Bedtime Stories: Dalllas Austin. This is basically an alternate single version. The acoustics in the song really come out more than the album. It is tame and simplisitc.
