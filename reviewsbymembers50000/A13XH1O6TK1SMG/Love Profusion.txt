 Love Profusion is one of Madonna's best songs to date. It has beautiful lyrics and a great tune. The UK single is divided into parts one and two (as all UK singles are). If it is remixes you like then go for the U.S. maxi you six mixes of Love Profusion and one of Nothing Fails.   1. Love Profusion (Album Version): A version that you can't get on the U.S. Maxi. This is nice if you just like the song and don't want the buy the album.   2. Nothing Fails (Radio Edit): An exclusive to the UK CD 1. This is a shorter version than the album version. I like the album version the best though.   3. Love Profusion (Passengerz Mix): This an okay verson of Love profusion. It has a techno feel to it. The best mix is the Blow Up Mix (Which you can find on the U.S. Maxi)
