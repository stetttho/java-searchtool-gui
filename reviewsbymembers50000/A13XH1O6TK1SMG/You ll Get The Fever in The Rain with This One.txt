 The German version of Rain is the best one that is out there. This is must have.  1. Rain (Radio Remix){Edit}:This is the radio remix without the spoken words in the middle. The spoken vocals are the best part of the song, so why take them out??   2. Fever (Edit One):The Main reason you will want this cd. This is the video version of Fever. The one everyone loves. The one that is 100 times better than the album version. This cd is worth the money just for this song!!  3. Rain (Radio Remix):This version is better than the edit, because it included the spoken vocals in the middle. This is a more simplistic version of "Rain". Though with it's simplicity, it takes so much power away from the song. The orginal is the best.   4. Goodbye To Innocence: This is one of the most atroucious dubs I have heard. It is a 12 minute dub of "Goodbye To Innocence". The only vocals here, are the ones included in the first verse of GTI and "Up, Down, Up Up..." The orginal version is the best go for it. (You can find it on "Just Say Roe")
