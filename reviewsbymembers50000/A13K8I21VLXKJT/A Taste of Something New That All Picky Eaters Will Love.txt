 I LUFF this CD.  It is brilliant, better than any other CD I've seen.   1. Not Gonna Get Us *****  A great song, their beautiful voices are introduced in this first track. 2. All the Things She Said *****  The radio favorite and the first I heard of t.A.T.u.  A powerful song. 3. Show Me Love *****  Fantastic lyrics: may just be my favorite track on the CD. 4. 30 Minutes ***** A beautiful, beautiful cut.  It's deep and sad and...beautiful. 5. How Soon is Now? **** Four stars, I didn't like this cover as much as the other songs on the CD. 6. Clowns ***** Creepy and cool, meets up with standards totally, yo. 7. Malchik Gay ***** A great powerful song with a catchy beat and tune.  Love it. 8. Stars  ***** Beautiful, the Russian in the background makes it all the more enchanting. 9. Ya Shosla S Uma ***** The Russian version of track 2.  I feel it is more passionate than the English version,specially the end. 10. Nos Ne Dagoniat ***** For some reason I like the English version of this better, but still 5 stars. 11. Show Me Love--Ext.  *****  Same review as the one for track 3, luff it. t.A.T.u is a breath of something new, and I adore them.
