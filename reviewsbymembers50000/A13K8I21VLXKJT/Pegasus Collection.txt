 The second DVD in the Pegasus Collection has it all--funny episodes, serious episodes, and touching episodes.  We all look to the episode, Protect Mamoru! Jealousy of Usagi the Ninja.  Without a doubt this is the best, or at least the funniest episode on the DVD.  It starts out with hilarity when Diana mistakes some smoke for a fire and Rei, getting the fire extinguisher, trips and sprays it everywhere.  Then Mamoru ends up staying at Rei's place, much to Usagi's discontent.  This episode is just one hilarious thing after another as Rei accidentally sees Mamoru in the bath, Grandpa Hino tries to teach Yuuichiro to get girls, and, the highlight of the episode in my opinion, Usagi dresses in a ninja costume and stalks Rei throughout Mamoru's stay there.  Diana's innocence is cute too.  The other episode I'm going to feature in this review is Try for the Best of Japan! The Worries of a Beautiful Girl Swordsman.  Little Miharu, seemingly misunderstood by her mother, stays with the Tsukinos for awhile.  She is trying to be the best swordsman in Japan, but her mother battles her and acts cruel to her.  Usagi and Chibiusa are furious and confront her, only to be told to leave her alone and to go away.  Miharu is fooled by Tigerseye and after she is found not to be hiding Pegasus in her dream, helps defeat the Lemre.  She learns a lesson and her mother turns out to be justified after all.  A sweet episode.  Also don't miss Fisheye's first episode, Makoto's friend Tomoko, Ami helping to fix a car (?), and Chibiusa nearly being revealed as having Pegasus in her dream.
