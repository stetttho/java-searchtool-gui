 That sums up Jaclyn Moriarty's book pretty well.    I read the kind-of prequel (you'll see why it's "kind-of" when you read it), Feeling Sorry for Celia, after I read this book, but it confirmed my new-found love of Jaclyn Moriarty. I've beyond lost count of how many times I've read this novel. It is one of my favourite books in the world.     Just the inanity makes it so much fun. The voices are matter-of-fact, but you can tell all of the characters are at least a little crazy. (Everyone is. Especially me.) At first it seems to lack a point (despite how much fun it is), but the deeper you get into the story, the deeper it actually gets, while still keeping the fun going. For example, the climax of the book is told in a transcript format, typed by a character who had, up until then, been very minor.    The premise of the book is three best friends, Lydia, Cassie, and Emily, who go to a private school and, in English class, are assigned to write to students of a nearby public school. At first their friendship is like a pastry--airy, with little substance. Only when the book goes on do you realise just how much they care about each other. Cassie's part in the book is the most heartfelt, as her friends try to save her from thinking she's crazy. This book has such a rollicking cast of characters, right down to the parents and bit characters, like Cassie's counselor. I love books that are character-driven, and this was one. I would recommend this book to absolutely anyone.
