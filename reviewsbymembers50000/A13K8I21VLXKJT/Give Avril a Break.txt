 Personally, I love every song on this CD.  Sure, her "punk" image may not be correct, but the songs really are wonderful.  Avril is not at all a Britney, or anything like her, and she actually has a pretty good voice AND she writes her own songs.  Personally I applaud Avril Lavigne for trying and producing a pretty good CD on her first try.  Give Avril a break, and just talk about the actual CD in these reviews (you're not reviewing Avril herself!)
