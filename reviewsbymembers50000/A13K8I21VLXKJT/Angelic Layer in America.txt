 When I first read the Angelic Layer manga, I loved it.  This is another adorable creation by Clamp, with its lead character, Misaki, reminiscent of Sakura of CCS and Hikaru from MKR, with her own little speech quirks.  (Na?)  When I saw that the anime was coming out, I was overjoyed.  I got the first DVD immediately and just got the second for Christmas.   Angelic Layer is an adorable anime about believing in yourself and your angels (fighting dolls that you maneuver with your minds.)  In the end it is about your own personal strength.  It has another Clamp-like amazing cast of characters, from Misaki to "wiggly" Icchan" to Tamayo who attacks innocent people...^.~  It is a highly recommended anime, and the opening and ending themes are really cute and wonderful.  Fans of Cardcaptor Sakura and even something like Pokemon would likely enjoy this anime.  I'm getting each DVD as soon as they come out.
