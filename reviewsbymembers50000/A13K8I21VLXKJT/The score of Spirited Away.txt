 Spirited Away (or Sen to Chihiro no Kamakushi) is my favourite movie.  It is glorious anime, and I had always loved the soundtrack.  When I saw how cheap it was, I immediately bought it.  It is a lovely score with several beautiful, cute, and dramatic pieces of music.  My favourite tracks are numbers 1, 5, 7, 11, 16, 20, and 21.  If you saw the movie, get the soundtrack, because it's beautiful.  I cannot recommend it enough.
