 First of all, this editorial review is really awful.  It's MISAKI, not Misaka, and HIKARU, not Hiraku.  What's with the "violence and risque humor"?  This show has about as much violence and risque humor as Pokemon!  If American viewers find Icchan and Misaki's slightly odd (but not icky in any way!!!) mentor/student relationship skewed or anything, then they are skewed.  Icchan is WEIRD!!  I AM WEIRD!!  He's COMIC RELIEF!  His stalkery habits are FUNNY and not at all twisted.  And Misaki is a sweet, trusting, innocent little girl.  This review is very disdainful and truly doesn't capture Angelic Layer for what it is:  an adorable, sweet, simple but not sugary, show about believing in yourself and trying your best.  It is one of my favorite shows ever.
