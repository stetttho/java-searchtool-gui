 I got this movie today in the mail and all I can say is WHOA.  Major turning point in the S series.  In the first episode, Minako is a little...shall we say put off that she hasn't been targeted for a pure heart.  She is targeted eventually.  She, Usagi, Haruka and Michiru are trapped in a parking garage.  They must henshin and find out each other's identities.  Eugeal fails (as usual) and "runs" away.  In the second ep Mimet, another Witches 5, puts a thumbtack in Eugeal's slipper and snails in her locker.  Eugeal is furious at Mimet and starts trying new methods.  Meanwhile, at Haruka and Michiru's apartment, Eugeal has phoned them telling them she has found the holders of the talismans.  Then...the beautiful part.  Michiru clasps Haruka's hand---"Don't worry, I like your hands."  I bet they cut it out in the dub.  The lovely 'Haruka's Song' plays in the background.  After threatening Usagi with death if she interferes, Haruka and Michiru go to the cathedral where Eugeal is waiting.  She informs Uranus and Neptune of their talismans and tries to take Uranus's talisman.  However, Neptune breaks her bonds and struggles across the bridge, even though the red platforms shoot her.  She makes it to Uranus and Eugeal easily extracts her talisman.  Usagi arrives and knocks Eugeal over the edge, which stalls her for a while.  Usagi tries to return Michiru's talisman, but Haruka stops her.  She takes Eugeal's gun and extracts her own talisman.  The senshi arrive to find Usagi sobbing over Uranus and Neptune's bodies.  In the third episode, it seems Eugeal will win and have the talismans, but the mysterious Meioh Setsuna has more up her sleeve than Sailor Moon and the others think...watch this movie, you won't regret it!!!!!!  ~Sailoruranus115
