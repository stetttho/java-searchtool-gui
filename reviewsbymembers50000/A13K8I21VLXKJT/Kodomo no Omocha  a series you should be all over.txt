 If you are thinking of buying this book, don't think anymore!  Quit reading my review, and go buy it!  If you are not too financially strapped, buy all of the others in the series, or at least a few more, because from the first volume it just gets better. Okay, if you stuck around for some reason, I will explain to you why you should get Kodocha: Sana's Stage.  The standard explanation for the book is that it is about a hyper child actress named Kurata Sana, and her enemy, Hayama Akito.  The heading on the back of the manga says, "comedy".  I feel this is wrong, though, because Kodomo no Omocha (Child's Toy) is so much more than that. Kodomo no Omocha is a story about relationships.  That's its main focus.  Relationships, between Sana and her mother, Sana and her manager, Sana and her friends, and of course, the main one, Sana and Akito.  This is the only manga, by the way, that can make me cry and then, on the very next page, make me crack up.  If you buy this book, you are making a commitment, because you will become addicted.  Also, it goes on a wild roller coaster ride of emotions, particularly in books 9-10, which grow very serious and deal with big issues like depression.  Don't be surprised if you find yourself a little down when Sana is, and on the top of the world when she is.  It is especially gratifying, and somehow beautiful, to watch Akito grow and emerge with his emotions. So don't be fooled by anything, not even the covers.  This is a brilliant work of art, not just a manga, and in my opinion it is not even comparable to other manga, because it soars above the rest.  Buy all ten volumes, and don't expect not to be on the edge of your seat at the end of each one.  Even my review cannot do this series justice. WHY ARE YOU STILL READING??? BUY IT!!!
