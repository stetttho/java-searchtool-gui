 If you a) love Sailormoon b) like to dance c) enjoy Japanese music, then this CD is more than worth your money!  Bishoujo Senshi Sailormoon is my favourite anime.  The only song they excluded that they should have had was Ai no Senshi.  I love Moon Revenge and Rashiku Ikimasho!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
