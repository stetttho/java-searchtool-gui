 In volume 8, Search for the Savior, we meet Chibi Usa's new friend, Tomoe Hotaru.  Chibi Usa likes her friend, although Hotaru is frail.  Hotaru is happy to have a friend at last!  We also meet the new villain, Mimete.  Mimete sometimes slacks off to read manga!  She gets dreamy over guys.  All of her targets are cute guys who're popular in the world.  Sailor Pluto has joined the Outer Senshi with her attack: "Dead Scream".  It's sugoi!  ^________^  I liked this movie!  ~Usagi-Bunny
