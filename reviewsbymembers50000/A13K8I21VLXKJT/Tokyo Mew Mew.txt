 I don't generally go for manga with an absolute *overload* of cuteness.  However, I had heard of Tokyo Mew Mew and really wanted to read it.  So one day, I bought it.   Tokyo Mew Mew some may say is a copy of Sailormoon.  But there are several differences.  The idea of merging endangered species with humans to fight aliens is interesting--the endangered species thing is something new.   TMM is quite cute--that's for sure.  Ichigo (which means strawberry) is the main character, a cat-girl.  Her comrades are called Mint, Lettuce, Pudding, and Zakuro.  This manga is recommended for people who like mahou shoujo and anyone who can withstand tons of cute-ness.  I liked it, for sure.
