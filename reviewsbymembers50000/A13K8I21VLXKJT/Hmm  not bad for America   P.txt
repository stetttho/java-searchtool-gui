 Konnichi wa!  If you look at reviews of a few other SM videos you may recognize Usagi-Bunny.  I don't watch many dubs, but before I discovered the subbed Sailormoon S I was a dubbie. :p  Baka me!  Anyway, on to the movie.  It was *okay*.  I didn't give it one star because I liked the ep where they defeated Jedite.  (Jadeite is the CORRECT spelling)!  I wish they had this movie subtitled and in my beloved Japanese.  :)  I am not Japanese (most of us on here aren't) but I am learning it and I've fallen in love with this language.  Sailor Mars is *okay* but I like her better in the Japanese.
