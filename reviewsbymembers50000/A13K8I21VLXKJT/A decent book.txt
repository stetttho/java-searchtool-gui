 Anyone who wasn't satisfied with Alice, I Think should re-read it.  I found it quite...odd at first, and would have given it 2 or 3 stars after the first read.  However, after re-reading it twice, and reading its sequel, Miss Smithers, I enjoyed it far more.  I think it is a book that you need to get used to.  The author's style is really something that's an acquired taste. However, I think that whoever thought the mention of Internet porn was awful...all I have to say is welcome to reality.  I am a teenager, and my friend who is younger than I am has read this book without issue.  I have seen much worse things in books, and it's simply ridiculous that it wouldn't be appropriate for 16 year olds.  (Besides, it WASN'T in great detail!)  And anyway, it's a _journal_.  I'm aware Alice is fictional, but if that happened, you know, it happened.  I keep a journal myself, and I'm sure it's extremely boring at times.  I mean, please.  This is hardly the height of inappropriate literature.  I think this is a grossly misguided idea.   Anyway, sorry for snarkiness.  This was a pretty good book.
