 Let's just see.  Like many Potter fans all over the world, I am in love with fantasy.  My interests are fantasy books, anime and manga.  I, of course, LOVE Harry Potter in a fanatical way.  So that this doesn't turn into a profile of me -_- I'll start the review.  Book IV didn't disappoint me!  It was riveting and I spent the whole day reading it.  This is Harry Potter's biggest adventure so far!  Read it, and I highly recommend Sabriel and Lirael by Garth Nix and the His Dark Materials trilogy by Philip Pullman.  Gbye!  ~Usagi-Bunny
