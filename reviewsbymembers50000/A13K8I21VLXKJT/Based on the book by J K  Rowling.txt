 I am a huge Harry Potter fan, and I felt that this movie improved drastically over the first.  Somehow, it managed to keep to the book while branching out juuust enough for it to not clunk along.  This movie ends up being tighter and easier to follow for those who have not read the book. I would have given this movie 3 and a half stars if I could.  This is because I had some little nit-picks.  For example, many of the lines that were originally Ron's in the book were spoken by Hermione, making her seem like the flawless know-it-all and Ron like the dull and dumb sidekick.  Also, Ginny was almost a complete absence from the movie, making it a total throw off the track when it was her opening the Chamber of Secrets for those who haven't seen the movie; in the book you can go back for all of the little clues.  There were also some deleted scenes, like the Valentine, that I was upset about. Despite those, however, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Some of the inserted lines (follow the butterflies!) made me laugh out loud.  Kenneth Branagh was hilarious as Lockhart, Jason Isaacs was perfectly evil as Lucius, and Rupert Grint was great.  The DVD features include deleted scenes, and they are much easier to get to!  Overall, this is one of my favourite movies.
