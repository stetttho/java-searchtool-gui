 The book is a quite nice introduction into the concept of application of physics to financial markets or to say better financial models. Both authors have published numerous papers in this same field, and this book I would say clearly summarizes some of their work as well as the work of other researchers. As I said the book is a good introduction to the subject, and it does not go into some great detail of each topic discussed, so if you are interested in something more detailed I would recommend not to read this book (but only if you already are familiar with the general topics of financial modeling). Authors presented current research results, whith a very nice and detailed bibliography, which I would recommend using if you are very interested in financial modeling, as there are some very good research papers and books cited.  As an introduction the book goes on to describe the basic points of today research process in this field, and some of the questions that yet have not been answered. There is very nice presentation of random walk and Levy processes, which seem to be quite an attraction in current research. Scaling and correlation is explained from the level of indices as whole down to a individual company stock prices. Some other topics which the authors discuss are:scaling, time correlation, correlation of financial time series, ARCH and GARCH processes, market turbulence (quite an interesting connection to physics), where they end the book with some option pricing theories.  The book is written in a very understandable language, where basic probability theory should be known to the reader. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in this field, but also to researchers, where I think they would find this book very useful introduction, as it describes some of the major work done in this field.
