 I have read this book for the class of modeling financial derivatives and I was very impressed by the presentation of the theories of financial derivatives and risk management. The book covers derivative pricing in a  very detailed form. THe best thing about this book is the presentation of  the problems(mathematical) throughout the book, either through graphs,  spreadsheet models, etc. It is not pure theory book, but it also contains  many applications which encompas real finanical world. Such presentation  enables the reader to easier comprehend the contents of the subject.  Overall, the book is  very very good for a beginner in finacial derivatives  fiels, but it is also a great contribution to one more experienced in the  field. Greatest emphasis was put on interest rate models, option models,  volatility and risk management techniques.
