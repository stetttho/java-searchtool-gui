 This book is in every way the best book that I have read on the history of probability, or better to say history and evolution of risk management. Starting from the very early ages of probability, game logic and thinking to the most current theories and obstacles that we face today in the area of risk management, this book truly explains the initial concepts of risk management. The book is very readable, and it will probably take you couple of hours to read it. It is indeed addictive. Definitely the best book written on such topic.
