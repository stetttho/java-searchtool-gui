 I have only used this book as a reference for the class in Abstract Algebra. The book is certainly an introductory text for undergraduate studies. However, I would be very reluctant to use it though, since it is not as comprehensive as it should be. The contents of the book is very good and just by reading the contents you could get a feeling that this is the one, but certainly the text is not so abroad. The author discusses only some main principles and theories of the abstract algebra, where I believe for an undergradute text, in order to get a good first start with the subject, one would require something more detailed in explanation. Also, one of the main lapses is the structure of the book. There are some examples for every chapter or better to say topics covered, and there are solution to exercises at the end of the book. I think the book would be great if there was a little bit more detailed approach to the topics.
