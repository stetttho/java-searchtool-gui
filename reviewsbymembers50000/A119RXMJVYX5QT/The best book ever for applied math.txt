 This is the best book I have read on applied mathematics. It simply  contains everything you would need to fully understand the theory and  application of applied mathematics.  The book is well written, while it  requires general knowledge of linear algebra and matrix computation. The  explanations in the book are very clearly stated and very understandable.  Very very good reference for applied math. The material really makes a  wonderful grasp on why and how to apply mathematics to some very demanding  and complex structures that we deal with in science. Every serious applied  math person should have this book on the shelf, it really deserves it.
