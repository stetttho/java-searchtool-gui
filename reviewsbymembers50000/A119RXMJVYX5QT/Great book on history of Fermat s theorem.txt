 This book indeed depicts the best moments of the historic evolution of the search for the proof of the Fermat's Last theorem. It is an excellent history book on how people - great mathematicians went on to solve the mystery of the number theory. THe contents of the book is tense from the beginning to the end, while discovering some of the greatest minds of the mathematics. Singh really goes into detail when describing every important aspect of how at the end Andrew finally made his dream come true.  Throughout this book we can learn so many great aspects of how the mathematics - number theory is build from historic time periods. The book is not only for someone who studies mathematics or number theory but can also be of great reading please for everyone. It is not highly mathematical with functions and equations, but rather all is explained at very understandable level. In the appendices we can find teh proof of the Pythagorean theorem and many more who influenced this discovery.  I would greatly recommend this book for everyone interested in this field and beyond.
