 I have used this book as an additional reference for the class that I took on Programing VB, as the original class book was very badly written. This book really starts from the beginning of what we need to know about the vb programing environment to some new aspects of programing used in VB. The book starts with smaller examples of how we can create a calculator, etc. There are many more as such examples in the book (more complex ones of course as we proceed to further chapters). Also each concept of the programing is clearly defined and explained. THere are really many concepts covered such as database programing, General common Pogram components such as Microsoft common controls, ActiveX Controls, Classes, Also there are some more intermediate advance topics such as accesing win. API, Using OLE, then there are also chapters covered on VB in the internet... I have found VB a very easy to use programing langauge after reading this book. It is very easy to read, with many visual representations which makes it much easier to understand.   The index of the book is quite good, as we actually can find what we are looking for. It doesn't have very many advanced topics but I would recommend it for every beginner and intermediate user. I think it would be of great help.
