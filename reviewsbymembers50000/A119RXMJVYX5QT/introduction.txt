 The title could trick you into actually buying this book thinking it could be very good. The book is certainly good if you are a beginner in risk analysis in banking system. However, if you have some experience with it and you have knowledge of risk analysis then this is certainly not the book you would want. The book is written in a very nice, easy to understand language, but it covers concepts in a very basic manner so it might not be suitable for someone who already knows these things, but it would rather be frustrating because you spend [money] on the book. Definitely for the money paid it is not worth it.  If you are indeed a beginner in this field then in general this book could be very useful because it gives many examples for almost every concept explained along with the appropriate figures. However, they cover very general concepts. The concepts are well explained. In the appendix there is a nice very detailed example of the analysis of a specified bank. It is very detailed.
