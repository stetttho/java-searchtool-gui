 This is indeed a thrilling book to read. As the title claims, it is about the great theorems of mathematics that we have probably already read about. The book provides not only the description of the great theorems, but also it provides a historical account of the great mathematicians invloved in creating the art of mathematics. These historical accounts or biographies are very well written, and easy to read and most of all enjoy. There is one drawbaack to the text and that is the "Fermat's last theorem", where the author states it is the greates unsolved problem, where the problem has been solved by A. Wiles. However, this is the problem of the time that the book is published. This book is indeed a great reading for many mathematicians and non-mathematicians, where many can find it very understandable and find themselves in love with mathematics.
