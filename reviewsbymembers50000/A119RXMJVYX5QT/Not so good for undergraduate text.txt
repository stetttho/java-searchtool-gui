 Currently, I have this book for my undergraduate course in Abstract Algebra, and I really really wish that the professor picked another one. The main reason why I don't like this book is the fact that the explanations are very bad and there is like 2 pages max. for each topic and then around 30 problems at the end of each topic. I think that clearly this is not enough of theory and explanation for an undergradute text in Abstract Algebra. There are very very little examples, and if there are any then those would be proof of the theorems and that's it.  I just don't feel comfortable with this book, and I had to search for other books in order to get through the class. I really like the contents, and I just wish the author would spend some more time explaining why and not just stating the theorem. That we can all found in Mathematical Handbook.
