 The book covers many interesting topics starting from general statistical analysis and linear regression to some more complex topics such as neural networks. Also some Monte Carlo is covered. I read a lot of books on same topics but in much more depth, which is why this book was not a big contribution to my current knowledge. The text is certainly good for a beginner or to refresh your memory, but I think to be a very good CEO of CFO you need to know more in detail than just some of these topics, as described in the book. Some chapters such as the one on Monte Carlo I think is not presented in a best manner. The whole chapter looks more like a user guide for Monte Carlo for Chrystal Ball software. The technique of Monte Carlo usage is not descibed in a detail at all , but rather it is just presented of how it is done in this software. Moreover, the chapter on Nerual Networks in a summary chapter on some general topics but there are no precise examples of how things can be done.  These are some of the reasons why I didn't really like the book, it is more less like a summary of the most important topics that one should know if in finance. As I said this book is probably good introductory text to get acquainted with the general topics, prior to getting into some more detailed text, becuase from this you really can not say you know the material in depth.
