 I use this book as a daily reference for calculations in Maple and it is very very useful. It is very detailed where there are examples for every function almost that you can think of. We all know that there is a help within the program, which is quite useful for the introduction to Maple. However, this book enables you to raise your calculations to a higher level.  I have searched for a good reference book for Maple for a while and I saw this one in library where after a week of using it I decided to buy one, a nd certainly it has not let me down yet. I do a lot of calculations in Maple and I am sure that this will be very useful for anyone who is in natrual sciences especially mathematics.  All general and well known topics are full explained, such as integration, differentiation, limits, differential equations, abstract algebra techniques... and many more. The best thing about this book is the fact that it is explained in a great detail and there are examples for every Maple function, which makes it much easier to understand and actually apply.
