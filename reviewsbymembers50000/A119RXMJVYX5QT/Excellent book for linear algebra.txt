 I have had a linear algebra course and I have to admit it was not enjoyable becuase of the book. It was not understandlable and actually quite frustrating. Now when I am taking some advanced courses in Matrix Analysis I was looking for a book that would actually help me in the course. So I found this book and now not only that I enjoy linear algebra I really like it. Gilbert Strang's book really helped me out. Strang explains the concepts really as if we don't know anything about the course and then it goes into more complex situations. He covers everything that a beginner or an intermediate in linear algebra should know, and even he goes to explain some relevant applications of linear alegbra, such as to mechanical and electrical systems, dynamical systems... We can indeed see that Strang is a genius in this field and I think we can completly trust him as to what is written in the book.  The book starts with some basic concepts of matrices, vectors and vector spaces. Then he goes on to describe the theory of linear independecy or dependency, determinants, symmetric matrices, Factorization, transposes, permutations, application and theory of column and null spaces, left and right inverses, complex matricesm eigenvalues and eigenvectors, Markov process, Fourier series, orthogonality, projection matrices.... The theory is well explained and combined with an appropriate example. There are plenty of exercises at the end of the chapter where the odd ones have answers in the back.  If you are planning to are taking linear algebra course I would strongly recommend this book. It is not for an advanced linear algebra reader, but it is certainly for a beginner or an intermediate one.
