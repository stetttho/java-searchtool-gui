 The story of Paul Erdos is quite an unsusual one. A man, mathematician, whose life has not been a journey without obastacles, but rather he faced such problems in life that could prevent him of "doing mathematics". Neverthenless, he stayed on the track and provided a mathematical community with tremendous resources.  The book starts with his early ages in Hungary describing his beginnings of mathematical challenge. The actual account of Erods' life is not very detail, as the author also writes about other significant mathematical activities. There are many "little" events of Erods' life that is included in the book, provided by his closest friends, however, I believe that the biography of Paul Erdos would be much better if it actually described his journey in a more greater detail, rather than just some smaller events especially in the mid years of his life.
