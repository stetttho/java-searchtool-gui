 The book is very well structured and I think and excellent introduction to the risk management in banking. I bought this book as hope to give me some more detailed presepective of risk management, but after reading it I think it should be used as a side reading reference to finance courses that some of the universities offer today in risk management or financial engineering. The author covers almost everything that we should know in risk management if we are new to it. However, if you are more experienced with finance or risk management I think this could be potential waste of money. I also think that the book has a bit high price for what it offers.One of the main reasons is the fact that the book is written in an elementary/intermediate form. Even as an elementary/intermediate level book I think that there should have been more examples or applicable activities that one can acctually see how some aspects of risk management are applied in the real world. Yes, there are some examples but not to an extent as there should be especially in the field as risk management and finance, where more and more people read these kinds of books in order to see or find how they can apply the information in the book to some real time activities in the financial market or corporate institution. If you are looking for some more concrete text with some serious derivation of mathematical formulas for finance and risk management, or some more detailed presentations (more complex to read) I think you should then consider buying some other book.
