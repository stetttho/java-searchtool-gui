 If, you are looking for a better performance in your bowing, and all the color in your violin, adquire this Book. The level is high and you need to be patient and practice to raise the correct level. I like the book, because has a good presentation, some notes about how perform some passages and the best of all, are three books on one book, The 24 Caprices, The Ecole Moderne(Wieniawski), and 8 Wieniawski Etudes.
