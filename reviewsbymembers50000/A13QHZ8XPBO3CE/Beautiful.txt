 Some guys like me, never had the opportuniy to know the great masters of the last century, this is a beautiful DVD, and an excelent documental. The violinist are their sounds, their phrasings, their humanity, some very perfectionist like Heifetz, some very carismatic, like Oistrak, some prodigy like Menuhin, and some interesting personalities like Kogan, Milstein, Szering, Szigeti, all of them big masters of the new style, different in style than Wieniawski, Vieuxtemps, Sarasate, Paganini, Viotti, etc. but not so far from their impresionant habilities. Believe me you really enjoy this CDs, a curiosity, pay attention to all the bowings, are very different, different production of the sound. Two violinist never will play equal, even they are using the same violin, the violinist is his sound not his violin. (Note: The violin helps, but not play alone).
