 Im happy buying the CDs from Accardo, only see Accardo in the CD-Case and you know, something good is inside there. Now talking about this particular CD, is amazing the Max Bruch work. Accardo playing incredible the third concert, a beautiful concert, like the other reviewers I agree, that this concert must be included in the violinist repertoire. Why always the #1 Concert of Bruch, Why always the Wieniawski #2, if those composers has other big master works. Now the technich of the violinist like the the materials of his strings, help so much to perform this works. A Bravo for Mr. Accardo in the release of this work. Accardo is a big master of the violin, and always you could associate with Paganini works, but is incredible listen him in other master works, like Bruch, Wieniawski, etc. I hope that he include in his futures CDs unknown concerts for the public in general like Fiorillo, Rode, Viotti, etc.
