 After heard both concerts, and compare the versions, I really enjoy the original concert, much longer - much beautiful. After this version the second one is a reduction of the original conceived idea of Mr. Jean Sibelius. The second version, the version that everybody plays, is a magnificent work that Mr Leonidas play very well. But after heard the first one and continue with the second version you will feel that the concert is uncomplete. May be some years more from this CD, the people will make justice to the original version and forget the actually played cut version.  The composers needs in many cases much time for take the accept from the public, this because many times the people evolution is slower than the composer vision. Adquire this CD, this is a jewel for your collection. Excellent violinist. Leonidas Kavakos, Composer Jean Sibelius, and two versions of one of his most beautiful works.
