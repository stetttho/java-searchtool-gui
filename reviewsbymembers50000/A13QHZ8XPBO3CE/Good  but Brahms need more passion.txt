 I heard the Hilary version with calm, and I found an excelent technique, all the notes clear, all the virtuosos passages too, but some phrases not has the sense of motion and feeling for Brahms, her vibrato is very good, but sounds equal at the E string than the G string, and under this circunstances some passages turn boring. I Like the Bach recording of the Hilary, because works very well the phrases and some passages came clear to me when I heard her, (Only I not understand the final of the Ciaccona, too slow, and break the performance of the first part, but... is a very good work), for Brahms, the violinist needs more things in his life, more time, more maturity. For example, hear the Yehudi Menuhin version with Kurt Mazur, simply brillant, the Mullova version, the David Oistrach version, and the Mtter version (in memory of her husband), you will feel an affinity with the second movement and their feeling, (I think... maturity), Miss Hilary plays very very well, I will wish to play like her, but her Brahms is not the better version of her, I think (again); that she needs the passion of her future years and mix with her performance, and in  that moment, maybe she will produce a magnificent Brahms. I give her 4 stars, because her performance is impressionant, but she needs to works more with Brahms phrases, and add a little bit of passion, fire and feelings when plays Brahms.
