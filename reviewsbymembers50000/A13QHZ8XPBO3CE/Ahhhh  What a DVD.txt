 If you not have this DVD in your collection, believe me, buy it. First, the performace of the Berlin Philharmonic, impresionant. You will hear the Carmen highlights arias with Anne Sophie Von Otter, Bryn Terfel, Robert Alagna, then the Rachmaninoffs Rhapsody on a Paganini Theme only for the climax of the Sarasates Carmen Fantasy; perfectlty performed by Gil Shaham, if you put attention you really see that all the performers of the DVD enjoy his own sound. If you like the Berlin Philarmonic perform, wait for the Hungarian Dance V, conducted by Claudio Abbado, i repeat the guys really enjoy playing music.
