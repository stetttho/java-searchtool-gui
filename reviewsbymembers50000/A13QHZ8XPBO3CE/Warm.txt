 Of the CDs that I have listened to Hilary, this is the one which more attract attention to myself. The sound is warm and very mature. My copy of Elgar's concert is that of Yehudi Menuhin, when the concert is recorded for the first time. I did not believe that the warmth of the first movement and the cadenza was repeating itself, but Hilary's expression to the violin does it, and gives him a very own sense to the concert. I give her 5 stars to Hilary's execution, you will enjoy it. Of Elgar, this is a concert with a very English character and of difficult attention to the public, therefore the skill of the violinist in this particular concert overcomes the technical virtuosismo to support the quality of the interpretation.
