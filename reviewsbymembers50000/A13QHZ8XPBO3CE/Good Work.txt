 Good work, sometimes we forget that the beauty of the music not always is related to its complex. Big violinst masters dedicated his years composing concerts for students, those concerts are very well conceived, are wrote by violinist, pedagogues, and has a technical purpose for the student and his evolution. But many times this little masterpieces have a beatiful colour and texture that a third-party listener would enjoy. For example the Oskar Rieding concert, how many violinist in this world play this concert, I think that all, the pleasure of play those notes with a piano the first time (priceless). Oskar Rieding has a good repertoire for the students, concerts for 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th position, a beautiful Hugarian concert. The same with Seitz, Charles de Beriot, Accolay. Viotti is a more elaborated concert with a beautiful style. Bravo for Mr. Perlman recording this CD, with his experience and mastering, he choose a beautiful progression of pieces and concerts, only to culminate in the 22 Viotti Concert. Perhaps in the future we could listen other masters (of our era) like Vengerov, Shaham, etc performing this concerts. The style is very particular from Mr Perlman, but sometimes the listener needs to undertand that no are a unique form of perform this pieces, each student will need time for undertand this works and find his own sound and style, the CD is a good guide. Again for Mr. Perlman a beautiful CD well oriented to the public in general.
