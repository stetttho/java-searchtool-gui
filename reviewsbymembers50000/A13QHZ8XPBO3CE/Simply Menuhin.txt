 I heard twice in my life this concert, I liked so much, specially because has serenity and peace. This Menuhin version conducted by Edward Elgar, is simply pure. I heard the last records of Menuhin, but I never heard him in his first years, simply I dont cry because ...you know, but in some cirscustance of my life if I would heard the Munuhin Solo, simply I could not resist,his natural sound, his phrasing, the solo in the third movement has a sense of nostalgy, with a beautiful vibrato, sorry for the others big masters, but this "carisma" only Sir Yehudi Menuhi. He really was a natural prodigy with a big carisma, if you dont believe me heard him. If not buy the DVD about him, and pay attention to the solo, while he stay with his "Mamina". Buy it you really enjoy. And my respects to Yehudi Menihin, a wonderful violinist of the 20th century.
