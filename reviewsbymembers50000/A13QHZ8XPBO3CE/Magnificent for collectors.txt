 This is a really masterpiece for collector. For the people that love the "virtuoso-violin", this is yours. If you are a fanatic of Paganinis music like me, this is your collection, because you will find the Maestosa sonata sentimentale, the Duo Merveille, "God save the King", in a perfect interpretation, only by Accardo, that are very difficult to find. The 6 Concertos, are amazing, if it is your first time hearing Paganini, you will find absolutely incredible, and remember, is only one violin performing those sounds. Double-Stops, Harmonics, Double-Harmonics, and the most colorful bowing performance. Paganini is very romantic and sentimental, the six, second movements are a jewel in your collection. I recomend you that adquire this for your personal collection, the case is beautiful, and the sound is powerful, like the recorders of the Deutsche Grammophon, Accardo plays Paganini transmiting to the listener the feeling of his performance. The 24 Caprices are interesting, and Accardo plays very clear, if you are playing the caprices, this is a good guide, please try to listen the sound of Accardo, you could find many tips in his performance. If you like the music in general, these concertos will give you a different vision and nature of the power of a violin with the London Philarmonic Orchesta.
