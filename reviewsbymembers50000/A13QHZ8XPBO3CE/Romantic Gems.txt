 Im agree with one of the reviewers above about the term gems. Mr. Wieniawski, one of the amazings violinist of our era, has in his music the next step after the paganini style, is modern, is difficult, but he is tonal and romantic. We always reference Wieniawsky by his Legenda or his concerto #2. But he has many masterpieces for the violinist advance. The first concerto, is not an easy concerto, specially with the tenths initiating the violin part, but is a masterpiece like his second concert, that the violinists would include in their repertories. Wieniawki the master of the staccato volante is performed in magnific style by Mr. Gil Shaham, I like so much hear Shaham because he plays very clear and his phrases are very well elaborated with the emotion and the sense of a professional violinist.  This is a beautiful recording, I recommend you adquire this and enjoy the violinist performing Wieniaski.
