 I love the perfect sound of this lady, my favorite violinist. I enjoy more her recents recordings, because she makes a change in her style, initially very perfect so perfect, but the beauty is not always in the perfect style, sometimes the colors of the music are directly referenced from the different nuances and little changes in the phrases, that turn the music from boring to interesting. Mendelssohns Concert is one of the masterpieces for the violin of our times, but is not his only concert, he has other one that he compose when teenager. Many people not agree in mention this concert, because feel that Mendelssohn not had the correct maturity. BUT sincerely I enjoyed this piece because is diferrent, is a young Mendelssohn, with new ideas, and with the need of explore the world with his sound. Is a pleasure hear  Ms. Mullova performing this concerto, for the enjoy of her listeners, who taste the differences between the two concerts performed with extraordinary quality.
