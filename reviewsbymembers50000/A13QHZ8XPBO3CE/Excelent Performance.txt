 A Bravo for Mr. Vengerov, if you are looking for a violinist with expression, please buy the DVD and hear the Ysaye Sonata, at final you exclaim "Bravo" with the audience. The Sibelius Concerto one of my favorites is very well performed, very clear and expressive.  Mr Daniel Barenboim's and Placido Domingo performance, without works, magnific.
