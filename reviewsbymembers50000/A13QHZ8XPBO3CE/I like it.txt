 I critic very hard the phrasing of the Brahms concerto, but this Bach version is excelent, she understand what is playing, is not boring, the partitas and sonatas, is not for all people, some are very difficult to understand, but she mantain captive the listen of the people. Only one comma; dear Hilary, why? you play too slow the final of the ciaconna, you are playing in one time and change abruptly the time. I choose five stars because is her own expression of Bach and I like it. (Very different than her Brahms version)
