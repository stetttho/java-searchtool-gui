 This is a version that I really enjoy with my other versions of Mullova, Oistrach and Menuhin, she not only understand what she is playing, much better she feels what she??s playing, I like the second movement, the passion of her performance shows me that some concertos need the maturity and experience of the musician life. Paganini, Beethoven, Brahms, Wieniawsky, Vieuxtemps Tchaikovsky and Elgar, needs more than a simply perfect performance, needs life and people with feelings that play in that way. The second movement is simply impresionant, all those kinds of colors and textures, that I never heard before in other versions. I will recommend you, buy this version, is the kind of musical jewels you will need in your collection.
