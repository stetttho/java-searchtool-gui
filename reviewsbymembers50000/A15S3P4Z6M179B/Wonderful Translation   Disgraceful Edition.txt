 Long ago, as a young child, I heard the Jerusalem Bible pronounced in Church, but never knew it.  Eventually, as I began to study Liturgy and Scripture, I became aware of various translations, and finally picked myself up an old 1971 copy of the paperback 'Reader's Edition' of the JB.  Of course, it sat on my shelf for quite some time.  Picking it up recently, while working on a project to revise the Breviary of our Synod, I became captivated by the striking language and depth of meaning found in the JB, and decided I needed a slightly better copy for my own use.  The Jerusalem Bible is quite simply the most poetic modern english translation of Scriptures that one will find.  The depth and clarity with which the Word of God is conveyed within these covers is only rivaled (in places!) by the Revised English Bible's translation of the Duterocanonicals (specifically Ecclesiasticus).   Sadly, this hardback 'Reader's Edition' appears to be nothing less than a (crummy) photographic reproduction (and shrunk at that) version of an earlier copy of the Reader's Edition.  I am deeply troubled that Doubleday did not see fit to actually imprint this copy of the JB, simply to photocopy/shrink it.  (Yes, I know there is more involved than photocopying, but you get my point.)  While I highly recommend the Jerusalem Bible (it's my second favorite translation after the English Standard Version), I can't commend this print job.  Here's hoping, along with others, that Doubleday might yet get it right.
