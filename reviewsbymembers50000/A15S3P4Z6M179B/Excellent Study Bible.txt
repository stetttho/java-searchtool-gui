 I have elsewhere reviewed the Revised English Bible, so suffice it to say that I prefer the New English Bible to the REB, though I must admit that as I transition to using modern language materials, the REB is particularlly useful wen it comes to the Books of the Apocrypha.    I have seen many notes herein about the poetic nature of the REB, and while parts of Ecclesiasticus are definately well done, I find the poetic material to be lacking.  One who is searching for a wonderful poetic translation of the Scriptures into modern English should really be investigating the Jerusalem Bible.  (See my review on amazon.com).  My mark of a great poetic bible is the ability to chant the psalms, hymns, and canticles of the Scriptures flawlessly and simply - and the REB does not permit me to do so.  As to the edition in hand, the Oxford notes are, as usual, a plethora of context, context, context.  While I don't agree with a great deal of modern Biblical scholarship, I find Oxford's articles to be very enlightening and easy to use.  I have several Oxford Study Bibles (New American Bible, New English Bible, Revised Standard Version) and have found them all to be excellent resources.  The REB Study Bible, which I purchased for use in Seminary, is another worthy addition to Oxford's line.  I still use it to this day for personal growth, sermon preparation, and individual devotion, and I believe you will find it to be a worthwhile addition to your library as well.
