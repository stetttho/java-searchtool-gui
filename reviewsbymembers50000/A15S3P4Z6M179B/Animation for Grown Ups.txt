 Now, before you start thinking odd things about me for enjoying animation while I am slowly whittling through the latter part of my third decade, and before you get outraged that a priest would be watching such a, uh, cutting-edge program. . .  Futurama is by far the smartest animated program I have ever watched.  Now don't get me wrong, you're still not going to use all that knowledge from high school Trig class (you know, the class that the teacher said would help you make it big) and the scientific method certainly does not apply to Futurama, but this program is quite wide in scope and find a way to poke serious fun at the past 100 years of film. . . especially sci-fi.   When virtually the entire cast of Star Trek, a sitting Vice President, other famous celebrities, and Blinky the Three-Eyed Fish show up on your television program, it's probably a really good program.   Futurama is, however, adult entertainment (no, not THAT kind of adult entertainment. . . but there is a lot of great music!).  Don't let your kids near it until they are, oh, married and have two children - or at least until they are sixteen (your choice). Trust me, while Futurama is from time to time rather racy and the humor often appeals to baser instincts, the program is wonderful.  And if you don't like what I've had to say, "You can bite my shiny metal". . . oh wait, I'm not Bender.   Enjoy the show!
