 Benedictine Daily Prayer: A Short Breviary, stands in the line of 'short breviaries' that have been produced by the Liturgical Press since the mid-20th century.  Their aim is to make the Divine Office more accessable to laity (with a particular aim, in this edition, to Benedictine Oblates).  This book succeeds to a moderate level.  The layout is very crisp and easy to follow, and the book itself is simply gorgeous.  There is a minimal amount of page turning, and there is a great depth of Scripture and Patristic Readings presented, considering it is intended to be a 'short' breviary.  The intercessory litanies are often quite nicely done, the translation of the Ambrosian office hymns is exquisitely done (and in modern english, with most of them being without a hint of the problematic Filioque tendencies that some translations of these hymns have), and the prayers for some of the saints days are thought provoking, though obviously influenced by Roman theology and thought.  Sadly, the terrible translation of the Canticles, the use of the NRSV, and the gender-neutral revision of the Grail psalms takes away my enthusiasim for this book.  Also, it's rather limited single week format for the psalms is somewhat lacking, both in number and in variability, though I realize that a fixed weekly recitation of the Psalter was Benedict's norm.  I would prefer using this book as a supplement to the single-volume Christian Prayer, but not independently.  Still, it is a worthy effort, even if I happen to feel it still falls short.
