 As a liturgist, I have deeply studied the Liturgy of the Hours for many years.  As a presbyter, I have offered the Liturgy of the Hours for seven years.  As a Christian, I have been fascinated with the Liturgy of the Hours for nearly fifteen years.  Robert Taft's masterful work has given to me, and to all of his readers, a deeper love for the Office, fuller information to use in revising the Office in various jurisdictions and denominations, and - without intending to do so - has given inspiration to many to offer prayer with the Church, through his witness to the purpose of the Office.  I highly recommend this book to all who are seeking both a scholarly and spiritually moving work on the topic of the full history, Oriential, Byzantine, and Latin, of the Liturgy of the Hours.
