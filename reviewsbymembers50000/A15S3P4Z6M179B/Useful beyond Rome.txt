 Msgr. Elliot has produced a classic liturgical work for the celebration of the Novus Ordo rite in Ceremonies of the Modern Roman Rite. Though I am not a Roman Catholic, I found much to commend Elliot's suggestions and directions to me in a broader context as a joint-inheritor of the western liturgical tradition. The book is laid out cleanly and is easy to read.  While the book is a quick read, it is definately not a lightweight.  Agree or disagree on points, but one must acknoweldge that Ellot knows his liturgy, and how to celebrate it. I highly commend this book to those in and out of Rome who wish to celebrate the liturgy in a modern setting with reverence and respect.
