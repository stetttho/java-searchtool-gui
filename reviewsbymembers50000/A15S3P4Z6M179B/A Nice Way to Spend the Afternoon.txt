 Syne Mitchell's "End In Fire" was an excellent novel for a dreary afternoon.  I was in the mood for a real-space novel, and while this was set in a slightly extrapolated future, it fit the bill close enough.  In the novel, Claire, the central focus, is assigned to the American space station Reliance (successor to the International Space Station) and is working on her life's dream, a solar collector that will help to eliminate America's dependence on fossil fuels.  If successful, the solar array will be the first of many beaming microwave electricity back to earth.  Of course, in true Science Fiction style, she's not, and all hell breaks loose.  Through the remainder of the story, we experience the trials and travails of Claire, both in orbit and in her heart, as she fights to help her crewmates and her young son and husband survive the cataclysim that is unfolding beneath their feet.  There are several suprises in this book, places you don't quite expect things to go, but the book is a very good read.  In terms of shortcomings, certain scenes are written way too briefly.  Things that take hours come across as instantaneous occurences (it would take quite some time to deorbit from MEO, but the event passes in about half-a-page in the novel), but in fairness, they are places in the story that really have nothing to elaborate on.  Regardless of the shortcomings, "End In Fire" is a good novel that I would recommend to anyone, even if the afternoon isn't dreary.
