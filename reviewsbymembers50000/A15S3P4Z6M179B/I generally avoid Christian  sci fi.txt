 I generally avoid anything that bills itself as "Christian Science Fiction" because it's generally neither.  However, my great regard for the space program and desire to read more novels similar to Stephen Baxter's "Voyage" led me to "Ice" by Shane Johnson (famous to most Star Trek fans as the author of "Mr. Scott's Guide to the Enterprise")  The technical detail and realisim of the Apollo missions staged in "Ice" were impressive, right down to planning realistic dates and times for launches based on when the United States would have launched further Lunar missions.  Johnson was able to take existing, real-world personalities, and blend them convicingly into a fictional tale of a Lunar-flight gone horribly wrong.  At times, the novel seemed to drag on, mainly because I didn't realize where Johnson was going with the various projections that the astronauts encounter on the Moon.  (I dare not share too much, or else the plot would be ruined.)  At the end, however, one becomes aware of what was going on and, in fact, kicks one's self for not putting the puzzle pieces together sooner.  The dialouge is crisply written with a very good flow, and as noted before, the terminology is used quite correctly, but not so much that an average reader cannot figure it out (with the help of the handy lexicon that proceeds the work).  I highly recommend this book to Christian Sci-Fi fans out there with no reservations.
