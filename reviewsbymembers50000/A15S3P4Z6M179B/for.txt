 As a huge fan of Clarke's 2001: A Space Odyssey, I have to say that the Soderbergh version of Solaris is indeed 2001 for 2002.  Howso?  Well, first, the visuals speak volumes.  Wordless images combined with the haunting score are enough to really bring one in - if you will let it.  (Personally, I could stare at the Solaris planet and listen to the score for hours on end.)  Solaris is a major player in this movie, even though the planet never utters a word.  While I'm not a huge George Clooney fan, I found his performance in this film to be suprisingly appropriate.  Not too many words - the sense of the profound is not lost.  The unexplaniable is left unexplained, and when we are honest with ourselves there will always be something we are forced to accept as unexplained.  The movie also explores our preconcieved notions of the world around us (or, more accurately, the universe around us) and also takes us into the mind of a man haunted by the death one one whom he loves.  As an individual who has experienced losses many times before, this movie was almost therapuetic for me.  Certainly Solaris has it's weak points.  For those who are purists, it omits a great deal of Lem's original story and the setting is ever-so-subtly changed.  However, Solaris is still a movie that represents for the early twenty-first century what 2001 presented in the sixties.  A movie of reflection and contemplation on the mysteries of the universe.
