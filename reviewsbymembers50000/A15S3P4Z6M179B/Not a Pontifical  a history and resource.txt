 Paul F. Bradshaw, a well known liturgical scholar, has presented for consideration the various texts used throughout the Eastern and Western Rites in the ancient world for the ordination of deacons, presbyters, and bishops - as well as deaconesses, lectors, acolytes... virtually every ministry with a commissioning or ordination rite from the ancient world.  However, make no mistake, this is not a book that is to be sat on the bishop's lap to conduct ordinations -- it is a book for study, reflection, and consideration as we forge ahead in our liturgical era to prepare new rites for our own day.  Those who have a deep love for the patristic church know well that the future of our faith lays not in the development of new doctrines and beliefs but in the deeper understanding and practice of the ancient faith.  Bradshaw's book provides the information needed to mediate upon at least a part of that ancient faith - the ordination of clergy.  These prayers are filled with biblical imagery, and show a glimpse of the faith-life of our brothers and sisters from nearly two-thousand years ago.  This is a must have for those interested in the theology of ministry and the liturgical rites surrounding Christian Ordination.
