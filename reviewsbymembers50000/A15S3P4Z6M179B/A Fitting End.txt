 It was just about eighteen months ago when I picked up volume 1 of Randle's series "The Exploration Chronicles".  Now, having finished book three, I can say the series was worth my time.  Book Three is not a direct sequel to book two, which was (IMO) the weakest of the three books.  Book three picks up with Hackett and company on Mars, in charge of the Galactic Exploration Command, and ends in a manner that even I didn't see coming until nearly the end.  Hints and thoughts are laid out for us all over the book as to how the story ends, but in the end the obvious answer isn't the right one.  This book had some seriously odd editorial blunders- misspelled words and names, and even the inclusion of some non-words, but it doesn't take away from Randle's excellent novel that much.  The ending seems to be begging for another book, so we shall see what Randle has in store.  Even if you didn't like book two, have a look at book three.  I think you'll find it more to your liking.
