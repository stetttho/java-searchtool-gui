 As a liturgist, involved in my Synodical Worship Commission, I find myself reading a great many liturgical texts and history books.  One of the single-most-useful books I have ever obtained has been Griffiths' "We Give You Thanks and Praise" in which the Eucharistic Prefaces of the Ambrosian Missal (a sub-rite of the Latin Rite in the Roman Communion) are collected in a stylistic, though accurate, English translation.  The Ambrosian Rite is unique in the west in the modern era for its literal plethora of prefaces (over 300, compared with about 100 in the modern Missale Romanum, 30 in the 1979 Book of Common Prayer, and as few as 5 or 6 in earlier editions of the Lutheran and Anglican rites).  These prefaces not only flesh out the themes of the Liturgy in the Ambrosian rite, but provide those of us who do not celebrate that rite with deep wells from which to contemplate about how we phrase our prayers and praises.  I can't thank my friend Cody enough for referring this book to me, and this book has proved to be quite influential in the work I have submitted for consideration to the Liturgical Commission of the Synod of Saint Timothy.  I hope that other denominations and jurisdictions will be able to find it equally useful.
