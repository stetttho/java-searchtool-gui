 Living in the United States, I had never seen a rugby match before.  The closest I have gotten was an Australian Rules Football match about a decade ago on the now-defunct SportsChannel here in the states.  I had seen Rugby 2004 sitting on the shelf used at a local store for some time and kept avoiding buying it, even though I as somewhat fascinated by the thought.  Finally, I decided that I would go ahead and pick it up.  The game is very interesting and engaging to me, but given that I had never seen a rugby match before, a lot of my engagement was learning the rules and mechanics of the game.  Nevertheless, the game is quite fun, and a very enjoyable change of pace from American Gridiron Football.  On the positive side, the game itself is just plain fun, and as many others have mentioned, the depth of gameplay is great.  You have the ability to play in several different tournaments and master the field, there is a really nice practice pitch, and the stadiums are very nicely recreated, right down to the ad-boards just out of touch (I love seeing the Weet-Bix and INXS ads!  Just great!).  The graphics remind me of stuff I saw many years ago on Madden, but the sheer fun of the game makes me forget about it.  Perhaps the most annying feature is the announcers because they keep saying the same thing over... and over... and over... and over... and the conversion still to come.  While I recommend this game to people who are interested in learning about rugby, I hear that the 2005 version is much better, so I plan to get it soon.  As an aside, this game served as such a good intro to rugby that I did a websearch to find the nearest rugby game to me... which kicked off less than 24 hours after I bought the game!
