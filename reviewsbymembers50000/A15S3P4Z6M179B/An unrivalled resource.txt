 About two years ago, when I began working with the Synodical Commission for Worship on a revision of our Church Year and Liturgy, one of the questions we asked was how we would be able to make the best use of the historic collects (opening prayers) of the Church Year in our new scheme.  This book made it simple.  Collected together for reference and comparison, Dudley's volume made it simple to research the history of the Collect in the usage of the Anglican Liturgy, from the Latin collects of the Sarum usage to the 1979 revisions and even into the late 1980's, this book covers the entire spectrum of opening prayers from throughout the Anglican Communion.  At the price this book is offered at, it is almost a sin not to have it on your bookshelf.  It is a truly indespensible resource for the Anglican cleric, or any cleric of the Western Rites with an interest in liturgical prayer.
