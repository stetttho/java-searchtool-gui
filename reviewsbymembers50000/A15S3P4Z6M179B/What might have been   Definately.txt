 Alternate history.  It's a fun concept to fiddle with. . . what if Hitler had won?  What if VonBraun had went to the Soviet Union after WWII? What if Kennedy had not died. Stephen Baxter answers the last question in grand form in the novel Voyage.  Voyage is the story of a manned mission to Mars in the 1980's, or perhaps, more specifically, the build up to and execution of the mission.   Baxter brings his aeronautical expertise to this book, as well as a good command of history (aborted and realized).  The story of Voyage, the tech, the flow. . . all are believable and the story is told quite well.  It reminded me of watching "From the Earth to the Moon" to be quite honest. Give Baxter a few evenings of your time, and you'll get a good read from it.  Just ignore the rather frequent use of the Lord's name in vain. ;-)
