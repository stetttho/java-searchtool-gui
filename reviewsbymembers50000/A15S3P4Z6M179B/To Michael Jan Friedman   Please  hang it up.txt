 I love Star Trek.  I have loved Star Trek for twenty years.    I hate this book.  "Death in Winter" is one of two Star Trek novels that I have started and given up on after several attempts to read and re-read the book.  It is slow, boring, and in the first hundred pages things are dominated as much by the Romulan Underground as by our flamiliar heroes.    In what little I read, Beverly wasn't a credible undercover agent (okay, so she was on a medical mission, but she was still undercover) and now Picard has entrusted himself to an individual who tried to kill him several years earlier in order to rescue Dr. Crusher.  Sorry, this book just plain stinks.  Given the steadily slipping quality of Friedman's contributions to Star Trek literature, it is this reviewer's opinion that, given the quality of "Death in Winter" that Pocket needs to simply let Mr. Friedman head out to pasture and take better advantage of their corps of fresh Star Trek talent.  And, of course, could someone please have a word with the cover designer?  If ever a book screamed at me not to buy it... it was this one.  I normally judge books by their cover (and have rarely been wrong).  My gut told me not to buy this, and now I am out the $20 that I paid for it.  Next time, I will have to go back to my standard 'judge a book by its cover' practice.  It certinaly would have served me well here.
