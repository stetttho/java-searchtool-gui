 Fawlty Towers by John Cleese and Connie Booth is one of the finest British television shows ever produced.  Following the venerable, yet annoying tradition of producing a very minimal set of episodes, this series manages to be one of the best comedies on television.  Ever.  Basil Fawlty (Cleese) stars as a hotel owner/operator with a bone to pick - with everyone he meets.  His wife, Sybil, (Prunella Scales) is equally hilarious for her total snobbish disdain for Basil.  In truth, the hotel stays afloat only by the hard work of the inept Manuel (Sachs) and the artist Polly (Booth) - but don't tell Basil that.  He is convinced that he is the pride of Fawlty Towers.  The series episodes contain a healthy dose of slapstick comedy to offset the ever-present dry British wit that underlies the entire program.  As an American viewer, I find the series fascinating, and my quickest 'boost' when I am having a bad day.    Hilarious, funny, and always entertaining, this DVD set is the perfect way to experience Fawlty Towers.
