 In this day and age, it is virtually impossible to find a copy of the 1928 Book of Common Prayer, and doubly difficult to find a copy of the King James Bible with the Books of the Apocrypha included.    Nearly six years ago, I found this edition, published by Preservation Press.  I thought the company had went out of business, so I am pleased to see that they are offering their book through Amazon.  This book is a well crafted one.  Even though I no longer use the liturgy of the 1928 BCP, this book served as my Altar Missal, my Breviary, and my devotional Bible for nearly four years.  It held up well, and is still intact, holding a place of honor on my bookshelf even today.  While I have some issues with the Liturgy of the 1928 BCP, this book is still a real gem, one that any Anglican serious about the Anglican Way, should have, use, and revere.
