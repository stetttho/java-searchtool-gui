 Leonel L. Mitchell took on a monumental task, that of finishing the three volume set of ceremonial manuals planned by Howard Galley to accompany the 1979 Book of Common Prayer.  While Mitchell is no Galley, he provides wonderful ceremonial and liturgical tips for those who are charged with conducting or assisting at the condcut of Divine Worship.  In this volume, Mitchell covers the services not regularlly used in the life of a congregation (i.e., not used every week).  Confirmation, Ordination, Confession, Reception of Converts, even the Daily Office are given the treatment in this book, and the material provided will give liturgists, clergy, and laity alike much food for thought.  Though I am not an Episcopalian, this volume, together with Galley's "The Ceremonies of the Eucharist" and Mitchell's "Lent, Holy Week, Easter, & the Great Fifty Days" are indespensible parts of my liturgical library.  I recommend them to you without reservation.
