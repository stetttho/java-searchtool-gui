 Cliff Martinez's score for the 2002 release Solaris is one of the most moving soundtracks I can think of ever having heard.  The music is quite well suited to meditation, reflection, prayer, and rest.  Having just obtained it, I was able to use the music one evening during my time of prayer to enhance the experience.  Nothing mystical or anything, just a hightened sense of what I was doing.  At any rate, as a fan of Yanni, Secret Garden, Mike Oldfeld, and other non-traditional musicians, I found this soundtrack to be a gorgeous listen, and I highly recommend it.
