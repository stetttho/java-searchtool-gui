 Having read the novel by Arthur C. Clarke, imagine my suprise upon discovering a CD that was inspired by the novel.  Because of my great fondness for ambient/non-traditional music, I had to pick up a copy.  I was not disappointed.  The blending of various concepts in the music - voice, synth, percussion - all lead to a pleasing mix that is soothing and just perfect (at least for me) to read by.  Until I got a copy of the soundtrack to Solaris, this was my 'read by it' CD of choice.
