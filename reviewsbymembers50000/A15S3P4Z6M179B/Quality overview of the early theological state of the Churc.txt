 I cannot say enough about Kelly's masterful work, "Early Christian Doctrines".    In my quest to find a text to introduce others to the various theological viewpoints of the ancient Church to lay and postulant alike, I found this particular work to be a gem.  Topics run the gamut from the canonization of Scripture to the doctrine of the Trinity, Eucharistic theology, redemptive beliefs, and even a glance at early ecclesiology.  For the first year seminary student or the highly advanced layperson, this book will prove to be a most excellent introduction to the Early Church.  I must stress, however, that this book is no substitute for reading the words of the ancient Fathers in the ten volume set of the Ante-Nicene Fathers.  This material is also avaliable online.
