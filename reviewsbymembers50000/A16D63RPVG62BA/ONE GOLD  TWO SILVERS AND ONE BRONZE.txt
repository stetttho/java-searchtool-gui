 Here we have four Italian tenors of the golden age, who captured world attention in that glorious past for their vocal and interpretative capacity. Other names that come to mind are Caruso, Zenatello, Grassi, Anselmi, Schipa, Paoli, De Muro, Merli and Bonci.  The four tenors on this superb CD have a lot in common. Born within seven years apart, between 1885 and 1892, they (except Pertile) sang at the Met, the temple of operatic singing.  All of them displayed mezza voce and heroic top notes on the stage. This CD has collected and handed to posterity their prowess, when the tenors were in their late thirties and at their prime. Interestingly, one may draw vocal attributes from their performances and make comparisons. Martinelli displayed a heroic and massive, Pertile, a sage but hard-driven, Gigli, an elegiac or turgid and Lauri-Volpi a robust, limpid and easily extended voice. The gold medal goes to Lauri-Volpi, the silver to Martinelli and Gigli, the bronze to Pertile. I liked Martinelli in "Come un bel di di maggio"(Chenier) full of pathos, Pertile "Vesti la giubba" (Pagliacci) for great artistry, Gigli "Dai campi, dai prati" (Mefistofele) for inspired    mysticism and Lauri-Volpi "Bianca al par di neve"(Les Huguenots) for unique mezza voce. Lauri-Volpi gets top marks for "E lucevan le stelle"(Tosca) recorded in 1928, when he was at his artistic splendour. The painter Cavaradossi is not his conspiring and patriotic self. He is in prison, reminiscing Tosca's sweet hands, languid caresses and voluptuous appearance.  Lauri-Volpi with an extraordinary, exquisite pianissimo sets up the mood before unleashing his despair with a powerful crescendo. It is an unsurpassed rendition of the great aria, as Puccini intended it.
