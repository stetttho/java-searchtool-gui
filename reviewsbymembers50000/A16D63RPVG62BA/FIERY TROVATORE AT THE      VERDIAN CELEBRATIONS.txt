 It is a great pity that this studio recording of Trovatore is currently out of stock. It is a feast of bel canto and heroic top notes (Lauri Volpi), musicality and scenic authority (Pirazzini), ample voice and resonance (Mancini), wisdom and dramatic spirit (Tagliabue). Add to it a lively and fast-paced score conducted by Previtali at the RAI studios of Rome in the winter of 1951.The sound is excellent and the voices soar above the orchestra radiantly. Buy the CD if you are a diehard fan (like me) of Lauri Volpi, the greatest Italian tenor ever, the supreme tenor for excellence and dedication. Eminent Italian music critics coined him the scarlet larynx. If you are a lover of showstoppers like Trovatore, dramatic phrasing and feline bursts abound: "il figlio mio" (a desperate Azucena in Act I), "all'armi" (a heroic troubadour in Act III), "Manrico" (a dying Leonora in Act IV), and "quale orror" (a mesmerised Count Di Luna in Act IV). At 58 years of age, Lauri Volpi was still the unmatched Manrico with a voice of rare brilliance, freshness and extension. His heroic top notes were unequalled for agility, resonance and breath. His memorable "Pira" ends with the famous squillo "All'armi" as a message sent to the moon! Pirazzini (Azucena), one of the few and authentic mezzos in the postwar period, sings with a romantic and not too dark timbre.  Listen to her brilliant top note "Sei vendicata, o madre!" at the very end of the opera.  Admittedly, Mancini (Leonora), a dramatic soprano with acute notes like stilettos, is not really at ease with the Verdi diabolical texture of "D'amor sull'ali rosee". In this famous aria, a youthful Callas triumphed one month earlier at the San Carlo Opera House. Who was Manrico then? Lauri Volpi, the scarlet larynx, of course. The final trio in Act I, the famous "Pira" and the Miserere are extremely notable.
