 It takes courage and little responsibility to provide and develop a ranking of past and present great tenors into a book of world-wide appeal without a thorough search, knowledge and listening experience. I doubt whether Helena ever heard or listened to recordings of Giacomo Lauri-Volpi (1894-1979)  otherwise she would have included him among the greats. Giacomo is tops, perhaps even greater than Enrico. I am saying perhaps because it would be unfair to compare Caruso's archival records even boosted by digital refinements with Lauri-Volpi's fine and well preserved operatic highlight records (currently available on CDs) of the early forties. Lauri-Volpi's voice intelligently combined the sensuous beauty of the young Carreras' legato singing with Pavarotti, Domingo or Melchior's resounding high C's.
