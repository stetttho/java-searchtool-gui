 This is possibly the only book available (in English or any other language) that provides a detailed look at the grammar and syntax of modern Ladakhi. The book is some 20 years old but the grammatical information provided is still current and valid. This book is really not intended for people who just want to get a glimpse of the Ladakhi language but since this is one of the few books available, even a casual interest may warrant its purchase. We have found that the book is very difficult to obtain through Amazon or other traditional resources, presumably because of a minimal initial print run. You may need to try several different sources. The book contains chapters on all of the typical subjects (phonology, morphophonemics, noun phrases, verb phrases, etc.) as well as a sample verb paradigm and some sample texts (in transliteration). Used in conjunction with Getting Started In Ladakhi, you'll come away with a fairly rounded understanding of the structure and grammar of Ladakhi. A Roman transliteration scheme is used throughout the book which is its only real fault. Ideally, this book should be reprinted with the Tibetan script to enhance its usability.
