 This book simply doesn't cut it and probably never will. The data for this book is very misleading -- there is no Book and Cassette edition even though it looks like there is. In actuality, the paperback book edition is the same price as the cassettes and each must be ordered separately. The $49 list price only gets you one or the other, not both. Audio Forum has been around for a long time and I was hoping they had changed their ways but they continue to repackage old texts with new covers and call them new editions. For example, the text in this book is from 1969 -- only the cover art is from 1992. To make matters worse, it looks the original text was created on a typewriter, run through a mimeograph machine (!) two or three times and then put on film. The end result is a poor quality product all-around. This is unfortunately true of many dozens of Audio Forum products. For those who aren't already familiar with Navajo, this text would be impossible to work through. Navajo uses a wide variety of characters with diacritics and accents, most of which cannot be accurately deciphered without prior experience with the language. For those who are familiar with the Navajo alphabet, it can be done, but you won't enjoy it. It's a shame that Audio Forum can't see to spend some money on resetting some of these older texts which still serve an important function -- just not in this horrendous condition. Unfortunately, Navajo studies suffer as a result.
