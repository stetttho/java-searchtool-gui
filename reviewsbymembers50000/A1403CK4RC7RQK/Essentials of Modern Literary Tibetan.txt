 This book is indispensable for anyone attempting to master literary Tibetan. Written by a well-known scholar, it exhibits the type of attention to detail that is frequently missing from grammar books. The systematic  introduction of particles and its approach to analyzing clauses and  sentences makes the task of breaking down complex Tibetan passages much  easier.  Each chapter includes at least one reading passage presented in  the Tibetan script along with a line by line transliteration and a free  translation of the text. Each clause is then broken down step by step in a  detailed section explaining the form and function of nearly every syllable  or word. An extensive glossary and index to Tibetan particles is also  included. An appendix includes sample readings from Communist sources. We  did occasionally find an error in the Tibetan script but nothing that  cannot be easily overcome by an attentive reader.  The Tibetan typeface  used through the book is easy to read and fairly well designed.  With  nearly 500 pages, this book is a must-have for any serious student of the  Tibetan language.
