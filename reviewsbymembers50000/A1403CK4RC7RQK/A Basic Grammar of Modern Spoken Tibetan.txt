 This is a great book for people who are already familiar with the script and just want to learn more about the spoken language since there is virtually no information about pronunciation. Unlike many books about the  language though, it does include a one page overview of the correct order  of strokes for writing Tibetan characters and a brief introduction to the  different Tibetan characters and sequences of characters (rango, lango,  sango, wazur, etc.). Another nice feature is the inclusion of the Tibetan  name for nearly every part of speech (which is not always as recognizable  as its English counterpart) -- something that's very necessary when  referring to grammar books written in Tibetan. The book covers all the  basic parts of Tibetan grammar, focusing predominantly on the spoken  language and also offering some insight into the use of honorifics. A  section at the end of the book provides a glimpse at some standard formulas  used in Tibetan letters and correspondence. There's also a brief overview  of the various Tibetan particles in table format for easy reference. The  English and Tibetan text are set in large easy-to-read typefaces.
