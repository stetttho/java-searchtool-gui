 This was one of the first books available to English speakers to learn the Burmese script. If you're just looking to gain familiarity with the script and understand how it all fits together, this book will fit the  bill.  The book introduces groups of letters, teaches you their Burmese  names and then offers a review after every few characters. However, the few  sentences included will do little to improve your mastery of the spoken  colloquial language. The book does manage to touch                                      on most aspects of the script but shoud be considered an  introduction to a more authoritative book like John Okell's Burmese: An  Introduction to the Script.  The large typewriter face is convenient and  awkward at the same time.
