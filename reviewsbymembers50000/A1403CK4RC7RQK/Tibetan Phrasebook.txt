 Like most of the books in this series, Lonely Planet attempts to offer the best of all worlds and does a fairly consistent job of it. This phrasebook provides some basic background information on the language and its grammar  but I have never found their transliteration schemes to be very accurate  for the average American English speaker.  Within its covers, you will  find just about every essential phrase the average traveler could ever hope  for. Its compact size and price make it the cheapest foray available into  the Tibetan language.  The Tibetan script is included throughout for those  who are interested in seeing the written word or just want to point out  phrases instead of attempting to pronounce them correctly. At less than  $6 USD on average, every Tibetan language enthusiast should have a copy of  this phrasebook.
