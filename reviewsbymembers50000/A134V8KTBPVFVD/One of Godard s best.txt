 This is a beautiful, exilarating, joyful film if there ever was one. I can't watch this thing without getting an overwealming sense of euphoria. Godard wasn't really known for making such whimsical films, and this one  still contains his cynical observations on the relationships of people, but  it is nevertheless is most exuberant picture. I consider this my favourite  film of his, and indeed one of my favourite films ever, along with his (far  more depressing) "Contempt". All the acting is wonderful to  watch, Anna Karina is incredible, as is Belmondo. It also features some of  Godard's most exciting experimentation. See this film.
