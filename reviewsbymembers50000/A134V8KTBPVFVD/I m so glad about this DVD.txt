 I'm thrilled with The Milestone Collection for doing this DVD. There are many movies that are in dire need of a proper release (on video -and- DVD) and Welles 'The Trial' was certainly one of these. The only copies that  were available prior to this was a number of very bad public domain copies  that were almost unwatchable, with terrible sound and picture quality. This  DVD changes all that and finally presents the film to a home viewing  audience how it should be presented.  The funding for this picture came  from French pockets, and so it is the only film he made aside from Citizen  Kane in which he enjoyed total creative control, without studio  interference. Welles himself said that this was the greatest picture that  he'd ever made, and I think I might even be inclined to agree with him.   If you're a fan of Welles, you will love this. If you're a fan of Franz  Kafka AND Welles, than this is exactly what your looking for. A brilliant,  stunning film, that finally looks brilliant and stunning.
