 I really do think that Eyes Wide Shut is one of the best pictures that Stanley Kubrick made, and was -easily- one of the best films of the 1990's. Easily. It's not suprising that so many people hate it though...of course,  this kind of film, with this kind of slow, tense mood is not usually one  that people associate themselves with. And Kubricks picture does this is a  totally unique and new way. Every movement in the film is accented. I don't  know, I think it's amazing. But I don't agree with a number of critics and  film journalists who claim that the film has a 'happy' ending. I don't  think the ending is even remotely happy. But I wont get into that here.  Anyhow...if you willing to just completely submit yourself to a film, then  I think you would like this picture.
