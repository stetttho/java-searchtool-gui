 I keep coming back to Godard. What can I do, he's one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, and everything he made in the 60's with Anna Karina (his then wife) is absolutely amazing. I'm not using the word amazing  loosely here either...this film in particular fills one with awe. It's  style borrows something from Dreyer's "The Passion of Joan of  Arc" (which Nana watches in this film) although not in a direct way.  It is completely unique, original, and highly inventive filmmaking, using a  number of cinematic tricks and devices that Godard was so enthusiastic  about playing with. Here, they all work. I cannot recommend this movie  highly enough. It is beautiful.
