 This film is incredible. Not for everyone, something I've learned by experience, but certainly one of the best films by Bergman. The final part of his 'faith' trilogy, and an extremely powerful conclusion, although not  a very optimistic one. In fact, this is probably one of the darkest movies  I can think of about man's displacement and awkwardness in the universe. It  also has dwarves in it, and everyone can enjoy a movie with dwarves. Uhm...
