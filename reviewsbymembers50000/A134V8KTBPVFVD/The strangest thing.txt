 This truly is one of the most powerful experiences ever put on film, and easily one of the most powerful of screen performances by Falconetti. Absolutely. But the strangest, and maybe even most wonderful, thing about  this picture is that it is ADDICTIVE. At least for me anyhow, certainly not  for everybody. Something about this film seems to make me want to watch it  over and over, almost relentlessly. I'm a huge fan of austere and often  slow moving works of film, such as everything by Ingmar Bergman and Andrei  Tarkovsky, but I wouldn't call their work addictive. Brilliant, yes...but  not addictive. But somehow, Dreyer has done that with this film. For me at  least. And it is even more so with Richard Einhorn's new score, which is  absolutely incredible. Anyhow...yeah, that's what I've got to say about  that.
