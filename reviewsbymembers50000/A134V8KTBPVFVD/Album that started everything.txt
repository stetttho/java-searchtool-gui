 This was the first album of 20th Century music that I ever owned. I bought it after seeing a number of Peter Greenaway's films and being blown away by the music in them. This album quickly became a favourite and Michael Nyman  quicly became one of my favourite musician/composers. This is what started  my interest in 20th Century music, and led me to a number of other  wonderful composers (Glass, Bryars, Part, Monk, etc.). The recordings here  are different from those on the original movie soundtracks, and I don't  want to get into which are better. This is an incredible collection of  music though, and I would recommend it to anybody who's willing to try  something different. It may take a few listens, but after that I don't  think there's turning back. Higlights are 'Water Dances', 'Time Lapse',  'Memorial', and 'Miranda'.
