 After all is said and done, I guess I would probably say that this 1993 recording of 'Einstein on the Beach' is the better recording. It's difficult though, because there are definately things I like more about the  original recording, such as the colder recitation of 'These Are the Days'  in the first Knee Play. Overall though, this one is probably better. It is  about 38 minutes longer, and the ending is in tact, which is important. The  ending of the original was good...but perhaps a little abrubt. Anyhow, this  album feels more organic, more refined, and this is it's strongest point.  The "opera" itself is truly one of the most incredible pieces of  music you're ever likely to hear, and with every listen it only grows more  so. I wish everybody would give this music a chance. Sadly, most people  I've played it for tend to dismiss it immediately. It's difficult, but it's  brilliant.
