 It's certainly true what the other reviewers of this DVD have been saying: it -isn't- widescreen like it says it is. This is dissapointing, but it still looks and sounds somewhat better than the previous video release of  the film. And it is a very good movie anyhow. His 1979 picture, "Slow  Motion" is generally considered Godard's return to his New Wave roots,  but I don't really agree. I think that it's found in this film, in which  Godard once again plays with the construction of narrative form like he did  in the 60's. The style of this film and those films is similar, whereas  much of his later work is extremely dense and cerebral. I'm not disparaging  those pictures; I love many of them. But I find that most people tend to  love his older stuff and avoid his later stuff...so I'm saying that this  film would probably make fans of the older films quite happy. It makes  remarkable use of Beethoven's music as performed by a string quartet that  we see rehearsing on camera (see, this is the kind of stuff you expect from  Godard, right?) as well as a great Tom Waits song, "Ruby's Arms".
