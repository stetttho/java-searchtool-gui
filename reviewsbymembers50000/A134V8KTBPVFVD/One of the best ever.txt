 This is the film that made me love film. It is unbelievable in so many  ways, that I could not even begin to recount them all in this space. It is  something that just has to be watched and experienced. From Lindsay  Anderson's Brechtian direction, to Malcolm McDowell's incredible  performance, to Alan Price's brilliant commentating score, this film never  fails. 'O Lucky Man!' is the 2nd film is a semi-trilogy from director  Lindsay Anderson, actor McDowell, and writer David Sherwin. The trilogy  begins with 'if....' and ends with 'Britannia Hospital'. These also are  wonderful, insightful, powerful films.  From where I'm standing, Lindsay  Anderson was never given the credit and attention that his cinema deserved,  and Malcolm McDowell continues to be one of the most underappreciated  actors around, turning up mostly in bad b-movies. Luckily, lately he has  had some better luck with such works as 'My Life So Far', and the very  recent 'Gangster No. 1'.
