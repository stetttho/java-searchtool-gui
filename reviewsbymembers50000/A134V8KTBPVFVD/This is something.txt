 Okay, well...I would probably say this is one of the oddest movies ever made. It isn't an artistic masterpiece like some people claim it to be, and it probably doesn't do a whole lot for historical accuracy either, but it  -is- entertaining, just in how extremely twisted and fascinating it really  is. It takes a stylistic note from Fellini's later work such as  "Roma" and "Satyricon" and then just sort of goes  crazy, filling the screen with mutants, bizarre scenes of extremely graphic  violence and extremely graphic pornography. And the fact that it stars  Malcolm McDowell, Helen Mirren, Peter O'Toole and John Gielgud, all  brilliant actors, makes it all the most fascinating. And, in fact, they are  all very good in this movie, in an over the top way. But really...in a  movie like this how could you possibly, even for a second, think to play it  seriously. It's makers (Guccionne, Tinto Brass) seem to take it quite  seriously. But really...
