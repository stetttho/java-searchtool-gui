 This music destroys me. I'm a huge fan of pretty much everything Gavin Bryar's has recorded, but this one probably beats out all else. It's a tough call between this and 'Jesus' Blood Never Failed Me Yet', but I think  this one wins out. 'Titanic' is some of the most beautiful, haunting music  that I've ever heard. I've heard it called good ambient music, good music  to play in the background. I couldn't disagree more. This is music that  -demands- every iota of your attention. Put it on, lie down, turn out the  lights and just listen to the whole thing. It is a truly overpowering  experience. Bryar's has a way of doing this.
