 After watching this, I couldn't believe that I'd read so many reviews where people called this film boring. I don't get that. This was as far away from boring as you can get. Slow, yes, okay, fine, alright, but boring  it is not. Besides, why shouldn't some movies be slow? It completely suits  the purpose of the film. Anyhow, Taste of Cherry is easily one of the best  films of the 90's in my opinion, and with an ending that is one of the most  original, daring, provocative endings to a film that I've seen in a long  time. A lot of people have reacted strongly against this point...I think  they were looking at it the wrong way, perhaps not understanding -why-  Kiarostami did this. I don't know...but it blew my mind. Anyhow...this is  beautiful, passionate, moving filmmaking and I would recommend it to  anyone.
