 This is one of the lesser known of Godard's films, but it is also one of his most exciting from his 60's period with Anna Karina, who is also wonderful in this picture. It's also the film that Quentin Tarantino named  his production company after (A Band Apart, from the french title  "Bande a part") and contains a dance sequence that I believe was  probably the inspiration for the John Travolta/Uma Thurman dance in  "Pulp Fiction". Maybe.  Anyhow...this is good stuff, and it has a  great opening title sequence. So for all you kids who love a good opening  title sequence...THIS is the movie for YOU!
