 I give this only 4 out of 5 stars only because this is not Godard's final cut of the film. I hate it when producers and studios feel they have the right to undermine what the director intended a film to be...so because of  that, I can't give it a perfect rating.  Anyhow, after Jean-Luc Godard  made 'Weekend', he didn't really return to narrative until 1979. This is  one of his early experimental works, and easily the most famous due to The  Rolling Stones participation. But don't be fooled: this isn't a film about  The Rolling Stones; not at all. This is a film for fans of the director,  and perhaps Marxist left-wing politics. The typical Stones fan probably  won't be too impressed by this film. I would recommend they pick up a  different video on the band. The Rolling Stones place in this film serve  mainly as metaphor, while Godard intercuts their recording session for the  song 'Sympathy For the Devil' with several dramatic sequences involving a  young revolutionary girl and a group of Black Panthers.  The highlight of  this picture for me is not the recording session with The Stones, but  rather an incredible tracking shot around a garbage dump, while members of  the Black Panther group read from various texts on different issues of  colour, some of them completely absurd, while a group of young white women  are escorted through the dump at gunpoint.  This is incredibly wild,  revolutionary filmmaking. More of a poem than a film. And always brilliant.
