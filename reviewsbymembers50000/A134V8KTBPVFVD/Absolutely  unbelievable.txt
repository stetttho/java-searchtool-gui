 I write specifically about this Criterion DVD version of the film. The other cuts simply do not do the film justice. Some of the films most beautiful and most powerful shots are cut in half, and some of them are  removed entirely in the 185 minute cut that is available on video. Although  other cuts were endorsed, this is 204 minute version is how the film was  originally meant to be seen, and I feel that it makes a big difference. The  photography and pacing of this film is breathtaking. It is an epic in every  sense of the word, but not at all in the sense of the traditional Hollywood  notion of 'epic'. This is a fragmented, episodic story, where some of the  episodes don't deal with the protagonist of the film at all. In some of  them he is merely an observer, in others he is left out entirely. These  scenes serve on a metaphorical level, not a physical one. Ultimately  though, it all culminates to express the same basic thing: the need for the  artist to trascend the earth, the natural world in order to reach something  beyond to material, beyond the physical. And it is often about the artist's  failure to do this.  I recommend alongside this, Jacques Rivette's film  'La Belle Noiseuse'. They are very different films, but they both deal with  the same essential themes. And both are extremely important works of  cinematic art.
