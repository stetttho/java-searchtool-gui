 Ingmar Bergman's "The Seventh Seal" is easily one of the greatest films ever made, along with "The Passion of Joan of Arc" and "Andrei Rublev" among others. Bergman himself is the director  of many masterpieces of cinema, and I think that "The Seventh  Seal" is perhaps the pinnacle of this. This is probably the film that  made me rethink almost everything I knew prior to seeing it. It is  certainly not a happy film, but I do not think I'd be exaggerating to say  that it -is- life changing. I understand it is Woody Allen's favourite film  also. That may not mean anything to you...but there you go.
