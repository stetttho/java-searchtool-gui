 If you have shopped for toiletry bags that can both store a great number of items, and hang up for easy access... look no more!  I was so happy with this item (purchased as a graduation gift...) that I bought two more for myself and another gift.  It is made of heavy nylon;  feels like canvas, and is both well designed and quality made.  The only thing I would have wished for would have been plastic containers for the compartments, but that is nit-picking a bit!
