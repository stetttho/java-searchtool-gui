 After being diagnosed with fibromyalgia and high cholesterol several years ago I've struggled to find a balance. When I started having hot flashes and increased fatigue, I went to Nisha Jackson's Southern Oregon clinic. It was there that I first glanced at "The Hormone Survival Guide for Perimenopause: Balance Your Hormones Naturally". The book offered what I thought was a common sense approach to women's health and positiive suggestions for how to feel good. Soon afterwards I ordered the book from Amazon and had my hormones tested.  I'm happy to report that since getting my hormones tested and getting on a treatment program to address my hormone deficiencies, I'm feeling better; more energy, and optimistic about how this adjustment may also positively effect both my cholesterol numbers and my overall outlook on life.
