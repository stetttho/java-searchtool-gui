 At first glance I liked the book. Short, entertaining chapters that make you re-think your thinking about writing. I actually found I felt comforted by the 'rules' since I seem to be following most of them. With over 50 articles published on the web, greeting card verse sales and several articles in local magazines, my bank account tells me I'm doing something right, but I'm in a constant state of "I could have done better." Rule #69: Grumble and Fuss, made me laugh at myself. With all of Robert's rules, education and experience, he's still a guy who speaks to the uncertain beginning writer in all of us.
