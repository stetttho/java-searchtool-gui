 I've had this TDK drive for over a year now, and it has never given me a problem.  It is quiet, burns both CDR's and DVD's accurately, with few errors; most of which appeared to be software error related. I have Roxio, Unlead and Nero 6 software, all of which work easily with this drive.  I prefer to use NERO 6 (purchased separately from this drive) in combination with DVD SHRINK 3.1 (a free program) to back-up my DVD's. I have tried TDK and MEMOREX media and all work fine.  This is a DVD+R or DVD+RW drive... so don't buy DVD-R media!  It's top DVD burn speed is X4 and I seem to get that speed consistantly without errors in recording with Nero 6.  I can always playback the DVD's I've made from home movies off my camcorder to DVD backups in my Toshiba brand DVD player.  (I would also advise not wasting your money by buying X8 media since this burner doesn't go that fast.) If you want a reliable, inexpensive and quiet DVD burner with a nice bunch of software... you can't go wrong with purchasing this one.
