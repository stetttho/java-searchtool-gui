 This is just plain fun! It's one of the few XBox titles that is made for any age, and not complicated to learn and enjoy.   Graphics are good, as are the tunes. If you score high enough, you will unlock new outfits for your performers and advance to new venues with songs increasing in difficulty.   I recommend checking out the tutorial before you try performing, as your performances are rated by the crowd and will determine your advancement through the game.  Start on the easiest level until you get your confidence up! Note that if you are using the microphone, you need to have it close to your mouth to register on the game. (*You need either an XBox live headset or XBox microphone (plugs into the standard controller; front side) to play.)
