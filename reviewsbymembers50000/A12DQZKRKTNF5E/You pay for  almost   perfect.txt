 Logitech makes great products and by in large, this one is no exception.  Assuming you have the right placement of the transmitter to eliminate interference from your monitor etc... it is a fast and easy set up.  The keyboard is light, but you have to hit the keys a bit harder than I would like and its noisy.  The mouse works well, and both do have that "cordless" advantage. I was unable to kick back and type.  I kept getting inaccurate keystrokes that appeared to be hardware error, not the operator.  As long as I kept the keyboard on my desk... all was well, but since I got it to be able to move away from the desk, I can't say I'm thrilled with what I would consider to be a fairly big chunk of change going to this item. Best wishes to all those who want to give it a try, I'm going back to the plug in myself.
