 This men's Pulsar chronograph is a nicely weighted timepiece. The face is as shown; classic but with a slight variation on the shape of the face. Appropriate for whatever you are wearing, at a price that's tough to beat.  I paid $37 for it with free shipping, and it will be given as a retirement gift.  I'm sure that the recipient will appreciate it's good looks and excellent quality.
