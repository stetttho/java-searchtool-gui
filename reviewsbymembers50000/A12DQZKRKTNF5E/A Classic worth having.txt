 Very nice gift set, and great price! I bought this for my three year old for Christmas.  She loves all the Disney characters and can spend hours looking at these.  One point to consider:  durability of the photo disks is low.  I had to remind her to be very careful with them and not bend.  (They bend in half with very little effort, so this may be a toy for kids who are a bit older?) Fun for all ages... and a super starter set to build on.
