 I finally decided to take the plunge and buy this item when the price dropped to $115 and shipped for free. "You cannot beat that deal, on this mixer!"  The mixer itself is HEAVY and not exactly something that you can easily take on and off the kitchen counter and store in any cabinet.  Check out the dimensions and make sure you have room for it... or make room; like I've had to do.  When using the mixer you really don't need to even scrape the sides of the mixing bowl.  Good thing... there's not much room to do it!  The bowl and the mixing device (whisk, dough hook, and beater are all included) both lock easily into place and the instruction book is very straight forward and has several recipies for you to try.  Using this mixer makes me realize what I've been missing.  It's got power, and with all of the available attachments it's versatile too.  The design is superior and the price is right.    Bottom line:  BUY THIS ONE!!!
