 Although recorded just after the departure of Henry Paul, which was a huge disapointment for me at the time. (I was awaiting a live album with H.P.)This is still a must have. From the opening, which is an electronic score (with Henry, they used the William Tell Overture)the build up to the guitar plug ins is apparent. The treasure here is Billy Jones last great live performance. His rendition of "Prisoner" and "Holiday" are worth the price. Of course Hughie always shines. Together, they are rocks greatest guitar line up of all time. Also get the new album, So-Low. Pete.
