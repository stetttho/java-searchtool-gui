 Thanks again Hughie!   You're right, there's a little Outlaw in all of us, and this CD sure brings it out.   DON'T HESITATE, BUY THIS CD!   This will quickly become one of those that, when you don't know what to put on, or are in a funked mood, PLAY THIS ONE!        You won't feel So-Low for So-long!    And, A huge SHAME ON ARISTA for not releasing the ENTIRE OUTLAWS CATALOG on CD.   They are ripping us all off!     We Love you Hughie!     Long live the OUTLAWS!     Pete Alberts
