 Get his live album. Go to Negron.com to see when his new live DVD will be available. (Very Soon). I saw the original Dogs, many, many times, in fact, it was my first concert at 13. I'm 47 now, and without Chuck, they're still ok, just not the stars of the show. Neither of these fellows, have Chucks range, or intonation. It's a shame that they're not all together. I'll bet it has something to do with ego's? Be Well. Pete
