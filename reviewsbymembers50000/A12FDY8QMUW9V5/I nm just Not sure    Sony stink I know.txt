 After having every Sony Product under $1500 I buy fail and die, so quickly after their warranty is up, I've tossed my hands in the air, and bough this panasonic today. I was looking for a Yamaha. Anything, to get away from SONY! RRRRR! Literally, over ten grand, down the drain! Well, this Panasonic connected, and worked immediately, and seemed to have an instantly better picture than the Sony it replaced (whose original japanese remote batteries are still alive and well). We'll see. I'm seeing all these other complaint about Panasonic motor faults. I don't care. It CANNOT be worse than the SONY motor FAULTS! IT CANNOT POSSIBLY! I'll report back, if, there's anything to report......  pete
