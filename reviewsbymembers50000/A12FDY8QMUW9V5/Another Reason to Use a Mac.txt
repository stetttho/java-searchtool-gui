 Good things for smart people! This machine is a compromise, of course, but, all things considered, It's great.I would give it 5 stars, but, it doesn't do all things as well as stand alones. All of you complaining, I see, are using windows. I know the pain... Also, about HP's having "carriage" troubles, that's very simply a cleaning job. The clear tape that runs the length of the carriage, Keep it clean! Other than that, HP has it all over Epson (stupid dirt and dust collecting paper feed), it's a good professional quality machine, and you can't beat that duplex (print on both sides) option. A no brainer! I've owned them all, and needed an all around, I'm happy I stuck to HP. Pete
