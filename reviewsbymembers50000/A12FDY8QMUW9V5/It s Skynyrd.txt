 Skynyrd is not Skynyrd of the seventies, face it. They're better in many ways. Most important is the addition of Outlaws front man Hughie Thommason, who can outshoot any guitarist Skynyrd ever had. And, probably all three together. The problem is, that the powers that be, know this, and they don't give Hughie his due. Not enough camera time when he's playing, etc. And, he has a tune up his sleeve that he wrote with Ronnie Van Zant, "Brother Travis" on the Outlaws "Diablo Canyon" album that should be included. Skynyrd is busy playing reruns, when they can be laying new tracks. Although it's a great show, this is covering ground that "Freebird" already has. I would hate to see Skynyrd become a "hits" act. My advice, buy the new Outlaws Cd So-Low, too!
