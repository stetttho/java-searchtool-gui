 You just bought the best screwdriver possible. The Milwaukee. That is why you are looking at this offset. Well, the screwdriver's handle offsets. A little. But, that just gives you something to hold against when the torque starts. But now to get into the tight spots. Think about it, we've all been there..... This is built like a Milwaukee too, after being thought out like a Milwaukee. It fits in the carry case for the Milwaukee. You Need One, Right?  Right.
