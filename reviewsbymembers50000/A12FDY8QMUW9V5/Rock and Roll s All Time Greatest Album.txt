 The Outlaws first album ranks with the best of all time! The lush, but not overplayed, guitar harmonies. The Point / Counterpoint of Billy Jones (Les Paul) & Hughie Thomasson's (Stratocaster)Guitars.  Their guitars, and Vocals, along with those of Henry Paul, bring a touch of bluegrass to Rock, and sweet background vocals, like birds, add up to the most amazing "Band Sound". While all Outlaws albums are keepers, "The Outlaws", is a MUST, for any serious music collector, or listener. Green Grass and High Tides is not the only high spot! You will be asked "Hey, What disc is that?" a lot! Pete Alberts
