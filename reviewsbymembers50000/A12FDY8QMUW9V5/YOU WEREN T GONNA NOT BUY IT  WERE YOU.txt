 You just bought the best saw money can, the Milwaukee. Now, I agree, this should be in the box, but seeing how you get what you pay for, and some fools will actually compare price on Milwaukee with (Brand B). Milwaukee chose to make this an extra, probably to hold the line on the saw. Now, you aren't actually going to cheat yourself because they hafto market to fools are you? OF course not. So just buy it. What are you reading this for?
