 Yup, it goes in my trunk, or in my truck. It is that important. And, the Milwaukee Offset head fits in the carry case with the extra battery and charger. So, if you are like me, and you must have the proper tool for the job. And the job must be done right. Well then, here is another Milwaukee that is a must have! When you get it, buzz your name right into the outside of the case with your Dremel. And you will be set for many, many satifying years to come. Good Luck, and God Bless.
