 Outlaws music is a way of life. It transcends time. If you consider yourself a music listener, and who doesn't, then you owe it to yourself to own at least one Outlaws CD. A greatest hits is a good start. It won't be your last. These Gentlemen can rock, lyricise, harmonize,better than the rest,  and make "Freebird" sound like a guitar excercise. I thank God for the Outlaws! Truly an inspiration every day. Pete Alberts
