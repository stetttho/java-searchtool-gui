 I own several PC's (ugh) and several Macs. This Titanium Book is the ultimate. If you are familiar with Apple's superior OS, and Industrial Designs, you are still in for a delight! Even my diehard WinTel friends drool! They just hafto touch it, and use it, if they're lucky. You want it, you deserve it. Don't feel guilty, it'll pay for itself! Pete
