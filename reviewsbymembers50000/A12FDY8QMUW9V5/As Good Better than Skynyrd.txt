 Yes, that's what I said. It's as good, maybe better. Dale Krantz (Rossington), has the pipes that were taking the rock world by storm, the next "Janis Joplin", many reporters exlaimed! Well, Allen's wife died during childbirth, and thus ended this band in yet another tragedy... But, don't miss these two great albums! They show Rossington and Collins at their finest! Workin hard! And, Dale Krantz has all the gritz required to be "front Woman". It's just a shame, that the new Skynyrd doesn't cover any of these tunes in concert, and just has Dale, as a backup singer.... These are classic, must haves for any southern rocker!
