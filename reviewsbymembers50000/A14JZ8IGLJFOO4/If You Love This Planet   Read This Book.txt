 A friend of mine heard an interview with author David Baron on NPR. What impressed him was how balanced and objective his view was. My friend immediately bought two copies of The Beast In The Garden, one for himself and one for me. The whole question of how humans can live with wildlife is a highly charged emotional issue on both sides. As I made my way deep into the bowels of this book I realized how utterly ignorant and naive I was. The author manages to examine the story of human interactions with magnificent but hungry wild animals with extraordinary intelligence . He conveys his passion for Nature at the same time that he maintains his objectivity.   Shortly after I finished reading this book, a mountain lion killed 35-year old cyclist Mark Reynolds whose body was found after another cougar attack along a popular trail in the Orange County Foothills. The lion had dragged Reynolds off the trail and his body went undetected for many hours. The cougar, protective of its partially buried prey, later mauled another passing biker. Anne Hjelle, 30, was rescued by her riding companion (who hung onto her leg) and other trail bikers as she was being dragged by the head into the brush.  My 35 year old son and his girlfriend also ride in areas where they have seen mountain lions and now they are reading this book.  It is clear that we human predators will need to change our habits if we wish to share the landscape with other highly evolved predators. You will see the world with wiser eyes after reading this book!
