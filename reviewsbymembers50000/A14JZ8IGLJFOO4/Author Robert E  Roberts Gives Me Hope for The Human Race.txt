 People like author Robert E. Roberts give me hope for the human race. "My Soul Said to Me" is an outstanding book that deserves widespread readership by all segments of society. I highly recommend it to anyone concerned about breaking the horrific cycle of violence that our current prison system perpetuates. It is well established that our prisons are training camps in degradation and corruption and that conventional solutions to crime and violence have failed on all fronts. Robert's personal account of his journey behind the walls of justice and his relationship with inmates demonstrates a bold step forward toward a more humane and enlightened prison system. Excellent companion reading to this book is "Violence: Reflections on a National Epidemic" by James Gilligan, M.D., a prison psychiatrist for 25 years. I hope Oprah invites both these authors on her show and gives these books the exposure they deserve. --Suza Francina, Mayor, City of Ojai, California, author, "The New Yoga for People Over 50" and "Yoga and the Wisdom of Menopause."
