 Gail A. Eisnitz is one of the bravest, brighest lights on this planet. I recently had the privilige of meeting and interviewing her and was immensely impressed and inspired by her unflinching dedication to tell the truth about what's taking place in America's slaughterhouses. For an update on Gail's work, please visit www.hfa.org, the website of the Humane Farming Organization.  I am a yoga teacher and I wish that all yoga teachers and their students would read this book. The great yoga masters through the ages urge us to consider all aspects of our lives and to revere all living things. Yoga addresses the ethical life through a whole range of practices that encourage us to live in harmony with nature, which includes how we treat animals.  The practice of yoga is rooted in the principle of "ahimsa" (non-violence). The great yoga masters teach that "The yogi believes that every creature has as much right to live as he has. He believes he is born to help others and he looks upon creation with the eyes of love." The yogi knows that his life is linked inextricably with other living things. A complete, holistic yoga practice encompasses a way of life that addresses the harm we inflict on animals.  If you love animals and want to do your share to ease their suffering, please read SLAUGHTERHOUSE and purchase extra copies for your friends.  To me, Gail A. Eisnitz is a modern day heroine who embodies the qualities of a compassionate yogini. I applaud and support her work with all my heart and soul and cannot recommend her book too highly.
