 Sacred Sanskrit Words is the perfect book for yoga teachers like myself who want to learn the meaning of the most often used Sanskrit words. The writing is exceptionally clear and easy to understand, and encourages and inspires the reader to go forward and learn more! As I read this book I began to understand that through Sanskrit we have the opportunity to come into the realm of a sacred language that is timeless and eternal. I highly recommend this thoughtful and illuminating book to all students of yoga as well as philosophers, theologians, scientists, health practitioners, musicians, historians and anyone else interested in exploring the cosmos and workings of the mind and soul.     Suza Francina, Author, The New Yoga For People Over 50 and Yoga and the Wisdom of Menopause.
