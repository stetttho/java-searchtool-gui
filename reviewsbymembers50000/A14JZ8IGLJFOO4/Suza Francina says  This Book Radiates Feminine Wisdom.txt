 I am delighted with my copy of The Woman's Book of Yoga & Health and recommend highly to beginners,experienced practitioners and teachers alike. On Thanksgiving Day this book sat on my coffee table and I listened to all the positive the comments from the women in my family as they browsed through the book and admired the clear, inspiring photographs. My nephew's young wife, who recently took her first yoga class, said "These photos really show how you are supposed to place the props and how to practice at home. And I like that it shows how to practice when you're pregnant." My younger sister, also a newcomer to yoga, going through menopause like myself, turned to the chapter on "Easing into Menopause" and said "This looks great!" And I know my 20 year old daughter will benefit from this book now and in the years to come. She has recently begun practicing in earnest and so I will also give her a copy for Christmas. The Woman's Book of Yoga & Health will help women of all ages deepen their understanding of how to adapt yoga to their changing needs and how to use yoga through all the stages of life--menstruation through menopause--with grace and equanimity. It radiates feminine wisdom!  Suza Francina, yoga teacher and author, Yoga and the Wisdom of Menopause
