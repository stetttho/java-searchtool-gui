 Absolutely the best attitude adjustment book I have ever read!  It's about the yoga of bicycling: the union of body, mind and soul while riding a bike. I felt inspired to read this biography after watching Lance Armstrong soar down the streets of Ojai, California, where he made a surprise visit on April 10, 2005, to ride in the second annual Garrett LeMire Memorial Gran Prix. A  life-changing, heart-opening book that I look forward to sharing with family and friends.
