  People at midlife and beyond--myself included--want to hear from seasoned teachers who have stood the test of time. Lilias has the depth of experience to provide older students with inspiration, encouragement and practical guidance. She demonstrates how yoga can help us to reconnect with inner peace and joy. I especially appreciate the very personal way she explains how yoga views the stages of life. She recognizes that as humans we are not only aging, we are evolving and growing until the day we take our last breath. I wholeheartedly agree with Lilias that yoga gets better with age!
