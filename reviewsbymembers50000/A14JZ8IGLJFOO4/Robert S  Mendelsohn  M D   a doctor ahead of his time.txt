 As a young mother I read and reread Dr. Mendelsohn's first book, Confessions of a Medical Heretic, which empowered me to listen to my instinct regarding the health of my children. At midlife, I read Male Practice, which further strengthened my ability to question conventional wisdom and do my own health research. Women today can thank medical heretics like Dr. Mendelsohn, who, in the early 1980's, was among the first physicians to sound the alarm on the medicalization of menopause. Male Practice warned women about the adverse effects of Premarin--a substance derived from the urine of pregnant mares. Dr. Mendelsohn also alerted women to the risks of the most indiscriminately recommended surgical procedures--the hysterectomy and the radical mastectomy. His observations on the hazards associated with the use of Hormone Replacement Therapy, including uterine cancer, blood clots, liver tumors and high blood pressure, proved remarkably prophetic. The recent Vioxx scandall only confirms what Dr. Mendelsohn and brave souls like him have said for decades: the "cure" is often worse than the disease. For anyone who feels shy about questioning their doctor about the side effects of any drug prescription, Male Practice will give you all the confidence you need!   --Suza Francina, author, Yoga and the Wisdom of Menopause and The New Yoga for People Over 50.
