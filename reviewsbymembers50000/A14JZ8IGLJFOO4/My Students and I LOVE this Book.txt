 Lucky for me, one of my students gave me this book for Christmas. This morning, toward the end of class, I found myself spontaneously going through the book with a small group of students. What everyone immediately noticed and found especially inspiring was the fact that it shows teachers of all ages, including many who are well into the "midlife and older" stage of life. The photographs are large enough so that you can see every muscle working. The text is also beautiful. My students and I LOVE this book!
