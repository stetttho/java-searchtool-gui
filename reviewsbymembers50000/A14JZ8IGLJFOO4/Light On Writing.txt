 "Light on Yoga" is my yoga bible and "If You Want to Write" is my writing bible. I began reading this book on the Summer Solstice of June 1987 (I scribbled the date inside the book cover)and have read it in bits and pieces ever since. No matter what page my gemini mind jumps to, a jewel jumps back at me. This morning it was:  "I used to have to drive myself to work. You cannot imagine what an uncomfortable, effortful thing it was supposed to be, to be a writer... It was my class who showed me I was working in the wrong way... I learned from them that inspiration does not come like a bolt, nor is it energetic striving, but it comes to us slowly and quietly all the time, though we must regularly and every day give it a little chance to start flowing, prime it with a little solitude and idleness. I learned that you should feel when writing, not like Lord Byron on a mountain top, but like a child stringing beads in kindergarten,--happy, absorbed and quietly putting one bead on after another."  Go Look Inside This Book and see for yourself what it's all about. I especially recommend it if you are a woman at midlife and beyond! If you still find yourself cleaning house instead of writing, go straight to Chapter 10: "Why Women who do too much housework should neglect it for their writing." Amen!
