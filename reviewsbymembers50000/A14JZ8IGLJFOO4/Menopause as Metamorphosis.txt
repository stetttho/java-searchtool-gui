 I teach workshops on yoga and menopause and this is one of the books I recommend most enthusiastically to women going through the Change. Susun Weed describes menopause as a metamorphosis, a complete change at the cellular level, when a woman changes from one person to another, similar to the dramatic change that occurs during puberty. Susun and other holistic healers who have studied the ancient women's mysteries remind us of the power and initiation potential of the two life events unique to women: menstruation and menopause. She views the menopausal years as the years of transformation from a potential mother to Wise Woman elder or crone. I read the first edition of this book during my perimenopausal years back in the 90's and now at age 55, officially on my postmenopausal journey, I continue to find little nuggets of wisdom that help me to honor and understand the profound changes my body and psyche are going through.
