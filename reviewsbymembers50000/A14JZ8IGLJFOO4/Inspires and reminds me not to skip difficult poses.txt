 I own several dozen wonderful yoga books and learn something new about the vast subject of yoga from all of them. However, Yoga: The Iyengar Way, is the timeless classic I turn back to over and over again when I feel the need for outside discipline to help me organize my personal home practice. On Sunday mornings, when I have the leisure to practice several hours, I make my way through all the catagories of poses, including all the Standing Poses, Inverted Poses and Backbends, by turning the pages of this book. The clear photographs continually inspire my practice and remind me not to skip more challenging poses I might otherwise be tempted to avoid. I highly recommend this book to students of all levels and their teachers. Namaste.  Suza Francina, yoga teacher and author, The New Yoga for People Over 50 and Yoga and the Wisdom of Menopause.
