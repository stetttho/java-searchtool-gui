 I have enjoyed Maggie Spilner's writings for many years and it's great to find her walking wisdom packed into one book! I especially recommend this book if your inner sloth needs to be reminded (as mine does) to get out and walk-- Every Day!   Maggie writes, "Walking supports health in every sense--physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. It enriches and balances your life. And it just plain makes you feel good."  She is the world's best walking buddy and sprinkles every page with practical --and fun--walking tips, guaranteed to get your inner sloth off the couch!   On a personal note, I want to add that there is a sign at the top of a hill where I walk that says: "Above all, do not lose your desire to walk." I have long been curious about the source of that quote, and, today, I found it:  "Above all, do not lose your desire to walk: every day I walk myself into a state of well-being and walk away from every illness; I have walked myself into my best thoughts, and I know of no thought so burdensome that one cannot walk away from it. . . Thus if one just keeps on walking, everything will be alright."  --Sren Kierkegaard, a prolific Danish writer, letter to Jette (1847)   Maggie's passion for walking is contageous -- reading her book will help assure that you never lose your desire to walk!
