 If ever there was a book that belongs in the waiting room of doctors across the nation, this is it! I am a yoga teacher whose classes are filled with women who begin yoga at a time when they are experiencing the symptoms of menopause. I keep this book in plain view and tell my students that one of the most empowering things they can do for themselves is to be familiar with the information in this book. To me, Christiane Northrup is the Goddess of Menopause, giving all us women in transition a Wake-Up Call! She reminds us that, "At midlife our job is to learn how to take care of ourselves instead of everybody else. If we don't learn how to do this, we soon learn that no one will do this for us." Thank you, Dr. Northrup, for helping us celebrate this liberating, crowning, glorious stage of life!   --Suza Francina, author, Yoga and the Wisdom of Menopause and The New Yoga for People Over 50
