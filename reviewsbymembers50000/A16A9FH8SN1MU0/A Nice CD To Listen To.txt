 Kenny White is apparently an artist who was successful making commercials and producing or playing back up for other artists, and decided to make his own CD a couple of years ago.  He has a couple of other albums out, but this is the only one I have heard.  I was introduced to him on David Dye's World Cafe, on the public radio station from the University of Pennsylvania, where he played live and was interviewed.  I liked what I heard enough to buy this CD.  I have to confess I was a little disappointed at first, as I thought it was a little slicker than what I had heard in the radio performance, and, after an initial playing, set it aside.  For some reason, a couple of months later, I picked it up again and like it much better this time around.  It is pleasant music, with Kenny playing a nice piano and displaying a pleasant voice.  Some of his lyrics, such as on 5 Girls, sound to me like he just put down whatever came into his head and put it to music.  Others are very good.  I particularly like some of the lyrics in shoot The Moon..."I swear when I drink and I'm cursed when I don't" and from Might As Well Leave..."you can't call it right, just cause it ain't wrong, you can't call it love, just cause we get along". And from Letter From X-Ray, my favorite song on the CD with a beautiful melody and some nice, subtle piano work, I like..."your skin was velvet in my hands".., and from Workin' On A Way, .."you suck for saying I'll never change, and I suck for never changing."        His sound is quite varied.  On Workin' On A Way, there's just a slight resemblance to Bruce Hornsby.  Other tracks are laced with a touch of jazz or folk rock.  And the final track, Symphony In 16 Bars, is a rather sweet, pretty love song.  Favorite tracks are Until You Learn, Shoot The Moon, Might As Well Leave, Different Today (a nice, bluesy song featuring a duet with Amy Helm, who has a great voice, and some nice sax work), Letter From X-Ray (this to me is the best track, and one I have used the repeat button on my stereo for a lot), Workin' On A Way and Closer.  While it's not an album that has knocked me over, and seems like it's on the verge of developing into something really special but doesn't quite get there, it's really quite a fine album and makes me want to check out his others.
