 I've been listening to Ray Charles since I was about 15 years old, when I first heard "What'd I Say."  His voice, the electric piano and the song were about the freshest things I had ever heard, and I immediately loved him.  That love never ended.  While I reluctantly agree with a few other reviewers that Ray's voice on some of the tracks is not what it once was, he still is absolutely wonderful and Genius Loves Company is a must for long-time Ray Charles fans like me.  The selection of stars with whom he sings duets is varied and interesting and the musicianship and arrangements on the CD are outstanding.  Everyone will find a different track that they like best and will feel Ray is particularly good with one artist or another.  But, while there are certain tracks that appeal most to me, I actually think they all are good and the guest artists all put in excellent performances -- seemingly a heartfelt tribute to Ray --one of the greatest ever.  My personal favorites are "Fever" with Natalie Cole, who I think sounds as good as I've ever heard her, "Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word" with Elton John, which some other reviewers have not liked but I think is particularly good, "Sinner's Prayer" with B.B. King--perhaps the best track on the CD, "Heaven Help Us All" with Gladys Knight, "Over The Rainbow" with Johnny Mathis (I think Johnny sounds as good as he did 40 years ago) and "Crazy Love" with Van Morrison.  While Ray has sounded better on other CDs, this is still a classic by a man at the end of his life and one which I'm glad I own and which will be played frequently.
