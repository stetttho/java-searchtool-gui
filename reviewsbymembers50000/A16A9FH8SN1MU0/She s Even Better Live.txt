 I've been an Amy Fairchild fan for about a year and have purchased all of her cds.  I first heard her performing live on radio and subsequently saw her perform live a couple of times.  I had always felt that, as good as her first two cds are, they do not quite capture the magic of her live performances (I guess nobody's do, but even more so for Amy because she's so good live). When I heard she was coming out with this cd, Amy Fairchild Live, I bought it without having heard a track, just knowing this would capture the magic, and, as far as I'm concerned, it has done so beautifully. One interesting feature is that she has recorded both full band and acoustic versions of Falling Down, Renee and Mr. Heart!  When do you hear two versions of three songs on a cd?  When I first learned this, I wondered how it would work, but I was delighted to find that it works perfectly.  In addition, Amy has four new songs on this cd, which are all good.  My two favorites are Come Around and Safe and Sound, which I think are among the best songs Amy has done.  In fact, I think they are among the best songs anyone has done!  And for my money, while I love the entire cd, the solo acoustic versions of Falling Down, Renee and Mr. Heart are superb, displaying Amy's voice and guitar work at their best. In the past, I have sometimes been reluctant to purchase live cds, because not all performers are good live and sometimes the sound quality is shaky.  But in Amy's case, I think the chemistry with the audience brings out her best and the recording quality on this cd is excellent. As is obvious by the above, I'm a big Amy Fairchild fan and I could not recommend this cd more strongly.  As I said in an earlier review of Mr. Heart, I truly believe very big things are headed Amy's way, which are fully deserved.
