 Brigitte DeMeyer's Nothing Comes Free is a wonderful album and she and her band are terrific.  On this CD, Brigitte's voice and singing style are spectacular....she does things with her voice that I don't think I've heard another artist do.  Most of the album is straight ahead rock/blues, with great guitar and keyboard work by several different artists, most notably Chris Rossbach, Ivan Neville and Mike Emerson.  I don't usually notice drums and bass much, but on this album they seem to stand out too.  Favorite tracks are Roll The Wheels, My Everything (this one has great organ accompaniment), By Yer Side, Big Boss Man, Nothing Comes Free and Ain't The One, but every song is good.   If you like rock/blues, do yourself a favor and buy this CD.  I bought it having heard only one full song, My Everything, and it has been even better than I had hoped.  And, if you're like me, you'll want to buy Brigitte's first CD, Another Thousand Miles, too, which I think is equally good. This artist is new to me and one I think we'll be hearing a lot more of.  I really love the band and her songs, and her singing just knocks me out!
