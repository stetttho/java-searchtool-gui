 I first heard Amy Fairchild on a live late night talk radio show singing Falling Down from the Mr. Heart cd.  I was half asleep when I was stirred by her voice and struggled to stay awake so I could find out who was the singer with this great voice and guitar.  I've been listening ever since. Mr. Heart is a wonderful album with a mix of song types.  The opening track, Falling Down, is a great song...the first I ever heard her sing.  I have also heard her do this live and actually prefer the live, solo acoustic version, but it's good on the cd as well.  The next two tracks, Renee and Mr. Heart, are also fine songs, Renee with terrific lyrics, a message about abuse and an interesting ending, and Mr. Heart a rocker with a slight country flavor.  In terms of age appeal, my 16 year old daughter liked Mr. Heart the best of all the songs, and it is one of my favorites too.  Also excellent are Movie, which reminds me a great deal of songs by Joni Mitchell with a flavor of Dylan, though frankly I like this better.  And Humble Pie is just an outstanding song, one that gets better the more I listen to it.  Tuesday, a moving song about 9/11, is also a beautifully crafted song.  For those who are interested, I also recommend Amy's first cd, She's Not Herself.  The first track on this album, This Time, is actually my favorite of all her songs. There are a great number of wonderful singer/songwriters around and what I think makes Amy standout is her voice.  The first time I heard it I fell in love with it and that has not changed a bit since the countless times I have listened to her.  And her voice is even better in a live performance than on the cd.  I hope more radio stations play her music so more people have the opportunity to hear this great talent.  I truly believe big things are headed her way, of which she is fully deserving.
