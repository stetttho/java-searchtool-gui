 After many years as a backup to some big names, Soozie Tyrell came out with her first solo album in April 2003.  I heard her perform live on radio station WFUV in New York right around that time, and went to see her perform the next day at TheTurning Point in Piermont,NY in what I believe was her first show since the album came out.  She was just terrific and I bought the CD from her after the show.  She plays violin, several guitars, piano and is the lead singer.  She admitted it was a little unnerving being out in front for the first time, but she was great. Soozie wrote all the songs on the CD and they are very good, with a slight country flavor. Her lyrics tell many stories about her life and are cleverly but unpretentiously written.  Her band is extemely fine, with her keyboardist, Brian Mitchell, as a real standout...particularly in the live shows.  Ste. Genevieve is my favorite song, one that is both beautiful and moving, but other favorites include Have A Little Patience, Ferdouganal, Who Rules Your Life (which has a great, almost Sting-like guitar introduction), Ain't Goin'Back, and Little Girl. And the title track, White Lines, interestingly compares her life as a young child traveling with family and her current life traveling with her band.  I have enjoyed the CD immensely and might add that anyone who has the chance to see Soozie perform live should do so..she is very sweet, and is a fine performer with an outstanding band.  I look forward to her next CD.
