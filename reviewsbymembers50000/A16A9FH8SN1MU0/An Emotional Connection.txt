 Phil Roy's CD, Issues and Options, is an album that stimulates the emotions more than any other I've heard.  Phil is a long time songwriter, who only recently started recording his own songs and making appearances.  His excellent voice is soft, smooth and very appealing and his songs evoke emotion like no others I've ever heard.  I am tempted to list all the songs I like, but there are just too many.  I will focus on two, but they are all wonderful.  My favorite, Amazing, is a song I wish I wrote.  I truly get a chill sometimes when I listen to it..the melody, the guitars, the words...it's just a beautiful song that I love.  The other I will mention is She Hurts, which describes an elderly woman in decline who just wants to feel special to someone again as she did when she was younger.  For those familiar with Amy Fairchild, another artist I am very fond of, this song reminds me of Counting Angels on the She's Not Herself CD in terms of the moving and emotional content.  There are a couple of other songs that have a jazz feel, but, believe me, they are all wonderful and many stimulate the emotions like no other artist I have heard.   For those lucky enough to see him in person, be ready for a moving, emotional, almost spiritual experience.  And, I want to add that I have spoken with Phil briefly after a show and he seems to be one of the most genuinely decent human beings I have met. I strongly suggest you buy this Amazing CD.
