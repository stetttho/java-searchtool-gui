 I think this very fine album by Alana Davis might just be a selling point for satellite radio.  I got a new car about a month ago, and, included at no charge for the first three months, is satellite radio.  I never heard of Alana Davis until I heard the song Create from Surrender Dorothy on one of the satellite radio stations, and liked her immediately.  We all know how annoying it can be to hear a song you like on the radio and then the announcer doesn't say who it was.  Well on satellite radio, for those unfamiliar with it, the name of the artist and song show up on the screen, or at least, that's how it works on mine.  I wanted to hear more, listened to a couple of samples on Ammy, and bought the CD.  Her music is a little different than most, I think.  I hear some soul, folk/rock, a little funk at times, even a touch of jazz-like chords, occasionally.  The guitar accompaniment is terrific and I like what she does with her voice, which has a fairly unique sound.  Her music does remind me just a bit of Ani DiFranco, but it's really her own sound and style, and is a bit hard to categorize.  I've only listened to the album a time or two, but I haven't found a song I don't like.  All songs are written by Alana Davis, with the exception of The Reaper, which is done very nicely, and a bonus track, Nice Time, written by Bob Marley.  Other favorites include Letter, The Benefit, which is a real rocker, Create-- the best song on the CD in my view -- Wide Open, Jaded and Stay.  A criticism of the CD might be that many of the songs sound somewhat similar.  However, I like that sound very much, so I guess that's not all bad.  This artist is brand new to me and I like her a lot.
