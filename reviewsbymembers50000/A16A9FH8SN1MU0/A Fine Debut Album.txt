 I like this CD quite a bit and understand why it has been such a success in the United Kingdom.  While I agree with other reviewers who have noticed similarities between James Blunt and the Bee Gees, Damien Rice and even Rod Stewart, I still think he has his own sound...one which I like.  And, as other reviewers have commented, some of his songs continue to play in my mind well after I have turned off the cd player.  To me, the best tracks are High, You're Beautiful, Wisemen, Out Of My Mind (the beginning of which is excellent) and No Bravery.  The last one, No Bravery, is the song I like best on the CD.  Upon first hearing, I thought maybe it was about the Iraq War, and subsequently read his bio to learn that he was in the British Army and served in Kosovo.  No Bravery is powerful, somber and disturbing, but very moving and a song of consequence.  Another interesting cut is So Long Jimmy, which is a bit different from some of the others.  It starts out with an almost Reggae beat, has some nice organ playing in it and ends with an electric piano that sounds very much like the one in The Doors "Riders On The Storm".  In all I like this artist and like the CD.  I recommend it and am a bit surprised at the negative reaction some have had to it.
