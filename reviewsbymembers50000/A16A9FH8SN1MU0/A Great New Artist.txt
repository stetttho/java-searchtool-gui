 I just discovered Rachael Yamagata in the last few weeks and like this EP very much.  She does remind me a bit of Fiona Apple, but I find her voice and music easier to listen to.  I don't have too much to add to the other reviews other than to say that my favorite song on the EP, which I don't believe anyone else mentioned, is "The Reason Why".  For my money, this is the best song.  I heard her do a couple of songs live on the radio with just her and the piano, and I thought this performance was as good or better than the EP, so she doesn't need a band and studio for her to sound wonderful. I like her a lot and look forward to the full length CD.
