 I heard the song, All The Rage,  from 700 Miles by Mary Lee's Corvette on the radio and fell in love with the song and Mary Lee's voice immediately.  I had never heard of her before.  Having listened to the album repeatedly since then, a couple of things are striking.  First, Mary Lee Kortes has just an amazing voice.  She has this great pop/rock voice on more rock-like songs such as Out From Under It, Herculetta and Redemption Day, which are my favorite faster songs.  And, on the slower songs All The Rage and No Place to Fall, she has one of the most beautiful voices I've ever heard.  It sounds like a finely played instrument with lots of vibrato and just the perfect phrasings.  Her range is incredible.  I have actually been playing these songs and people walking by have stopped and wanted to know who was singing with such a beautiful voice.  Second, I like every song on the album, which I find pretty unusual.  Even some of my very favorite records of all time still have a song or two that I don't like.  The more I listen to 700 Miles, the better I like it.  And, the entire band is really good.  While all the songs are excellent, I think the absolute best track is All The Rage, which I believe is one of the best songs I've heard in a long time.  The lyrics are moving, the string accompaniment fits perfectly and Mary Lee's voice just captures me like very few others have.  I give this album the highest rating and will definitely be purchasing the other Mary Lee's Corvette cds.
