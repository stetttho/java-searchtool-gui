 Shania Twain is really up there with the stars. From the first Track You`re Still The One , to Rock This Country  ! this really hit`s a nerve in me. There`s something in Shania Twain`s voice that tingled my feelings. Enough of that. Let`s move on to You`re still the One. This is a fine popsong, with a country feel to. Make hybrid music, make it so. Amen ! This is nearly a "perfect match" when it comes to voice/ music together. Track 2 When is a little let down, with not to much variations,but anyway an ok listen. Track 3 From this Moment is a little bit better, but not Shania Twain at her best. It`s veeery slowmoving, and doesn`t kicks your`e soul in gear, sorry to say. Anyway at Track 4 Black Eyes, Blue Tears, we are back in business again, with a more tempo up beat song. Track 5 I wont Leave you Lonley it`s an ok listen, but doesn`t give you a impact. Track 6 I`m holdin on to Love she start`s with the word`s Kick It, and kicks your`e soul in gear at once, with a realy treat when it comes to an earfilling and joyable hardtop fastback country rocker with the right "yiaahaa" . Track 7 Come on Over has much of the same quality, but here`s to little variations all trough the song. Track 8 You`ve got a way fittted well into the movie Notting Hill, but when it stand`s by it self is, sorry to say, a boring listning experience.  Track 9 Whatever you Do ! Dont !.Twain is better when she`s turn up the tempo. This one kicks some ass, but isn`t really up there. But at last the waitin` is over. The best of the best. Track 10. Man ! Feel like a woman ! This is Twain at here best. On this one she rules. This is a complete "hit song"  who make`s woman the surperior race in a way. Anway the musical knock out makes me feel good all over, because every thing fit`s in a way. Man, this song is a really "turn on" for female and male, so to say. From here and further on is more or less uphill. Track 11 Love Get`s Me Every Time, has a drag along feel over it and a joyfull song. Track 12 Don`t Be Stupid (You Know I Love you) is cool enough with a fiddle touch fore a change. Track 13 That Don`t Impress Me Much (UK Dance Mix) . Nuff said before. I like the simple version better. Track 14 Honey. I`m home. Ok Track. Rythmic and danceable. Track 15 If you wanna touch Her, Ask ! it`s in the same league. Ok. Track 16. Shania Twain at here best. Rock/Country hybrid with fiddle and the whole rock and roll package. Anyway this is crossover pop/country music which really hits a nerve.
