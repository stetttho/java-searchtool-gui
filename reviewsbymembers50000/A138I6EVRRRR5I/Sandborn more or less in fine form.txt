 David Sanborn give`s you "nightlife music", that`s for sure. The music all through this CD is sometimes funky, sometimes very melancholic, and if you mix this musical ingridient`s together it can create`s "minor masterpieces". On this one there some glimmering inbetween the different tracks. Track 1 Relativity has a steady rythmic beat, with a Sandborn saxophone "funky" and "talkative" in a way. A good beginning. Track 2 D.S.P is more melancholic, with a crackling beginning, which sound`s like a vinyl record, at it`s start. It`s slowmoving and has a certain quality, helped by Sandborn saxophone once again. Track 3 Rikke, bring`s you in a romantic mood, with very effective use of  somekind of muffeld syntheseisers, and once again Sandborn saxopohne talk to your`e soul. 4. Listen here. Well, this is a letdown in a way, but the funny thing is that this song talk to you in a way, and say`s :Listen here, with just the help of the different instruments. Track 5 Spooky. It has a very effective rythmic beat, that make`s youre feet move to the beat. Track 6 Missing you, cries out in a way, and you can feel the mood Sandborne is in when he play`s this one. Track 7 Rumpelstiltskin, is a funky melody, with a very rythmic beat that would "jazz" you up in a way. Track 8 Infant Eyes, is to slooooow, and is nice to sleep in to, but as a musical wakeup call, it`s not. Track 9 Southern Exposure is a good and funky last song on the CD. All in all this is Sandborn more or less in fine form. 3 1/2 stars, nearly 4, but not right up there.
