 Steve Martin are funny again. With Eddie Murphy too, this one is a real treat. Even the dog in the movie, is an exellent "method actor". The story of Bowfinger, a struggling director, which hope for sucsess is something which we can identified with. And Frank Oz commentary track on the DVD is a mini filmschool in itself. Weel worth the money. Should been a classic !!!.
