 This is the Best of Stan Ridgway. The Best is realy great, but the other tracks are a mixed experience.  The best track ever by Stan Ridgway, is Camouflage, and it`s included here as track 8. This is an extraordinary good song, especially when it comes to the writing. This is high class litterature, a short story,with a very good "visual" score. It makes me shiver everytime i listen to it. The rest of the tracks is not up there in that "department", sorry to say. Track 1 Salesman has also qualities, especially it`s funky rythm all trough the song. Track 6 Goin Southbound is also a good listen, with  a certain sting to it, and tempoupbeat in the right direction. Track 12 The Big Heat has quality all over. There are some realy weird stuff on this like Track 11 The Cannon Song with  the Fowler Brothers (from the Threepenny Opera). Track 16 Walkin Home Alone had a walkalong musical quality, but the rest of the tracks, is a mixed bag. Stan Ridgway`s 1985 CD The Big Heat is anyway a better treat. And why put in all that old Wall of Woodoo crap on this CD ?. Stan couldnt save that from his "old backin band ", and sometimes it`s just overall "noicy" to say it  with few words.
