 Screaming Jay Hawkins is an artist with a soul and passion for rock& roll, soul, blues, and jazzy rythm, you name it. As an introduction to Screaming Jay Hawkins, this album has it all. Little Demon is a grand opener which just put you into it, and never slips it grip, trough the album. It also put the unedited version of I put a spell on you in. You begin beliving in woodoo after listnening through this CD. The voice with all its growling and mumbling,is as scary and joyfull as ever. Forget the rather tame version from Creedence Clearwater Revival and other artists( to be fair John Fogerty sings quite well on it, but the woodoo hoodoo voice missing, and Jay Hawkins groaning is not included on that version). Little Demon and  I put a spell on you are repeated with to nearly similiar versions, but its one of my to favourites tracks on the album. To understand classical rock & roll, when it was raw,unpredictable, and full of pasion and soul, few do it better than Screamin`Jay Hawkins. This one is a real screamer !!
