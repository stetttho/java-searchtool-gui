 Eagles has the sound, charisma, and personalites to kick  other group`s in the "same area" way out there, when it come`s to pure, let`s called it "eargasm". It realy get you goin` into the right mood with Track 1 Get over It. A fast, good rockin" light fuzz guitar driven rock & roll tune with a Don Henley voice just right there where you want it. But the best one on this  CD, is Track 2: Love will keep us alive, with Timothy B Schmidt on vocal. It`s honest, well krafted, and something to think about for each of us. Simple and say so much: Love will keep us alive. A very suprising effort "should have been a great hit" this one up there with the others oldies and goodies you find on this CD. Track 3 The Girl from Yesterday  and Track 4 Learn to be Still, is ok tracks. And after that the rest of the bunch is goodies and oldies from the Eagles catalouge. Quality all over, not too much more to say in that department. But the  overall sound on this CD is very well produced, and should even kick life into the cheapest stereo sorround players which are around all over the world. Eagles at his best. This is it.
