  I was new to Vince Gill when i bought the european version of this album. The UK version have to bonus tracks Aint Nothing Like the real thing( Duet with Gladys Knight) and the Eagles cover I Cant tell you way. But the rest is the same.  Track 1 Whenever You Come around is if i you hybrid country with sweet lullabye music. Its also a gospel feel over the tunes but Vince Gill has a voice so clean and powerfull that it just hit you in your soul. I like the ballad`s best, but the more tempo tunes Like What the Cowgirls do Track 4, still kicks ass man.  Track 7 South side of Dixie is the ultimate track if you want to take a swing. Its produced by Don Was which has created a clean and smooth soundpicture all trough the CD. All in all this is music you want when its cold outside. It makes you warm inside. More words to describe the CD is pointless. When the words stop, the music takes over.. A voice from heaven.
