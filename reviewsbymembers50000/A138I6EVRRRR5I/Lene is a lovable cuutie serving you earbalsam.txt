  I would have given this album a 5 star has the whole album been up to Track 2 Pretty Young Thing and Track 3 It`s your Duty, but with more in deep listning to the 10 other tracks, maybe i will correct my 4 star judgment. Lene Nystrm has a lovable "lolita" voice, and Pretty Young Thing should a been a hit, but most of the radiostations in Norway wouldnt play here, and the unison voice from the music critcks gave the album 1 star and zero grade. But forget it. This is "sexy  pop music .Track 2 Pretty young thing is music to sleep into, and wake up too. Lene`s solalbum is a cultcd which will grow, hopefully the other tracks will to as i begin my 3 listning trough the CD. Lenes voice ticling my soul.
