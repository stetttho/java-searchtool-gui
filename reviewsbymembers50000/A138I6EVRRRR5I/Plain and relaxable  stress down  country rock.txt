 Alabama  has enough integrity to give you god ol` country rock. This is very simpel tunes, but right "down to earth" and the music fits in as  "quality earfillers" here and there. Track 1 Take a little trip, is a good exampel of it. It put`s the melody right on the track. It`s a "hummin song" with it`s light and soft touch in every instrumental and vocal department. As a whole it sounds good. Track 2 Hometown Honeymoon with it`s "walkalong" rythm also breezes quality. Sometimes the theme "spinns" around and around, but as a whole is quite likeable all trough. Track 3 Once upon a liftime is a nice ballad, that drips quality touches here and there. Sometimes it can sounds too much over the top, when the strings set`s in,but the atmosphere is intact, and that lift`s it above average. Track 4 You can`t take the country out of me has a certain "hillbilly touch" and lesser rock and a certain banjo playing brings it more "down to earth". Track 5  I`m in a hurry(and don`t know why) is anyway the winner on the CD. There`s a very uplifting atmosphere on the track that`s difficult to pinpoint out in words.  You feel a hit song when it comes to you. The freeze in your backbone tells it all. Call it backbone reflex. Track 6 Richard Petty is a minor letdown. A ballad that doesn`t spark. Track 7 Homesick Fever is the funky one on the CD, and it`s quite rythmic and effective as a whole. Track 8 Between the two of them is a nice and carefull ballad. The melody line is quite beautiful and it has a nostalgic feel all over. Track 9 American Pride is the title track, but this one is a let down. A stream of cliches that doesn`t work as a whole. Track 10. Sometimes out of touch is nothing new. A ballad that`s below average. Yes, it`s out of touch so to speak. Track 11 Pictures and memories it`s in the "old country feel style". And it works okei. Anyway this is plain and relaxable "stress down" country rock that`s most of the time is quite a joy to listen too.
