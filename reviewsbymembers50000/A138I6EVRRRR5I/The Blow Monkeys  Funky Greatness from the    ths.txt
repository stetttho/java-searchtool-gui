 This singel collection from The Blow Monkeys is an intellectual form fore "disco". Oh now wait a little. I will rather called it "funky  disco jazz hybrid". This Cd is rear, beacause each track has their one "personality" in a way. Each track stands for it self . This very relaxable to listen too. Some jazz, some funk,some "disco", and some pop, and you get an ultimate mix of pure musical energy. But the realy greatness with this collection, exept that it is a greatest hit`s singel collection, is the atmosphere all trough. The best track on this CD is Track 1 Wait, and you can hear the longer version on Track 11. What more can i say. This is maybe "yuppie" music, but is so good to see popstars dressed up in style, in clothes or  in musical style. If you had problem get you "mental motor" running when you wake up, Choises is a good Choise. This is anyaway the ultimate introducton to one of the best bands from the 80 ths . The Blow Monkeys will blow you away. If you wanna buy a new sorround system take this Cd to the Hifi Store, and it will swing your`e soul.
