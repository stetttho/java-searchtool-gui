 Talkin about rock and roll. Jerry Lee Lewis is the real thing.  Nearly everybody knows the classical stuff. Great Balls of Fire, Whole lotta, High School etc. This is hellraising striped to the bone rock and roll, and it realy feel you with joy, listning to it. Also the country stuff is great to listning to. But to more modern tracks like Drinking Wine Spo-dee odee, and Rockin my life away realy kicks youre soul in gear. Nobody can fills his shoes, when it comes to hellraising pumping, thumping, rock and roll.  He are what he are, and we love him for that. I am what i am too, and maybe more will find his soulmate listning once in a while to the "real thing" and what realy rock and roll realy is. Jerry Lee just rules on this one.
