 Peter Criss solo album back when Kiss "got bananas" and in the same year made 4 soloalbums + a kitch tv movie called: Kiss meets the Phantom in the Park. Before Peter left Kiss he put this great album out.I didn`t sell to much, but it went platinum so far as i now. Gene, Ace, and Paul`s album sold more, but Peter`s album is the best. The reason is that it so filled with earfriendly puuur pop/rock/jazz/ hybrid music, you name it. The ballad`s are the best on the album. The song I can stop the rain, realy does it. The drumming is terrific. Its not "heavy metal drumming" ala modern Kiss Eric Singer, but its the minor detail inspired by Crupa, Sinatra band, etc who does It has a touch of easy listening to it. A solid rocker Tossin and Turnin is also on the album. Nowadays Peter Criss is out of Kiss. Hopefully he will give us a new soloalbum soon. As a Kiss fan. There is only one drummer who did Kiss. The ones who take over the drumming from Peter are probably more technical drummers, and more intelligent. But do they have the heart and soul ala  Peter Criss ?. I doubt it.
