 This album is a winner. She`s great looking that`s for sure, but when listen trough  when youre heart are in pain, and youre soul are swinging from up and downs, this album gives you medicine.  With Jerry Douglas on Dobro, how can you miss the focus on great music. The voice, mmmm the voice, has a certain signature to it . It could be sometimes to softspoken to lift it up to a 5 star. But you certainly will put it many times on your record player, and you can cancell your therapist, that day. To say it with Allison Kraus: (Track 11): Dreaming My Dreams with you: It makes you to a walking lullabay the rest of the day. It`s an earbalsam song that will knock you over.
