 Alan Jackson is up there in country heaven with Dont Rock The Jukebox. This is one of his first`s Cd over 15 years old, but still has quality all over, when you compare it with countrymusic nowadays. Why ? It`s the harmony with the voice and music, which melts together, complete in a way. From the first track Dont  Rock the Jukebox ,  to Track 10 Working Class Hero we witness a musical extragavanza with  very few wrongsteps qualtiywise. This is "cool" countrymusic, with no screaming,fuzz, and disharmony. Track 4 the ballad Midnight in Montgomery is full of passion, in a very simple and effective way.  On Track 5 Love``s got a hold on you,  has the right portion of heartbreak  in the written "department", and also in the "walkabout" rythm from the muiscal ".department" . It`s the right mix between ballad and uptempo songs all trough this CD that shows the "Jackson quality". To summ it up: This has quality in every department. From the asskicking walk  along tempo songs to the ballad fingerpicking songs i know why Alan Jackson smiles more and more when he`s on the stage and on his record cover. He` knows what`s he doing, that`s for sure. To bring musical joy to country fans.
