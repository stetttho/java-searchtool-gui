 This is bare boned rockabilly with a certain ecco from the "classical 50th`s. Robert Gordon has the important x-factor when it come`s too "streetcredibilty" and carisma.  This record it`s not up there with his  classic  CD`s like: Bad Boy, and Are you gonna be the one. This has many live tracks, which give`s it sometimes a muffeld and distorted soundpicture. Track 1 Heartfull of Soul is a good starter, that lift`s up the  Robert Gordon voice in front for a good rock and roll "joint". Track 2  My Babe, is in the classical area too, with a minor agitate fuzzy guitar in the background.  Track 3 Something`s gonna happen, it`s a minor let down. A very tiny soundpicture doesn`t help either`. Track 4 Someday, someway, is an another cup of tea. It swing`s. It rock`s. It kick`s ass, man. This is a Robert Gordon classic, which is included on many other collection`s too. Track 5 Undecided is more in the "blues territority", and showe`s that Gordon has controll over that genre . Great guitarplaying on this one. too.Track 6 One More Heartacke, has a swinging rythm which grips you, and doesn`t let you go all trough the song. Track 7 Just because, is one of  the "weird one`s on this CD. It sparks , but it`s to much over the top sometimes. Track 8 Three time Loser, is anyway a winner. It`s an old Wilson Picket song. Gordon makes a great version with flaire and style. Very likeable this one. Track 9 Love you so, it`s not up to that standard, sorry to say.  Too much too soon in a way. Over the "top" is maybe a better expression. Track  10 Linda Lu, is classical rockabilly, down to the smallest bit, which smells quality all over. Track 11 Love Me, is a Elvis classic, written by Leiber and Stoller. Well performed, but nothing more. With just a finger pickin` guitar it`s too simpel in a way. Track 12 Nervous, is classical Gordon at his best. A very effective guitar lift`s this one up, and the vocal is as good as it get`s. Track 13 So young is a letdown, a talkative song,not to effective, and the girl at the vocal doesn`t help either. Too sentimental, oversexy, and artifical. Track 14 Im dreaming, it`s an ok ballad, wich has the sound of the 50 ths. Anyway. Robert Gordon showe`s that rockabilly rules with simpel remidies. Well done` Robert Gordon.
