 This is the real thing. Raw,unpolished, and full of gut`s and rock& roll soul all trough this disc. It kicks off with Track 1 Stupid Girl, which realy makes sence. It has something to say to all of us when it come`s to our tabloid society and thing`s that just polish the "outside" with no thought for the brain and soul inside which should matter. The rythmic soundpicture is very effective, and the beat is dancable. A hit this one is. Funk and postmodern punk makes the song quite a gem. Track 2 Who knew is a melodious song, with simple guitar plink and plunk. Pink`s voice is very in control on this one. There are a certain "sexy" rawness in here voice which to sum it up "realy makes it". Track 3 Long way to happy, is more in the experimental sence of rock music, but when it explodes later on, it bring`s you into some kind of "metal headbangin`mood". She`s quite raw on this one, and the style realy fit`s here. Track 4 Nobody knows is the "slow song", where she sing`s like she realy means it. It`s very simpel in it`s balladform, and most of the time it works quite well. Track 5 Dear Mr President, has a very open soundpicture with it`s very effective simpelness all trough. Pinks pain mixed with here rawness in here voice is a hybrid which are very solid. This is a straigt to the point critic of President Bush and is quite good storytelling which say`s the most in a simpel way. Poetic justice in other words. Track 6 I`m not Dead, is the song wich she "mumbel sings" in a way. And that`s in Pink`s case a quality mark. She spits out the word`s anyway, and it doesn`t matter if here voice is not so much expressive on this one, but it hit`s you anyway. Track 7 Cuz i Can, is a homeage to the glam rock from the 70ths. It`s glam,bang, halleluja rock and roll all trough. Track 8 Leave Me Home( Im Lonley) sound`s like U2 goes Blondie in a way. It`s the kind of song that grips you at once, and does not let you go. Here Pink`s voice sounds simpel and straightforward. The rawness is gone, and this is very girlish in a way. Track 9 U+Ur hand is more in the "honky tonk country" in the begining before it smash into raw power rock and roll. Track 10 Runaway is another slow song that stand`s out as something else. This one after the prelude goes over to more light heavy metal, and here it works well, but nothing special. Track 11 The one that got way, is simpel guitar finger picking blues with Pink`s quality roar singin all trough. Track 11 I got money spark`s not to much, and it`s the weak one on this CD, sorry to say. Track 13 Conversation with my 13 year old self, is a fine ballad .  Greatness shines all over.Pink rules !
