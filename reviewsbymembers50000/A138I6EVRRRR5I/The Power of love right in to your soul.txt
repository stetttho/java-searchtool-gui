  Why use many words on this CD. When the words stop, the music begins. The little  thing that  matters, the heart will always tell the truth. That`s the power of love. Thats the power of Celine. Therefore she sells tons of records. Damm the intellectual critics. They can have their bla,bla, words for introvert analyses. This one goes directly to your heart. Thanks Celine. You give us the truth that matter.  Shout it loud folks:THERES`ONE TROUGH EMOTION THAT REMINDS WE ARE THE SAME ( I really missed the song Let`s talk about love on this CD, but othervice great).
