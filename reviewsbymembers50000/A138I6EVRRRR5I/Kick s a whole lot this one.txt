 Little Texas is a fine hybrid between country and pop. Well let`s called it "country poprock". There are many  small "gems" on this CD. Track 1 Kick a little is the first kickstarter. This is a fine rythmic earfiller, with enough uptempo beat to make it a small winner if you wann`a :party,party,party. Track 2 I`d hold on to her, is a little bit more slow moving, and to be honest, it doesn`t really kick off. It spinns around and around with the same theme with not to much variations. Track 3 Amy`s back in Austin is a minor gem, in the classical country rock style. The melody is easy to remember, and has that good spinal chord feel, with small good freezes down your`e back. Track 4 Southern Graze is an ok ballad. The problem. Much of the melody has to many cliches. Easy in, easy out. Track 5 She`s cool, is more in the blues land. Not to cool, but nice guitar plonk inbetween here and there. Track 6 Your Days are numberd is good ole country rock, in the "easy listening" territory, and sound`s like Poco in it`s style. Track 7 Inside is a ballad, but you have heard much of the same once again. Ballad`s are noth Little Texas strength. Track 8 A night i``ll never remember kick`s in the right direction. It has a rythm and a melody which are easy to follow. Achy Breaky rythm which shows quality in every department. Track 9 Hit country song, is not a hit. This is poor man`s classical "try to be country" which swings ok, but that`s it. Track 10 Redneck like me has a refrain, but some how not very ok put together. But overall this Cd Kicks on most of the track`s in the right direction. A good introduction to the band it is. Kick`s a whole lot this one
