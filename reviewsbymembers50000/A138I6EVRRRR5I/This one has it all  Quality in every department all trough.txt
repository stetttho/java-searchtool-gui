 This is what she can best, and it goes from the slow to the tempoupbeat. Track 2 Conga is a winner anyway. A track called Dr Beat ( Track 4) says it all in a way. If you need Dr Beat, Gloria has the right medicine to move youre soul. A track like Dingus Li Bangui (Track 7) it`s fun to listning too. Mostly this is songs from earlier CD`s but if you want a good  introduction to here quality and musical style this one has it all in one place. Great. Just a great Cd. How can you go wrong when bought  Track 10 Oye Mi Canto and  Track 11.Here We are are included.
