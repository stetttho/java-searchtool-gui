 Suede. Well. At it best`s it sound`s ok, but there`s too many weak tracks to make this a winner. Track 6 is a winner, but there are two many up`s and down`s before that. So, let`s go. Track 1 Electricty, spark`s some electricity.It has vibes in that department somewhere, and it`s not a catastrophy. A good opener which spark`s, yes some electricity. Track 2 Savoir Faire as a "honky tonk rythmic" opening, but then when the refrain kicks in, it doesn`t sounds good at all. Track 3 Can`t get enough. Well, we can. This is just a mess, and your`e glad it`s over. Noicy "porman`s" heavy metal light music, but somwhere in there, it`s a melody who want`s to creep out. Track 4 Everything will flow has an oriental japaneze beginning, and is quite ok with it`s slowmoving atmosphere all trough. Quite good. Track 5 Down, has a "blip blop" computers`k atmosphere, but never kicks off the ground. The vocal sound`s like "poormanns David Bowie" on speed. Track 6 Fashion has outstanding qualities when you compare it with the other song`s on this CD. It`s very humming, and right to the point  when it come`s to a good pop tune. It works in every department, and it`s a 5 star inbetween a more or less "bloodpooring" music. Track 7 Asbestos. Well, we are back in the slowmoving "muddy music genre". Track 8. Head music is synth rock and roll, with that dreadfull "heavy synth metal fuzz" on the guitar. Not music for my head, so to say. Track 9 Elephant man, it`s quite ok, and moves on, but has a irritated "tin can" vocal all trough. Track 10 Hi Fi, it`s called. Well, try to test it on your`e hi fi, and the hi fidelty feel is not there,...yet. Track 11 Indian strings, has a  good bassplay, and the rythmicsection is quite interesting. One of the better one `s. Track 12 He`s gone, is not too bad. Simpel and effective, but when it`s gone, it`s gone. Track 13 Crack in the union jack sounds like "poormans" David Bowie singin` ballads. At the end you know there`s many fine themes and melodies out there, but you feel very confused, like nowhere man in nowhere land.
