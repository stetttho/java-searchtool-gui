 Criss is here far from the Kiss sound. But it doesnt matter. Its a little improvment from the Out of Control album, and it sounds fresh in todays music. Kiss producer Vini Poncia has taken over the production, and the soundpicture is pure magic. Its sympho rock, espesially on Track 2 Tears. Let it go Track 1 is more rock and roll. Move on Over Track 3 its more simple. He also have a go on the John Lennon hit Jealous Guy. Eat youre heart out Brian Ferry, who also had a minor hit with this one. Track 5 Destiny has a certain quality over it, but its not Criss on his best. Track 6 Somekinda hurricane, is a real rocker, fast and moving towards a climax of pure rock orgasm. Track 7 Let me Rock you, is the title track, and been out for a surprise. Criss doing doooo op, and its doesnt sounds like rock, is pure pop with the sound from the sixteees. This is a treat, and earfriendly. Pure joy. More or less. Track 8 First day in the rain is a ballad, but its not up to it`s usuall standard. Track 9 Feel like heaven is back on what we can called a "light heavy metal track". Track 10 Bad Boys is rythm and blues and its interesting. Over all Its time for a new Solo album from Peter Criss. Peter Criss will surely rock you on this one.
