 Yes. Indeed. Madonna has what we call star quality. To  start with Track 1 Holiday, and end it with Track 17 Rescue Me, i wonder if i need a rescue too. To be short. This collection is popmusic gold. Here are all the favourites from the 80 ths. There are some tracks that are outstanding when it comes to songwriting/ music.  Track 9 Papa dont Preach is one of my favourites. This has an atmosphere that make me chills. The synth strings, here voice, gives the ultimate experience to bring joy for your ears and mind. Track 11 La Isla Bonita is an another great experience. The acustic guitars, gives a quality  sting to the whole experience.  Track 14. Cherish.Woooooooah. This is my best experience with Madonna, anytime. This is simple, this is right to the point, this is the ultimate popsong. It`s make a stonecold heart soft. This is mind power, and will swing youre thoughts around in many different direction, at least  for a couple of minutes. There is to much hate in this world. In this song you got a better suggestion. More Cherish, pleaaaase. It`s simple, but sometimes it`s hard. Very hard. The other tracks are also great songs, but my Three favourites, shines all trough.
