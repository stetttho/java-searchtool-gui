  Steve Windwood doesn`t dissapoint on this one. The reason i think it`s his voice, and the way it fits in as a shining guide, inbetween the very "urban street sound" which brings associations to smoke clouded nightclubs and highlife so to say. Track 1  Roll with it, is an ok starter, which paints a "funky musical tempo up beat " all trough the song. Track 2 Holding on is a classic, or should have been the forgotten hit song gem. It starts, so, so, but then when it build`s up on the refrain, it realy kick`s your`e soul into "heaven feel". There`s something with the refrain that fills you with some sort of religious mood that gives you a good emotion. Track 3 The Morning side is an ok ballad, but it`s a minor let down from the song before. It`s moody, and the Windwood magic is still there`, but it`s not realy up there. Track 4 Put on your dancing shoes, it`s a fastback hard top rock and roller with guts and glory and also have the right element`s to make it shine in a way. Track 5 Don`t you know what the night can do ?, shines in it`s glory. It has a halleluja feel over it, and the Windwood quality dripping on the right notes, so to speak. Track 6 Hearts om fire, is a minor let down. It has tempo, it has a certain flair, and a funky beat, but that`s all. It`s easily forgotten, even when the refrain kick`s in,but the shining quality is still there. Track 7 One More Morning is an ok ballad, but that`s all. It`s to tiny in a way. Track 8 Shining song doesn`t shines too much, sorry to say. Anyway. To sum it up. Roll with this man. Winwood always deliver`s. That`s a fact.
