 Dwight Yoakam has a good ear for what`s quality  country,  inspired from the "bakersfield school" of great country star`s like Buck Owens,etc. This CD are Yoakam in more or less topform, except for a few letdowns, this CD shines. Track 1 Pocket of a Clown is a good opener, played in a  relaxable speed, this one delivers. Yoakam`s voice has a brightness and certain coolnees , which give him a certain sting all trough. But, hey. The best Track on the CD Track 2 Thousand miles from nowhere, is a minor masterpiece when it come`s to "hitsong writing". From the beginning to the end it has flaire and style, marked all over. The windy guitar and Yoakam`s  voice delivers something what we can called "outer space "music. The song kicks you off the ground, and you nearly belive you can fly trough room and space when you listen to it. Track 3 Home for sale is an ok slow country song, which doesn`t have a build up to a climax, but are anyway relaxable to listen to. Track 4 This Time, is classical "walkalong" country from the Bakersfield school of music, and Yoakam`s voice  has that "Buck Owens" scwung all over.Track 5 Two doors down has much of the same mood all trough, but doesn`t really kicks in gear.  Track 6 Ain`t that lonley yet, has much of the same quality as Track 2. That sometimes "undescribable" airy outer space feel, that fill joy into your`e mind and soul, that also Yoakam sings in the song: you hungry for some more. Track 7 King of Fools are more or less traditional country, but have some weak spots in between. Track 8 Fast as you can, is somekind of an inconsistency style rocken roller, which has some high or lowpoints all trough. Track 9 Try not to look so pretty are fine and put`s you in a "quiet is the new loud" mood. Track 10 Wild Ride, is a blues rocker, which sounds like "Rolling Stones" on a bad day. With this the 5 stars are gone.Sorry to say. Track 11. Lonesome Day is a letdown too. But hey there. Hi Ho Silver. This is anyway quality country, man !
