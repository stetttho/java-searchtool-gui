 Sade. What a voice . So smooth. The real hit song on this CD is Track 1 By your side. Sade has a voice which is very relaxable to listen to. That`s for sure. To listen to here is a fine cure for depression. Here voice has a certain mood over it, that realy makes you shiver in a good way. Some other trax are a mixed bag, but anyway the Cd shines quality all trough. The best thing about Sade is that she knows here roots. There are no hiss,rumble, and creative blip blop that some call music on this Cd. There are not to much tempo up beat songs on this CD, but why ? Track 4  Somebody already broke my heart is also a winner track with hit potential, with a very effective synthesier sound in the background which realy lift the musical picture all trough. There also some light reggea rythm on Track 6 Slave Song, for a change. Great song. Anyway. This album is solid enough to cure depression and make youre mind in better shape all trough the day.
