 This is  maybe "poormans" horror music, since it`s not from the orginal movies, but it`s quite well performed by the Silver screen Orchestra. It begins with the devil and ends with the devil (Track 1: The Omen) and Track 15 The Exorcist 2: The Heretic. But how is it inbetween ? Short melodies needs short comments, and i try to use horrific terms so to speak: 1. The Omen. Horrific. 2. Psycho. Screamable 3. Scream. Disturbing. 4. Halloween. Hypnotic. 5. The Exorsist. Freeeezy 6. Poltegeist. Spooky. 7. Friday 13 th. Murderish. 8. Dracula. Blooooody. 9. Christhine. Effective. 10. The Hunger. Weird 11.A Nightmare on Elm street. Nightmarish. 12. The prince of darkness. Dark. 13. Silence of the lambs. Shivers. 14. The Shining. Gloomy 15. The Exorsist 2: Devilsh  Shall i show you something realy scary? This one is not to easy to get hold to, so you can go to the original soundtrack to pick your favourites.
