 Get the party started. Yeah right !. Pink got the x-factor what some artists have, and some don`t. It`s here raw voice which does it, and when the music also sounds great, its the ultimate fusion, in a way. Track 3 Missundaztood shows that she has a voice that  fit`s in , whatsoever. I like hear screaming on this one at the end of track, and here laughter after.  (This is my first singel, she says with laughter, and the laughter is so raw and sexy that it turns you on, even if youre out of Viagra and castrated). The ultimate experience on this one is track 9 with Aerosmiths Steve Tyler, the duet Misery. It makes me shiver. The two voices click in to harmony, right on. Track 12. My Vietnam is another winner. So to speak. Great tunes, great voice, The ultimate Pink experience.
