 Samantha Fox new CD, produced by Fox and Joe Barrucco,shines when it comes to polish quality. The reason for the four star, is that some of the tracks are very similiar in style and musical preference. But this is not a let down. Not at all.  There are 13 tracks on this one, and is well worth the money, if you think  this CD it`s expensive. Some tracks bring you into dance mood, some dont. Here sometimes tiny voice, fit perfect on some of the tracks. The opening track is not at here best. Angel with an attitude. But hey, lets move on to a real "goodies" with track 2 To be heard, which is a uptempo dance beat song, whit hit quality, and a great sound of "airy" syntheseisers.  Sam Fox is one of the few artists who can say aaaaaaah, that will bring you  what  we can call "eargasm ". It`s a clever thing to put so much "air "inbetween here voice and the soundpicture. That makes here voice comes forward  very clear trough the different tracks. On Track 5, The Power Sammy goes what we can call " soft heavy metal  power ballad" with some fuzz on the guitars, included a more sensual and raw Foxy voice. Many of the tracks has some similarty with ELO (Electric Light Orcestra) and a  Jeff Lynne inspired symphonic sound picture. Track 9 Breathe is veeery mooody, and a great ballad with high Fox standard. Track 12 Dreams Unfold is anyway a great ballad, which put you in a relaxable mood, it has some realy hit potensial if it`s played on the radio. The funny thing is that  one of the best track's on the CD is the bonus track Time, which are full of rythm and dance, that should at least kicks some ass, and Sam Fox voice register shines more. This is a realy goodys for the fan, and others too. It`s a pity that it`s not have world wide distribution, and only distributed in Canada. But as a clever buisness whoman as she certainly are, she probably nows what`s shes doing. Samantha Fox shines once again.
