 Steve Windwood has his own style. There is a flair of "urbanism" on most of the tracks on this Cd. Some track`s doesn`t grip you at first, but there is something there, if you take your`e time an do some, let`s call it "active listning" where you open your`e senses and "let it go" . When you go through this CD, is like an interesting  journey  from the best of his solo stuff. The best track is the last one Track 10. Talking back to the night. Anyway let`s take it from the begining. Track 1 Wake me up on judgment day, is an ok opener, and sound`s like it`s from the 80 ths (and it is), with synthezeisers,guitariffs, and funky bassplayi, which creates a solid and interesting soundpicture. Track 2 While you see a chance is a nice one too, with a great syntezeisers play all trough the song.  Track 3 Vacant Chair is a scene change, moody with a releaxable atmosphere all trough.. Track 4 Help me Angel, is a more up beat song with a optimistic theme, with a refrain who delivers. Windwood`s vocal have never sounded better. Track 5 My Love`s Leavin is a little letdown in a way in the beginning.  The Windwood`s voice is good, but it realy doesn`t  take off before the refrain. And from there it`s Windwood magic all through the song. Track 6 Valerie is a an upbeat and uptempo song with a great rythm which realy set the standards how a good popsong should deliver. Track 7 Arc of a Diver is an okei song. It has a walk along rythm all trough which makes you remember it. Track 8 Higher Love with it`s carrebiean touch, have the x-factor when it come`s to good craftmanship from Windwood`s craftmanship. Track 9 Spanish Dancer is a let down. To slow sometimes a bore listning.  But then it come`s Track 10 Talking back to the Night, which realy delivers in every musical and vocal department`s. Closed your eyes when you listen to it, and you see colors, urban life, nightlife, and it will certainly bring you back to the 80 ths.  Steve Windwood always delivers. That`s fore sure !
