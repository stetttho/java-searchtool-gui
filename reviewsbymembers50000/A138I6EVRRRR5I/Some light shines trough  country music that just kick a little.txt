 Clint Black greatest hits ? Not much to write home about, sorry to say. It`s realy a downfall his version of the Eagles master peace Desperado. Sometimes everything goes wrong here, especially his voice. But anyway let`s take a look at the bright side on this album. The best songs are Track 15 No Time to Kill, which have a certain sting to it when it comes to  singing capacity and country flavour. Track 14 Life gets away  also is a good listen, an has hit poential. It sounds like belive it not like the The Cure crossover with country music. Track 11 Cadilack Jack Favor also have some charm. Track 8 We tell Ourselves swings a little bit too. Track 6 A better man has quality and "swing along". Track 2 Summers Commin kick a little , but the rest of the tracks don`t make me feel "country halleluja", sorry to say. Clint Black is not up there with Alan Jackson and Garth Brooks.
