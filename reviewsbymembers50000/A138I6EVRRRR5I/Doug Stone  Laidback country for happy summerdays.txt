 Doug Stone is one of the artists who should have sold more. He has a good voice, and laidback feel that fits into the genre.  This CD from 1991 i bought at a second hand shop in Norway, because it`s difficult to get hold on to. It`s a pity, because this is good listning trough. There are not to much uptempo songs on this, but Track 9 The right to remain silent is a winner in that area, anyway. This Cd is in between Ricky Skaggs and Alan Jackson, but  Doug Stone has it`s own style.  Since this is his first album he gave out here in Norway, i wonder whats he up to nowadays.
