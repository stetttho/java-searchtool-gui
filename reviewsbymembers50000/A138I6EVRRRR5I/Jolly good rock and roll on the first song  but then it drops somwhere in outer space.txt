 The first track on this CD Large Time has much of the same qualities that the best ZZ Top songs , lets called it fastback, hardtop, sprint, real rock and roll music. Large Time is under 3 minutes, but the beginning just blew me away, man. Then it shifts gear into a ballad hybrid, which is a let down in a way, and the stars fell down to 4. Little boring thing, this one. And then we get a another ballad, which is even worser. Oh,oh. It` sounds like poorman Jeff Lynne with ELO (Electric Light Orcestra). But we are soon back in business with Track 4 Champagne Love, which was a small hit for the band back in the 70 ths. Track 5 Imaginary Lover has god lyrics, but it`s sounds like poor mans Moody Blues. For the great 5 star beginning im sorry to say it ended in the middleway.  Anyway Track 1  Large Time is worth the whole album. Woah is the right word to describe that listning experience.
