 This is rock& roooool man !. Rod Stewart goes back to his roots on this, and kicks off with track 1 Cigaretts and Alcohol, and what a stunning opener. This is probably traditonal rock and roll, but anyway sets a standard trough the CD. Track 2 Oh La La is a more traditonal song, with a very good melody, which bring`s thought`s to the scootish folk music, with fiddles and a seldom instrument called bodran. Realy soul in this one. Track 3 Rocks is not up there. It`s similar in style with Track 1, but doesn`t realy  have the right kick off and creativity, but anyway, it`s an ok rocker in the most traditional style. Track 4 is a ballad called Superstar, it`s ok, but sound`s to pompous in a way, and it`s ridden by cliche`s. Track 5 Secret Heart, is as you read it  is very, very, simple, but a good listen with some "soulbalsam" inbetween. Track 6 Hotel Chambermaid, kicks off in the right direction. This is similar in style with Track 1. Track 7 is a let down in a way. A ballad that it`s ok, but nothing more. Track 8 When we Were The New Boys, swings in the right direction, and it`s the song with the most "hit" potensial on this CD. It has a very good refrain, and i don`t mind that the "theme" goes over and over again, when it`s done with quality as this one. The two last one`s is ballad`s .Ok, but nothing more. This CD kicks in many directions, but he`s best when he skip`s the ballads, and consentrate`s with the  basic rock and roll`ers. A good buy, anyway. Rod Stewart always delivers the rock and roll package.
