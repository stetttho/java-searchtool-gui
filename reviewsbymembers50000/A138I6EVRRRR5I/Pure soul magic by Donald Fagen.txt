 This is a great CD. You can close your`e eyes when you listen to and it will fill your`e soul with happines and pure energy. Technicalwise this is way above much of the other stuff modern so called quality music when it come`s to so called hi-fidelity sound or sorround sound. This one sounds good on a lousy Hi Fi system, because the overall quality of each track. Track 1 IGY realy put`s your`e soul in gear with the laidback jazzy blueeeesy mood. This is "urban big city" music under the stars. Every track put`s you up on a higer level so you belive in angels (if you dont belive in them before) . There are so many highpoints on this CD. Track 5 The uptempo New Frontier is one of those, which realy stand up as an original and great song. The titletrack 6 The Nightfly has also that quality mark on it.  Sorry to say. This CD is a great listening all trough. So good that the word`s stops sometimes. It`s a great joy to listen to a perfect production by Gary Katz. The echo of Steely Dan shines trough on most of the tracks, and this must be every studioproducers dream to produce a CD like this one. Pure soul magic by Donald Fagen. Should have been a 6 star, but the rating stops by 5. Nothing to do about that.
