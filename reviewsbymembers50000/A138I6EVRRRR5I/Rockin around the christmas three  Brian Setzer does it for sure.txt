 This is a real treat. To mix bigband beat with a classical "sunstudio" sound picture, lift this album way above average.  Brian Setzer voice is glorious sometimes and he gives flavour to upbeat tempo songs, and the more slower songs . The duet with Ann-Margret Track 6  Baby Its Cold Outside, is a winner, and you dont need to heat up the temperature in your living room. It`s enough to listen to this one. Im impressed how Setzer and his Orchestra can create his own identity and signature on many of this songs. Another winner is certainly Track 9 Sleigh Ride, with a swing  tempo up beat, and a glorius rock and roll guitar solo which just blow you away. To nearly end the album is  Track 11 O Holy night, shows what voice Setzer realy has. Full of  emotions with a big E. All in all this is an CD to rockin around the christmas tree too, and also to relax too. A great collection from The Brian Setzer Orchestra .
