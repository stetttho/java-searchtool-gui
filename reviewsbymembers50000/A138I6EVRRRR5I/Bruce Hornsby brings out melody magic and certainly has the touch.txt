 Bruce Hornsby has the touch on this classic Cd from the 80 ths. With his band The range, this certainly shows a whole lot of range when it comes to eargasmic pop/rock music. It begins with Track 1 Look out any window, and it drives you into the Hornsby world. The pianoplaying is the key element on many of this tracks, so on the opener too. He treat the tangents with the right feel and joy, and the vocal and other instruments just fits in. Track 2 The Valley Road is more in the "synth land", and is a fine mix between different keyboards variations. This one too has that open soundpicture, with a very clear piano soundmix , and the vocal and the other instruments just fill it out in a way. Track 3 I will walk with you has much of the same elements input, but this one also have a more potent vocal with the right tearjerkin` voice to build up the right mood alltrough. Track 4 The road not taken, has a very open soundlandscape, where Hornsby just drizzel out pianomagic in this very catchy and tuneful song. Track 5 The Show begins as a ballad. Soft but clear pianoplay with some synth strings along with it. Then suddenly it changes into more uptempo beat, and give`s you minor freezez down your backbone, so to speak. It opens up.He realy makes the show goes on, on this one. Track  6 The old playground is the first minor letdown, which is to compact . The vocal and the instruments figths for theire places. There is anyway a good piano solo there, all though. Track 7 Defenders of the flag, is a blues song, which doesn`t fit`s in a away. The harmonica is ok, but it has much of the same problems has the song before. Track 8 Jacobs Ladder sound`s like a copy of the original Huey Lewis hit, but Hornsby bring`s some new magic to it. Not at all bad. Track 9 Till the dreaming`s done, is an ok ballad. Anyway Bruce Hornsby brings out melody magic, and certainly has the touch with a big T.
