 Trouble, yeah, screams Pink. Yeah the trouble is that i can get enough of here.  If God is a Dj, this is what he wants to play, when youre are in the dimension in between heaven and hell. This Cd has so many highpoints, that its difficult to choose one. But Walk away is my favourite Track 12, and also Track 8 Save my Life. So what is it with Walk Away . Its  so likeable to like, after just one listening. The lyrics is like a short story. ( You had my heart, you had my soul. You had it all-didnt  you  ?). I still have Pink !. I realy look forward to the DVD from here European tour. Pink rules !
