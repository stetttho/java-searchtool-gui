 Ai,ai, this is sugar for you ear.  Track 2 Here we are is an all time Gloria Estefan hit.  This is sooooo releaxing to listen to. Here voice is simple,plain, and full of emotions. The  are some tracks which really drag you into some kind of tempo upbeat emotions. Track 3 Say is a winner in that category. It`s uplifting and full of movements. It`s a fine mix to have some ballads put inbetween. But i prefer the up tempo songs, and i dont mind here singing in spanish too.  The rythm of Gloria Estefan gonna take you sometimes. Track 7 Dont wanna loose you, it`s full of emotions, that it goes straight into youre heart. Say it simple, play it simple, and it will soften the emotionless, at least a tiny bit. This record was big back then in the beginning at the end of 1989, and still holds up. Quality all over.
