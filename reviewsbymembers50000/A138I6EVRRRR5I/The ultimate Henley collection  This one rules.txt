  Henley`s solo collection is not a mixed bag of music. Actual Miles shines quality all over. From the opening track Dirty Laundry, with a very good tabloid critique of the media society, which still holds up today, to the last track. This CD shines.But how can you possible go wrong when you move into The Boys of Summer on Track 2. You can realy feel the summer breeze shivering trough youre soul on this one. An open soundpicture with a somekind of air feel to with it. Uplifting. Track 4 It`s not enough love in this world is also a winner. It`s moody and have enough tempo upbeat to make you a happier human beeing. And  the lyricks tell you  things to think about too.  But the real winner and my old time Henley favourite is  Track 6 The End of the Innocence. The opening with the piano. It`s pure music magic. And when Henley`s voice is put in gear. This is what music should be. It`s like a short movie in a way. Just close your eyes, and listening.  Anyway if you new to Henley this one gives you an earopener when it comes to pure gold quality all trough
