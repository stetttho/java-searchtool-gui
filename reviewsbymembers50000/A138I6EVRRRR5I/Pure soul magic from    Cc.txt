 This CD is pure soul magic if you can get it from somewhere. This is happy and shiny music. Very polished and real balsam for your ears and mind. It`s over 75 minutes long and was recorded back in 1993. Except from Track 6 Across the Universe, written by Lennon/Mc Cartney, this is pure Stewart/Creme/ Gouldman magic. Sometimes live sound sounds disturbing, but not on this one.  Yes.It`s  back there somewhere, but you hardly can hear it, and that`s good. Track 1 The Wall street shuffle is a great opener, with it`s rhytmic and effective "hit`s you right there in your soul music" . Here lies much of the 10 cc magic. A chorus with voices that melt`s together as one, and music that fills out what`s missing to make it  a complete hit song. Track Im mandy, fly me, has much of the same atmosphere, so there`s nothing much more to add realy. Track  3 Good Morning Judge, is more rock and roll with more fuzz on the guitar riffs. It realy kicks off, with a touch of sympho rock also included. Track 4 Welcome to paradise, is more in jazzrock/fusion land, and it`s very easy to get hold on to. Suddenly it shift`s into a hybrid reggae/carriebean music mix, which makes it something special. Track 5 The things we do for love is one of theire biggest hit`s and sparks and shines all trough. A gem this one. It` has a solo in the middle too, and the singin` is realy great. Track 6 Across the universe. It`s certainly ok, but the Beatles version is  better. Track 7 The stars didn`t show is more in the light pop music country, but is a minor let down too. Too much, too soon. Track 8 Art for art`s sake has an arty opening, somwhere there in "heavy metal light " land. Great refrain, and some interesting riff`s, but not a masterpiece sorry to say. Track 9 Feel the benefit. Well. It`s a slow opener, and doesn`t brings too much magic to you ears. Track 10 Dreadlock Holiday, is anyway one of their best song`s ever, with it`s popreggae rythm and the laidback vocal. It was a big hit back there in the 70 ths, and it`s understandable because it shines from note to note, with it`s hot ethnic carribean feel which never goes away. Cool man, is  probably the right word to use. Track 11. Im not in love,has an airy uplifting synthsympho start, and is very atmospheric. And this is what we can call atmosphere with a big A. Track 12 is a medley called the Bullets medley, that contains three tracks: 1. Rubber Bullets. 2. Silly Love. 3 Life is a minestrone. Early 10 Cc stuff which is ok, but you miss the atmosphere which very developed on the later hit`s.  Anyway this is pure soul magic from 10 Cc, if you can hold of this very rear record. If you find it it will "make you day" if your`e into this kind of music.
