  Frey has put out some great songs  inbetween The Eagles work. He has a voice full of soul and heart. This is in a way a very good introduction to Frey`s solo stuff.  My favourite all time Frey album is Soul Searching. The title song is also included here. When Glen Frey sings about Soul Searching he realy means it.  This is so coool, so soulfull, it realy put you in the right mood.   My ultimate Frey song, so to speak. Many of the  other hits are on this one like The Heat is on, Smugglers Blues, etc, are also on this collection. This is pure 80 th`s big city, urban, soulfull music. The ultimate  music experience when you drive long distances in your car. One of the voices from Eagles wich has soul, heart, musical talent all over. That`s a fact folks.  And dont forget The title song from Thelma and Louise Part of Me and Part of You, and then you know what the ultimate track is when you start up youre car on a cold day. This is the lonesome drivers music, and of course others too.
