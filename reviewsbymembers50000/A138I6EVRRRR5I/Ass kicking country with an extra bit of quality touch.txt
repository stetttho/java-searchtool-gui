 Rodney Crowell has a good ear for composing good country with the right credibilty touch, which overall "kicks" in the right direction on this Greatest Hits collection. The main reason for not give the cd a 5 star, is his voice that sometimes not sparks so much as the melodies. But, hey, let`s move on. Track 1 Lovin all night, show`s Crowell in top form, with a fast tempo country rock gem, which makes you heart go bang,bang, and makes you clap your`e hands and stamp your`e feet. Track 2 Even cowgirls get the blues, is a little bit slower, but his voice has a certain flair, and this one sparks in a joyfull direction, all trough. Track 3  What kind of love has a "Roy Orbison" touch over it. Especially on the chorus,(it`s also cowritten by Roy Orbison). Crowell sing`s good on this one. Track 4 I Couldn`t leave you if i tried, is a minor let down. It`s a stream of cliches in a way. It`s very country, that`s ok, but this is too much. It gives you a certain feeling, that you have heard it all before with other artists. Track 5 After all this time, has much of the same problem. You sence that you have heard it all before. It`s ok put together,but doesn`t shine. Track 6 Talking to the stranger, we are back in the "orbison" landscape which is a quality mark, if you put it together in the right direction. This one does sometimes, sometimes not.Track 7 She`s crazy for leaving, swing`s in the right direction. It is an up beat "country swing song" which make`s you happy. Track 8 May a long&Lonesome higway, it`s a ballad, that doesn`t shine. It`s a stream of cliches in a way, and have much of the same problems as his other ballads. Track 9 If looks could kill, start`s in a more quality direction, with it`s likeable"walk along" tempo up beat. This is Crowell at his best. Nuff said. Track 10 It`s such a small world, it`s a minor let down, but when Rosanna Cash`es vocal kick`s in , it sound`s better, and lift the song above average, and it ends good. Track 11. Thing`s i wish`d i said, it`s a simple ballad, but it spark`s more than the other ballad`s.  Track 12 Standig on a rock is anyway the best song on this collection. Why ?. It has a rock and roll "halleluja" gospel all over, which makes you wanna swing,sing, clap, and stamp your`e feet alltogether. All in all. This is ass kicking country with an extra bit of quality touch. A good introduction to Rodney Crowell for beginners, this one is.
