  This is what we can called "mature pop". The Abba sound still shines inbetween from the songs from the 70 ths. The reason for that it`s not get a 5 star is that it`s to much syntheseizers on some of  the tracks, which disturbs the  complete perfect soundpicture some times and pushes Agnetha`s voice back in the " backyard". But anyway. Here is value for the money. 18 tracks from the best of here solo stuff. The real goodies are the following tracks. It`s starts with the all time "tropical summer hit": 1.The heat is on. This is a real swinger, with enough tropical rythm that wanna get you in the real: "party,party mood".  It was a big hit in Scandinavia back in the 80 ths. Track 3 Let it shine is also one of the winners. It`s simple pure pop energy, and here voice is magic. To say it short: This one realy shines.  Let`s skip the "discoinspired" stuff and go Track 11: Slipping through my fingers, written by Ex members of Abba Anderson and Ulvaeus. This is pure Abba energy, and a glory sound right trough. Thats what we can called harmony with a big H. Track 13: Can`t Shake Loose is a real tempo up beat song. Winning stuff, this one too. Much moore goodies on this album, and a very good introduction to Agnetha Faltskogs solo stuff.  Pure earorgasmic music with a voice with pure gold in it.
