 Track 15. Human is a great an uplifting synth song, and was very clever when it came out back then in the 80 ths. The rest. Well it`s a mixed bag of syntheseisers inspired, let`s called it "blip blop" music. Because that`s what it`s all about when you try to listen to this band. There`s not much more instruments. This was before the big "computer" revolution. The early hits was very "blip blopped". Track 1 Love Action is fun to listen to, but very forgetable when your`e finished with it. Track 2 Mirror Man, is a  tempo upbeat song, but sounds very like the first one. And that`s the main problem with Human League. Much of the track`s sound`s to like. But if you into this, genre....,fine. Track 5 The Reagge inspired Don`t you know i want you, is one of the better tracks, with little more rythm and air inbetween the vocal. Track 9 Do or Die with more "carribean" rythm is a fun listen, but nothing more. Track 13 Louise is a great tune, but an irrititaiting vocal. Even the synth can "sing" better than this  But as i have written before. The greatest song on this and the ultimate song is Track  15 Human, which have the quality mark "stamped" all over in every department. It`s fresh and very innovative, and it gives you that "creeping good cold shivering feeling" down your backbone. Anyway. This CD is certainly not every one`s cup of tea.
