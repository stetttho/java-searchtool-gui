 Alannah Myles is something special. Here voice is mysterious and carismatic. This is "sword and sorscery" rock & roll. Track 1 Our world our time in it`s light form with it`s "heavy metal" inspired riffs certainly kicks this "middel age" inspired melody right into your soul. Trembling good rock and roll with devilish dark  vocal from Alannah Myles. Track 2 Make me happy is more in the "funky blues" territory". Anyway it`s screamin`good , with it`s very steady,ready,go go beat. Track 3 Sonny say you will it`s the quality ballad on the CD. Here vocal is very disciplined on this one, but here "hurting quality vocal" shines all over. Make you shakin` when you listen to it. Track 4 Tumbelweed is straight rock & roll . Straight forward ,but it swings and shakes in quality directions all trough. Track 5 Livin on a memory sounds like  early Bon Jovi, but when Allanha Myles starts to sing, she put`s here unique vision on it, and makes it here own. Track 6 Song instead of a Kiss is the symphonic track on the CD. It doesn`t grip me. It`s a stream of cliches, and Myles voice is too "polished" and it doesn`t fit here at all. The weak one, this track. Track 7 Love in the big town, we are back in the "light heavy metal  landscape" and it works ok, but nothing special. Track 8 The last time i saw William is the "pop song" on the CD. It`s "humming"and simpel. It doesn`t have any extraordinary qualitys. Track 9 Lies and Rumours is back in business with it`s light heavy metal touch, and effective guitar riffs puts inbetween here and there. An effective refrain on the melody. Track 10 Rockinhorse is the one that realy goes back to the "blues roots" with a very effective finger picking acoustic guitar play that lifts this one above average.  Allanha Myles is one of the few female vocal`s that has a "magic touch"  that rocks all over. In other words "she`s got it".
