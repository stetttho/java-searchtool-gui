 Songs like The Joker and Abacadabra is Steve Miller at his best. This one. Well. It`s certainly not his best effort. I`m not sure of this one at all. It sounds more like a technical experiment in what you can do with digital teqnique way back in 1984, and on this one remasterd and so called "up to date". Well. Let`s take a look at the bright side and forget the more or less crappy songs, and consentrate on the "good" ones. There are some belive it or not. Skip the first four tracks, and Track 5 Who do you love, shove`s some of the Steve Miller magic, the voice and the soundpicture, is ok on this one. Track 8 Bongo, bongo, has a certain charm with the bongo, bongo, rythm, and effects. Track 10 Golden Opportunity is anway a good rock & roller with lesser synth and more guitars, etc. Track 12 The Hollywood Dream is the best track, relaxable and moving, and shows much of the good old Steve Miller Band. Anyway. Not much abacadabra on this one, sorry to say.
