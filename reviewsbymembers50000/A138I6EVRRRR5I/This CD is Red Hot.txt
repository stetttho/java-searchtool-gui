 Brian Setzer give us rockabilly riot. That`s for sure. This is bare bone music, stripped down to the right tune in for the real thing. The sound is pure nostalgic. To go back to the roots as he does on Track 3 Real Wild Child, gives us  a sting of Jerry Lee Lewis when the piano is pumping up the steam. All in all some of the tracks give me the same feeling listen to a Classic Jerry Lee record. Its fire out there, in a way. The reason for that i dont give this record a five star, is that tracks like Mona Lisa and Get Rhytm does not belong here in a way. Brian Setzer and Robert Gordon is two personalities in classic rockabilly who gives the listner a feeling of the rock and roll  with the right echo sound on the microphone. I realy look forward two Volume 2. As  Brian writes on the innercover: Put this thing on and cranck it up. I dare ya not tap your foot, and whoop and holler.  Yeah. Right. Bare bone rockabilly on this one. Look forward to volume 2.
