 This is a weird one. To bring his 8o ths "hip to the square" style to some classical rock and roll songs. It`s a so so listening, that put`s Huey Lewis all over the song`s but have problem`s to bring us back to 5o ths. It start`s ok with the   soulfull saxophone on Shake Rattle and Roll, on track 1, but  then Lewis voice doesn` fit`s in in a way. Track 2 Blue Monday, has a good musical background atmosphere, but the vocal one brings it down. The saxophone is great anyway. Track 3 Searching for my love, is a sentimental weepie, and the quality mark weeps too. Track 4 She`s somekind of wonderful, is more in the Lewis 80 ths style, and this one works. On Track 5 But it`s alright we are back in the "stream of cliches" once again. It`s anyway ok in a way.  Track 6. If you gotta make fool of somebody, sounds like "poor manns"Burt Bacarach,which is a minor stepdown. Track 7 Mother in Law, is an upstiffer, and on this one Huey "steps" on the right buttons, all trough. Track 8  Little Bitty Pretty One, is an even better song. The only 5 star song on this CD, with it`s tempo up beat rock and roll rythm all trough. This one shines. Track 9 Good Morning  little school girl, is an ok, blues song, which another vocal than Huey (or it could be?) brings some flaire to the song. Track 10 Stagger Lee, is a classic. The original is better. Track 11. She shot a hole in my soul. Yes she does and Huey does too, when i listen to it. Bad to the bone this, with it`s hybrid 50 th`s and 80 ths soundpicture. Track 12 Surley i love you, sound`s like a "comic book song", and is more "cartoon" than rock and roll. Track 13 You left the water running, is cool, and has a certain temperature all trough. Track 14 Your cash ain nothin but trash, has some guts, but it doesn`t kicks off . Track 15 Function at the junction has big band flair, but that`s all. Track 16 Better to have and not need, it`s "urban big band beat" as poor man`s blues brothers, but that`s not a quality mark on this one, but it sparks here and there sometimes. Track 17 Going down slow, is a fast "blues rock and roller" that sparks lively. As a whole this one shake`s sometimes, but on most of the track`s it doesn`t. That`s it folks !
