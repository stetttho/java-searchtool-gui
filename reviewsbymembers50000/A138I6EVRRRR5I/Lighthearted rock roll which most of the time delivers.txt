 This Shakin` Stevens collection from the epic years has many songs of what we can called " one hit wonders"tracks. The rest is average,and some are below. There are 25 tracks on this CD, and it realy kick start`s with Track 1 This ole house, which swing`s ok, and Shakin Stevens sings with a "poor man Elvis P" voice. But the 50 ths atmosphere in the musical department helps. Track 2 Cry just a little bit, walk along in a hummin``way, with Stevens "sobbing" voice. Track 3 Lipstick,powder, and paint is average. The rythm is ok, but that`s most of it. Track 4 Green Door, lifts the  mood, and Shakin Stevens sings quite good on this way on this more or less "classical rock& roll" song. Track 5 A love worth waiting for, is a very polished song, but the uplifting mood helps it all trough. Track 7 What do you want to make those eyes at me for, is an ok sound. But there are too much "ecco" to much sound. To much of everything in other words. Track 7 Rockin good way, is a duet with Bonnie Tyler.  This Benton classic sounds much like the original musical whise. The original thing it`s how theire voices fits together. Tyler`s raspin``voice, and Shakin`s polish one. Sometimes it sparks quite good. Track 8 Marie, Marie, is a weak track, that spinns around and around, and that`s most of it. Track 9 Teardrops, is a very light hearted "rock & roller", with Hank Marvin on guitar that brings flavour and color to the song. Track 10 Turning away, is very average. It  spins too much around in the same "themeditch". Track 11 You drive me crazy. It`s in the"hulking " department. Much ecco and hulking "tearjerks" this in the right direction. Track 12 A letter to you is average. The problem is that this one spins to much in the same direction. To little variatons. To little of everything. Track 13 Oh Julie, is a Shakin Steven`s original. It`s a very catchy tune, that grips you. It`s a song in the "who cares it`s just fun,fun,fun`lifephilosophy department. Track 14 Because i love you. This is the first ballad, and it`s a stream of cliches, and in the world of "booredom". Track 15 I might, is an easyway and catchy rock&roller, and that`s it. Track 16 Hot Dog, is much in the same department as track 15. Track 17 Breaking up my heart, is a disco/rock and roll hybrid. Awfull. Track 18 It`s raining. The second ballad on this CD, does`nt deliver. Track 19 Love attack is a hybrid in synth/rock &roll country. Weird. Track 20 Shirley. We are back in business again. This is a fun fun fun gem rock&roller. Very catchy tune this one. Track 21 A little boogie woogie. Sure,but the production is overkilled. Sound`s ok though. Track 22 Give me your heart tonight, is most of the time quite moody. The accordian play helps it above average in the quality department. Track 23  It`s late. Well. It begin`s and soon it`s over. Forgetable is the right word. Track 24 Radio is an acoustic rock & roller with good drumming and rythm.  Track 25 I`ll be satisfied.  It sums up much of the mood for this collection. This is lighthearted rock&roll which most of the time delivers.
