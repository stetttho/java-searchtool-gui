 This one is Rod Stewart at his best. The voice, the music,  and the lyrics. This is a compact and quality collection all over. From the first Track Rythm of my Heart  to the last Track 13. If only, is a rear joy to listen to this CD. Some tracks are not realy up there in rock and roll heaven, so it have some minor fault to put the "masterpiece mark" on it. Nevertheless. The great Tracks on this one realy shines, like the slow rock and roller called Broken Arrow (Track 3). The voice of Rod Stewart realy fit`s in on this one, and a realaxable "wall of sound" with the right instrumental "plink and plonk " sounds in the back ground. Track 4 It takes two The duet with Tina Turner kicks off  and gives you a rock and roll song to clap your`e hands and stamp your`e feet to the groovy rythm and vocal. A real "heartstarter" this one. Anyway my favoruite on this one is Track 7 The Motown Song. It`s a homage to the Motown greatness from back then. From the beginning to the end this one has the right feel and groove all trough. It`s a very enthusiastic song, which realy shines on every note. In other words. It has the right temperature for  feeling happy with a smile on your face, after the listen. The rest is a fine mix with ballad and more uptempo songs, with track 10 Have I told you lately, as a stand out in the "ballad department". Track 12 Downtown Train, written by Tom Waits has hit potensial, and Stewart does it in his own way, and there`s nothing wrong with that, so long it has his creative input stamped all over. To sum-up this is Vagabond joy from Rod Stewart . One of his best CD, ever.
