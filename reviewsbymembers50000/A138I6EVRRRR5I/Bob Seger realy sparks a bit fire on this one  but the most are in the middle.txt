 Some rockartists doesn`t know their roots. Bob Seger is one of the few among the socalled "modern" artist`s`who does.  The opener Take a Chance isn`t realy up there in 5 stars heaven. The theme is to much repeated, and have to little variation, but you don`t have to wait long. Track 2 The Real Love kicks your`e soul in gear, (it`s also produced by Gear Publishing Co but that`s a coincidence ?), Track 3 Sightseeing Is root`s rock and roll, but nothing more sorry to say. Track 4 Real at the time I't s much in the same style, and not a realy "earopener" when it come`s to creative listning experience. Track 5 Always In My Heart is a ballad, and it`s ok. Very simple, not to creative to listen too. It`s good too take a slow dance too, but would not lift you up with star`s in your`e eyes. Aaaah.But at last The title track  Track 6 The Fire Inside. Bob Seger at his best, saved by a good melody, and Roy Bittan, (from Springsteen Estreet band with a pianoplaying which realy hit`s the mark).  This is it, to make it short. Everything fit`s in a way.  A melody that will lift your`e soul. Track 7 New Coat of Paint is Bob Seger singing Tom Wait`s, and has some flair, style, and a walkalong melody. Track 8 Which Way, is a good blues song, which has much weight in the melody and a good whole. Track 9 The Mouintain has Eagles member Joe Walsh on Lead guitar, that save this one. Puerly standard rock and roll. Track 10 The Long Way Home is a great ballad. Simple, but strong on lyricks which tells us much about life:- Some lose their way. They all want so much to succeed. How do you tell them apart. The best of them lead with their heart. Bob Seger The Long Way Home. This is great poetry, and something to think about for each of us. Track 11 Blind Love is more in the "country style" and ok. Track 12  She can`t do anything wrong, is good ol rocker in the style of his earlier hit`s like: Old Time Rock and Roll. Some great tracks, some not, Bob Seger is anway a good traditional rock and roller who know`s his craftstrade. 3 1/2 star, nearly 4. A good buy anyway, if you can get hold of it.
