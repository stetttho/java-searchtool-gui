 Nearly up there with his Nightfly CD, but not realy there at 5 stars quality. Nuff said. From the slick and funky  Track 1 Trans-Island Skyway, to Track 8 Teahouse on the tracks this one delivers. So what`s the magic with Donald Fagen ? First of all it`s very well produced by Walter Becker, who realy knows what "buttons" to switch on to get what we can called "the slick,jucy, and tastefull" Fagen sound, which should have been a quality trademark, like Coca Cola. The real thing. It`s very funky in a way, like Track 2 Countermoon is a good example of. Track 3 Springtime is one of my favourite, which brings me an ecco of Steely Dan at theire best. Track 4 Snowbound is an "overcool" joy to listen to.  Track 5 Tommorow girls is a funky and more upbeat Fagen at his best. On the rest of the tracks, it`s overall very stylish to listen to, but Track 7 On the Dunes, is a let down, but Track 8 Teahouse on the Tracks delivers. All in all Donald Fagen delivers once again. In other words this music realy surround`s you with joy, and delivers happines inside you. Fagen quality, in other words.
