  What a collection. To start with  O Holy Night, the traditonal christmas song which every artist seems to put in theire christmas collection, shows what a register in here voice Celine has. Celine Dion is not a critique favourite among some critiques But the hardest "stone hearted" which is in no contact with his soul will soon forget this when listen to this stunning opener. If you are stressed this realy put you down to your innerself in a good way. You will get in to the real christmas spirit  when listen to this CD, and it`s a treat if you looking for the christmas album with what we can call  has the X-factor. Track 4 written by Bryan Adams Another Year has gone by, is a winner, and has the Celine magic over it. You have it all here from Ave Maria to Happy Xmas. This is music to close you eyes too, and also open you ears too. To put in a track with Andrea Bocelli (Track 9: The Prayer) makes you at least for a couple of minutes  belive in angels. Call me to simple, to emotional,and to little intellectual, i dont mind, the music lift`s me anyway. This album is certainly special times, at least from those who open their hearts. And sometimes i dont mind if more people does that, and it will bring more peace to earth. Celine Dion is certain santas little helper when it comes to this collection. To put in Happy Xmas  (war is over) written by John Lennon and Yoko Ono, says it all about christmas: Let's hope it`s a good one . And this CD certainly help in that department. And you wonder why Celine Dion sells many records ? Shame on you . It`s simple. The little you need will the heart tell you when you are confused. A treat for you inner voice this one.
