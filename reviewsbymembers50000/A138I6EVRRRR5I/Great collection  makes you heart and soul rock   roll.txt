 If you new to Huey Lewis and The News this one does it. The great thing with Huey Lewis is that  he has his own simple style, that it`s easy to remember. From the first track Power of Love (from the hit movie Back to the Future) to the last one Track 17 Back in Time ( also from Back to the Future) you talkin` "rock and roll, man". This is the real thing when it comes to how you should write songs which tells you how it was back in the 80 ths. Because this is the sound of the 80 ths, with synth symphonies that bring you in to a good mood. Sometimes it sounds like "sodastream music" who makes you think pink. Most of the Huey Lewis hit`s from the 80 ths are included here. The one that realy put your soul in  to gear is the Track 9 The heart of Rock % Roll,  and also Track 12 Stuck with You, shows much of the same "real thing quality".  So if Huey Lewis and the News are new to you this is a very good introduction. It`s realy a coooool listening if you close your`e eyes and want to bring memories from the 80 ths back again. You know it`s so Hip to be Square
