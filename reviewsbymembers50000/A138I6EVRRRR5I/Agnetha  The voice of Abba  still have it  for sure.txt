 It`s a candy king for you ears, if you like one of the voices from Abba: Agnetha Faltskog. It`s femenim soft rock, or shall i called it " smoothies" for your ears. This is easy listening. To easy sometimes, to give it 5 Stars. It opens with a song called The Colouring Book, a so so opener, but it realy kicks in gear with the Del Shannon oldie: Walk in the Room. Many artists have their version on this one. It`s a simple pop song, but Agnetha put her own signature on it, with respect to the original. There are not to much tempo upbeat songs on this CD, like the older Agnetha solo album songs like The Heat is on etc. But the good thing is that she do the cover songs as here own. The favourite is the new version of the Skeeter Davis hit: The End of the World. If she`s gonna do an another album put some more variation and up beat tempo on some of the covers, but hopefully it will come some new written songs for Agnetha. If some of the ex Abba members read this, please put the band together and Agnetha will really 5 star shines again
