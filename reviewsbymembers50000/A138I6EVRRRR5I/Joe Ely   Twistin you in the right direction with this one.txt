 Joe Ely is an artist with the quality stamp all over. He turns you right into it with the great opener Track 1 Twistin in the wind. Musicalwise he painted your`e soul with a great mix of cajun, texmex`, and other musical influences which is hard to put words on paper to describe. He shifts mood between the tracks, like Track 2 Roll Again, which is a great "saunter along" song, with the right "dose" of guitar plink and plunck as a back wall to lift this to a great tune. Track 3 It`s a little like love had a great beginning, but it``doesn`t kick`off in the right direction in a way. There goes the 5 stars, beacuse this has not the optimal quality track over it. Anyway we are soon back in business again with the title track Track 4 Twistin in the wind. The beginning is a little bore, but soon the song wakens up, and it grows, yeah it realy grows.  You can saunter along listen to the the rest of the tracks and Joe Ely gives you great music, and put`s in accordian, and other "harmonica", steel guitars, plink and plunck instruments on the rest of the tracks. Track 8 Your`e workin for the man, has style,guts, and a very interested  chourus as a background carpet, wich realy fills out a mood for you dark corners in your soul, with a  "rattlesnake" sound in the background. Anyway my favourite Tex mex happy song is Track 9 Nacho Mama, a great tune to   any "tortilla and taco" dinner party anywere. Theres` even room for a blues and jazz inspired  "musical tale" like (Track 11Gulf coast  blues) . A great end to a great Joe Ely CD, which twist your`e mood and soul in the right direction.
