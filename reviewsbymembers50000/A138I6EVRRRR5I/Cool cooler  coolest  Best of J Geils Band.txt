 This is party,party, party music which will blow most of the competion in this genre right out in the open space. So where is the magic ?. Ok. Track 1 Southside Shuffel gives somekind of an answer, with it`s shuffel rythm that shaken and stir up the temperature, so to say. The vocal screams like "the son of " Screaming Jay Hawkins. Raw and powerfull this one. Track 2 Give it to me, is a more "laidback" song, but has not the same quality as the first track. It`s humpin` and dumpin` to much in a way. Track 3 Where did our love go, is anyway a stunner, when it come`s to rawness and streetcredibility, as the real thing, with an effective harmonica to fill out all trough the song. Track 4 (Aint nothin but a )House party, is a let down, which doesn`t take of in the right direction. Track 5 Detroit Breakdown, is certainly ok but it hasn`t got the spark which i feel missing from it. Track 6 Whammer Jammer, is in the Screamin Jay Hawkins territory, and has feel, grooooove, and the bluesy feeling that some of us long fore. It`s a instrumental short gem in a way. Track 7 I do, is my favourite. It`s very melodious in a way, and the "clapping hands rythm, help`s to. And when the harmonica set`s in gear, you just scream "woaaa". Track 8 Musta got lost, is a minor let down. Too much, too soon, and is the weakest track`s on this cd. Track 9 Looking for a love is to messy to make it a hit, but sparks here and there, but the melody structure is confusing sometimes. Anyway. This Cd has most of all very cool song`s,sometimes a bit cooler, and then Track 8 I do, a song wich certainly is the coolest on this CD.  A good buy if you want a good introduction to a band that deliver`s in every departments.
