  Don Henley is a shining star. On this one it`s the ballads who does it. The reason for no 5 stars on this album, is that some of the other tracks with more tempo beats, doesnt give me the ultimate Henley experience. Sure the voice is there, but when he show further development from The End of the Innocence track, from 1989 Cd, im totally blown away.  Track 2 Taking Your Home is nearly up there, with The End of The Innocence. Its the ultimate soundpicture, so carefully developed . On Track 3 there are one other ballad to come with the Title For my Wedding . The tempo up beat Workin It is also a winner. Track 12 Annabel is my favourite, and has much of the soundpicture you can find on Desperado.  Its Don Henley voice who does it. Theres something in it which is difficult to describe with pure words. Just listen to it and it will tickling youre instincts. This one makes me shiver. All in all and album nearly up at The End of the Innonce standard.
