 J.J.Cale always delivers. This CD is not an exeption. It so overcool and relaxable that is some times grips you and hurt your soul. The first track is Cocaine. Forget the Eric Clapton version. This one is the real thing. It`s simple and has style, and the coolness shimering all over. Track 2 is the more up beat Don`t wait, with a very rythmic beat from the percussion instrument`s and a great harmonica which complete the soundpicture. Track 3 Magnolia is one of the weak tracks on this CD. It`s ok, in a way, but very,veeeeery slow, and will get you sleepy to listen to. But soon enough you wake up to the more fast "bluesrocker" Track 4 Devil in disguise. A real treat this one. Track 5 Sensitive Kind, are moody, oh yes very sensitive. It has that feeling, all over it. Track 6 Carry On, is an uptempo song, but doesn`t delivers in all the department`s sorry to say. Track 7 After Midnight, is classical J.J.Cale, and the coolnees shimmering warm and bright all over. Track 8 Money Talks is not there up in the big league. It`s overlong, and has a very repeative theme that goes over and over again. A little depressive sometimes. Track 9 Call me the Breeze is a good rocker and roller, and will quick up your`e mood. Track 10 Lies is also in that department. Simple and hit the mark were it should. Track 11 City Girls is a happy,happy, song from J.J.Cale, that make`s you happy with a smile on your`e face. Track 12 Cajun Moon, is down there in the country of the "overcoolness". Track 13 Don``t cry sister is a little boring track, and forgetable. Track 14 Crazy Mama is in the same department, sorry to say.  But overall this is above average from a smart an overcool artist who knows his roots. The man they call J.J.Cale.
