 The sound. The voice. In other word this is magical and overcool, and very relaxable music. Ry Cooder made this in the year 1979, and it still stand`s out as a CD which gives you the most. The "chicken skin" atmosphere kicks in already on track 1 Little Sister. It`s moody, with an atmospheric chorus, with great plinking on the guitar`s. Track 2 Go home girl, it`s an atmospheric moody slowsong, with good airy space between the different instruments, to make this a little gem, so to say. Track 3 The very thing that makes you rich, have much of the same mood, as the previous track has, but it`s a little bit more up tempo beat. Track 4 I think it`s going to work out fine, it`s an instrumental  "diamond" with a soundpicture that delivers. Cool, yeah. Cool must be the word. Track 5 Down in Hollywood, is a minor let down. To fuzzy sometimes, but qualitywise when it spark`s it sounds similar to Donald Fagen and Steely Dan, and that`s a qualitymark for sure. Track 6 Look at granny run,run, has a funny tittle, but it`s more a sometimes "confusion country tempo upbeat song". Ok. But nothing more. Track 7 Trouble ,You can`t fool me. Well this is more in the gospel area. Sound`s okei, but nothing revolutionary. Track 8 Dont mess up a good nothing, is blue`s from Ry Cooder, with a female vocal from Chaka Kahn, which put some flaire and magic to the song. Track 9 I cant win, is a slow song. To slow in my case. Just minor details to pick on, on this CD. This is anyway "chicken skin music" with "chicken skin" feel allover. In other word`s Ry Cooder delivers on one of is best classical cd`s, made back in 1979, in the "vinylmania heydays".
