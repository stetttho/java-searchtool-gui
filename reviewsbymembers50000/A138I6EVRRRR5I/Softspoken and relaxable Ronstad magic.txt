 Yeees. Track 5 The Blue Train has the magic of Ronstad softspoken and halfway wispering voice which realy tickle youre soul.  Emmylou Harris on the background vocals, fills out the magic with here voice too. There is a certain dreamy feel over this song. Pure Ronstad magic. The other tracks are filled with more ups and downs. Track 2 Walk on  the more fast moving song with Allison Krauss on the fiddle is anyway a good listen to . But it is the moody feel of Ronstad voice that runs trough the whole CD that gives the magic a certain touch, that lifts up more anonymous songwriting. On the weaker side we have the cover of the Neil Young masterpeace After the Gold rush which break the moody feeling. It doesn`t fit here voice in a way. The Randy Newmann song Feels like Home Track 6 has much of the same problems. But hey, soon we are back into gear with  Track 7 Teardrops will fall, which has the rhythm and feel of a good hit song.  But how can you go wrong when you get help from Allison Krauss and Emmylou Harris ? If the whole CD was up to Track 5 The Blue Train standard it would have been a solid 5 star. But anyway Linda Ronstad as an artist put some "musical angeldust" in your ears.
