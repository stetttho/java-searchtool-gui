 Gloria Estefan has at least one hit on this Cd called Coming Out of the Dark, but when she goes into the "syntheseisers land" on some of the tracks it`s a let down from the " Estefan quality" we love, (at least some of us do, hopefully). This is to much "discoland" sometimes, on track 3 What goes around she sounds like Donna Summer. Nothing wrong with that,for sure, but it doesnt fit here style at all. There is much to much syntheisers over the soundpicture. But at least Track 9 Language of Love brings some joy into your mind. Its "hip" enough, and a good listning experience "all trough". Track 12 Live for Loving You, shines also with "Estefan quality". When Track 15 Don`t wanna loose you in portugeguese, is one of the best tracks from the minor masterpiece CD cuts both ways, something is wrong. But anyway Gloria Estefan shines trough sometimes, but this one has it`s ups and downs, that`s for sure.
