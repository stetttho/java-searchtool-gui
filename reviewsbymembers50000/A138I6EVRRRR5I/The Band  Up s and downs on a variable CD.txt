 The Band is a great band, and still has a small amount of magic back. Some tracks shines more than others, but there are to many tracks who dissapoints. Track 1 Stand Up, in it`s "walkalong" tempo glimmers right trough. It shows creativity and has flair. Track 2  Back to Memphis is a letdown, sorry to say. It`s too slow, and a weird vocaljob that sounds like Bob Dylan on a bad day, doesn`t help either. Track 3 Where I should always be, has more power as a nice ballad, with a very "airy and open" soundpicture all trough. Track 4 Free your mind, is a more uptempo song, with a "bigband beat" that has a certain "sting". It delivers, but nothing special . But hey, on Track 5 Forever Young we are back in "god ole Band mood". This has the trademarks of a The Band. It`s written by Bob Dylan, and it`s a tribute to Jerry Garcia. Garth Hudson`s organ play sneak`s in to your`e soul, as on every "great" Band song`s.  Track 6 The High Prize of Love, is a little let down, once again. It`s very "muddy" and to distorted to have a great listen too. Track 7 Crazy Mama, is a different cup of tea. As a blues rocker this one delivers, with a good strong backbeat that pushes the song forward in the right direction to the end. Track 8 I must love you to much, is a fast rocker, that has a enough tempo and beat to make you put on your`e rock and roll shoes. Track 9 She knows, is a traditonal ballad, which delivers in a slow jazzy mood, but it`s not up there. It`s  anyway nice to  listen to as a "late night gem" but nothing special. Track 10 Rumble Jungel, is a "musical rumble to the jungle" and sounds like it, with a weird vocal to carry it trough. Track 11 Young Blood, is a Leiber/ Stoller Classic. The Band does it in a "slow up tempo beat" . Quite okei. Anyway. This is The band, with`too many up`s and downs on a variable CD.
