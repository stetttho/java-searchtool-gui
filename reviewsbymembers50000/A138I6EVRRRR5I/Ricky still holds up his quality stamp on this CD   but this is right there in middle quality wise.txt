 There are some slow starters to get you in the right "Skaggs" mood here, but on this one is the ballads who does it  like the title track Track 5 Waitin for the sun to shine. On the uptempo songs he`s not up to his usual standard. There`s something missing there when you compare to CD `s like Kentucky thunder and other`s of his earlier CD`s. It`s very traditional sometimes, and you think that you have heard  some of the stuff on other CD`s. In other word`s he repeat himself to much musicalwise. But anyway. A Ricky Skagg`s CD always deliver quality Bluegrass and Country music, but it`s not up there with his earlier stuff, sorry to say. More as Track 2 Don`t get above your raising, anyway lifts the quality.
