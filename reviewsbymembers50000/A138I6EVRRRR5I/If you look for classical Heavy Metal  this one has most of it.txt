 Deep Purple from the classical period, has much of the most, and get`s better and better everytime you listen to it. Here you have all the hit`s from the early 5 album`s from  70-74 purplemania period. It rules, it rocks, in other words it does it. This has the most, and bring`s back the classical "purpel ghost".  Track 1 Woman from Tokyo, burst`s into you ear with the drum beat to speed up the tempo into  a enjoyable "purple tour". Jon Lord`s keyboard/organ  with early effective synth play ,makes it on this one, and ties it together in a effective way. Track 2 Fireball is an uptempo fastback hardtop  sprint heavy metal gem. It moves so fast so you nearly missed you breath. Track  3 Strange kind of Woman, is the blues heavymetal hybrid, which swing`s and spark `s in all it`s glory. Track 4 Never before is probably the weak spot on this CD, but that`s a very minor fault. This is not very "heavy metal" , but it swing`s ok all trough. Track 5 Black Night, is a live track that brings a very effective gut`s to the song. This is the one you must try to put your`e amplifier up to eleven. Greatness shines ! Track 6 Speed King, begins with a church organ playing, very slow build up, but then suddenly explode into classical heavy metal which realy kicks ass, man. Track  7 Smoke on the Water. The ultimate Deep Purple classic, here in it`s live version with some improvisations, does the 5 star all by it self. It rock`s, it moves, and it`s classical guarntee powerd heavy metal that should flash fire your`e soul in a joyful direction. Track 8 Child in Time, is a worthy closer on this "golden record". It has the element`s of a ballad that make`s you relax too. If you look for classical Heavy Metal, this is the real thing.
