  Track 3 Rush, Rush, as Paula sings it: Ooooooo, na,na.  It`s a soda stream of  5 star music. The other tracks are a mixed bag. Here voice some times  has a "minnie mouse" squeaky quality over it which irritates me. It`s not up there in the big league, but she has charisma and star quality. more or less. She`s a good dancer, and funky enough to put a signature on many of hear songs. The problem is that many of the songs make me more or less emotionless. Track 11.  Alright Tonight  is another cup of tea anyway.With the carabiean touch over it, nevertheless this song "kicks ass" man. It`s fast and fourious, and Paula songs fits into the rythmic soundpicture. More of this, and i would have given here one extra star. But as whole maybe 3 1/2. Star.
