 Sure this is Donna Summer`s greatest hits. Some tracks blow you away, some dont. The new track on this album Melody of Love is not to much to shout hurray  to. But when it comes to the classics that`s another cup of tea. And i dont mean the oldest one, but at the end of the 70 ths she troughly shine. It start`s with Track 9. Hot stuff and Track 10 Bad Girls. That`s what i called Disco with a sting in it. It brings sweet memories back to when the disco was cool and has a certain creativity over it. You can skip trough much of the other stuff. Track 10 Bad Girls is the ultimate Summer Hit, no over, no besides. That`s a fact Track 15 She works hard for the Money has enough tempo upbeat to make your dance. Also when she uses the same producers as early Sam Fox used back in the 80 ths(stock/aitken/waterman) Summer shines, especially on Track 17 and Track 18 This time i know its for real and I dont wanna get hurt. Still Summer is good to listen to when the weather is bad. She still sparks sometimes
