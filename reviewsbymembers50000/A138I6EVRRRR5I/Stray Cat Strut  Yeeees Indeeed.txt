 From the first track Stray Cat Strut, this album really strut. It`s simple rockabilly stripped to the bone. Here are all the early best from the Stray Cats. Go further to Rock this town, make you think that rockabilly really lives. The 80 ths was the best  Stray Cats period of the "simple bear boned" rock and roll. It`s the soundpicture with bass,guitar, and a simple drum set up who realy does it. This music is not clean and squeaky, but have the roots from early music from the Sun Records. This is also inspired from Gene Vincent and Eddie Cockran, and Brian Setzer vocal  realy fits the music. But i also like the titles of some of the songs: Built for speed, Rebels Rules, and Rock this town.  The alcapella song I won`t stand in your way, is a real treat for Brian Setzer fans, old and new. But my all time Stray Cat Strutter is also on this album: It`s called: Jeanie,Jeanie,Jeanie, and it realy kicks ass man. Rockabilly rules, man.
