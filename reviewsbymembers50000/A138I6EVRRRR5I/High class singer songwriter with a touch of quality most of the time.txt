 River of Souls is nothing revolutionary, when it comes to creativity and plowing of new "musical ground". Anyway when it comes to a certain rousing music, certainly Dan Fogelberg hit the spot on most of the time. The first track Magic Every Moment is an good example. It kick`s of at the first note, and never let you go all trough the song. There`s a certain form of carribean touch, with the rythmic section, that  make it a happy listen. Track 2 All there is is dedicated to Donald Trump, and has a nice melody, and say something to his all that money can`t buy happiness. A fine "slow song". A little let down with the ballad (Track 3)The Minstrel, with weird lyrics, which sounds like a bit "shakespearean " when it come`s to the "mood" all trough. Skip trough tracks like Track 4 Faces of America, and listen to the more "light rock & roller  Track 5 Holy Road which has a certain flaire, but nothing more, sorry to say. Track 6 has a certain " U 2" mood over it, but is right there in the middle,but we are soon back in buisness again with Track 7 Higher Ground which has a certain "touch " of Steve Windwood over it, and a creative soundpicture. Track 8 I love like this, is an okey ballad but nothing more. Track 9 River of Souls with it`s latino sound has a "copacabana" mood all trough with a certain flaire . Anyway Dan Fogelberg is a singer/songwriter with a touch of quality most of the time.
