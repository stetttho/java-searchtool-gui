  Tanita Tikaram was very big in Norway, at the end of the 80 ths.  And as i listen to this album,my conclusion is that here voice i simple,clean, and with a cool and coldness who creeps into your soul. Here on this album you have all here hit`s. My favorite tracks is from here first album Ancient Heart, with Twist my sobriety, Cathedral song, World outside the window, and Good Tradition. This is five stars song, all along. The rest who follows is certainly a mixed bag of songs. But here voice. And if Elvis Presely was reborn as woman, she probably would look like Tanita Tikaram. In Norway she was forgotten after here two first album, so if you can not get hold of this album, buy ancient heart.
