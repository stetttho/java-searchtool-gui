  So cute, so good lookin, so raw and unpolished. You can hear here humming voice on Split Personality and you know that this artist has something to tell. The voice has a pain in side, as she realy means what she sings. Some other artists dont, belive me. This album from 2000 is here debut album. The reason why i dont give it a 5 star, is that some tracks is a bit "unstable" and doesn't have the quality which surley comes on here next album Missundaztood. Track 4  There you go, is one of my favourites. It`s so rytmic that my feets starts to tap hysterically'. But the voice. Everytime she speaks, she has that Janis Joplin inspired voice, which gives that makes me shiver in  a good way.  Its a pity i can`t take here home. She has star quality all over. Track 12 Hiccup is another winner. A must in youre Pink Collection. The dreamgirl next door, with a voice from another planet, which is difficult to describe in words. Track 10 Stop Falling is a sweetie two.
