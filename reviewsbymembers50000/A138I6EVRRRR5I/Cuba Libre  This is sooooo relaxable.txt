 Gloria Estefan put you in the right romantic mood with this great collection of songs. Here voice sounds even better when she goes back to here roots and sing spanish. It doesnt matter if you know the words, the music speaks for itself. It lifts you, it moves you, and this is quality all over. The soundpicture is clear, with great acoustic certainly on the guitar, and Gloria`s voice is even better here, then when she sings american language songs. The good thing with this cd, is that it`s so much room inbetween the instruments that lift`s forward Estefan`s voice to a higher level of "earjoy" Track 7 Si Senor and Track 9 Montuno shows that Gloria Estefan really knows here roots when it comes to the rythmic upbeat songs too. I dont know much of the words, but the music speak for it self.  Like Track 12 Tradicion, im agree, and i think that the word is universal. This Cd keeps the "tradicion" when it comes too roots and the "real thing"
