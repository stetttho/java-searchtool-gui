 Nearly a 5 stars this one, but some tracks don`t have the real x-factor in that department. But, hey. It will give you much musical earbalsam anyway. Nancy Griffith`s voice doesn`t have the greatest register, and sounds sometimes flat and not very interesting. But when you skip trough this CD, and stop by Track 3. I dont wanna talk about love, it realy moves you, because of it`s smoothness, and the laidback feeling it gets when you listen to it. Quiet is probably the new loud on this one.(I don`t wanna talk about love. Cuz Ive hear it before. And it talk`s too loud, as she sings in the beginning of the song). Other favourites on this rare CD (as i can see you can only buy it second hand here at Amazon) is Listen to the Radio Track 6 and The Ballad So Long Ago shines in that department too. Track 13 Late Night Grande Hotel is anyway the best ballad on the whole CD, which makes you shiver when you listen to it. Its in there between the Eagles hit: Desperado and other ballads in that area. There are many ballads on this CD, so if you like Nancy Griffith doing that, this one is for you. As an introduction to Nancy Griffith, this one gives you a starter for more, thats for sure.
