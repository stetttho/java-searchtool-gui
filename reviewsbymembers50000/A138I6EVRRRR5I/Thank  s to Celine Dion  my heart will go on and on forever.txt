  The voice. The personality. The songs. It just clicked toghether in total harmony. This is earbalsam for your soul. She sells tons of records. Many critics in the more or less academic league gives here one star or less, in some magazines and newspapers. But the fans (including me) loves here music anyway. She has total controll over here voice register. Not much songs here that not have love in the title and lyrics. Ok, Let`s talk about love. This album has so many stricking songs. The Love theme from Titanic really strikes a nerve in me, and i can listen to it again and again, and my heart pumping in the same rythm as the song. Celine Dion realy strikes a nerve in those of us who are not totally  among the hipsters league and always looks for new trends. Better keep it simple. As Beatles says in one of theire songs: All you need is love. It`s some times a cold,cold,world out there. Celine reminds us about other values in the world.  As she says it: There`s one trough emotion, that reminds me we are the same.....  Celine Dion Let`s talk about love. Yeeees Indeed. Celine.
