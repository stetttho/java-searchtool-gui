 The movie is a cinderella story in oure modern society. It`s the ultimate lovestory, which brings hope to everyone. All you need is love in other words. The soundtrack is  variable experience with ups and downs. The misses are forgettable( but it certainly fits in the movie soundtrack). But the songs that realy hit the mark is first Track 3 KIng of wishful thinking av Go West, with much breath and air  from the vocal and inbetween the instruments.  It has enough heartpain in the lyrics, to melt the hardest one. The ultimate Roxette hit makes it too. Track 5 It must a been Love was a big hit and it really helped selling the movie at the boxoffice for a cross over audience.  Track 9 Fallen is a softspoken song with a voice which has a good atmosphere all trough the song. But high over everybody the Late great Roy Orbison. The voice, the song, the simple lyrics. It`s just put every one's dream sometimes: "been mine tonight, Pretty Woman". Say it simple, and you hit the mark. The other tracks. Well Red Hot Chilly Pepper on a romance soundtrack. Say no more .
