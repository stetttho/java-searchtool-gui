 This is very lighthearted music. There is always a relief to listen to a group like Sawyer Brown how brings joy on every tracks on this one with very few letdowns. Sometimes the songs sounds much the same, but that doesn`t take a way the fun aspect to listen to it all trough. Track 1 Lady of the Evening is anway good listen musicwise. The weak point is the vocal, sorry to say.  I just wonder what Eagles member Glen Frey could get out of this one. Track 2 The fast up tempo beat song Better be some Tears fit`s anyway the vocal better. The ballads are the weak points on this on. To pompous in a way. The Title Track 4 Out goin` cattin, is anyway a great flashback to the 80 ths. Track 5 The house won`t rock kicks some ass to . To sum it up with few words: This is happy,happy,fun,fun,music from the lighthearted parts of the 80 ths. This is  rockabilly,country,disco, hybrid music. Few thing wrong about that, as Sawyer Brown doin it. The Shakin Stevens inspired Track 9 Savin the honey  for the honeymoon, is anyway a great listen and my favourite track on this one.  A dont worry, be happy CD, is the conclusion on this one.
