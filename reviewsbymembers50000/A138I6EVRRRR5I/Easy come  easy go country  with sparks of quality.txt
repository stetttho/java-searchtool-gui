 Well this is very polished country music. There at least two great traditional pop/country hybrid songs here. The rest is  a very mixed bag. Track 1 Let your love flow is the flagship on this Cd with it`s very harmonious vocal and perfection in every instrumental departments. Track 2 If i said you have a beautiful body has much of the same quality. When the Bellamy Brothers sings in choir, they just melt into one. That`s great, but sometimes it can be to much polished, but on this one it certainly work for the better. Track 3 You aint just whistlin dixie, is an ok ballad, but nothing more. Booring most of times. Track 4 Sugar Daddy. A room for change . With it`s walk along tempo it kicks ok from start to the end. Track 5 Dancin` Cowboy is very danceable, but this is to much musical candy sweetness.  Track 6 Lovers live longer is much in same territory. Nothing much to add, realy. Track 7 Do you love as good as you look. This is more up tempo, and it works for better. At least some fuzz on the guitars for a change. Track 8 For all the wrong reasons has much of the same qualities as the previous one. At least it`s easy to catch the melody line. It`s anyway too much up`s and down`s alltrough. Track 9 Get into reggae cowboy. Reggae ?. Well the rythm is certainly here and there, but that`s it.  The weird one from the Bellamys this one. Track 10 Redneck Girl, is the country rocker & roller hybrid on thIs CD. Ok. Anyway this CD is to much easy come and easy go country to make it a winner. But somewhere here and there it sparks quality.
