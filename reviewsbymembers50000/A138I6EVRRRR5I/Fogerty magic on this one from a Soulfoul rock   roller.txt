 This is basic,stripped to the bone rock & roll, as only John Fogerty can do it. Here we are back in "Creedence  territorium".  Few misteps in cliche country doesnt give this a five star, anyway it`s a quality product all trough. John Fogerty has a rough voice, soulfoul and very intense sometimes. It fit`s very well into the music that also has that simplicty to it, but here simplicty  a quality mark  stamped all over the CD. The CD is called Blue Moon Swamp, and if you close your eyes, it`s easy to get that cajun feel, mysterious and very likeable, with guitar`s as the main instrument on most of tracks. He has total control over this production, written, arranged, and produced by John Fogerty. After the mistep with the CD Eye of The Zoombie it`s good to have John Fogerty back in the big league when it comes to quality. Where lies the magic with John Fogerty ? It`s difficult to say, but when you listen to the most "boring" track like the CD Track 5. Rattlesnake Higway, it still has the "magic touch" inbetween, the fuzz and rumble that this song has sometimes, which destroying the total listning experience. But, hey we are soon back in buisness again with the Track 6 Bring it down to Jelly Roll, which "swing along" as a great tune. John Fogerty knows his roots, as he writes on track 9 Rambunctinous boy:  "well i ain`t good looking and i ain`t so smart  but baby im a sensitive guy. I ain`t done everything there is to do,but ill damn sure give it a try"  Much good lifewisdoom there or  what ?
