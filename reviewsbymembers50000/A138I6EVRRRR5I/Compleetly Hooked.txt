 In the early days Dr Hook was funny. I mean realy funny. When Shel Silverstein wrote the lyrics it was hysterical to listen to. Cover of the Rolling Stone, anyone. There is a couple ones here too, especially one called Everybody`s makin it big but me. Before everyone who wants to bee a popstar try to sing and play listen to this line:They get groupies for their band, all i have is my right hand. The rest of the songs on this double disc is from theire "poppy" days, with their version of the old Sam Coocke song  Only Sixteen and other "easy listners" like: When youre in a love whith a beatiful woman, little bit more etc. This is a very good introduction to Dr Hook, but try to get hold of some of the early stuff too.There you have a clear picture of the variation of theire musical talent. And Shel Silverstein is a real poet, when it comes to lyrics for Dr Hook.
