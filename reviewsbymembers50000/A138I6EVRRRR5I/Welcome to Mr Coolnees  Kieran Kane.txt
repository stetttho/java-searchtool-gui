 This CD is great. If you like J.J.Cale`s music, you will love this one. There is a certain "coolnees" over most of these tracks. It kick you into gear already in the first track Im here to Love you, which sounds like early J.J.Cale, when it comes to the cool fingerpicking guitar which he`s famous for. The difference is that Kieran Kane has a better and much more clearer singing voice. This is superb good quality all trough the CD, with some minor "hickups", but they are forgetable, when it comes to the "overall" quality. He also get quality help from Emmylou Harris on Track 2 Greener Pastures and Track 8 Find my way Home, and how can you get wrong with the song writing structure then ?  This is simple straightforward "laidback" country, in the great singer/songwriter tradition. Track 2 I`ll Be Turning To You is simple in form, and a great listen, and should have been a hit back then in the middle of the 90 ths. The minor letdown is a a boring Track 4 If You Only Hurt The Ones You Love which is not up the usual standard the rest of the tracks has. But soon we are back in business again with Track 5 Return to Me. The rest of the tracks are great listning anyway.  Once again.Kieran Kane has the quality stamp all over him in the singer/songerwriter tradition. That`s a fact in my eyes.
