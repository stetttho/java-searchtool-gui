 Beach Boys. Well they were exellent back there in the 60 ths. Track 8 I get around,Track 9 Wouldn`t it be nice, and Track 10 California Girls are Beach Boys at theire "classical" best. The rest. Most of these other tracks, are not my cup of tea. The most positive among those is the oriental inspired Track 2 Somewhere near Japan. It has flair,style, and a very exotic "easten/japanish" flavour over the soundpicture, which make`s it  a good listen all through. The rest are a very mixed experience. Most of the other song`s are soundtracks from different movies, and probably fits better in there in movies like Track 1 Still Crusin ( Leathal Weapon 2"), a minor flashback to classical Beach Boys, but miss the mark, to make it great. Track 3 Island Girl, a reagge song, with good rythm, but in style  just average. Track 4. In my car, is a weak one, easy forgettable. Track 5 Kokomo, is better, and did  good  work in the Tom Cruise movie Coctail.  Track 6 Wipe out is a small catastrophe to listen to. Track 7 Make it Big ( from Troop Beverly Hills) is up there with the best track`s on the CD. It has a good melody, which are easy and relaxable to listen to. The rest as i have pointed out save the total impression. They are great, they are classical, and it`s Beach Boys at their height and best.
