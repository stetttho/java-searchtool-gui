 I`ve seen Joe Walsh live on Eagles Hell Freezez over tour back in 1996 in Norway. And man Joe Walsh has an extra quality touch on every thing he put`s his mark on too. This CD is not any exception. Track 1 Two sides to every story starts with a harmonica and a big heeey shout from Walsh and there you go. The rythm is cool, and the laidback quality "growl" singing from Walsh is great.  Track 2 Ordinary average guy, is one of the realy  funny one, on this CD. It`s a great homage to us average guys out there. It has a reagge rythm and also a certain "coolnees" which makes this something else to listen to. Track 3 The Gamma Goochee, is a minor let down. It`s like a children rhyme song. It`s fun in a way, and has a funky back beat, but sometimes it can be overkilled in a way. Track 4 All of a sudden is anyway a great ballad, where the creative use of fuzzy guitar sound, and an open airy sound picture lift`s this one up to a just great song. Track 5 Alphabetical order is a messy not to interesting song to lend you ear to. Forgetable. Track 6 Look at us now, with it`s jungle rythm drums, is studio extragavanza music, which realy has the force to bring out quality in every musical/vocal department. Track 7. I`m actin different, is an ordinary song which glimmers quality  here and there. Average. Track 8 Up all night is anyway a winner, where Joe Walsh change his voice in a sentimental great way. A certain touch of synth quality plays lifts this one above average. Track 9 You might need somebody is even better with it`s airy soundpicture. This is a very quality pop song, which shines from beginng to the end. Track 10 Where i grew up, is a sentimental prelude to track 11 School days. These are two songs bound together where the last one changes gear into a more light heavy metal mood song. All in all Joe Walsh "the funny" eagles "does it " most of the time on this one.
