 This is a weird thought in a way, but when i review his greatest hits collection, i put a 2 stars on it. My opinion is that this one is better than "his greatest hits". It`s the country ballad One Emotion, Track 1 which kicks my soul into gear. This solid work from a country song perspective. Track 2 Summer`s commin, kicks off a little ( and is included on the  greatest hit`s collection). Track 3  Untanglin` my mind is anyway a let down, from the good startin` standard with the to first tracks. Track 4 Wherever you go is also right there in the middle. Not to smart to lift it up on a higher "star" level to say. Track 5 A change in the air, could be a musical "change in the air" but it is not, sorry to say. It`s a stream of country cliches put together, not in a narrative interesting structure that we long for. Track 6 Life get`s away, is the best one on this Cd, with it`s hybrid "poor mans" The Cure sound picture as a background carpet trough the song. Track 7 I can get by is an uptempo "walkalong" country song,which have some flair and credibility. Track 8 Hey hot rod, has a certain "rock and roll" feel over it, but the song has too much, too soon, musical elements inputs here and there. Track 9 You walked by has a certain "joodle yiaah" flair all over. It`s fun, it`s short, and it`s ok. Track 10 You made me feel is an emotionless ballad, and that`s not what Clint Black try to tell us all trough the song. It`s called, "not hit the mark" in other words. Track 11 A good run of bad luck, is ok, but nothing more. Track 12 A bad goodbye is a good ballad for a change, with Wynonna also on the vocal, wich lifts Black as a country artist right up there with the classic country artists much thanks to Wynonna`s tribute. When she`s click in she bring`s more emotion to the CD, that Clint Black does with his "one emotion". If you are satisfied with One Emotion, this CD is probably ok, but if you want more try some other artists.
