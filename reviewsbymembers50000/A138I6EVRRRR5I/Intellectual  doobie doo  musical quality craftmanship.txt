 Ex Doobie Brother McDonald goes solo, and certainly he has the craftmansship to do this. And he also get "help" from musicans as Joe Walsh(Eagles) and Jeff Pocaro(Toto) to make this cd a joyfull trip altrough. Track 1 No lookin back is the title track which has an uptempo beat with some sparkling keyboard play from Mcdonald him self. A quick musical mind and heart starter this one. Track 2 Bad Times, is more in "jazzy/fusion land" and has a certain "studio soundpicture" all over. It`s bigtown "urban" music, with the quality starsparklin` touch marked right on target. Track 3 (I`ll be your)angel is a funky up beat disco hybrid, which should have be a winner back in the 80 th`s and certainly is it in our`e days`. Track 4 By heart. Well, this is a minor let down, with too little variations. It goes on and on, but after one minute it changes gear into a more interestin` sound picture. Track 5 Any foolish thing begins with great saxophone playing along, but there are two many up`s and downs between before it ends. Track 6 Our love, is a ballad which tries to get you into a moody feel. It`s certainly cool and laidback in it form. It has a certain carribean feel over  it with the percussion and the drums in the background. Track  7(I hang) on your every word, is anyway a winner. It`s the most uptempo upbeat song, and it realy gives you a kick off.  Here all the different synthesizers, sequenced synth and the emulator programs are well used to make this a winner Track 8 Lost in the parade is a minor let down, which has lost much of it`s sparklin`here and there. Track 9 Lost in the Parade is anyway an uptempo ok song, but nothing very special. Anyway this is intellectual "doobie doo" musical quality craftmasnship. Michael McDonald certainly has "it".
