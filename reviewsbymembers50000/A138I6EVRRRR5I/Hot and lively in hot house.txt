 Bruce Hornsby. Mmmmmusic with a big M. It`s jazzy ,funky, and full of life. Sometimes is messy, with different instrument`s "fighting" for it`s place in the whole "musical picture", but fore the most is soulfull music. Let`s move on. Track 1  Spider Fingers is messy, and has not a clear  "structure". It`s overkilled from the beginning to the end. Track 2 White weeled limousine is much better. Here it kick`s off immeidiately, and the melody has that "moody" feel and you can feel a certain "freeze" down your back. Track 3 Walk in the sun, is an ok "sunny" song with happiness and joy spread all over from the beginning to the end. Track 4 The Changes is more in the "cool" style of jazzy feel, with quality "sting" all over. Track 5 The Tango King, is not much of a tango. Overkilled this one too. Too much, too soon. Track 6 Big Rumble is more "rock and roll" and has a certain guts all trough, but in some places it stand`s still from further  creative development. Track 7 Country Doctor, has much of the same problem`s. Bruce Hornsby are best when he makes the song simple and more down to earth. Track 8 The longest night show`s quality in every department. It  has a very good refrain which goes frictionfree into your`e ears and down to your`e soul. Track 9 Hot house ball, well, it`s hot enough, but doesn`t swing you into the right mood. Too much and messy sometimes. Track 10 Swing street swing`s ok, and has a good "tune line" all trough. Track 11 Cruise Controll is an uptempo great song, especially in the beginning, but the refrain is a weak point and a let down. Anyway Bruce Hornsby is hot and lively on this CD.
