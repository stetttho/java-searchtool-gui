 Mmmmmmmmmadonna. You never forget the early eightees (1982,1983) just before the Like a Virgin CD when she`s exploded into popheaven with here first album, just before the CD revolution with the Album Madonna:The first album. Simple earcandy popmusic to make youre day happy in "pleasentville ". It kicks off with the funky and realy right to the point  Track 1 song Lucky star, and this has the most for you and the ghost, because she`s already there shows the great potensial how a good ear for how a hit song should sounds like. Track 2 Borderline, is more in the borderline country, with not so much to shout hurray for (there goes the 5 star, sorry to say). This is of course quality all over, but not up to Track 1 standard. Track 3 Burning Up, is more like a "flashdance" song, with it`s more rock and roll disco hybrid sound. It`s how disco should sound`s like and a potensial winner on the dancefloor. Very melodious to sum it up in a simple way. Track 4 I know it it`s more traditional, and is a minor let down. It`s very tiny, with an irritating saxophone in the background. Track 5. Well. Heeeeeeey. It`s time for a Holiday, and this one realy sparks and shines. A simple refrain, and gives hope for all happy shiny people out there. Holiday. A song to realy celebrate. In other words: A classic. The ultimate popsong. Track 6 Think of Me, is more in discoland once again, and it`s funky enough, but not a classic. It`s anyway cool enough. Track 7 Physical attraction. Well it`s once again in funky discoland, but doesn`t take off into pleasureland, but a good earfiller anyway. Track 8 Everybody, is a synthpop classic, with "teen pleasure", for the young at heart. It has a refrain which is effective, but not much more, sorry to say. This CD one is anyway earcandy from you ears. The remaster version has two new version of two of the hits. Ive have the original, and im courious why they put them in , but maybe theire would give you more values for the money.
