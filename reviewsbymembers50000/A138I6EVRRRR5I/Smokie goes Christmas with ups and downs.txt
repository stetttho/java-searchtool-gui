 I like the Smokie sound, but when it comes to cristmas song it`s up`s and downs. .When it comes to the slow songs, it`s to sloooooow sometimes. Terry Uttley is the only one back from the classic Smokie, and he`s playing bassguitar. The best thing whith theire Christmas album is that the smokie sound is all trough the songs, and gives the traditional songs a certain flaire. If your`e looking for an CD with something to rockin around the cristmas tree too this is certainly not " that cup of tea". Track 11 White Cristmas is a treat and something different for the versions you have heard before. But please Smokie put in at least two songs with more rock and roll next time. A boogie woogie here and there. I dont mind at all.
