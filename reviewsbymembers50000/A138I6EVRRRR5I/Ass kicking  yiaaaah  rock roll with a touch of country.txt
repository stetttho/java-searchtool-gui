 Travis Tritt is more of a country & western artist, but on this one much of the songs has an ass kicking" yiaaaah" rock and roll feel over it with a stream of country on some of the tracks, as they are the weakest one on this CD. But how can you possible go wrong when you use Little Feat as a backing band on tracks like the "fast moving" Bible Belt,  (Track 3). The ones i realy like is rock and roll tunes like that which shows the rock and roll side of Travis Tritt. Maybe we can call it "foot stomping" rock & roll, with a dash of hard rock feel. Like Track 2 T.R.O.U.B.L.E which sometimes has the magic of Jerry Lee Lewis with the "humping" and "stomping" over the piano, with enough woooha and yiaah to make youre feet move automatically to the rythm. Skip trough the slower ones, which doesnt show his "real rockin side" . Sorry to say i don`t like his version of the Eagles hit Take it Easy, otherwise this is a fine collection which realy shimmering one most of the tracks, on the "rockin" side, but not one the slower ones which doesnt has the right "rockin sting".
