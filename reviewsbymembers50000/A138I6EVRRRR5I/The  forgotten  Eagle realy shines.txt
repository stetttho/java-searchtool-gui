 Randy Meisner, let us call him the "forgotten" Eagle, brings us here on this CD, a lovable breeze, and a hybrid musical joy somewhere inbetween  Poco (another group wich he had played for) and Eagles  soft core quality country music which realy has the right sting to it.  He puts you into a good mood with Track 1   which i will call the "hit song that should have been"   Hearts on Fire, and ended with Track 9 Anyway Bye Bye. But the best thing on this CD is the quality which shines all trough. Eagles members Don Henley and Glen Frey, and Jack Tempchin as one of the songwriters on One More Song, i wonder how you can possibly go wrong. But the best thing about the CD is the "mood" all trough. So relaxable to listen to. It`s the simplenes and the smooth soundpicture that realy lifts this one.  Track 5 I Need you Bad put`s you into a Desperado mood, can you realy ask for more ? Track 6 One More Song, is high standard, and when you hear Frey and Henley in the background. Woooah. This one realy does it. Highly recomended.
