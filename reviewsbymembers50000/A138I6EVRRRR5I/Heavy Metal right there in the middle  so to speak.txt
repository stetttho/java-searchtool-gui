 There are two tracks on this CD, Blue Oyster Cult: Super Hits that stand`s out as real" heavy metal gems". Track 1 and 9 on this super hits are "superduper". The rest  are very variable with some small up`s and down`s  all trough. It start`s very well with one of theire biggest hit`s: Don`t fear the reaper. This is a classic, and sound`s very well when you compare it with much new "heavy metal". It`s more like a pop/rock song with an very atmospheric vocal and soundpicture. It goes along as somekind of breeze trough your`e soul. It build`s up to a heavy metal quality solo nearly at the end, and the theme never runs empty on atmosphere. Track  2 This ain`t the summer of love`is a booring mess of socalled sophisticated heavy metal, but far from the lighter Track 1 atmoshere. Track 3 Godzilla, well it has much of the same problems.It spin`s around and doesn`t run of later on in more interesting directions. Track 4 The Red and the Black is better classical blues rock this one, and it kicks up a great tempo upbeat all trough. Track 5 O.D.`d on life it self, has a weird opening, but soon bring`s you over in more bluesy mood. Ok. Not so much heavy metal, but  likeable an humming in a way. Track 6 Goin trough the motions is more "sympho rock" than heavy metal, with a very broad vocal. Track 7 Black Blade is also a synth heavymetal hybrid, and has a certain sting, but doesn`t kick`s off in a very interesting way. Track 8 7 screaming diz busters, is the most classical heavy metal track, and sound very 70 ths, with it`s rockopera element`s put`s in here and there. Is devilsh in the lyricks, but not in the music. Track 9 Burnin` for you is a gem. Has much of the same atmoshere as Dont fear the reaper (Track 1). Atmospheric pop rock, with a very likeable refrain. Greatness all trough. Track 10 Flaming Telephats. Too much to soon. Forgetable, so to speak. Anyway this collection is near a 4 star, but the tipping point goes to 3 1/2 star, because the overall quality.  Heavy Metal right there in the middle so to speak, with more down`s than up`s to make it shine.
