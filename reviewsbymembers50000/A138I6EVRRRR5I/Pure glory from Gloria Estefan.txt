 Quality in every department on this album. As an artist she always gives the best to the listner. You know what you get, but it`s nothing wrong with that. From the opening track Destiny to Track 11 Reach there is just small musical letdowns to not give the CD a five star. But the glorious "Estefan touch" shines trough the weaker things anyway. Personally I prefer here when she sings in spanish, because it`s more real in a way. You get anyway a good mix of slow songs and songs with more "up tempo" beat. Track 5 You`ll be mine is a good example of that. Track 9 Along came you is an another example wich realy make you "cha cha cha" all trough. The acoustic  Track 11 Reach is a classical Estefan songs as we like it. A fine end to a good musical journey.
