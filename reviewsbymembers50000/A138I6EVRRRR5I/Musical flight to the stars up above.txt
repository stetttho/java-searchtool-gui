  Santana and his guitar. It`s difficult to find words what`s his music can do to your`e soul. Soulful`music is probably a concrete word . It`s happines and love all trough the album. It`s potent musical energy. The reason for just a four star, is that sometimes is to little variation in the songs. But hey, Santana is Santana and give you loveable music for boring days. Track 1 Adouma is Classical Santana, and when is guitar comes in. Woooha. This is a musical flight to the stars up above. Track 3 The hit Singel The Game of Love, featuring Michelle Branch, is stunning in all it`s glory. The voice of Michelle Branch realy lifts this one. Sorry. No more words to describe it. Move over. Here come`s Santana with the perfect hit for loooooong summerdays. It`s no problem to see why so many guest stars want`s to contribute on this CD. Carlos you have done it again. Make the world a happier way to live in. Thanks !
