 Steve Forbert is the real thing. The voice has a pain in it  that grip your soul. This collection combines the albums Streets of This Town and The American in Me. And what a listning experience. He should be in the big league, because he has the magic x factor in most of his songs. I can`t put a finger on what it is that make Steve Forbert a real treat to listning to. To use Garry Tallent as an producer give Forbert a rich soundpicture, lesser acoustic sometimes, but  something else which really fits the artist. There`s so many goodies on this CD. But Track 6: On the streets of this town, have a certain magic. It has an "walkabout" feel which is difficult to put in to words. But the harmonica at the end really lifts it up  where the skies is the limit. Forbert knows his roots, that`s for sure. One of the few, in our "media muzak" society who realy stands up for the word quality, with big Q.
