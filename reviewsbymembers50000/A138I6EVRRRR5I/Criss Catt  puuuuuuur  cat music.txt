 Peter Criss has always been my favorite Kiss member. Kiss was magic in the seventees. Peter Criss has been in and out of the  group.Understandable he has other references than Simmons and Stanley, but his "Criss cat purring" is over the record. Except for his drumming style, it`s little traditonal Kiss sound here. This is the man singing Beth, one of the largest selling single in Kissstory. Be myself (Track 1) is easy listening. In trouble again (Track 2) is more heavy. Where will they run, is simple, and playable on a FM radio,who will remember the sound of the 80(eightees).(Track 4). I Found love, is easy listening. Its fun to know that the album is made in 1980, and much of the sound  groups who had one hit wonders later on, "duplicated" later on and then dissapeared, but Criss has stayed more or less tuned. (Track 5) Theres nothing better,is a real rocker, with rockabilly piano, and a whole brass and rythm section, who sounds like The Commitments. Track 6 (Out of Control) its one of the weakest tracks, but Criss voice is on "top form", the rasping voice inbetween Rod Stewart and Joe Cocker somwhere. Track 7 is a slow "should have been a mega hit" on Radio. Words is the name of the track. Its puuuuuur Cat music. Peter Criss is a ballad singer, and this one shows.One Track 8, You better run,its more heavy, but its low on "temper". Track 9 My life, is the one who has some guts, but fall apart and sounds later on "overproduced". Track 10 Feel like letting go, sounds like belive it or not Elton John. Anyway this is "puuuuur" cat music. Maybee far away from Kiss, but has its Peter Criss stamp on it. And thats not a minus.
