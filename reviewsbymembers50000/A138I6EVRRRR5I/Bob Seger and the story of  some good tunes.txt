 When Bob Seeger is good, he`s very good, but sometimes it swings into "average" but he`s never below average. The reason is that he`s a rock& roll craftsman that knows his roots. Track 1 Roll me away is a great opener. You know when Roy Bittan (E street band) just touches the piano tangent  in the beginning, you are on the right track. This is a very uplifting song, with the right touch "open space"between the different instruments to make it a classic. Track 2 Night Moves, is more in "so so" country. It`s very traditional but nothing  exceptional. Track 3 Turn the page is one of the early Seeger hit`s. Well performed vocal, but the tune is mediocre. Track 4 You`ll accomp`ny me it`s more up there.Easy to get hold of the song. Straightforward roots rock and roll done the "easy way out", but it certainly works. Track 5 Hollywood Nights has an effective rythm all trough. It`s the drumming which does it. Effective down to the smallest beat. Track 6 Still the same. Yeah. That`s all to say folks. It`s likable, but it`s still the same. Track 7. Old time Rock& Roll. Woooha. I just said wooha, when i first heard it. This is a jukebox and karaokee favourite, but that`s not all negative. The reason is that it`s so likeable when you hear it you know it`s time for "party party". It`s soooooo rock & roll man ! Track 8 We`ve got tonight is a great ballad. Moody and effective. Seeger sing`s with passion and you know he`s meanin` it.  Track 9 Against the wind, is classical rock & roll with it`s "walkalong tempo" it goes in the right direction from beginning to the end. A classic this one. Track 10 Mainstreet is more in "average" Seger land. It`s certainly ok, but nothing extraordinary. Track 11 The Fire Inside. Bittan is back on the piano, and the uplifting soulcraftmanship is right there it should be. A fiery song that really sparks. Track 12 Like a rock is very straightforward. It has a refrain that it`s repeated. Seeger sing`s great, but that`s not pushing it to much above average. Track 12 C`est la vie it`s a Chuck Berry original that Seger does a very good version of. It`s full of passion and shows the early simple barebone stripdown rock & roll roots. Track 13 In youre time is an ok closer, but nothing to shout  a big hurray of. As an introduction to Bob Seger this one shows you in the right direction,if you wanna listen to an artist and the story how to put together some good tunes
