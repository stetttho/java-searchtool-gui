 The opener  In this little Town is like a cute little short story, with a heart to it.  It will stay in your head nearly forever, because it has some universal human elements. A narrative structure in story telling that realy hit`s you in the  heart. Restless Heart  in a way, as we all some times feels. The other tracks is variable, but worth listen to anyway. It`s a form for light country rock, which really kicks in gear sometimes like Love Train. There are ballads that Mind of Matters of the heart which really tell universial stories about love and relationships that give every one hope for a better world for all of us.  Track 8 Hometown Boy has quality written all over it in the same quality as In this little town has. Restless Heart gives you feed for your soul and your heart all in all. To sum it up with a tempo up beat song Id``cross the line, really gives you something for every taste.
