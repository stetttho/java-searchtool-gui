 This is a remixed and repacked album and a rerelase of 21 Century fox. This is pure and simple a summeralbum for all Sam Fox fans, also included is a multimedia CD you can play on youre Mac/PC. My to favourite tracks are Let me be Free and Santa Maria, which also you can see on the video. Sam Fox is the sexy girl next door you always dream of. This is pure and simple popmusic, and sounds like balsam in youre ears. Here tiny voice,fits perfect to the wonderful and easy listning music. Close your eyes when you listen to here, and she fill you with pure joynees. Fox is perfect company when you feeling stressed. She so relaxing. Music to sleep in too, and waken up too. Pure feminin music. The one critical point is that there not too much variation on the album. Give us a new rocker ala Hold on Thight, on your next album Sammy !.
