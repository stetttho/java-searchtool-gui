 Robbie Robertson gives you what i will called "naturs own" experience when it comes to music. When you try to listen to it, with  open mind, it will lift you up as a human beeing. Certainly Track 6: Somewhere down the crazy River is in that category. That song has a certain touch of magic. It`s the space inbetween the different instruments, and the voice of Robbie Robertson, which will spin your soul into the direction of happines.  But how can you go wrong when you get help from Peter Gabriel and U2. When listen trough this CD, it have many highpoints, but there are some minor problems wich don`t give it a 5 star, probably because sometimes the U 2 soundpicture make Robertson  a "copycat" of  U2. But  when you listen once again at  Somewhere Down the Crazy river, you are back on the track again. Listen to the wind, listen to the sea, listen to the nature. The voice of Robbie Robertson fits in there,....somewhere probably over the rainbow, when the words stops, and the music take over.
