 Deja Vu. Maybe that ?. Anyway this has "quality" Deja Vu, all over again. John Fogerty seldom change`s his style. Thank god for that.  The best with this CD is the creative simplicity in many of the songs. It grip you in a way that you can humming most of the tunes after a couple of listning`s. There are some tracks that are realy outstanding in that department, like Track 2, with it`s saunter along refrain. Let`s skip the tracks like Track 3 She`s Got Baggage, which is ok, but nothing more, and go to the funky "poormans" reagge like Track 4 Radar, which is double ok. But then he come up with the great Track 5 Honey Do, which will swing you mind in a positive direction. Track 6 Nobody`s Here anymore has Mark Knopfler on second lead guitar. Woooa, is the word. To put the "sultan of swing" master to filling out the musical picture is great. This is realy fingerpicking great guitar play. Track 7 I will walk with you, is a great song. It`s say so much in a simple and honest way. ( I will walk with you, and treasure every smile. No matter what the fashion. You`ll always be my style. John Fogerty: I will walk with you) This is great poetry, ....man. To say something about Love, why say it in a difficult way, when you can keep it simple, the Fogerty way. The rest, is solid work, but not up to 5 star quality, sorry to say. Anyway the John Fogerty magic is back. Nuff`said !
