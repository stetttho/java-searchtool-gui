 Gary Moore has the touch, the guts, and the credibility. Yes, most of the time, it`s here on this CD, called Still Got the Blues. On Track 1 Moving on, Moore set`s the standard all trough this CD. Moore`s vocal has the "blues voice" for sure, and this track doesn`t dissapoint as it move`s on, from the beginning to the end. Track 2 Oh Pretty Woman, is blue`s from the "old school standard", with Albert King on the guitar who know`s how to "milk out" enough "iiiiiiaaaaa" and"woaaaa" from his guitar, that makes you scream for more "Moore". Track 3 Walking by myself, is more upbeat, a "rockin" bluestune, with an effective harmonica, that makes it an ok listen. Track 4 Still got the Blues was a hit back then in the beginning of the 90 th`s. It`s an earfiller, with a very open soundpicture, that give`s Moore`s voice enough room to spark `s a moody feeling all trough. Track 5 Texas Strut `s is ok, like a "poor man`s ZZ Top song, on a bad day. It also have the "ho,ho,ho" Z.Z.Top vocal growl, included. Track 6 Too Tired, is  standard blue`s with Albert Collins back on guitar. Ok, but nothing more. Track 7 King of the Blues, is  standard blues too, but has a certain spark, with good guitarplaying by Moore, and an effective Hammond Organ in the background. Track 8 As the years Go Passing by, is a let down, to slow, to little guts`y, and doesn`t deliver`s at all. Track 9. MIdnight Blues follows in the same footsteeps,but has a moody and relaxable atmosphere, all trough.  Track 10 That kind of Woman, has a certain flair`e, with it`s honky tonk rythm walkalong trough the song. Track 11 All your Love sound`s better. It`s uplifting, and a joy to listen to. Very good solo guitar play by Moore, and it`s soulfoul enough from every "Blues brother" out there. Track 12 Stop Messin` around, has  every ingridient, to put a standardmark qualitywise on this one. Yees. Gary Moore has the blues feel most of the time on this one. Quite enjoyable this CD.
