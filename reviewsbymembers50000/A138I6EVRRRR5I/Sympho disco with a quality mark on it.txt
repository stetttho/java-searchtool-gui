 It`s probably hard to put this CD in to a certain category, but i would like to called it "symphodisco" . First of all this one has one of the greatest covers i know, which shows something of an arabian fantasy. Jeff Lynne is a great songwriter, that gives you something of  an "out of space experience" when you listen to track after track.   Track 5 Last Train to London, is my all time ELO hit``and shows you how a hit song should sound like. Track 6 the beautiful and sentimental MIdnight Blue is also included too. There are some tracks here that doesn`t make it to the top, but anyway the real Lynne rock and roller is included here Track 9 Don`t Bring me Down.  A very good CD this one, but not ELO`s greatest.
