 Track 1 Hold on is a very uplifting song, which brings us hope for tomorrow. It certainly can cure depression, if you listen to it  with an open mind and ears.  And why shouldnt you. There are at least to very good songs on this CD. Track 1 Hold On and Track 3 Impulsive. The rest is a mixed bag, but the overall quality is good.  Wilson Phillips is smooth popmusic, which fill you with  happy earbalsam, beacause the girls voices just click together in total harmony. This is not easy when it come to chorus, but Wilson Phillips are there right on the spot in many of the songs. Track 5 You`re in Love is one of those moments. In the mixed bag category we have tracks that not are bad listen, but sounds very similar. More variation would have given it a 5 star.  Anyway Whilson Philps are nearly up there in music heaven for 5 stars CD.
