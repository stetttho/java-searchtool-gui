 Aaron Neville is one of the voices from heaven above. I first heard him at a Linda Ronstad album back in the late 80 ths. His voice totally gripped me. Track 2 Everybody plays the fool, was the Neville hit who did it here in Norway. It`s difficult to describe, but his voice is a real "smoothie".  Co producer on this album is Linda Ronstadt, and she and George Massenburg (producer) has done a tremendous job to build up a great "wall of sound" that fill you ear with "musical earbalsam". This is one of the albums that has a clear signature on it. There is no copycat here. This is i the real thing. This is Aaron Neville at his best.
