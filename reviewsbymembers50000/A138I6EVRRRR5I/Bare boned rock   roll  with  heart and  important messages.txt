  I would have given this Cd a 5 star, but my alltime favourite cut from TRB 2 Sweet Black Angel is not included. But the first cut 2,4,6,8 Motorway sets the tone. At the end of the seeventees Tom Robinson Band were big in Europe, and this hitsingel was often played on radio in Norway. Power in the Darkness, the other big singelhit is also included. Sweet Black Angel, my fauvorite rocker from TRB 2, the hit that should have been, is not here, but you get All right All night from the same album.  Anyway if you have you not listen to TRB, before this is a fine way to check the artist out. Every body raise your fist and yell. That`s the power in the darkness.
