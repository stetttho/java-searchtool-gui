 B.T.O (Bachmann Turner Overdrive) kick`s away some rock & roll sparkle here and there, but the whole cd  is not very great. Anyway Track 1 Lookin`out for no.1, is a more or less a slow rock & roll starter, and it`s to much easy listening all trough to make an impact to the traditional rock & roll style as we know it from "school of rock". Track 2  Roll on down the highway is anyway back in the right "track". It has rythm,guts, and glory to make it an enjoyable tour. Effective and right to the point. There ya go rock & roll in a way. Track 2 Hey you is a minor funky song, which has a ok refrain, but that nearly it, so to speak. Track 4 Freeways is an up tempo song, which brings some "symphonic" element`s to the rock and roll genre. Fine. Track 5 Takin` care of business, is the real "greatest hit" on this CD. It has drive and guts and  the real "rock and roll" feel which gives it  soul and intellect. Track 6 Down,down, with it`s honky tonk rythmic feel has much of the same quality as the previous one, but the real "soul rock and roll drive" is not there. Track 7 You ain`t seen nothing yet, has potensial, but it has too much repitition in a way. It spins around in the same direction, over and over again. Track 8 Let it ride has some "heavy metal" elements  with a smal hybrid of sympho rock and roll. Ok,in a way but far from a BTO classic. Track 9 Flat broke love, is heavy metal for sure, but  it`s to flat to make it enjoyable. Track 10 Can we all come together.  A disco boredom. Track 11 Rock and roll nights, is classical slowmoving heavymetal, with a minor spark of melody, but that`s it. Track 12 Jamaica, is an "alcapella" rock and roll song. It doesn`t realy take off. There`s something missing there. The refrain is ok, but a rock song needs some more guts to make it shine. This CD is anyway an ok intro to BTO for "beginners".
