 Ricky Skaggs has a voice that fit`s perfect to his music. This is really music too get happy to listen too. It`s very lighthearted in a way. It realy kicks in gear with the tempo upbeat Track 1 Hummingbird, and it`s not to much letdowns on this CD. His voice is clear and full of sensitiveness, and you can feel it when you listen to this CD. If we looking for small letdowns, which don`t give this a 5 star, it`s the ballads that`s not realy up there with the other stuff. But soon we are back in buisness again with songs with fingerpicking greatness like Track 6 Lonesome for you and the Title track 7 Kentucky Thunder. The favoruite is Track 9 He was onto something ( So he made you). Lighthearted with funny and great lyrics. This is a very good introduction to Ricky Skaggs. I know`s there are some religious aspects over his music, in his lyrics, but forget that if you are not open to that aspect. It`s lighthearted and great listen anyway.
