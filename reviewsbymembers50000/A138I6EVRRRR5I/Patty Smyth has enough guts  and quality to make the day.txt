 How can you possible go wrong when you get help from Don Henley on the chourus ?. There are two tracks on this album who stands out. It`s Track 1 No Mistakes and Track 4 sometimes love just ain`t enough`. What i realy like is the rawness and pain in here voice. Maybe you can called it Janis Joplin Light in a way. The other tracks are a mixed bag of listening experience.  The duet Sometimes love just aint enough has quality written all over it. It builds up a certain mood, and when Henley clicked in. Aaaah. Total harmony. This is the ultimate hit ballad on this Cd. Henley has also the pain in his voice, that makes you shiver. But how can you realy go wrong when you get Roy Bittan (of Springsteen and Bob Seeger, piano, keyboard, fame) to produce the album. All in all Patty Smyth is a good treat , and have a enough guts in here voice to make the day.
