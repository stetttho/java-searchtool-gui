 Pweeee !. Annie Lenox just blew my away on the first track called 17 Again. The voice, yes the voice are back. This is very intelligent popmusic, with creative notes put`s in the right "narrative" direction. In other words very well composed   Track 2 I saved the world today, is an even better listen. The "airy"  and "breezy" sound just grip you and never let you go . Track 3 Power to the Meek, is more rock and roll. and sounds OK, but nothing more, sorry to say. The ballad Track 4 Beautiful, it`s a nice gem, when it comes to how to perform a good ballad. There are anyway to many ballad`s on this Cd to give it a 5 star. I prefer Eurythmics doin the more up beat tempo songs, either it`s rock or pop songs. The rest tracks are a fin mix between those. Track 10 Forever is a nice "beatles" inspired song, but got it`s own style beacuse of the Lennox Vocal. All in all. A fine introduction if you are "new" to the modern sound of Eurythmics, and also for the old fan. It will certainly give you one or  another form for peace.
