 Alabama give`s you some "good rockin tonight" songs, and other`s that just kick``s the surface a bit. But overall this Cd is a good treat. Track 1 Still goin` strong is not Alabama at their best, but more average. Then there is Track 2 TLCP ASAP, with a weird tittle. An ok listning, but nothing more. When Track 3 kick`s in  as the ballad Kathy brought my guitar back today, the quality is up at least one level. It`has a relaxable atmosphere all trough the song, and has hot potensial as an example of the "good old school" of ballad tradition. Track 4 On this side of the moon is a letdown, and doesn`t take of in the right direction. It sound`s like you have heard it before. Anyway Track 5 Cheap Seats is a good old standard rocker, with gut`s and glory to kick up some sparks here and there, and set`s some qualty standard`s which some of the other tracks has problem to follow. Track 6 Reckless is also up there above average "quality", with a catchin refrain. Track 7 That Feeling is an letdown which does`nt bring me "that feeling", sorry to say. Track 8 This Love`s on Me bring back the standard in way, but not`s realy up there. Track 9 Clear Water Blues, has nothing to with Blues to do, and are the worst track on the whole Cd. Track 10. A better word for Love is in the same league, sorry to say. Track 11. Angel among us, is a ballad to, but is a big step in the right direction, but ballad`s are not Alabama`s strongest force when it come`s to good songwriting. Anyway as a hole this is very average, but has some song`s that kick`s in the right direction a little bit more tha average, Probably 3 1/2 star`s Cd.
