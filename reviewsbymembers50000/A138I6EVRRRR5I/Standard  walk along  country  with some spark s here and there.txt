 Billy Ray Cyrus. Well what shall we say ? Exept for the "hit song" Achy Breaky Heart (Track 2) there`s not very much to shout "hurray" for on this CD. This is standard country. Veeeery standard. It`s to sterotyped in a way. Let`s move on. Track 1 Could``ve been me, has some gut`s but it` doesn`t kick off in the right direction for a good melody, sorry to say. The best track is the hit song  Track 2 Achy Breaky Heart is an enjoyable,danceable, and good country song. Cyrus voice on this one show`s some spark and variation`s quality that`s difficult to discover on the other tracks. Quality all over, in every department`s. On Track 3  She`s not cryin anymore Cyrus, show`s that he has a good ear fore ballad writing. One of the better ones on this CD. Track 4 Where`m i gonna Live is a tearjerker lyrics wise, with a piano in the background, as an understatment. This is anyway very stereotyped, and easy forgetable. Track 5 These Boots are made for walkin, the Lee Hazelwood hit song has been done with many artist`s with more or less luck. Cyrus is not more lucky, and doesn`t make it  as it`s own. Track 6 Someday,somewhere, and somehow, somehow a boore to listen to. Stereotyped in every department. No spark, no guts, and no country feel. Track 7 Never thought I`d fall in love with you, has tempo, oh yes, but nothing "more". It kick`s off here and there, but that`s all. Track 8 Ain`t no good  goodbye, is a song which has nothing to do with good quality country, but  sound more or less as  "stewed prunes" with sugar on,gooey and overly sweet. Aiiik !  Track 9 Im so miserable has some spark, and and rythm that makes it an ok listen. The CD ends with the title track Track 10 Some gave all. The song it`s ridden with clishees. There`s nothing more to say. Billy Ray Cyrus, is anyway "likeable " country music, with some spark`s here and there.
