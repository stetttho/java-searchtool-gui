 This is not Cooder  at his best. Its very in the middle. It`s so overproduced and sounds like a terrible mess sometimes. Let`s forget that and consentrate on the good things. Track 1 Get Rhytm written by the late Johnny Cash has the rythm and the cooder magic. Fast and down to the point musicalwise. Track 7 I can tell by the way you smell has some magic too, but it`s to much sound sometimes, which kill`s the vocal. Track 9 Let`s Have a Ball has rock and roll feel too it, and the cooder magic . But the rest is not "my cup of tea" to be honest.
