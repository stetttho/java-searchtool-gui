 Aaron Neville has a voice like few artists in his category. This CD kicks you right into a happy mood with Track 1 Can`t stop my heart from loving you (The Rain Song) and hold you with a soulgrip all trough the CD, with some minor letdown`s, which doesn`t give this a 5 star. Track 3 Everyday of My Life is anyway a very sensitive song with the soulshivering voice that is Aaron Neville`s trademark. There are also a complete different tour on this one with the bluesy Track 4 Down Into Muddy Water. Outstanding listen. But the ballads. Oh the ballads. That`s what doing this CD. Neville does`nt have to say more that a couple of humming and the voice touches you. There are very much description of rain , sunshine, and thunder in the songwriting on this one,but isn`t that much of the changin moods that our`e everyday life got alltrough the night and day ? Track 10 Use Me is a style break, and the weakest track. Booring in a way. The last Track 14 Crying in the Chapel is as near heaven and angels than Elvis Presely had done with his version. Anyway this one will tatooed your heart and soul with joy and happiness. Stylish and well polished music and very relaxable to listen to. Very useable as a lullabye or a wake up call from the softside this one.
