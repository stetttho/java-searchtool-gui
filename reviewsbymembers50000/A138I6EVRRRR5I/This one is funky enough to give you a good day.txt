 The opner does it.:Love is certainly a wonderful thing, and Michael Bolton is one of these singers  to blow many other male`s singers right off the spot. It makes your soul sing trough pouring rain.  It`s a cliche nevertheless, but Bolton makes me happy, so damm the critiques. This is certainly a "good mix" from a singer with a "heavy metal soul hybrid voice". There are some ups and downs trough the CD, but overall, it has enough soul to make you sometimes shiver in pure enjoyness all trough. Kenny G on Sax does help too,on Track 3 Missing you now.  Bolton sings as he realy means it, with a soulfull voice, not at all soulless. To put in the good old "oldie" when a man loves a woman, can be to much over the top, when we compear it to the original. But  i dont think is bad to put a "real signature" on his songs.
