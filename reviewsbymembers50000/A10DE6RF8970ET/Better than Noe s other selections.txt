 Decent storyline and thread. Artwork is sketch with watercolor, so expect softer lines and details than Kevin J. Taylor's work. Personally I liked this title better than Doctor I'm Too Big, which had a pretty blah story, and too few panels per scene (important for any graphic novel to provide continuity and flow.) This title "Ship of Fools" does have single cels of the aforementioned bestiality and bondage, but I'd consider them NC-17 rather than X (similar to the difference between a Hollywood murder on film, versus a snuff film) - there are paperback reading books far more graphic in those areas than this title. Contrary to other reviews, I considered the action scenes depicted in Noe's titles to be much tamer than Taylor or Belore illustrates, but that may be due to the limited number of continuity frames per scene.
