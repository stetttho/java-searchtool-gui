 I like the images, both resolution and quality-wise. It's a little boxier than I'd like, but then the price makes it a closer performer to the $700 cameras.  Something not mentioned anywhere I've seen is that the lens used happens to accept standard 37mm filters - Tiffen and Sunpak have a pretty good selection available.  Very capable flash unit despite the size, probably due to the pretty sensitive CCD (took some pictures inside the house with all the lights turned off - came out like daylight).   Nice bright LCD with fine resolution.  A little slow on picture-to-picture transitions when in Slideshow mode (initially resolves a 50% pixelated version, then slowly draws in the refinement over about 15 secs. per picture).  TV Out seemed to take as much battery life as running the LCD (you get about 15 mins continuous life max out of the supplied 1400ma Ni-MH AA's.)
