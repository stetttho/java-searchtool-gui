 These are clipped from A&E's Live at the Improv - total of 6 individual volumes, each with different talent, available also as a boxed set.  Each concentrates on a 5-7 min. set comprising basically the most famous premises from each comic.  Not necessarily a great or comprehensive collection, but nice as an intro. to each comic's particular style.  Chris Rock, very early, and less raw than currently, Drew Carey - just plain young and directly out of the Marines, short Judy Tenuta bit, Carrie Snow hosts.
