 As the description says - Shrek 1 and 2 are full-screen limited versions (similar to the $19.00 special releases before the 2-disc sets come out).  Shrek 3-D is a wide-screen short.  The bonus disc has some added music video games and stills.  For me, it was an inexpensive way to get all 3 quickly, but really you should be getting the WS versions for full content.
