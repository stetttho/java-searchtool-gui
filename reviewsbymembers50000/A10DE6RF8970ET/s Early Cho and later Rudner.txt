 These are clipped from A&E's Live at the Improv - total of 6 individual volumes, each with different talent, available also as a boxed set. Each concentrates on a 5-7 min. set comprising basically the most famous premises from each comic. Not necessarily a great or comprehensive collection, but nice as an intro. to each comic's particular style. Rita hosts. Rich Hall is just after his Sniglets run. Cho bit is not the MontgomeryWard set - it's the one about her name and parents.
