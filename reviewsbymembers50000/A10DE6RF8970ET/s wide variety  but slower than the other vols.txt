 These are clipped from A&E's Live at the Improv - total of 6 individual volumes, each with different talent, available also as a boxed set. Each concentrates on a 5-7 min. set comprising basically the most famous premises from each comic. Not necessarily a great or comprehensive collection, but nice as an intro. to each comic's particular style. Brad hosts.
