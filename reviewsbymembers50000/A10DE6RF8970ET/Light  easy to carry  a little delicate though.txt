 Buttons are very small, so large handed/fingered people might have trouble with them. Nice sound quality on SP (7 hr); LP (15 hr) is the usual MP3 on low resolution warble, ST is pretty good, but creates pretty bulky mono-sounding files, unless you're using external stereo mics, or a stereo line-in.  5 user folders for sorting - can do Add or Overwrite, but takes about 2-3 clicks to change the mode.  Display normally stays on, but it's like a digital watch with a backlight.  Sound output is quite audible for a little wafer speaker.  Bought as a replacement for a micro-cassette, and used for vocal presentation preparation, so I like the scan/review features and the variable speed playback.  Vocal-Up does a modest job of basically compressing the input to equalize amplitude (think of it as auto-gain).  Delicate refers to the overall feel in that it's pretty much all plastic, and I'm worried about dropping it and having a lot of damage from a fall.  But that's what one gets for the price, and the size (which is like a couple of matchboxes stacked vertically).
