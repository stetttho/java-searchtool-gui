 Yes, I'm quite satisfied with the results.  I headlined at my showcase night at The Improv - Hollywood, and thanks to Judy's personal touch, we played to a packed house of 250 with consistent unique and tight delivery, and came away with the experience of a lifetime.  The audio CD's and DVD's help with understanding how you need to apply the step-by-steps found in this book - but the point is: you have to get out of your own head and work the material like a maniac.  The average rate is about 200 hours of writing per hour of performance rough material, so there's lots ahead.  Judy herself points out that she didn't "invent" this methodology - she merely thought enough to actually organize all of the years of experience she's gained in writing, living and loving comedy and put it into a single tome.  But that doesn't mean it will write material for you.  It points you in the direction you need to go - which is start noting down every single premise you discover and forensically tear it down thoroughly.  Then, grab your comedy writing "buddy" and start working it through to death.  And get in front of every audience or person that will listen.  Think of this as a common sense guide to what are the "magical" things that make people like Seinfeld, Chris Rock, Robin Williams, and Billy Crystal funny.  And how you can take your personal point of view and find the "funny" in it.
