 First off - this is about the 3rd in her series of basically one-woman show format performances.  Since she transitioned from regular stand-up, Margaret's found new passions in politics and advocacy that have significant contributions to her contemporary content - so, for those seeking more of the old days' "...Let's go to Montgomery Ward" premises, disappointment will set in. These are sharper, more pointed and in-your-face challenges - nothing polite about it.  That being said, I was at this show for the taping in LA and can vouch for the energy and vitality of both this show and it's audience.  Her website has great blogs of all the post-show comments, and she's getting stronger with each year. Naturally, this translates into becoming even more challenging to the conservative perspective - so if you just want the fond content of the young Margaret, visit her shorter stand-up clips on the various "Night at The Improv" DVD's, or her 2 earliest CD's.
