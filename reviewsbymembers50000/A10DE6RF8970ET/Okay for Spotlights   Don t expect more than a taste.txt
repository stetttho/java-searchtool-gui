 These are clipped from A&E's Live at the Improv - total of 6 individual volumes, each with different talent, available also as a boxed set. Each concentrates on a 5-7 min. set comprising basically the most famous premises from each comic. Not necessarily a great or comprehensive collection, but nice as an intro. to each comic's particular style.  Liked the early Norm and Ray work, and the vintage Tim Allen.  Star: Jerry Seinfeld American Comedian/Actor  Star: Norm MacDonald Actor/Comedian  Star: Ray Romano American Comedian  Star: Richard Jeni Actor/`The Mask`  Star: Charles Fleisher  Star: Rick Overton Comedian  Star: Tim Allen Actor/`Santa Clause`  Star: Dennis Wolfberg   In addressing the prior reviewers - don't buy this expecting a full set from each comic - it wouldn't fit on a 60 min. video. But if you want a 'flavor' of what each comic can do, or does, this is perfectly plausible.  I agree Seinfeld's features are way better, but this is more like comic scene studies than full feature presentation.  Know what you're buying first.
