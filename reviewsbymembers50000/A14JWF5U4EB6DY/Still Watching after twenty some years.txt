 I have been watching "Christmas Eve on Sesame Street" ever since my parents taped this for me and my sisters sometime in the 1980's (although I'm not sure exactly when). I'm glad I found this DVD, because the video copy I have has definitely seen better days!  This program was made in the 1970's, but I don't feel as though it's dated. Kudos for releasing it just the way it was, and not making an updated version of this.  ***WARNING: FOLLOWING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***  The story starts out at a skating party, where Oscar the Grouch asks that fateful question: "How does Santa Claus get down all those skinny little chimneys?" Big Bird and his friend, Patty, have to find out right away! So Kermit the Frog and Grover ask some kids how they think Santa does it (some of the kids responses are really interesting).  Another storyline is a classic take of the O. Henry story, "Gift of the Magi" where Bert and Ernie are trying to think of what to give each other for Christmas. Neither of them have any money so they each trade their most prized possessions to Mr. Hooper to get each other a present.  One of my absolute favorite parts of this whole special is Cookie Monster writing a letter to Santa. Or at least trying to. I won't go into great detail about this one, you and your kids just HAVE to see it for yourselves!  ***END OF OVERVIEW***  Anyway, this has always been one of my favorite Christmas programs, and I think it's great for kids of any age.
