 Like I titled this thing, you watch this DVD, and by the end of it, you're rolling on the floor laughing your head off. These are some of the best Jim Henson Muppet sketches I've ever seen in my life. Some of them were re-done for the Muppet show, such as "Kermit's Friend" (also called "Inchworm"), and "Happy Girl Meets Monster," but they were much better on this DVD. Some of the highlights of this DVD are "A Change of Face," where a doctor is rearranging a Muppet's face, "Happy Girl Meets Monster," where a girl is commenting on how nice the day is and a monster is doing all he can to ruin it, "Scrap Fiap" (and if you listen carefully, you can hear someone in the audience saying "oh boy!" towards the end of the sketch), "Kermit's Friend" (Kermit eating the inchworms and ends up getting swallowed himself), "Java" (a personal favorite), and "Octopuses Garden" where a diver is singing, and an octopus is cracking bad puns during the whole thing. Any Muppet fan will delight in this collection. The quality is excellent, the sound is great, and the colors are spectacular!
