 This is the very first MLP cartoon ever made. It was also the first one I ever saw, back in 1984.  The story starts out with Firefly and Medley flying down the rainbow, and all the little ponies playing. The fun of the day ends abruptly when the Strattadons (big, ugly, flying lizards) come and take away Cotton Candy and Moondancer. Firefly flies away to get help. She ends up falling into a well, and is pulled up by a girl named Megan (probably around the age of 12 or 13). She goes with Firefly to Ponyland to help the ponies.  Upon returning, the Strattadons come back and take Bubbles and Ember away. The ponies are being taken to Midnight Castle where the evil Tirac turns them into monsters with his Rainbow of Darkness, so they can pull his chariot.  Sandy Duncan is the voice of Firefly (the only pony to ever have a celebrity voice), and Tony Randall is the voice of the Moochick.  This special is included in the MLP First Season DVD box set, but it's been edited. I suggest you try to find a VHS copy of this, unedited, because it's really the greatest MLP cartoon ever made, and you really miss out on a great song called "Little Piece of Rainbow," sung by the Moochick (Tony Randall).  Word of warning, I wouldn't recommend showing this special to very young children, due to the scary overtones. I saw this when I was a two year-old, but was never freaked out by it, but then again, every kid is different, so use your best judgement.
