 What better vocal version of "Sleigh Ride" is there than the Ronette's version? You hear this song once, and you'll have "ringalingalingadingdongding" stuck in your head the rest of the holiday season. Well, maybe not, but it's still a great version of the song, as well as Darlene Love's take on "White Christmas" and "Winter Wonderland." Other great songs on this disc include "Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer" by the Crystals and "Frosty the Snowman" and "I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus" by the Ronettes. These are some Christmas classics I hear year after year on my oldies station, and now I finally have them on CD. These are some of my favorite Christmas songs, and they're sure to become some of your family's favorites too.
