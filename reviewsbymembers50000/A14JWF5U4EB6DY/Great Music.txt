 I found this while looking for "Walk Away Renee" by the Left Banke. This is a great CD, although I'm inclined to say some songs like "Lightning Strikes" by Lou Christie, isn't *that* hard to find as "Laurie" by Dickey Lee (and let's face it, ANYTHING by Dickey Lee is hard to find!) The great moments on this disc are the two songs mentioned above, as well as "My Boy Lollipop" by Millie Small, "Nothing But a Heartache" by the Flirtations (which I had been looking for for quite some time), and "Rumors" by Johnny Crawford. This disc is worth it.
