 Care Bears were hot back in the 1980's, and they're making a comeback today! This particular bear is just SO SOFT, and the video has two episodes from the Care Bears series, which teach about the importance of caring and sharing your feelings. The new Care Bears are just as cute as the old ones, and any child would love these, as well as adults who collect.
