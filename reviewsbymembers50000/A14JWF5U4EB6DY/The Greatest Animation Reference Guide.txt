 This is THE best cartoon encyclopedia I have ever stumbled upon. It lists nearly every cartoon ever made (by nearly, I mean some programs that weren't shown in America aren't in this book). The book is split up into five different sections: 1. Silent cartoons from the 1910's to the 1920's 2. Theatrical "sound" cartoons (i.e. Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny, etc.) 3. Cartoon movies 4. Cartoon television specials 5. Cartoon television series Everything is listed alphebetically, so it's not too hard to find your favorite cartoon. Although there are some errors in the book, such as slight mistakes in voice credits. But other than that, it's a great book. Specials and series that you never thought anybody remembered are listed in this book.
