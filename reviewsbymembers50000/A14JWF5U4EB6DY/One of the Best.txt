 This is the second "My Little Pony" special. It's one of the best ever made. The Little Ponies are having a costume ball in honor of their human friend, Megan. Throughout preparation, we see Catrina, an evil cat-like creature, who uses Witchweed Potion to be powerful. The potion is made by the Bushwoolies. But they soon escape and Catrina wants the Little Ponies as her new slaves. PROS: The songs are really great, and Catrina isn't wishy-washy like some of the villians on the MLP 'n Friends TV series (ie the Witches from the Volcano of Gloom). This is also one of the best plot-lines for an MLP cartoon. CONS: I didn't like the way Megan was animated, and the ponies from the first special never returned (and in my opinion, Firefly should have returned. Also, whoever designed the initial box when this came to video obviously wasn't paying attention to the program. On the front cover, ponies and characters who aren't even in this special are pictured, and the back states that Baby Surprise is kidnapped by Catrina, but  it's Baby Moondancer who gets kidnapped. All in all, this is one of the best MLP cartoons ever made.
