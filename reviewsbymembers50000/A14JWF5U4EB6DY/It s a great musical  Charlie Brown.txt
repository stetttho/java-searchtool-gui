 I've loved this Peanuts special from the minute I saw it. I own the CD soundtrack from the 60's play (with Gary Burghoff from "M*A*S*H* as Charlie Brown). I used to sing with the songs all the time. The highlights are the main title, and anything done by Snoopy. "Queen Lucy" and "Oh Give Me a Home" are funny points. All in all, this is one of the best Peanuts cartoons that have ever been made.
