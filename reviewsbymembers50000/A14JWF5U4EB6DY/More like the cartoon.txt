 I've seen both the first and second Inspector Gadget movies. I was (and still am) a huge fan of the Inspector Gadget cartoon show (one of my all time favorites, actually), so I was really looking forward to when the first one came out. I was sorely disappointed in it. I found this one to be better. Here are some of my reasons:  1. My favorite character from the cartoon is Penny. I'm glad to see she got more screen time in this movie than in the first one.  2. I found French Stewart's Gadget to be more of a bumbling doofus than Matthew Broderick. Stewart's Gadget, to me, was a lot more like the Gadget in the original cartoon.  3. The biggest mistake they made in the first one: Dr. Claw. You are NOT SUPPOSED TO SEE HIS FACE!!!!! Adding an actual claw for a hand is a nice touch, though. Also, in the first one, Rupert Everett was too young to play Claw. I don't know who played him in this one, but the voice was better as well. It was raspier than what Rupert Everett did in the first one.  All in all, I felt this movie was more like the cartoon than the first one. I'm not a fan of live action movies based on cartoons, but I found this to be a good remake.
