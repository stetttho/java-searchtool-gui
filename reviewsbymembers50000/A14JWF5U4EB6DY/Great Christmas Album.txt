 Being addicted to the Four Seasons, I had to get this album. It is a mix between traditional Christmas classics, and fun Christmas songs. Although during two or three of the traditional songs, Frankie Valli hits a couple of clinkers when he breaks into his falsetto, but not much. The medleys are well balanced, and beautifully transitioned between one song and another. But my favorite songs on this albums were the one fun Christmas songs, such as "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town" (which is my favorite version of this particular song), "I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus" (with Frankie singing in his falsetto all throughout the song), and "Christmas Tears" which is virtually new to me. Another song that was new to me was "Jungle Bells" (the track listing on-line makes a mistake and credits it as "Jingle Bells"). "Jungle Bells" is easilly defined as a novelty song, where Santa Claus visits the jungle and is giving presents to all the animals. It's really cute and funny. This album is also the hardest Four Seasons album to find, and could possibly become one of my all time favorite Christmas CD's, and it could become one of your family's too.
