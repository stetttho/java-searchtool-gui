 This CD is the ultimate collection of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. Included in it are all their hits you hear on the radio, as well as some hard to find songs (like "Big Man in Town", "Girl Come Running", and "C'mon Marianne"). It spans from 1962 ("Sherry") through 1975 ("December 1963"). I was a little disappointed when I didn't see "Grease" on the album (only because the Rhino put "Can't Take My Eyes Off You" which Frankie Valli did in his solo career). Once I saw this CD, I knew I had to buy it. I had been wracking my brains out trying to find a good Four Seasons CD with all my favorites (many discs only give you two or three songs that I like, and I would've had to gotten 2 or 3 to get them all). This CD has every Four Seasons song I have heard and liked (save for "Grease", but it doesn't matter, 'cause I own the "Grease" soundtrack). All in all, this is the perfect Four Seasons album out there,
