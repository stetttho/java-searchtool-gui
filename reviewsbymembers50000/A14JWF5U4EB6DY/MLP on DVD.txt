 I am SOOO glad this came to DVD! I had to buy it the MINUTE it came out! It has all the episodes from the first season! The animation looks great. A heck of a lot better than on some of my tapes of MLP.  The only complaint I have is about the two "pilot" episodes, "Rescue at Midnight Castle" and "Escape from Catrina." These were originally television specials. In 1986, the Powers That Be edited them as episodes of the MLP TV series. The versions on the DVD are the edited TV show versions.  But even with the edited specials, this DVD set is worth it.
