 I collect MLP's, and this one was no exception. One thing I have to say is that this pony is such a little cutie! As a child, I was never much into human baby dolls. Too bad toy companies didn't come out with things like this when I was younger. Petal Dove is a really cute baby pony. Press the heart on her hoof, and she giggles. If you give her the bottle (or stick your finger in her mouth), she makes slurping noises. When you remove the bottle (or finger), she hiccups, and then she yawns a few seconds later, and turns herself off. You can start her up again by feeding her, or pushing the heart on her hoof. My sister, (who's older than me by the way) can't seem to get enough of playing with her when she gets a chance. But there's one thing I don't like about this toy. I LOVE the yawning sound effect she makes, but she only makes it after you feed her. There's nothing you can do to get her to yawn, except if you feed her. But on the plus side, she's just so goshdarn cute!
