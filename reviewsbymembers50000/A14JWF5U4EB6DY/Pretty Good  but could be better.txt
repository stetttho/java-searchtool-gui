 This was a pretty good album. The soul reason I got this was for track 1, The Power of Love, since I wanted that after seeing the Sailor Moon R Movie. I also liked Moonlight Densetsu and Ai No Senshi. Nothing at All I heard at the end of the S and Super S movie. The only downsides to this album are I Want Someone to Love, Who Do You Think You Are, and I Want to Hold Your Hand. Personally, I think the Beatles did it much better. But all in all, this is a pretty good CD.
