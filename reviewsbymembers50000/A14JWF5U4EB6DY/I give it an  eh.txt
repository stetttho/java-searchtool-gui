 First of all, the book had some really great pictures. That's the good thing about this book. The ONLY good thing. The bad thing is that most of the information is wrong, wrong, wrong! There are many errors in this book, and it'll get Monkees fans really really confused (it happened to me!) Now, I just like to look at the pictures in the book. Steer clear, don't read!
