 If everybody thinks Dick Clark started "American Bandstand," you're wrong. This book tells about "Bandstand" before Dick Clark became the host. It goes into great detail about the years between 1952 and 1956. However, the book was slightly disappointing. I bought it in hopes the author would talk a little more about the kids who used to dance on the show (since learning my favorite disc jockey danced on the show in 1953), and it didn't. Can't win 'em all, right? Also there were many spelling and punctuation errors as well. But those can be easilly overlooked. All in all, this was a good book.
