 This is one of the best animated movies of the 1980's. I've seen it about a million times and I have never gotten tired of it. The story is great, and the songs are spectacular! It's a good movie for little kids, because it portrays a great message. It's good for older Care Bear fans who like to reminisce. All in all, this is a great movie!
