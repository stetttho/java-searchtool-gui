 This is one of my all time favorite books. I loved it when I was a little girl. I read it even today, when I need a little lift. It's such a cute story. My copy of the book isn't exactly like this one, it's an older version, and falling apart from repeated use. This is one of the greatest children's stories of all times, and your kids are sure to love it.
