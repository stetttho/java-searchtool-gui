 While I must agree that it is obvious that Jim Wilson is a Master of Kendo, I must sadly not recommend this DVD.  The sound is horrible.  There are times when you can barely hear Mr. Wilson speaking, and in the introduction the sound comes and goes as if on a whim.   If you can find a VHS copy, I've been told that the quality is much better. I sincerely hope that the producers of this DVD will fix the problems and re-release it; this has the potential of being a cornerstone teaching DVD.
