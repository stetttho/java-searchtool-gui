 . .  If it weren't for the fact that you just don't get that much in return for the amount of time you spend setting the game up.  The creator of the game spends a majority of the first 3 hours of "game play" giving you an in-depth look at Japanese history, and whereas this is interesting and all, it's not what I bought the game for.   I was looking for the old time fun of "Nobunaga's Ambition" (sp?) for the original Nintendo.  I used to spend hours tinkering with that game; playing and replaying different scenarios.  This game doesn't give you the option of deciding which battles to fight.  It just takes you to the next one and assumes that's where you want to go. The animations are. . . good.  Not great; certainly not above the standard I've been seeing in other PS2 games.  The real drawback to the animations is that you get the same ones every time. .  If you fire a cannonade 5 times, you sit throught the same animation 5 times- and you can't stop it once it starts.  If your cavalry charges 30 times, you sit through the same animation 30 times. . . On the plus side:  The whole game is attractive, with more detail per character (story-wise) than many I've seen.  And you DO get a MASSIVE  amount of history in the game (like it or not), not to mention a terrific glossary of terms and additional historical materials on the disk. I'd have given this game 3 or even 4 stars if it had given more to me.  Unfortunately, more money and effort was spent on the animations than the storyline and playability.  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE games that require a high degree of concentration, but this just got boring after a short amount of time.  Anyone have a copy of Nobunaga's Ambition?
