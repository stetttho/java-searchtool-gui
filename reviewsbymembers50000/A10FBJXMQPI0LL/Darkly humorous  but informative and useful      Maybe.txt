 "Dear Lord, thanks for sending the Worst Case Scenario book.  Now please make sure I never, ever, ever have to use it." At first shot I thought this book was another "duct tape book"; cute idea, neat application, no real use. . .  Then I read just ONE of the chapters.  I finished it the same night. Could you land an airplane?  I can.  Reattatch a finger?  Me too.  Survive an earthquake, air raid or nuclear attack?  Great, meet me at the door jamb and don't forget the olives! This book gives you the framework for surviving all kinds of disasters that you hear about on the news every stinkin' day, but know you'll never be involved in.  And it does it in such a matter of fact, don't get all worked up about it way that you might even remember someof the information- Heaven forbid you should ever need it.  I though the Boy Scouts were prepared before; this should be their new handbook! I highly recommend this book, and hope like anything you'll never use the information contained within.
