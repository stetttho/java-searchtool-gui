 That it didn't appeal to the minority of "Ahnold-shoot-em-up-blow-wm-up" fans is no real loss. It's a good movie that sort of "wraps up" without "ending" the story. Don't look for all the heroes to ride off into the sunset, and don't look for geeky, campy one-liners.  This is actually the more cerebral of the movies to date. Bueno.
