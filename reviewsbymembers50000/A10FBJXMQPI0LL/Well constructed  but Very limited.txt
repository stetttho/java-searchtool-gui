 I really wanted to like this book more than I did.  I've just gotten into Tin-Litho toys and I wanted my first fairly expensive (for it's size) book to contain at least SOME the information I required.  No go. There is  information on the manufacturers, but it is extremely limited, and not very  tight.  In some cases, the information is limited to half a page or so. . .   And this was on one of the biggies. There are tons of pix, but not in  color.  That's a big part of Tin-Litho!  If you don't know what the color  was to begin with, how do you know what condition it's in now? Another  problem I had with the book is the valuation scale that the author kind of  thought up.  With as many different (and accepted) scales to determine the  value of a collectible today, it seems odd to me that she needed to invent  another.  It's sort of like re-inventing the wheel; Sure, you COULD. . .  But why? Again, I'd like to be able to give more credit to this book, but  it's just not there. . .  Really great cover, but not much behind it. . .  Maybe next edition.
