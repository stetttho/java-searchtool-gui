 This book doesn't pretend to be the end all be all of knowledge compedia. It's a relatively humorous look at some of the things that you may have fudged on in the passed and hoped you wouldn't get caught on.  Roughly one in 120 people are allergic to peanuts. Fewer than 1/20th of that amount are allergic to MSG (if such an allergy even exists). Sorry, but it's a medical fact. N.E.J.M. Mar. 1998- If you want to read something humorous and mildly insightful, read this book. If you have serious concerns about allergies, see a doctor.
