 My CD collection is nearing the 1,000 mark, but there are a few discs that you can almost always find in my car or at my work. . . This is one of them.  I'm not a big DEAD fan (don't hurt me), but Garcia and Grisman  really struck a chord with me on this album.   It was originally given to  me by a friend that REALLY didn't like folk music and bought it because  Garcia's name was on it.  What a great album to get!! All the songs are  SUPER tastefully done, but as the title implies, adults will enjoy these  tunes as much as anyone! Really groovin' little disc!
