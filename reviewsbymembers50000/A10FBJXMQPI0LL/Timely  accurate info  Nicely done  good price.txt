 ... As a Clinical Massage Therapist I am always looking foraccurate information to pass on to my patients (at the Hospital) andclients (in my private practice).  I have found all of the AmercanCollege books to be accurate and timely enough to have confidence whengiving them out that I am providing a good resource.  If I did not, Icertainly would not recommend them here! Why not 5 stars?  For thesimple reason that the authors STILL are not taking into considerationthe massive amount of Medically proven information availableconcerning Massage Therapy when making recommendations for treatment.It may just be the fact that "when you live your life as ahammer, every problem looks like a nail", but with over 300medical journal articles written since Sep, 1997 touting thebeneficial effects of Massage Therapy for everything from chronic painto migraines to breast pain and the prevention of cancers, it seemsthat there would be SOME kind of mention of it in a book produced byThe American College of Physicians. Aside from this one complaint, Ihave found this to be an EXCELLENT book and would recommend it foranyone with chronic headaches!
