 Much like a computer manual, this is a book that could be rewritten twice a year and still stay 3 months behind.  As much as the Massage Therapy community and profession change on an almost daily basis, it would be almost impossible to mass produce any kind of book (short of a magazine) and keep it cutting edge. The book DOES still have plenty of things to make it well worth the price, and it's all in one volume.  There is only one mag that has proven itself to be worth reading and it (MASSAGE) will cover about 3/4 of the info contained herein in about a year. The chapter on MONEY MANAGEMENT  gives the same excellent advice that my Grandfather gave me 20 years ago when it comes to smart investments of time and money.  It's certainly as useful today as it was then.  If you're planning on going it alone in the business, I strongly suggest you at least borrow a friend's copy and read that chapter. There is also a great chapter on marketing on a budget.  There are those that say that a good Massage Therapist doesn't need to advertise, and in-as-much as many Therapists work alone, they are correct.  I have 12 Therapists in 2 offices, 3 clinics and 3 hospitals. . . I do a small amount of marketing simply to educate the general public (and the medical community) on what's available; this book made that an easy thing.  We also advertise our seminars (we do about a dozen free infant massage classes and roughly the same number of stress management courses a year) and this chapter helped me save some money there. There is also some plain, common sense kinda' stuff that you just need to hear from more than one person before you believe it.  I won't ruin the book by spilling it here, but there really is a lot of good material in this tome!  If you don't know someone with this book, buy it or wait for the next edition to come out- It's really due!  There's a reason that this book (slightly outdated as it may be) is regularly used in Massage schools across the country.
