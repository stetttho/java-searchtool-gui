 What an excellent movie!  If you had any interest in "Garden State" or "Rushmore" then you will really be able to crawl into this movie.  And crawl you must.  Sorry, no express trolley to the underlying theme, or spoon feeding of plot here.  Bill Murray has always been an interesting choice to star in movies that don't sport a hard-core comedy theme, but he is seemless in this movie.   I wish I had more time to work on this review (my apologies, as the movie truly deserves serious accolades) but again, if you had any interest in either of the two movies above, then you should have no problem grooving to this slow-burn beat. (Oh, and the music is fantastic!! Again think Garden State / Rushmore)  Kudos Bill.
