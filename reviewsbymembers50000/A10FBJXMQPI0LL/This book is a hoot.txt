 As a Clinical Massage Therapist (for both humans and non), and the only captive/agressive (animal) TTouch practitioner in my state, I do a lot of volunteer work at my local Zoological park.  I'm never quite sure what I'll be working on when I go out, so I like to pick up info on various animals when I can and just read ahead.  When I placed my order,  I was looking for a little more scientific data, but even without the clinical research I was most pleased with what showed up at my door!   Ms. Sherr's sincere passion for the creature is evident on every page, and the book itself is simply a pleasure to hold and read.  It has a nicely designed slick cover and the binding is top-notch.  This book will last for ages if taken care of, but as appealing as the images have been to my daugher, I have to keep a close eye on it. There are interesting facts, and some fiction is dispelled.  There's tons of history and beautiful pix on every page. No, the book is not the end-all be-all of information, but it is well worth the price, and there are even a few used ones for sale above (though not mine. . .  you can't have it. . . just back awaaaaay from the book.) I highly recommend this book for anyone with a passing interest or even a non-veterinary passion for the animal!
