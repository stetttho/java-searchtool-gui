 . . . If it weren't already a MOVIE for PS2. . . And unfortunatley, that's almost what ORPHEN becomes; a movie.  With little actual gameplay and loads of Anime-esque pre-rendered videos, ORPHEN really doesn't give you much to do.  Sure, there's running around with bizarre camera angles looking into these little treasure chests that seem to be absolutely flippin' everywhere, and then there's always the "Stop the movie whilst we fight a monster without any explaination!" that seems to happen just often enough to keep you from losing your mind from boredom. . . On the up side, the animations are great and the characters (though eerily "Harry Potter"esque) are interesting enough that you might not mind if this were a real movie that you just paid ... for instead of a video game that won't let you do anything. . . The colors are vivid and the camera work (at times) is almost award winning.  I said almost.  To be honest with you, I'd probably have given this game an additional star if, after saving and dying, you could skip all the superfluous movie bits and get back to actually playing the ever lovin' GAME!! Borrow a copy from a friend then decide if you have the time to spend on it once you pony up the cash for your own. . .  I've been a little dissapointed with what I've seen for the PS2 so far. ...I want more than just slightly revved up PS1 games.  Don't get me wrong, I've really liked several of the games that I've played, but they're just not up to the hype yet. . .
