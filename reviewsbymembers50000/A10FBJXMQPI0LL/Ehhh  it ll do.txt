 Please don't get me wrong!  If your sole purpose in life is to learn basic Swedish massage and pass the NCBTMB so you can go to work in a hair saloon, PLEASE buy this book; it is absolutely what you need.  If you aspire to loftier goals, pass on this one and go look on the shelf of the most successful Massage Therapist in town; those are the book that you want. The A&L is really pretty much just a prep book for the NCBTMB, so don't grab it expecting "PATHOLOGY FOR MASSAGE THERAPISTS" or "SOFT TISSUE MANIPULATION", because it's simply not that detailed. Think about everything you know about driving a car.  Now think about the thin little yellow book that you were given to study for your driving test. . .  This is the little yellow book for "national" certification, nothing more.
