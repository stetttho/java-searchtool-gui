 This is the WOW book to which the title refers. . .  It is, for lack of a better description, "everything you need it to be".   As a Clinical Massage Therapist I have become accustomed to dealing with physicians and their patients. . . When I got a call from a VET I was, well, taken aback.  Having been a CCMT for many years, I knew what to expect and where to find problems in a HUMAN, but this book filled in absolutely every gap I could have come up with in regards to equine physiology, anatomy, kinesiology and the basics of "don't do this around a horse if you want to make it to your next patient" . . . To start off with, it's spiral bound so it's super easy to take to the stable!  The illustrations are terrific and the text doesn't speak to you like you're a fifth grader; it assumes that if you're working on horses, you at least know the basics of working on humans.  And finally, it's encouraging. . .  It let's you know some of the pitfalls before they happen and how to avoid them. I'm really glad I picked this one up! I strongly recommend it for anyone interested in Equine Massage!
