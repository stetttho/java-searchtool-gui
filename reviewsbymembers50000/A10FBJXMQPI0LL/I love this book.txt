 . . . .And I wasn't expecting to!  As a Clinical Massage Therapist, I perform accupressure every day, but I've always had a big fat Western Health Care Provider mental block about this sort of thing. The authors have made me a believer!  Great visuals, expertly written text and basic explanations of what you're doing (aside from unsubstantiated empirical evidence) make this a book to keep!  I absolutely could not put it down until I had devoured it! I strongly recomend this book!
