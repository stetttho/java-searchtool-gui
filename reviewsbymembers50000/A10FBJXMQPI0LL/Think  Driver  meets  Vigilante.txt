 Think "Driver" meets "Vigilante 8" and you've got a pretty good idea of how this game works. The excitememnt and high speed chases of (a wilderness) "Driver" and the crash em' up "what's physics got to do with it" of "V-8".  This is a really impressive piece of work; here's why: SIZE. . . The maps are MASSIVE. . .  They seem to go on forever, and for the first half hour of play I thought that they wrapped around like in the old Atari days. . . Nope, they're just really flippin' huge!  It could litterally take you 10 minutes to get from one side to the other.  Want to climb a mountain?  You can, and then you can look around at things that will actually take time to get to. . . DETAIL. . . Everywhere you look, theres just lots of, well, STUFF.  You hit a stream and it goes on and on and on. . . You hit the highway and it stretches out for miles. . . You hit a pedestrian and, well, I don't want to spoil everything. PRICE. . . I've paid almost this much for PS1 games in the past that have still only been played for 15 minutes. This is one of those that, even if you don't play the mission mode, you will continue to pull out every few days and just allow yourself to be impressed by a video game. Why 4 stars and not 5?  It's not perfect.  The physics is a little conservative for me.  Mind you, I'm not complaining.  I'd have given up looooong ago if I actually died every time I deserved to in this game.  Also, I don't like the fact that just about all the cars have the same acceleration and $X$ ability, even if they wouldn't have the ability in reality.  But this isn't reality, it's pure, unadulterated fantasy, and it's WELL worth the price!
