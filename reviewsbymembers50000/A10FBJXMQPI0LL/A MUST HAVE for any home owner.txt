 Generally when I used think about home improvements I thought about calling somebody (experienced or not) to help me with it.  To be honest, until just after I bought this book (2+ years ago) I didn't think I had the inate skills needed to do something as alien to modern men as replacing a toilet seat, much less replacing the whole toilet and installing a dish washer the same day!!  This book, aside from not being very good at helping you lift heavy things, is all the help you will need to complete hundreds of different improvement projects around your house. The skill gauge is very acurate in it's time estimates and tells you what level of skills you should have before starting a project - This is helpful if only so you can put your plumber on call. With all the information on tools, their usage, and the type, amount and quality of materials you will need this book could make Homer Simpson look like Bob Villa. . .  Well, maybe more like Tim Allen, but you get the point. I highly recommend this book and the Home Depot "Outdoor Projects" book as well!!  Truly money well spent!
