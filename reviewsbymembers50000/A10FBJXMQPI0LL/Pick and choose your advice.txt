 As with any book on making your home more efficient, a grain of salt must be held at the ready.  Saving $50 a year may be  a goldmine to some and may just be a private victory against oil corporations to others.  Still, with all the info in this book, you'd have to be pretty wasteful to not recoup the purchase prise pretty quick! Like the previous critic, I advise the ever-present grain of salt when reading anything that has yet to be proven scientifically. . . Like the wrapping of the water heater HAS. You WILL save energy and in turn money by doing so. So much to the point that the state of California now provides Water Heater Blankets with installation, free of charge, to anyone that wants one. Soon it will be a requirement.
