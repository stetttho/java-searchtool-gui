 I am an Oklahoma Republican; have been since I was 18.  By most liberal standards I'm fairly conservative (and have been since waaaay before that PR*CK Bush made it an insult.)  But when I was bed ridden for weeks with a severe tear in my hamstring I became a little desperate for things to read.  When a more liberal friend brought RUSH LIMBAUGH IS A BIG FAT IDIOT in for me to read, I was, well, hesitant. I read the entire thing in about 5 hours. . . Then I read it again, laughing my *ss off!!  My wife read it, and we then we began buying copies for our friends.  We gave copies out for Christmas and birthdays.   The short of it?  This book is genius.  It's pure unadulterated genius, and I love it. . . ALMOST as much as RUSH LIMBAUGH IS A BIG FAT IDIOT.  When it hits softcover, you can bet we'll be buying it by the case, as well.  Franken is smart, outspoken, funny, and worst of all, correct.  My party has fallen into a shameful pit of greed.  Being Republican used to mean that you were for bolstering the economy for ALL Americans.  It used to mean keeping an eye on the government so things like the "patriot" act (patriotic in title, ONLY) would never come to pass.  It used to mean that you were going to retire rich because you'd worked harder than others. Please, oh please, young readers, do not judge all Republicans by the slanderous slimebag that oozes about the Oval Office these days; we do actually have a purpose. . . We've just forgotten what it is. Come back Bill, all is forgiven.
