 Simply too much categorical, mind numbing data (that isn't actually used on a game-by-game basis) to maintain any sort of interest.  If it were a book on chess problems then it may have made sense to break down sooooo many possible variables, but it's not; it's a book loosely based on Will's belief of how the game should really be viewed and it makes osmosis seem exciting. As a rule, I find most of Mr. Will's writings to be interesting; even insightful. . . Unfortunately to all rules, there must be an exception. I picked up the book thinking that Will would be able to answer questions about the game and it's inner workings. How very disappointing.
