 It's a stand. . . It holds a PS2 in the vertical position.  That's all it does. . .   Let's see. . .  It's made of some pretty sturdy plastic.  Ummm. . . It's attractive. . . Okay, I tried really hard, but I just couldn't come up with anything else to say about this, umm, stand-holder-thingie.  There's really just not that much to it.  It keeps your PS2 from tipping over if you didn't have the forethought to stick it on a shelf between a couple of books. If you have fifteen bucks burning a hole in your pocket, buy it.  Otherwise save you money and buy another game.
