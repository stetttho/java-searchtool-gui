 I didn't much enjoy this game, though I must admit that the graphics were TERRIFIC!  I suppose this is a great game if you you're into (as the young man at the game shop put it) "Button Mashers". . .  A button masher, it seems, is a game in which the primary goal is to mash the attack button before the enemy hits you over the head with a mallet (or some other unfriendliness). The crux of the game is that you're one of the heros outlined in the opening credits.  Each has a different weapon that they use in a different way from the next (Et cetera, et cetera.  Yadda yadda. . .).  You have to win a series of battles (that are a bit confusing to begin with) and claim various prizes. . .  Now on to how to play the game- (much like the title of this review) "Run around, whack buttons, repeat until you are dead or victorious".  Taa Daa, you've just mastered Dynasty Warriors 2; Congrats.  The only real strategy I've been able to discern from watching 3 people (aside from myself) play the game is "don't get hit".   Sorry to have been less than overjoyed with the gameplay, but I've seen really good games and I've seen really bad games (I own 116 PS1 games and 16 PS2 games. . .) and this one is simply too close to marginal to get all hot and bothered about.  Rent it before you buy it.  If you can't stand the idea of returning it to the rental store, buy your own.  (On the up side, I'd give it 2.5 stars if that were an option)
