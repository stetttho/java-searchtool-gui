 Wendy Northcutt has done a great job of cutting the urban legends out and providing the reader with a nuts and bolts, "this really happened, so be afraid" kind of book!   Please don't buy this book thinking it has anything to do with Darwinism. . .  I hesitate to add that, but according to a friend at a book store, there have actually been people that held this belief.  This book is about the odd, humorous and often bizarre ways that people, which should likely have been taken out of the gene pool anyway, have offed themselves (or come close to it). You will wonder if what you are reading is true, but Northcutt is careful to be VERY specific in the details, should you decide to check them out yourself!  In the case of urban legends (stories of things that happened to your brother's girlfriend's Uncle's third cousin) Northcutt has included some that you've probably heard, and some that are regionally specific. (Yes, the man that tied balloons to a lawn chair and drifted thousands of feet in the air is true. . . The guy that strapped a rocket to his car-wheelchair-bike is not) Buy this book for humor value, if nothing else. I recommend this book.
