 As a rule, I don't concern myself with compilation cook books.  I simply don't like the "K-Tel" feel of the disjointed conglomerations of food from cooks that may or may not have even heard of one another.  This book is surprizingly cohesive.  The recipes are not really ones that I would have sought out individually, but of the ones my wife and I have tried, we've been pleased with the results. This is certainly not the end-all be-all of the cooking world in a book, but there are some surprizes for those willing to experiment.  Not the least of which really is the fact that these recipes are inexpensive.  I was kind of shocked.  Okay, I was really shocked.  The ingredients aren't that tough to find, either.  I've actually bought books that I still have yet to find some of the ingredients listed, but they offer "substitute" ingredients. . .  It really makes me wonder what the real ingredient would have done for the flavor. Why not 5 stars?  Regardless of the recipes that I liked, it is still a compilation cookbook, and there are some pretty far to one side or the other recipes.  I like knowing what I'm buying in advance. I still recommend this book to anyone willing to try something new!
