 The words needed to properly describe the grandeur, the flat-out SIZE of this film have simply not yet been coined.  Sorry.   Buy the movie and mayhaps you can come up with some of your own. I give it a 67 out of 5.  Need a better review? Read Lawrence's biography by J. Wilson.  In a month you will either be ready to cement-over the Sahara or buy the movie.  My hopes are with the latter.  =)
