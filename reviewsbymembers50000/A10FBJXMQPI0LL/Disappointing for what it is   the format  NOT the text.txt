 For whatever reason, the publishers decided to leave out portions of the text, and add a massive amount (about 40% of the already shortened book) of Japanese history with photos. The history is great.  The photos are. . . Photos. If you've any interest in this subject, find a copy of the Shambhala Dragon Edition by Thomas Cleary.  It's much more complete, much more more readable, and was actually translated by Thomas Cleary(!), a world reknown scholar on the subject. This poor representation of such a powerful, important book almost relagates it to the dingy shelf of the "coffee-table book.", and that's a real same.
