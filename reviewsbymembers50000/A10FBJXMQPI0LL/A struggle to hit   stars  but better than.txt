 If you liked Crouching Tiger ~ If you liked House of Flying Daggers ~ If you are a fan of historical fiction ~ If you enjoy nuveau Kung-fu flicks ~ If you enjoy old-veau (get it?) Kung-fu flicks ~  Then you'll love this movie.  Visually stunning - great story - super fight scenes (that actually have something to do with the story) - AMAZING costumes.  That's all I've got for you.
