 Although the back cover makes Mr. Cardoza look and sound a bit full of himself, the book seems to be well put together and informative.  It breaks down essential information into 21 easy to understand chapters and gives  lots of information on printers and what you can expect when it comes time  to send out checks. 	I have enjoyed this book from the first page, and  truly believe that it will become an essential desk ref for independent  publishers all over! 	On a personal note. . .  Mr Cardoza. . . I  really liked your book, but lose the boots.  At the very least, pull your  pant cuffs down.  =)
