 In the bold tradition of The Avengers, this movie tends to wind it's way around and about several story lines and a dozen characters.  If you've ever seen an episode and liked it, you will LOVE this modern re-telling!   Not for movie critics or whiny  why-doesn't-every-little-thing-make-sense'ers. . .  Not stop action and  wit!
