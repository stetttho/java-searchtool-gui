 As I was in my review of SMUGGLER'S RUN, I am in awe of the sheer magnitude that this new platform affords.  Granted, there have been VERY few games that have taken advantage of that fact yet, but the thing  was just born; let's give it a little bit. THE TRACKS:  The runs are huge.  Right off the bat there are 2 runs you can try and one actually take 6-7 minutes. . . If you're actually TRYING to get through.  The more experience you build up, the longer and more interesting the runs get.   OPTIONS: Again, the more experience you build up the better the options.  From new clothes to new boards to a sliding performance scale that actually allows you to increase your own abilities with points. GRAPHICS: Don't even get me started.  From the box this thing looks more like a documentary than a video game.  The colors are stunning and the speed is phenominal!  If only more companies would put this kind of time and energy into their game playability, look and feel then the world would be one step closer to perfect. . . Okay, maybe not, but it might be a nice place to start. All in all, if you like snowboarding games even marginally, don't bother renting this game; just buy it.  It's certainly well worth the initial cost and you'll be pulling it out as long as you own your system.
