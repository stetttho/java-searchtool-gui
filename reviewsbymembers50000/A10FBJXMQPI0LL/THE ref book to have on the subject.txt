 When I first re-entered the world of climbing, about 4 months ago, I went into the local "outdoorsie" emporium (a GREAT store called BackWoods in Norman) and asked for the finest Swiss Seat they had.  It only took half a thought for the youngish, very polite woman to have any clue what I was talking about. "You're looking for a harness."  Was her reply.  "And you'll want this, too." and she handed me this book.  Ahhhh. . . Pure bliss.   If only I'd known about this tome when I got into climbing the first time, I might not be getting "back" into climbing now, but just getting better.  This book is indespensible.
