 I'm on my fourth copy of this book.  Mine tend to vanish like the morning dew juat as my neighbors begin their spring garage cleanup. . .  My bro-in-law has one as well, but he insists that the fact that my name is written in indelible SHARPIE marker on the front is just a tribute to me and my helpful nature. . .    This book has more helpful hints in introduction than most do in the first 5 chapters.  And it just goes on and aon and on! With actual real life applications for stuff you'll find lying around your garage (from old buckets to wire to old useless hose), this book is a true boon for anyone looking to clean up their act (and their garage) and make the time they have to spend on projects less of a fight to just keep the cords straight! I highly recommend this book for anyone that knows they own at least 4 tape measures, but can't find one to save their lives! Well worth the cost, and as well constructed as the book is, it will last a lifetime!
