 My hat is off to you Ms. Susanka!  You have taken the ages old saying of Bigger is Better and stuffed it into a hat box. . . And it actually looks good!  = ) With this, her second book on the subject of compacted quarters, Sarah Susanka provides a greater foundation for her earlier claims that a house can be more functional and even more attractive with less space.  In addition, she spends muuuuuuch less time stuffing her personal ideas of how your house should be laid out down your throat. . .  This book has dozens of DIFFERENT ideas to work with including lots of schematics. In her previous book she was, well, confused as to how many of us still have family dinner in an actual dining room and a few other misconceptions.  These mistakes has been corrected and the end product is a book that combines form with fashion to produce some really interesting living space inside an area that most would consider cramped.  Now if she could just explain how to get my wife (beautiful and intelligent as she is) to keep her stinkin' shoes off the floor in our own small space I'd give her the other star. I like the floor plans included as well as the explanations used for using different materials and lighting.  I'm not a refugee from the fashion decorating police, but I did learn a few things in this section! Much better than it's original version!  Highly recommended.
