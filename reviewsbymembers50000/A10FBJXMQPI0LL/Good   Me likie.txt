 Insomuch as the movie was not designed to be a historical account of what happened during this period in Japan, rather an interesting, beautiful work of fiction in the form of a movie, I liked it. "Dances With Wolves" in Japan?  Definately. Amazing film making?  Umm, yeah, okay. Terrific scenery and costumes?  Oooooh yeaaaaaah. I'm *not* a Tom Cruise fan, but I *did* like this movie.
