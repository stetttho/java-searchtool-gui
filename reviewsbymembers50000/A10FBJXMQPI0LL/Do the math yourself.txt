 MD's make plenty of money from patients that get sick NATURALLY.  They simply don't have the time needed to spend on people that have created a log-jam on the system by making THEMSELVES sick with their "diets-du-jour".   Feeling run down?  Angina pain?  Wanna' lose some weight?  Try eating LESS and walking MORE.  GOSH, why didn't we all think of that before?!?  Oh yeah, some of us DID! Still want to own this book?  Buy one of the used ones above.  At least you'll keep the Diamond Empire from getting your money. . .
