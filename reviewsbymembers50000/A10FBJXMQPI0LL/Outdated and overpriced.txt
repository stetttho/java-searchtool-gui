 When it comes to money making e.fads (as daytrading is now seen) you need the absolute most accurate up-to-the-minute information available to succeed.  This book is simply none of the above.  Sorry. If you really want to know how to get started (or if you even should) go to one of the daytrading .coms and read their FAQ.  Their information will be the most up-to-daye around, and they might even offer advice that will help you get your finances in order before you start.
