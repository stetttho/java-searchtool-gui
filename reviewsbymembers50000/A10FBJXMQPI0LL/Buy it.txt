 I stumbled onto this little goldmine in a used bookstore in Enid, Oklahoma of all places.  I picked it up to pass an hour that I had before an appointment and have since crawled through the entire book numerous times. I've made almost half of the recipes as is evident by the ingredients ground into the pages themselves. . . Having lived in 12 countries and half a dozen states in this one, I have found that I love food.  All food.  Food from everywhere.  All of it.  This book has recipes from all over the country and the world and most are as I remembered them!   All are tasty, even if some are on the "Why would I spend that much time on a snack" side. The chapters are laid out with easy to follow instructions and photos for every recipe!  Recipe books without pics are a real pet peve of mine.  Granted, I only have 40 some-odd recipe books, but I have found, invariably, that those that have the food represented in a visual manner are those that I go back to more often.  Food is as much a visual experience as it is one of scent or taste. There isn't much by way of history, but then again you're already getting more than what the title promises! Why not 5 stars?  It's a good cook book.  It's not a GREAT cookbook.  The author doesn't make suggestions as to alternate ingredients and many of the ingredients used would have to be purchased specifically for the preparation of the snack.  This small problem aside, this book is well worth having.
