 . . .And really that's the only way I can imagine the reasoning behind this book; as a joke, or maybe on a dare.  the author did her very best to put together a list of sushi rolls that might be found appealing to the  westerner. . .  With little success.  Peanut butter and Jelly?  I won't  even justify that with the much deserved  "PUHHHLEEEEEEEASE"!  The book is short of facts, shorter on  technique and devoid of any history whatsoever.   Well over half the  rolls are either western concoctions or creations straight from the  author's imagination.  Some of my fav's being the "Eggs McSushi  Roll" (Tamago), the "Anchovy and Sun dried Tomato Roll", the  "Mussel Shoals Roll" and what Japanese cookbook would be complete  without the "Prosciutto and Cantaloupe Roll". . .  There's always  the "Blackened Catfish Roll" for those of you with a taste for  Cajun Sushi.  And for you Brit's, how about the "Tomato and Cucumber  Roll". . . Try it with beans. Did I really spend 4 bucks on this?
