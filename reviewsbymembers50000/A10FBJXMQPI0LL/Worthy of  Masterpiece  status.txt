 This series, though certainly low budget by today's standards, is absolutely one of the most superbly constructed pieces of classic Brit cinema available on DVD.  It will take it's place in my collection along side more contemporary versions of it's cousins "Pride and Prejudice" and "Sense and Sensibility" to be more "savored" than "watched". As far as special features, there are few. . .Okay, there's ONE.  You can chapter search - Though the huge guidebook included with the set make up for not having "behind the scenes" and the like.  And you can read it WHILE the series is playing!    A true boon to those of us that tend to have less short term than long term memories. The series is comprised of all of the things that you want from classic Brit television- Drama, romance, intrigue. . . Well, a little less intrigue than maybe would have been nice, but still the shows will keep you spellbound from the first opening sequence!  This in conjunction with it's humor (not quite "To the Manor Born", but still very witty) make this a series you'll keep pulling out on family-movie nights for years to come!  Sure, there's less chance of that happening if you are blessed with all boys, but those of you that are bringing up little girls can look forward to many viewings of this classic!! I strongly recommend this series!
