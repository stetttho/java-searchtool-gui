 As the founding "Father" of a group of at-home-dads I'm always on the hunt for any kind of helpful resource to pass on to my Dads.  This book has proven to be one of the most well received.  As any of you that have read my other reviews know, I RARELY give 5 stars.  This book is just that well put together. The book doesn't dwell on the fact that Fatherhood is just now coming into it's own. Instead, it presents basic Dad-stuff info in an easily digestible and accurate fashion in combination with some pretty humorously drawn pix.   Each topic, from tying shoes to riding a bike to tying a tie (roughly) takes about a page or so and presents it's information fairly in depth, but still very easily read.  Imagine this as the little yellow book you got for your driver's test; there's 10,000 other things you'll need to know also, but this will help you pass the tests that tend to show up every few months after the age of 4. I highly recommend this book for any new Dad; At-home or not!!
