 The grace and wit with which Mr. Walker writes would be welcome, regardless of the subject.  However, as a Buddhist I must say that there are very (VERY) few volumes of Christian literature that have actually deepened my appreciation of not only the mystic aspects of Christianity, but Christianity as a whole as much as The Mystic Christ. This book is informative, without being preachy.  It is witty, without being sarcastic.  And it is honest, without prosyletizing.   I own a small gift shop in a small-ish Oklahoma town, and we go through about a dozen copies a month.  It is possibly our best selling single volume. Thank you, Mr. Walker, for your insightful and interesting product.
