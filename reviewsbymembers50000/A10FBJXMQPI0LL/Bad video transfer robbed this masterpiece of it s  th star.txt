 Romance, intrigue, murder and just a bit of humor make "The 6 wives of Henry XIII" a classic that you'll enjoy for MANY years to come. . . IF you're a fan of Brittish T.V.  or a history buff, that is! It's difficult to describe the pomp and circumstance of such a grand series to anyone that's not "lived" it for themselves.  Brit T.V. has held America firmly in it's grasp since the first showing of Masterpiece Theater and "The Pallisers" about 320 years ago. . . Okay, it wasn't QUITE that long ago, but it seems like it sometimes.  If the series was available to you the first time around, watching it again on DVD will leave you wondering how you got on without it in your collection for so long. I feel compelled to agree with a previous reviewer that said less about the series and more about it's transfer to DVD.  Though I don't feel the port was so bad as to call it on par with VHS, I DO feel that it has dropped to say, a poor BETA copy.  Still, with as much as you will gain from simply having the series in your collection, the minor picture imperfections and rare audio distortion are a small price to pay. I strongly recommend this series, along with "The Pallisers" (sets 1-3)  and "I, Claudius"!
