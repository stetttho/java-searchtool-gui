 As a friend of mine (that owns a pet shop) said, "I really wish this book had been around when my 8 year old did a report on fish. . .".  The book is beautiful.  If you need some great pix or if you need some  pretty easy text to copy, go for this book.  If you have an in depth  interest in cichlid keeping or breeding, get the book by Loiselle.
