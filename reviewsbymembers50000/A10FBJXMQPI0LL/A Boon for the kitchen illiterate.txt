 I love my wife; she's brilliant, beautiful and has a wonderful sense of humor.  Unfortunately, the girl could burn Jell-o. . .  So take it as said that when I can home the other night and not only found dinner on the table, but found STEAK, I was a bit taken aback! The George Foreman (blah blah blah) Champ Grill is a a very wonderful thing!  It actually works like everything you've ever bought on a whim SHOULD have worked, but didn't.  It heats up quickly and cooks even quicker!  You can cook burgers and steaks in HALF THE TIME, because it's actually cooking both sides at once!  What a great idea!  The only real drawback I've found to it's speed of cooking is that beef tends to be a bit tough when cooked so quickly.  I think I've come up with a solution though. . .  Next time we're going to sandwich the meat between 2 thin onion slices and THEN cook it. . . I'll let you know how it goes. Cleanup is a snap with the little plastic toothed widget they send along, as long as your 18 month old doesn't get hold of it and hide it under the couch, thereby removing the "clean" mystique it had at the beginning. . . But that's just an assumption. . .  =)    Even if your kid does take away the widget, a little soapy water and it's right as rain!! I bought the biggest one, but I wish I'd gotten the one down from it.  I cook for myself, my Wife and our 18 month old food critic and the one I got is simply too big. It's a little tough to store also. Why 4 stars?  Well, it's not perfect.  For starters, it doesn't have a timer.  It's easy to misplace the little fat catcher-cup thing  that goes under it too.  Oh well, it's still a really handy device for making dinner super fast and with minimal cleanup! I thing you oughta' buy one (but not the biggest unless you have 2+ kids and a really hungy dog)!
