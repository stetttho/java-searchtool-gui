 Ummmm. .  Yeah.  Let's talk about something OTHER than the screenplay.   The effects were STUNNING!  I can't give it higher praise than that without giving something away. . .  Actually I could, but I'm feeling lazy.   =) The actors were a little surprising. . .  Rent or buy CITY OF LOST  CHILDREN to see what I mean.  Weaver has never been my fav even in the  Alien flix, but she does a damn good job of it in this pic!  Good Job  Woman!  The ending, well, the ending sucked.  Period.  The end of the  movie became an astronomical singularity and all other things were sucked  into it, never to escape.  The end.
