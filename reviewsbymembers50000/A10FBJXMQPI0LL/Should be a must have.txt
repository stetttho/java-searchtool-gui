 Not to get too deep, but Chuck Palahniuk has seemigly taken the (Wilhelm) Reichian blueprint for the downfall of man as it relates to his own subconscious self fulfilling prophecy and woven it into a FANTASTIC, highly contemporary read!  I was not expecting to enjoy this book this much!! The characters are vivid and incredibly human.  You will pick out characters in the book and add the names of people you know; likely even visualising the people you know as being the character!  I've never been so. . .so. . . COMPELLED to finish a book in one sitting.  It is simply that good! In an attempt to NOT reveal anything in the book, I will say that your enjoyment of the book is magnified by knowing anything at all about Reichian philosophy- Wilhelm Reich was an absolute flippin' lunatic- However his theories are the basis for much of our psychology today. I strongly recommend this book!  For any of you that have read my other reviews, youwill know that I RARELY give 5 stars. . .
