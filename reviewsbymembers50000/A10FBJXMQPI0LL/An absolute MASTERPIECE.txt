 It is difficult for me to rate anything as "absolute", but this movie is, for lack of a better word, flawless. . .  The story has a discernable start and a realistic (if an animatronic muppet movie can be  realistic) if all too soon ending.  The characters are at least likeable,  and most are loveable!  Augre was truly one of the best put-together  characters in almost any movie I've seen. . .  There's something to being  able to create a character to match their "character".  One can  definitely see the influence of Jim Henson's studios in FARSCAPE, and this  is FARSCAPE'S Great Grandfather!  Very Hobbit-esque. . .  I'd LOVE to see  the Tolkein masterpieces done in this fashion!!!
