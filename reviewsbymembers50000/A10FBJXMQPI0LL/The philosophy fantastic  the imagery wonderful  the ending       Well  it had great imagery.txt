 My sister with impecable taste in reading material loaned this to my Wife.  I got to it first.  That is to say, I couldn't find a book I was looking for, and this one was sitting on the desk.  I scanned the back, and took a look.  I devoured the book in two 3-hour sittings.  As a Buddhist (Soto Zen) and a Christian (Anglican; my Priest calls me a Buddheo-Christian)I have grown accustomed to people that don't truly understand either path telling me that the arrangement is simply not "possible".  I honestly felt like answering out loud when the holy men were telling Pi "You can't follow more than one religion!"  In my heart I wanted Pi to use the words I've used so often in my life "No, YOU can't follow more than one religion. God and I, however have no problem with it."  I must say that, while I've not heard much mention of it, Martel's wit is the gem that kept me captivated.  I found myself laughing out loud for much of the first half of the book.  Some points actually so funny that I would wake my wonderful, patient wife with my guffaws.  = )  The ending was abrupt, and not as satisfying as I would like, but that is simply my opinion.  My sister thought it was perfect.
