 This is one of the worst films that I have ever seen. The historical inaccuracies, though significant, are almost forgivable in comparison to Woo's outrageous ignorance of the military. The military campaign is incomprehensible. On top of that, the acting is almost universally poor, though Adam Beach does a fairly respectable job. I might have to reevaluate the poor reviews I gave to other war films in order to balance the scales a little bit. Avoid this film by any means necessary. You will either hate it, or be made stupider for having watched it.
