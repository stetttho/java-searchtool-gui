 This film is very clumsily made, though not as much so as the atrocious "Windtalkers. It's interesting to see how a film can so successfully avoid any political or historical significance, and yet be almost entirely non-fictional. To lift the Vietnam War, and the battle in the Ia Drang valley, entirely out of historical context in order to create a film that indulges an extended father/soldier fantasy, is quite an accomplishment.      I'm sure the real Hal Moore was quite a commander. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. But there's something really weird about the idea that a Lt. Colonel is in the best position to tell the story of the men who died under him. This would have been a far more interesting and valuable film if it had been entirely a film about Hal Moore or about the battle itself. Instead, it simply tried to be all three (actually all four because it was also about the wives at home-a topic that certainly deserves its own film) and only really succeeds in being a film about Mel Gibson acting like a soldier.      The problem of failing to tell the story of the battle becomes obvious at the end, with an out-of-the-blue retaliation of what we have been led to believe should be a crushing ambush. As a soldier, I could fill in the blanks, but my girlfriend was at a complete loss.       This stinker gets two stars only because of the outstanding performance of Sam Elliot as Sergeant Major Plumley. He was entirely believable and a guilty pleasure to watch. Old-Army SGM's like that are becoming increasingly rare, and may soon go the way of the dinosaur-nowhere on earth, but all over the screen.
