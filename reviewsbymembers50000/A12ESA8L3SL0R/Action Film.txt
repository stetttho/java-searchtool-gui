 I own a version of this that is produced for the East Asian area so I don't feel qualified to rate this DVD. An excellent film, and I think one of the funniest ever. I certainly don't think this is an action film. Isn't it also a fine allegory for the Cold War, the nuclear arms race and the doctrine of mutually assured destruction?
