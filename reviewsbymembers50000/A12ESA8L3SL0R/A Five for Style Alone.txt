 ...I read the entire book in an almost breathless three and a half hours, reading it from the front door to the table for lunch, which I ate while I read... I took a bath so I could continue reading uninterrupted and then left an hour late for my evening social engagements.    McEwan's prose is spare and elegant, the sort that any writer might think he could write, until he tried it.  It has been so long since I read a book without a preponderance of authorial intrusion that, paradoxically, I found the absence of looming omniscience and clumsy stage directions jarring, then irresistible. Character development is subtle and persuasive, and even the most self-destructive and outrageous turns are justified and believable.   McEwan's rendering of musical composition is as gripping as a good thriller.  In general, his work writing is very good.  Topical subject matter is included in a manner that is neither heavy-handed nor obtrusive, but rather gives the novel a definitive grounding in a contemporary that should translate well into the future.    I took particular enjoyment in the Jacobean conclusion.  Many other readers have criticized the ending as implausible, but I am persuaded that they have missed many of the important cues in the book, which Mr. McEwan claims to have written so it might be read in one sitting.  This is a morality play; reprehensible behaviour, betrayal, irresponsibility, and inhumanity all have their comeuppance in a manner reminiscent of the Classical tragedian bloodbath.  This book clearly references many similar dramatic traditions.   I heartily recommend this book to a variety of readers. Aspiring writers (especially American ones) should take particular note of McEwan's style, emblematic of good contemporary British prose.
