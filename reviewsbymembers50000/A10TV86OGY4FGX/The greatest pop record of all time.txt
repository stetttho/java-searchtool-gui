 The debut album from one of the best pop bands ever is the greatest pop album ever!  The first three songs on this record speak for themselves.  These songs are still in rotation on rck and classic rock radio today, and are the songs that define the cars.  Other stand out tracks on this record are:  You're all I've got tonight, Bye Bye Love, and Moving in Stereo.  Although this is the Cars at their peak.  None of thier other albums are ones to be ashamed of.  This album, though, should be the one you purchase first!
