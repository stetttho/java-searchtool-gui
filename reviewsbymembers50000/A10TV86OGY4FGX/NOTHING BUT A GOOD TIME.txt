 Here is the first collection of Poisons best known songs, and this has pretty much everything you would need for the casual Poison fan.  It has the hits like "Nothing but a Good time" Every Rose has Its thorn"  "Talk Dirty to Me" and many more.  Poison's music summed up the 80s in one word: FUN.  Their lyrics were not the greatest, nor was the music the most technical.  However, their songs were not meant to save the world or anything.  Their songs were made to be on your stereo on a Friday night at a party or in your car with the volume at eleven with your windows rolled down.  This collection has the perfect soundtrack for a party, or any time you just want to smile and have fun!
