 Well, here is the first "official" greatest hits album from Quiet Riot.  There have been many "bargain" versions, but here is the first official one.  For a band that only has 2 songs well known to the  general public (Cum on Feel the Noize and Metal Health) these songs are  guarenteed to be on this collection, so there is no real point in talking  about them.  On to the other songs.  I find it VERY strange that they chose  to have three songs from their 1988 self-titled album with Paul Shortino  taking over the vocal duties.  Don't get me wrong, I really like that album  and there are some great songs on it, but that album was their weakest  selling of the 4 records represented on this collection.  I also wonder why  they put the live versions of Metal Health and Let's Go Crazy.  I mean the  studio version of Metal Health is already on here, and I feel that it woudl  have been more fitting to release a full live Quiet Riot album instead of  just putting 2 songs on the end of a best of collection.  I think this  collection would ahve been a lot better if tracks like Thunderbird,  Condition Critical, Sign of the Times, Put up or Shut Up, etc were on this  collection.  Despite my complaints I stil find this a very good album and a  great introduction to Quiet Riot
