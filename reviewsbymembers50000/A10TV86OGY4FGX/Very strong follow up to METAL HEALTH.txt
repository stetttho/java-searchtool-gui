 Condition Critical was Quiet Riot's follow-up to their multi million selling METAL HEALTH record.  This record sold decent, about 1.5 million in the states, but not nearly as much as its precedor.  I do feel, however,  that this album is superior to METAL HEALTH.  I still dont' have the CD,  only the vinyl, but it is great.  the first side is great.  Sign of the  Times, Party All Night, and Winners Take All are among the highlights.  The  second side has 2 great catchy songs:  Red Alert and We were born to Rock.   However, you can't forget the "hidden gem" on this record, which  is the title track.  If you are a fan of early 80s commercial metal, and  you liked the songs on METAL HEALTH, pick this one up.  You are in for a  real treat!
