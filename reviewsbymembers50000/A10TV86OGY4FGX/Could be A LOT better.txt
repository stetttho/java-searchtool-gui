 Let me first start off by saying that I feel that Bon Jovi is one of the BEST rock bands that have ever taken the stage.  However, I am EXTREMELY disappointed by this live album for many reasons.  One of the reasons is that it is a single disc set.  Bon Jovi have been around for almost 20 years.  They have had tons of hits and even more fan favorites.  They could have easily filled 2, possibly three discs with their catalog.  Secondly, I feel that the "1985-2001" is very misleading.  With the exception of "Runaway" and "In and Out of Love", all the live tracks were recorded from 1995 -2000.  The third, and probably the most frustrating reason is the lack of continuity.  There are usually 2 songs from each show together on the disc, and they sound fine, but after that, the song fades down, and the next group of songs fade in.  When I listen to a live album, I want to feel like I am at a Bon Jovi concert, and with a fade out every few songs, it definitely loses the live feel to the record.  One of the very positive things about this record is the presence of 2 covers songs:  Rockin in the free World and I don't like Mondays.  It was a real treat for me to hear these songs, and if it was a double of triple disc set, like I wished, they probably could have put a lot more coves on there as well.  All in all, this live album was a huge disappointment for me.  Greanted it had some cool cover songs, and some very good live renditions of our studio favorites, but it is too short, it doesn't cover the bands career as good as it should, and it lacks continuity.  Hopefully Bon Jovi puts out another live album that is MUCH better, because I know they can do a lot better!!
