 Around the second half of 1988, it was just 5 years after Quiet Riot was bursting onto the mainstream with their hit record called METAL HEALTH.  This album, however, was destined to be a disaster before it was ever recorded.  Former frontman, Kevin DuBrow was insulting his peers and his  record company, etc, the people there to help them.  The public and music  industy hated him unanimously, which helped make their next records  commercial disasters.  In 1987, Quiet Riot, clinging onto the little glory  they still had, dumped DuBrow in favor of former Rough Cutt vocalist Paul  Shortino, and they also brough Sean McNabb to play bass (who is currently  in Great White) and Jimmy Waldo (formerly of Alcatraz) on keyboards.  The  result is a very different, very good, new Quiet Riot.  These eleven songs  are an incredible collection.  The guitars on songs like Stay With Me  Tonight, Coppin a Feel, King of the Hill, Callin the Shots are a lot  darker, and the bad screaming of Kevin Dubrow is replaced with the full,  bluesy vocals of Paul Shortino.  Quiet Riot had everything going for them,  except for the fact that they were Quiet Riot.  I feel that if the name of  the band was some name other than Quiet Riot, this album would have sold a  lot better.  Which is sad because Paul Shortino is one of the most  underrated hard rock vocalists of all time.
