 This is Maiden's second album without Adrian, and their struggle continues.  Although a lot better than "No Prayer for the Dying", the cracks in Iron Maiden's armor are showing.  There are some great songs on here like "Be Quick or Be Dead" "Fear of the Dark" and "Afraid to Shoot Strangers" but there is a lot of filler here like "Fear is the Key" and "The Apparation".  Although this album was a disaster in the states, and an overall poor effort, this was nothing compared to they next two studio outputs.
