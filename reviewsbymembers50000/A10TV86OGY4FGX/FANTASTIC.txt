 If you are curious about the Ulich Roth era Scorpions, GET THIS COLLECTION.  This is about as economical as you can get.  You get to hear some of the BEST metal from the seventies.  The music on Fly to the Rainbow is some of the most creative music EVER.  It is hard to imagine that this album was put out in 1974.  The other 2 albums: In Trance and Virgin killer  are so amazing.  They go form melodic to intense so quickly you don't even  know what hit you!  I am still amazed to this day by the guitar playing of Ulrich Roth on these records.  If you were to get all those albums with ALL  the songs AND artwork AND lyrics, you would be spending a lot  after adding taxes, shipping, etc.  You get 3 incredible albums: Fly to the Rainbow, In Trance, and Virgin Killer for a great deal.  If you already have  these albums you shoudl get this as well.  The remastered versions sound REALLY great and you get lots of interesting photos, and the FULL lyrics to  the songs.  It also comes in a hardbound book!  In other words this is for  EVERYONE.  For this price you get 3 of the most underrated albums of all time.  Looking at the live photos makes me wish I would been able to see them live during this era.  However, I live in the USA and the Scorpions  never came here with Ulrich, and Ulrich left the band shortly before I was  born :(  If only they would have released a live video from this era, aside  from the taken By Force home video and the Tokyo Tapes double CD, all I  have is my imagination of what it could have been like.  In closing, metal  fans old and new should be satisfied with this release!
