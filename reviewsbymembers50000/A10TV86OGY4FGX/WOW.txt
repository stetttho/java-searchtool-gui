 I still remember the dat I got this record.  Until then the only Scorpions I was familier with were the big radio albums (lovedrive-crazy world).  Little did I know that this other side of the Scorpions existed.  I was so  amazed when I put the needly on the album and listened to the first few  bars of "Pictured Life".  I had no idea this dark side of the  Scorpions even existed.  I have been hooked on this album ever since.  I am  still so amazed how they had something like the title track and yellow  raven on the same album.  Although most people who are familier with the  scorpions have no idea the album exists, it does upset me, but then again,  it could be "our little secret".  And what a great secret it is!
