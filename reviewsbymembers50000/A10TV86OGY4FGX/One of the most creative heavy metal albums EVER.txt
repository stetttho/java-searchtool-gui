 This is probably one of my favorite metal album of all time.  For 1974, this album is so far ahead of its time.  Although the lyrics are not the greatest, it really doesn't matter because you have a MASTER guitar player  in Ulrich Roth.  I still remember the first time I listened to this record  I was so amazed by his work in songs like "They Need A Million"  "Fly People Fly" and the title track (which is ONLY available on  the Japan Import onf this album).  You can if you appreciate NWOBHM bands  and early 80s thrash metal, pick this album up and you will be in for a  REAL treat!
