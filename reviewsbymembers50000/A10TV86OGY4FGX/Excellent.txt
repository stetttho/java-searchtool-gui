 In 1979, after almost 15 years of hard work and establishing themselves in Japan and Europe, the Scorpions finally made a dent in America with their masterpiece entitled Lovedrive.  This half-hour of music, with the Schenker Brothers (Michael and Rulolph) and Matthais Jabs on guitar, shows you the many great sides of the Scorpions.  From the hard rocking "Lovedrive" and "Another Piece of Meat" to the great Instrumental "Coast to Coast" to the Arabian sounding "Is There Anybody There?" to the closing acoustic ballad "Holiday", the Scorpions show off all of their talents.  Twenty One years later, this album still pulls its weight.  Although it looks a little skimpy at just over 30 minutes, this was a time when a band put an album out every year, not once every 2 or 3 years.  Aside from the great music from start to finish, the influence this album has had on bands is irreplacable
