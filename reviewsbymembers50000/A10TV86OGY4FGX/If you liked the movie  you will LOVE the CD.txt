 If you enjoyed the movie, THE ARISTOCRATS, you will LOVE this CD.  It has lots of great parts from the movie, and even stuff that wasn't in the movie.  If you are a fan of very dirty, and gross humor, you will absolutely love this disc.  The "Family Dog" track is HILARIOUS.  As with the brilliant movie, the Gilbert Gottfried, Bob Saget, Sarah Silverman, and Otto & George bits are brilliant and memorable.  Although all of the bits have thier own charm, I especially like the "Amish" version.    If you enjoyed the movie, or just like dirty humor, you will LOVE this CD.
