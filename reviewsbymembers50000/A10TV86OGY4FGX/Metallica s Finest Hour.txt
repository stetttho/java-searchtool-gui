 This is hands down Metallica's finest album.  This album is great musically, lyrically, and it has put so much influence on future bands.  The opening acoustic guitar on "Battery" followed by the heavy pounding drums and the crunching guitars really set the tone for the album.  The slow middle part of "Master of Puppets" is so beautiful.  This album is also home of one of the finest metal instrumentals of all time in the form of "Orion".  Some of Metallica's heaviest riffs ever are on here in "The Thing that Should Not Be".  I really can't say enough great things about this masterpiece.  If you do not own this record yet, you need by click on ORDER and get it NOW!
