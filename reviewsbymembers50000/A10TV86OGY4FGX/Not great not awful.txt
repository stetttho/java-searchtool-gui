 In 1997, Metallica released RELOAD.  Most of the people have either said that it is a great album or a terrible album.  I disagree with both of these groups.  Yes, the band has changed their image, yes they have changed  their music, but NO BAND has ever stayed the same after recording for 14  years.  The only band that has done anything CLOSE is AC/DC, and although I  love them, they have gotten BORING and PREDICTABLE over the past few years.   Metallica did what they HAD to do.  However, I don't think they should  have put the songs on LOAD and RELOAD across 2 albums.  If they would have  put the best songs on one album, it would have been a decent album.  There are some good songs on this record.  Fuel, Memory Remains (although it  took me time to get used to it) Unforgiven II, and Prince Charming.   However there are many songs that make Metallica sounding tired like  "Better than You" "Bad Seed" "Low Man's  Lyric".  Despite some of the boring filler, there are still some decent songs on this album, and it might be worth picking up.
