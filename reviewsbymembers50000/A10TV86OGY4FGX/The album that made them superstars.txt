 Metallica, also known as "The Black Album" was the album that catapulted Metallica to rock superstardom.  Five of the 12 tracks are radio staple STILL after 9 years of its release:  Enter Sandman, Sad But True,  Unforgiven, Wherever I May Roam, and Nothing Else Matters.  Although many  people cried "sellout" when this album came out, but I feel they  are wrong, VERY wrong.  Although this album did sell like 12 million (or  whatever it is) copies, the songs here are agressive, heavy, and GREAT.   This album, in fact sounds heavier to me than Justice.  I do feel that this  was Metallica's last great record.  Many people have started to even hate  their earlier albums due to their output in the ninties.  I find that  uphauling.  You may not like their newer stuff, but their older stuff is  still the same stuff it was in the 80s.  This album is truely an album for  everyone.  If you have not gotten into Metallica yet, get this album.  If  you like their slower melodic and poppier songs, get LOAD and RELOAD.  If  you like their hard edged aggressive songs, go for Master of Puppets and  Ride the Lightning.
