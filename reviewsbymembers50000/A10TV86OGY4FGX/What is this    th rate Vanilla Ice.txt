 I have Kid Rock's album DEVIL WITHOUT A CAUSE and it rocks.  I bought this CD and I almost puked.  This album is complete crap.   I have over 1500 CDs in my collection.  Among the 1500 I have, there are some pretty bad CDs,  but NONE of them are as bad as this CD.  Don't bother getting this album.   If you have DEVIL WITHOUT A CAUSE, you don't need anything else.  My  review, to parody Spinal Tap:  SH*T SANDWICHES FOR BREAKFAST.
