 Very impressed with Nero 7.  I do a LOT of DVD burning, and the dvd burning software with 7, has been a LOT better, and a lot less burning errors, especially when converting between NTSC and PAL video formats.  I have been using Nero since 4, and I am always impressed with what it has been able to do. Nero 7 is well worth the price!!!
