 An interesting ride through the ups and downs of the Cuban sports machine and the system that it serves.  In the process of capturing the essence and success of Cuba's sports mania, Price also opens ours eyes to the failure that is the Cuban Revolution.  The book is a travelogue of Price's various visits to the island throughout the 1990's, terminating with his final visit in December 1998.  As a sports writer, he focuses on the Cuban sports program via numerous encounters with Cuba's premier athletes throughout the island.  Price does a wonderful job of capturing his adventures, taking the reader on a site, sound, and smell-filled roller-coaster ride through the at times joyful, but predominately painful reality that is Cuban society.  Via sports, we see a system that breeds humans for ultimate political gain, then punishes or discards them when they show independence or a desire to improve their lives.  The book is probably a couple of chapters longer than it needed to be.  However, whether intentional or not, it graphically relates the tortured and diffuclt lives of the average Cuban.  Read this book to better understand Cuban sports, but more importantly, to better grasp today's Cuba in the words and lives of its citizens.
