 A pretty good synopsis of what's hampered our intelligence services, but a bit too harsh when passing blame.  There's no doubt that our intelligence capabilities were proven to be in need of repair after the failures of 9/11 and the Iraq War.  Gertz examines those failures, plus others, and lays the blame where he sees fit.  He has excellent chapters on the organizational cultures of such intelligence agencies as DIA, CIA, NSA, and the FBI.  I believe he has correctly captured the internal dynamics of those agencies, the arrogance, rigidity, disagreements, and even agenda-based analysis that defeats production of good assessments for the policy-makers.  However, I felt he was unfairly critical when attacking people like ex-CIA Chief George Tenet.  He's ultimately responsible for the failures, but it doesn't mean they were of his making.    Gertz should know that intelligence analysis is an art, not a science, no matter what politicians or societal pundits want to believe.  (To better understand this argument, I'd recommend readers look at the book by John Hughes-Wilson, "Military Intelligence Blunders")  I sense Gertz' severe critique of Tenet is colored by the latter's service for, and under, Democratic politicians.  Nevertheless, the author is right-on when he disassembles the various agencies, and more importantly, when he details how Congressional Democrats, especially in the 1970s, systematically destroyed our ability to collect intelligence.  He also does a fine job of laying out the Presidential Administrations responsible for undermining our intelligence community.   In the end, Gertz offers some well though-out recommendations for improving intelligence capabilities.  This is a revealing book, which should be read by those interested in better understanding the political and military challenges in the War on Terror.
