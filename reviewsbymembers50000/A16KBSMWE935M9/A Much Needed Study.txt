 A concise, but comprehensive look at anti-Castro resistance by Cubans inside and outside the island from 1959 to the present.  Encinosa tells an important story that is rarely known outside of the Cuban exile community, as such it is an invaluable study for serious Cuba watchers.   Of special interest, from a military history perspective, was the chapter on the mid-60's anti-Castro guerilla campaign centered in the Escambray mountains of central Cuba.  This story is virtually unknown to the outside world, yet captures the courage and defiance to Communist rule, while detailing the uncompromising and brutal tactics Castro used in putting it down.  I only wish that a more detailed examination of the Escambray campaign could someday be published.  The book flows easily through the various decades, using numerous first-hand accounts of the bravery of those who resisted and the savagery of those who repressed them.  Readers will also realize that many of those who took up arms against Castro, had previously supported him.  Encinosa also details little known facts about Cuban domestic opposition to their overseas wars.  Lastly, a discussion on resistance in the last decade brings to light the viciousness of the Castro regime, best captured in the comments of an individual who tried to set up an 'independent library'. This book is a great eye-opener that reveals the regime for what it is - repressive and unpopular.  Very necessary in light of the constant, and effective propaganda that comes from the island as it tries to influence the more gullible and economic minded sectors of the US.  A relevant read given today's developing events.
