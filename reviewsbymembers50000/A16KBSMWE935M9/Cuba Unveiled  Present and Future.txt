 A superb examination of what makes Cuba tick today and what may be the driving force in the future.  This is an incisive, focused analysis of Fidel Castro and his anointed successor, his brother Raul.  To understand revolutionary Cuba you must understand Fidel Castro, and Latell does an excellent job of "cutting to the chase" when exploring what drives the Cuban dictator, and therefore, why Cuba has acted, or will act, in any given way/situation.  Additionally, the book, more than any other I've read, goes on to explore the limited historical information and possible mindset of Raul Castro, therefore taking a peek at what a post-Fidel Cuba may do.  Latell's own background as a longtime CIA Cuba analyst enriches the story he is telling.  Through his own personal experiences you'll understand why Fidel Castro has managed to outlast nine American Presidents as he relates the thinking that permeates much of the US intelligence and policy-making community.  His insiders view and wide range of contacts have allowed him to provide insights of Fidel and Raul that have rarely, if ever been explored or discussed by other writers.  His assessments are solid, mostly because he's come to understand the culture and idiosyncracies that drive events on the island.  This is a timely and must-read book for those interested in Cuba.  But it's also an easy, interesting, informative, and fun read for anyone who enjoys history or current events.  It was hard to put down once I started, and I believe everyone who reads it will feel the same.
