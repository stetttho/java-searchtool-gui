 It's well written and engrossing at times, but poorly focused.  It's strictly a senior level view of the 101st Division's action in the war, the grunt level view is totally absent.  In fact, a recently returned veteran who served with the Division during the invasion told me that Atkinson's book was referred to as the "Ode to Petraeus" by many in the 101st. Atkinson also wastes half the book writing about the deployment preparations in the US and the pre-invasion activities in Kuwait - not very interesting except for the details surrounding the killing of fellow soldiers by a disgruntled Muslim member of the unit.  Atkinson further ruins the book by occasionally making shallow and crass comments against the administration and it's rational for war.  However, once you get past the negatives, and accept the high level view/analysis contained in the book, it can be informative as you read the comments and military judgements of senior officers. Atkinson also provides some interesting, although limited, observations of Iraqi culture as the 101st plows its way to Baghdad.   The problem is that Atkinson fails to capture the soldier level view of the conflict, but can't fully articulate the strategic level. I felt he could have better honored such a renowned fighting unit.  Nonetheless, if you're a current or former Screaming Eagle you might find it enjoying.
