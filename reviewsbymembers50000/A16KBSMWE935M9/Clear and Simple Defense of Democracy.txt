 No intellectualizing here, just a simple, clear argument for the power of freedom, via democracy, to change our world for the better.  Sharansky's personal experience as a political prisoner in the Soviet Union adds tremendous strength and respectability to his argument.  He does a superb job of articulating the differences between "free" and "fear" societies and why we need to be reminded of those differences as we fight the War on Terror.  In the process, he concisely, but accurately captures the internal weaknesses that threaten to destroy "free" societies as they encounter unprincipled, committed adversaries.  The discussion is oftentimes viewed through the struggles of the Cold War, as well as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  This is a refreshingly unsophisticated yet powerful analysis of how a commitment to freedom can change the direction of world events, providing the peace and security we all seek. A necessary read for our times.
