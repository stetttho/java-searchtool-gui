 An insider's fascinating and engrossing look at the machinations of Fidel Castro's Communist regime.  In what amounts to a stimulating autobiography of an Argentinian who grew up in Castro's Revolution, Masetti weaves his life's story by revealing astonishing facts concerning Cuba's aggressive attempts at undermining both the US and Latin America.  The son of an Argentinian revolutionary who supported Fidel's guerilla movement, Masetti describes his loyal commitment to Castro's worldview, only to be dissilutioned by the brutal betrayal of his father-in-law.  Readers will learn of Cuba's support for anti-US terrorist organizations and their attacks on US soil.  You'll also learn how Fidel Castro successfully supported/advised triumphant Marxist groups.  Yet, the most powerful message is left for last, as Masetti undergoes a painful awakening to Castro's brutality, coupled with a deeply moving self-examination about his blind support for an inhumane system.    This is a great read.  An eye-opener that peels back the thick layer of lies that protects Fidel Castro and his broken Revolution.  Important information for Cuba watchers, and an exciting, intriguing real life story for those who want to be entertained - a superb mix.
