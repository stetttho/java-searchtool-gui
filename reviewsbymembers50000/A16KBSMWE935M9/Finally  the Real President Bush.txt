 A great piece of work.  Quick to read, and simple in it's approach, Kessler manages to dispel all the distortions created by the Bush-haters.  Appropriate that it should come from someone who voted against Bush in 2000.  What Kessler captures is the true character and personality of the President - a very sincere, downhome, positive, focused, intelligent, and compassionate human being who has mastered successful leadership techniques. Through the words of those who know him, to include liberal Democrats, we see what the man is truly about, instead of the horrific caricature painted by his political enemies.  The book also touches on key issues in the Bush administration, doing so by placing them in proper perspective, and without the twisting of facts that is the favorite tool of his opponents. You finally see the true measure of the man, allowing the reader to strip away the lies and judge the President based solely on  philosophical views of policy issues.  Those who trash the book are blindly partisan and unable to fairly judge the man for what he truly is and what he believes in.  The book is not only informative and interesting, but entertaining to read as Kessler captures what George W. Bush is all about.  A must read!
