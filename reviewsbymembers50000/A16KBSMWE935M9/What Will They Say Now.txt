 What an incredibly revealing and fun read!  Fontova has really hit the mark with this "no holds barred" assault on the Castro mystique and the gang of American "useful idiots" who support Fidel and his murderous regime.  The book magnificently lays out the facts that prove how hypocritical, culpable, cowardly, unprincipled, biased, and in many cases, just flat out ignorant are the individuals who sing Fidel's praise.  Presidents, Congressmen, Hollywood-types, writers, media, academics, and others who mainly identify themselves with the liberal/left are revealed as having a "furious ignorance" when it comes to Cuba.  The quote comes from one of many Cuban exiles, Guillermo Cabrera in this case, who have lived and suffered through 47 years of revolutionary reality.    Fontova takes an "in your face" approach as he castigates the Cuban regime and those responsible for either naively or purposefully spreading Fidel's propaganda.  In the process, he entertains with his funny, down-to-earth writing style that makes you laugh and cry as you read the stories that have been buried by the mainstream media.  The book is hard to put down once you start. I gave it four stars only because of some factual errors and typos.  However, the story he tells, and the way he tells it, has been long overdue, and Fontova has produced a gem in doing so.  This is a powerful, yet easy read that will finally, in one fell swoop, blow away the lies, and those who propagate them, that have been spread about Fidel Castro's liberally-annointed "happy island."
