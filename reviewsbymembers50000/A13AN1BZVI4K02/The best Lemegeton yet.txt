 Recently (since 1995) we've had a surge of interest in Solomonic magick and several versions of the Goetia, and even the complete Lemegeton, have become available. Finally we have a definitive edition carefully compiled, annotated and commented upon in a scholarly fashion. It is also handsomely published in hard covers and (at the present reduced price) quite a bargain. Unlike most backyard Goetias and Lemegetons, Peterson does not rely solely on Sloane MS. 2731 but chooses the more complete Harley MS. 6483 as his base text with comparative notes referencing other MSS. He also traces the origins of all the five books in his concise but highly detailed introduction. Several points that Peterson's augmentations from other manuscripts bring forth are of considerable interest--especially to those of us working Solomonic systems. I was happy to see the circle in the center of the Triangle of Art "blacked in" in two other versions of the Goetia besides Sloane 2731, lending more confirmation to our dark mirror theory. I was also happily surprised to discover that Harley MS. 6438 used the Shemehamphorash invocations on the back of their Brass Vessel sigils just as we decided to do (before we were aware of the precedent) in our practice (see *The Book of Solomon's Magick*). Peterson also cites and presents the Almadel type drawing from *Sepher Schelomoh* (that we also displayed) and a similar sketch from a newly acquired (at the Brit. Lib.) Hebrew version of the Almadel. All considered Peterson's *The Lesser Key of Solomon* is probably the best reference Lemegeton we will see for many years to come. But in order to work the system you still need to consult the practical manuals by Steve Savedow, Lon Milo DuQuette and Poke Runyon.
