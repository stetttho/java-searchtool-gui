 Even though Steve took a swipe at me on the back cover (which he later apologized for) I really like his book and I think it has to be read by anyone who is serious about doing this work, or even understanding it--because Steve Savedow really did it. Sure, he did it "the hard way" (medieval free-form style)and he did it on a Jewish Klippothic model whereas the traditional Goetia spirits inhabit a Christian Dantesque Tartarus. We in the O.T.A. put them all in Yesod and do them in a dark mirror (see TBOSM). Regardless of such quibbles, Steve Savedow and more recently Joseph Lisiewski (Ceremonial Magic and the Power of Evocation)are serious and dedicated practitioners who prove that spirit evocation is neither a hoax or an irrational delusion. However subjective it may be (and no serious operator will claim it is not subjective), it is one of the most remarkable and challenging adventures an intrepid explorer of the unknown can experience. I give Steve's book five stars for reaching the summit(or the depths)--even though he took the most dangerous and difficult route.  Poke Runyon, Author: The Book of Solomon's Magick
