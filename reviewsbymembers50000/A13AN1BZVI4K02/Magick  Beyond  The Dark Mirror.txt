 The O.T.A.'s two previous productions: The Magick of Solomon and Dark Mirror of Magick ( both still available in up-dated, extended and enhanced "Second Editions" on DVD ) might be considered as "the dark side" of  magick. They both featured the evocation of spirits in a dark mirror by hypnotic conjuration and the distortion of facial reflection. Although not evil or even amoral, these two previous video documentaries were gothic in mood and tone. To uninformed and spiritually conservative viewers they may have seemed sinister.  In The Rites of Magick the producers have shown us a broader view of the magical process; one might say: The Magical Universe, because it is another world that magicians create with the power of their imaginations. This production takes us to the secluded estate where the O.T.A. conducts its training and rituals.  We are introduced to their yoga system, their astral journeying technique, their ancient seasonal rites, their own version of the Holy Grail "Mass of the Elements," and a remarkable Enochian ritual based on the Elizabethan system of Dr. John Dee. As "bonus feature" we are treated to an artistic fantasy about "the perils of alchemical experimentation."  Some viewers may find the employment of "Grail" and "Eucharist" symbolism in non-Christian rituals to be disturbing even though the narrator explains their pagan origins, but with this one criticism accepted, this is otherwise an excellently produced, informative and inspiring production.
