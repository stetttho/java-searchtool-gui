 If the Crowley-Harris Tarot hadn't become so popular with the uninitiated this book by Maestro DuQuette might not have been so necessary--but it did, and so it is! I had the same experience with Crowley's Book of Thoth (his book about this deck) that Lon had when first reading it in 1969 (or attempting to read it)Ugh! Where do I go to learn all this stuff? The Golden Dawn, of course. That's where Crowley learned it. So, if the average Joe/Jane wants to understand, much less use this deck and Crowley's book on it he/she needs to read five or six other books...But not anymore. Lon has condensed, polished and made understandable the esoteric essentials that apply to the Thoth Tarot. He even explains the Star-Emperor switch (whether you like it or not) and he gives us background on Lady Harris' role as the artist that I found fascinating. DuQuette's easy writing style and sparkling humor are both delightful and make the book a joy to read. One thing he does not do is provide a "quickie" divination system (Crowley didn't either) but you'll get that in the little booklet that comes with the deck, so no loss there. All-in-all Lon's book fills a definate need. He opens the Thoth Tarot to those who are drawn to it but don't know a Theoricus from an Enochian. Reviewed by Poke Runyon Editor - The Seventh Ray
