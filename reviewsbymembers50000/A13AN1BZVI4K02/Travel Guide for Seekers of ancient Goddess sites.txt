 Sacred Places of Goddess by Karen Tate  This book is not the usual popular archaeology offering on the subject. It is a combination of that and a travel guide as well---so you not only learn the historic and mythological background on the various ancient sites, but are supplied with current information on how to get there. The coverage is impressive. Karen even briefly mentions the ruined shrine of Astarte at Aphaca in Lebanon which is the ancient source of the pre-Christian (Canaanite) Holy Grail legend according to anthropologist Jesse Weston (From Ritual to Romance). This beautiful natural site, where hundreds of Goddess worshipers were massacred by emperor Constantine's soldiers in the  4th century, is still venerated by local Pagans but has been almost completely forgotten by the Neo-Pagans of America and Europe.       Hopefully Karen's book will go through several updates as time goes by and thus it will continue to be carried along on sacred grad tours for years to come.
