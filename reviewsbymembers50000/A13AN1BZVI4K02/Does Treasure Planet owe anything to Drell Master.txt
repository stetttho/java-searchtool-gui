 Several readers of *Drell Master* (by Poke Runyon from Maelstrom Press, copyright 2001 by the author/illustrator) have expressed the opinion that Disney's latest animated effort *Treasure Planet* owes as much to *Drell Master* as it admittedly owes to Robert Louis Stevenson's *Treasure Island.* This prompted me to actually go out and see the film myself (I usually avoid Disney's animated stuff). I came out of the theater wondering if the people at Disney had seen my book,but realizing that they could have derived their similar mix of ideas and combination of anachronisms as a result of combining *Treasure Island* with *Star Wars.*      Some of these anachronistic combinations are remakably similar: the aerial sailing ships and boats, the docks projecting out into empty space, the giant floating whale-like creature does remind us of the Mother Drell, but it's an aerial whale, not an aerial squid (from "Monstro" in *Pinocchio* probably...)  As for floating islands, Disney opted for a crescent moon out on the fringes of space --which really was a crescent--not my zeer-globe buoyed orbiting archipelagos in the stratosphere of Thoon. Regardless of that, compare the full page illustration of Skyport Jhalimar on page 227 of *Drell Master* to the Crescent Moon spaceport in *Treasure Planet.* They are similar but not enough to suggest a connection.       As for Long John Silver's cyborg eye---well, eye-implants are not anything I can lay claim to. In *Drell Master* Rothgar's fire-crystal eye is used to hypnotically dominate his underlings, whereas Silver's eye is a laser range-finder--besides that, my sky-pirate Captain Gorn--gruff and lovable as he may be---has all his parts, whereas Rothgar my warlock-warlord has "The Eye," so we don't really have a direct match there, but  it is another similar theme, and similar characterization (Gorn=Silver---but did I base Gorn on Stevenson's John Silver? Not really. I based him on a friend of mine who founded the first pirate reenactment group "The Brethren of the Coast.")     I should point out that Disney's flying galleons have ion-sails and pulse-drives whereas my stratospheric barques and schooners are actual aerial sailing ships buoyed by the ubiquitous zeer globes that hold up the floating islands of Thoon.     Also both stories have an ancient underground industrial complex---but Disney just throws this in as an escape tunnel, whereas in *Drell Master* this cavern civilization is a major venue. . .    All-in-all the similarities are striking. Perhaps I'm too close to my story to be the best judge, but it seems to me that the folks at Disney could have cooked up *Treasure Planet*  without drawing on *Drell Master.*      And BTW, I enjoyed the film. I might add that *Drell Master* could be described as an "R-rated" Treasure Planet for adults. Poke Runyon, author Drell Master
