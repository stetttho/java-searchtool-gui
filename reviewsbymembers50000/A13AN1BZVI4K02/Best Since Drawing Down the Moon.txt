 Reviewed by Poke Runyon This book is large (8.5x11"), heavy, thick (670 pages), black and intimidating. The dust jacket screams "Witches" in inch-and-half high type garnished with a flaming red pentagram; just the thing to leave on your coffee table when your Christian maiden aunt pays a call (obviously shock value is part of the publisher's marketing strategy). However, if we can get past the book's appearance and take an unbiased look at the contents we will find a treasure trove of modern Pagan, Wiccan, and Magical history going back forty years (and in some instances brought up to date). Professor Holzer might be called the Herodotus of modern witchcraft. He reports on what he has observed first-hand, and gleaned from interviews, among the several personalities and groups he has visited over a period spanning four decades; and all this graphically documented by nearly a hundred photographs. He writes for the general reader, avoiding academic technicalities. His viewpoint is empathetic, in pleasant contrast to the expose journalism so often associated with this subject matter. He does not attempt to write a comprehensive history of the modern Pagan/Magical revival--but, when such a history is written, Holzer's contributions will figure prominently in its corpus.
