 This movie was really great. At first when I saw the storyline of the movie I thought it was going to be another Parent Trap movie, but it was totally different. The story is this. It's about 2 girls one a super model and the other a typical high school girl who are complete strangers to one another, and then they bump into each other at a party. Both of the girls are tired with their own lives and so they decide to switch places. At first it seems like a good idea and things are going as planned, but soon everything goes wrong and the whole twin switch thing is a complete disaster. In the end the two girls reveal to their family and friends about their switch when they bump into each other at the dance and soon their lives and problems are mended and everyone lives happily ever after. This movie was a fun and heartfelt movie. Kathie Lee Gifford does a superb job as the overprotective and overbearing mother of her supermodel daughter. Justin Timberlake is not only hot as the supermodel Jason Sharp, but he can really act. He is wonderful! I love this movie! If you love movies like the Parent Trap and Freaky Friday then you will love this movie.
