 When I was about 14 or 15 years old I used to think that the Spice Girls were a cool girl group, but now almost of the age of 21 I realize just how unoriginal and untalented the girls of this group are, well except for Melanie Chisolm. Although I enjoyed one or two of the songs on this album that are the sultry and slow song Too Much and the funky and upbeat song Saturday Night Divas the rest of the songs on the album don't make up for it. The only reason I believe that the Spice Girls are popular is because they are in phenomenal shape and are beautiful. They cannot sing if their lives depended on it. Personally I think that Melanie C could do so much better on her own without these untalented women.I don't know what is so special about the Spice Girls. I wouldn't be surprised that in 2 or 3 years from now the Spice Girls will be no more and I think that would do the music world a lot of good.
