 From beginning to the end of the movie Nia Vardalos' character brings a certain innocence and down to earth type of attitude that many female characters are lacking in Hollywood films nowadays. Her character is so intelligent and sweet it is hard not to fall in love with her. John Corbet is equally brilliant as Nia's boyfriend Ian, he is so funny and endearing you will fall in love with him as well. Seeing all these crazy and eccentric cousins, grandmothers, uncles, aunts, grandfathers, reminds me of my family, I may not be Greek but I am Italian and us Greeks and Italians have three things in common: we're both loud, we both have strong religious beliefs and we both love food. This movie depicting Ian trying desperately not only to fit in, but to get Taula's family to accept him will make you laugh and cry the whole way through. There are so many hilarious scenes I can't list them all there is too many. Watch it for yourself, you won't be sorry.
