 The way they are seperated from the other boy bands of pop: they don't dance, they play all their own instruments, they write practically all of their songs and they can harmonize so beautifully. Their songs are all original and every song is as great as the last.Not to mention these guys are so incredibly fine. They are such excellent stage performers. They really know how to work a crowd. Wether it's the upbeat song Back Here or the slow and mysterious song The Ghost of You and Me this album does not have one bad song on it. I have to say that I am proud to call myself a BBMAK fan and there is no doubt in my mind that 50 years from now these guys as Doug from the group 2gether says,"We will still be getting chicks and making hits." Oh how true it is.
