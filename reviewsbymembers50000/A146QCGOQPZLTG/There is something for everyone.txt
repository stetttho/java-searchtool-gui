 This cd set is without a doubt the best collection of holiday songs ever. I say that for two reasons: one it has just about every christmas song you can think of and two it contains songs sung by artists from not just the 50's and 60's but from the 90's as well. So if you are a person who doesn't prefer classic artists such as Bing Crosby, Johnny Mathis or Karen Carpenter then you can always listen to songs by contemporary artists such as Joe, Britney Spears, Nsync and Boys II Men. This cd set covers every christmas song such as White Christmas, The Christmas Song, Silent Night...... This is a set that you definitely must add to your christmas cd collection. These christmas songs are definitely a good cup of holiday cheer.
