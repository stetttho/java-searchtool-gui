 Stephen King really outdid himself with this movie. This is by far his best movie to date. The special effects and makeup are just amazing in this movie. The acting is wonderful, there are some great performances by Nancy Travis as Dr Joyce Reardon, Matt Ross as Emery Waterman, Melanie Lynskey as Rachael "Sister" Wheaton, Kimberly J. Brown as Annie Wheaton, Matt Keesler as Steven Rimbauer, David Dukes as Professor Miller, Julian Sands as Nick Hardaway, Kevin Tighe as Victor Kandinsky, Judith Ivey as Cathy Kramer, Emily Daschanel as Pam Asbury. The acting was very believable and well done. Julia Campbell did a great job in her performance as Ellen Rimbauer, a big change from her role in Romy and Michele's High School Reunion, and Tsidii Leloka was amazing as Ellen's servant and companion Sukeena. Laura Kenny played to perfection the role of Kay Waterman, Emery's overprotective and partially insane mother. The movie is pretty much like any haunted house movie, some guests come into haunted house and are paid to stay there. When they arrive one by one the guests began to disappear until in the end only a few lucky ones escape. The story may be formulatic and even predictable but with this movie it proves be an okay thing. Rose Red is definitely a chilling haunted house movie that you should add to your scary movies collection.
