 I was very impressed with this movie when I first saw it. The acting I have to say was superb and the humor was original and witty. Tim Curry's performance as Wadsworth the butler was absolutely played to perfection. It is also though one of those movies where you need to watch it very closely to figure out who killed who, it really makes you think. In the end you're not really sure who was the real murderer, this is a great comedy/murder mystery to add to your video collection. It is defintely more fun and more humorous than the board game.
