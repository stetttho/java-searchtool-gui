 This doll is wonderful. I am 20 years old and I thought that I grew out of the whole doll phase, but being a true Nsync fan I couldn't help buying this doll. It looks so much like Joey from his hair color, goatee and earring right down to his shoes and clothing, even his facial features. I absolutely love it. Joey is my fave Nsync guy and I know this is going to sound super corny but every time I wake up and look at this doll, it's like Joey is really there looking at me. I love you baby!
