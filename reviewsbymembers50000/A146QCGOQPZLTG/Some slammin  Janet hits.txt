 This album is amazing. It is a great combination of Janet's hits. Janet is an amazing artist and I love the songs that she picked for this album. From the sultry and sensual song Twenty Foreplay to the upbeat and romantic song When I Think of You all the songs are absolute perfection. There are other great songs like Rythym Nation, Runaway and That's the Way Love Goes. If you are a diehard Janet Jackson fan then this album is for you. Go out and get it now. Janet Jackson is an amazing singer, dancer, songwriter and a true diva.
