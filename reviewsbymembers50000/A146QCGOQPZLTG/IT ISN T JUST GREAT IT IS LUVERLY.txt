 My Fair Lady is a timeless classic and it is probably one of my favorite musicals. I love absolutely everything about it: the songs, the acting, the exsquisite costumes, beautiful sets, the delightful humor and the brilliant acting. This movie defines what great musicals are all about. Audrey Hepburn, what can I say. She played the role of the coarse and unrefined flower girl Eliza Dolittle to absolute perfection. The way she played the role was so convincing and the way she could grasp that cockney accent was sheer brilliance. Rex Harrison as the role of the bitter and sexist pig Professor Higgins, was amazing. I must say that not only is he sexy but his acting proved to be nothing more than perfect. Rex and Audrey make a terrific team in this movie, they really shine. My Fair Lady how sweet it is!
