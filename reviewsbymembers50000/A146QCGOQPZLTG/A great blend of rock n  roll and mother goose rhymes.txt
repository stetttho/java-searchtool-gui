 The first time I ever saw this movie was on the Disney channel when I was about 11 or 12 years old and ever since then I have been in love with it and all the endearing even sometimes annoying rhymeland characters. The story is basically simple Mother Goose played so delightfully by Jean Stapleton has suddenly disappeared from rhymeland and it is up to her uptight son played to perfection by Dan Gilroy and Little Bo Peep played Shelly Duvall who was made for the part to find her and bring her back before everyone in rhymeland disappears and mother gooses's rhymes become nothing but a mere illusion. It shows all the hilarious struggles and complications Bo Peep and Gordon have to go through to find her and all the crazy characters they meet on the way. The sets are bright, colorful, and very creative as are the costumes and makeup and while the special effects are not very realisitic and corny the great script and amazing humor make up for it. This movie just about has any star in the movie and music business you can think of including Woody Harrelson as the lamb from Mary had a little lamb, Little Richard as the party loving Old King Cole, Ben Vereen as Itsy Bitsy Spider, and the musical trio ZZ Top as The Three Men in the Tub which was pure genius putting them in that role. This movie is amazing and although it may seem corny and even childish at times it still proves to be funny, endearing and magical and I promise if you watch it, it will make you feel like a kid again.
