 What a deliciously funny parody of the Frankenstein movies, it left me in stitches. What a incredible imagination and sense of humor Mel Brooks has, he really outdid himself with this movie. Peter Boyle really surprised me with his performance as the monster, his performance was very believable and perfect in every way. Gene Wilder as the young doctor Frederick Frankenstein was hilarious, charming, witty and original, he fit the part so well. Marty Feldman as the hunchback Igor was hilarious in every sense, I could not stop laughing whenever he was in a scene. It has a lot of adult humor in it, so I would not really recommend it to younger children, but other than that this great blend of humor, comedy and romance is one to be treasured and watched again and again for years to come. Another great thing about this movie is that they used the original Frankenstein set, I loved that.Another great thing about the movie is that it had so many memorable lines such as: Inga: Hello, would you like to have a roll in the hay? It's fun, roll, roll, roll in ze hay. Frederick: Hearts and kidneys are tinker toys! Frederick: Damn your eyes! Igor: Too late. Frau Blucher: Yes, yes say it, he was my boyfriend Frederick: You must be be Igor Igor: No it's pronounced I-gor Frederick: But they said it was Igor Igor:(mockingly) Well they were wrong then weren't they Frederick: Well dear are you ready? Inga: I think so doctor. Frederick: Elevate me Inga: What, now right here? Frederick: Yes raise the platform Inga: Oh za platform, ja yes!
