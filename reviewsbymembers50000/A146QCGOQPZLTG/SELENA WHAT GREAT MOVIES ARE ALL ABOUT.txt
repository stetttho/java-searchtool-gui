 The movie Selena is probably one of the best movies of this century. It so well captured the life of Selena down to a fine art. Everything from her childhood,life on the road, performing on stage with her band, all the way to her tragic death. This movie really moved me so much. It made me both laugh and cry. Jennifer Lopez portrayed the role of Selena so well no one could have done it better. For that movie she turned into Selena and she was amazing. Selena was an amazing singer, dancer and had a wonderful attitude on life and it was wonderful that her life was shared with the world in this movie.
