 This movie was a movie that I so much enjoyed watching as a child and still do. Faruiza Balk did an amazing job as Dorothy Gale in her first movie ever. This movie had everything:great villains, beautiful scenery, great acting, laughter, chills, suspense, tears. At first when I saw that this movie was a continuation of The Wizard of Oz, I thought "Oh great a sequel, it probably won't be good at all" I thought that with many sequels they can't really live up to the first movie, but I was proved wrong. Return to Oz is amazing in every way. The villains such as the evil Princess Mombie was played to perfection by Jean Smart. Her acting was amazing, and even to this day she still gives me chills when I see her in this movie. The wheelers probably scared me the most and still do, just hearing their wheels squeak and their evil laughter frightens me, and the Gnome King is another great villain. It was nice to see some of the old Wizard of Oz characters return such as Scarecrow, the Tin Man and The Cowardly Lion and see new ones like Tik Tok, the Gump, Jack Pumpkinhead and Dorothy's companion in this movie Billina instead of Toto. If you loved Wizard of Oz then you will absolutely love this movie. Don't spend your money on some cheap, bloody slasher flick. Spend it on something worthwhile. Return to Oz is what great movie sequels are all about.
