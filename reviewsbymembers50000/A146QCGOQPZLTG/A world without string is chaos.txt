 Mouse Hunt is definitely a comedy to watch and while the concept about two men trying to rid their house of a pesky mouse might seem silly, after watching it you will find yourself laughing. Ernie Schmuntz played by Nathan Lane and Lars Schmuntz played by Lee Evans are brothers who after the death of their father inherit an ancient house from him. After finding out from the historical society that the house is an ancient goldmine they start to renovate the house in order for it to be ready for the auction to be sold. In the process Ernie and Lars and trying everything in their power to get rid of this pest from adopting a ferocious cat named Katzilla to hunt down and eat the mouse, to hiring a very eccentric exterminator named Caeser wonderfully played by Christopher Walken. This movie has a lot of slapstick comedy, great acting, and a mouse that just steals the show.
