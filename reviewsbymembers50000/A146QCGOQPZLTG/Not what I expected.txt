 This album is so different from Mandy's first album. She has really matured from a young girl to a young lady. Her songs used a lot of mideastern, spanish and rock infused beats and it really works with the pop music. What I like most about the album is it is not pure pop music, it experiments with different beats and while it may not work with some artists music, with Miss Mandy Moore it is pure magic. Mandy Moore fans you will not be disappointed. This album is a must buy.
