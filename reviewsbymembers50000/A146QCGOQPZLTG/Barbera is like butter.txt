 This is one of Barbera Streisand's best movies. She is absolutely perfect for the role as Dolly Levi. She just shines in this movie:her acting is amazing, her singing just takes my breath away and she is just gorgeous."Hello gorgeous!" I love musicals because I have been in musicals my whole life and musicals just amaze me as did this movie. The costumes and sets were gorgeous,the dance numbers were done to perfection, the singing and harmonies blended so well together and besides romance it had humor. Walter Matthau was made for the role of Horace Vandergelder, no one could have done it better. He is an amazing actor and although he can't sing that great his superb acting and delightfully sarcastic humor makes up for it. Michael Crawford as Cornelius Hackel is so hilarious and amazingly adorable. His character is so lovable and the movie would not be funny without him.Hello Dolly is not just a movie for adults but for all ages and I love it so much that even after watching it over and over I never get tired of it. Hello Dolly is a classic movie and is one that should be cherished for many years and even centuries to come.
