 Bruce Willis stars as Malcom Crowe a very well known and accomplished child psychologist who has everything: a beautiful wife and a amazing career, but a visit from a disturbed patient of Malcom when he was a child makes Malcom realize that although he was able to help so many people there were a few like this patient that he could not reach. Then with one pull of the trigger Malcom's patient kills him and then kills himself. Then Malcom returns to earth and there he meets a special boy named Cole Sears played so intelligently by Haley Joel Osmont who has a special power, he can see dead people. Malcom is determined to help this boy and that maybe in befriending this boy he can help him before it is too late. This movie does not have all that gore like most scary movies, it is a very chilling and intelligent movie, it really makes you think, and every time you watch it there is always something I guarantee that you might have missed like a piece of clothing, an object, and so on. This movie incorporates suspense into drama, and even some comedy. There are also some great supporting performances by Olivia Williams as Malcom's wife, Toni Collette as Cole's mom and there is even a small cameo by director M. Night Shamalayan as a doctor in a clinic. Sixth Sense is an intense and amazing psychological thriller that will haunt your dreams and your minds for a long time.
