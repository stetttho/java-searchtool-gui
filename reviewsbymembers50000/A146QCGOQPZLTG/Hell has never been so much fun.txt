 I will admit that when I first saw the previews for this movie I was somewhat offended by it, because I am a Catholic and I thought that the movie poking fun at christianity and making hell seem like an ok place would offend me, but after watching it, I actually seemed to enjoy it. It pokes fun at both heaven and hell but not in a way that is too insulting. Adam Sandler is hilarious as Little Nicky the son of Satan, although I thought that his performance was funny, his speech impediment got a little bit on my nerves after awhile. Harvey Keitel's performance as Satan was devilishly funny and witty, he did an amazing job. It was great to see Sandler being reunited with a lot of his costars from previous movies including Allen Covert as his flamboyantly gay roomate and aspiring actor and Clint Howard as the nipple rubbing man which just cracked me up. While the humor gets a little bit out hand at times such as Jon Lovitz being humped by a big black bird and one of the devils getting boobs on his head, it still proves to be funny. Look out for other great cameos by Rodney Dangerfield as Lucifer, Patricia Arquette as Little Nicky's girlfriend Valerie and Dana Carvey as a basketball referee.
