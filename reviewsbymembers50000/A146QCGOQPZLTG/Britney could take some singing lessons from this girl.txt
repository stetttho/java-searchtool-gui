 Jessica Simpson has such a strong and beautiful voice. She doesn't dance around on stage in skimpy outfits like Britney. And her voice does not sound like she has a frog caught in her throat. It is very deep and soulful. When I hear her sing I get goosebumps. Even though she is a new artist I can already see her as a true diva. She is amazing and possesses all the attributes of a diva: she is beautiful, charasmatic, an incredible dancer and a extrodinary singer.
