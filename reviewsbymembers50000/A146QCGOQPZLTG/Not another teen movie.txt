 Where can I begin with this movie: great performances by Shane West and Mandy Moore, very believable acting, inspiring music, well done script and a beautiful setting. Mandy Moore's performance as the shy and reserved Jamie Sullivan was both inspiring and believable, her acting proved to be nothing more than perfect, she really made the character come alive. Shane West played the part of Landon Carter to perfection, in the beginning of the movie his character was like this tough, bad boy I don't give a sh** about anything and then he meets Mandy Moore's character and the way their friendship blossoms into love changes him in a way that he never thought possible and Shane does that transformation so well. Shane and Mandy's chemistry in this movie is electric and seeing them together in some of the scenes in this movie such as when she tells him that she is dying from cancer, or when he tells her that he loves her definitely touched my heart and brought tears to my eyes. This movie is about true love, faith, and that admist all of those goals we wish to accomplish in our lives the greatest one we can accomplish is finding true love. This movie will make you realize what having faith means, who your true friends are and that one of the greatest miracles in life is falling in love with someone.
