 I absolutely love this video. The songs are beautiful, the characters are endearing and hilarious and most of all this story teaches a good lesson: that it is more important to give than receive and that Christmas is not about getting presents, trees and food but it is about family and being together and that is what Christmas is all about. Awesome video for all ages, go and buy it and it will help you realize the true meaning of Christmas in this material world.
