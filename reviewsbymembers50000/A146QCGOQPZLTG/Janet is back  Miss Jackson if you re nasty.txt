 I have to say I was very much impressed with Janet's latest album All For You. Although any of you younger Janet fans I would not highly recommend you listen to this album because Janet gets very much explicit in her lyrics. Anyways like her album "Janet" she explores a lot of her sexual side especially in one song in particular called Would You Mind in which she really goes over the top on her sexuality, but it still proves to be a great song. Another refreshing song is China Love in which she uses pop and Chinese drum beats, the way they went together so well was amazing. Janet's duet with music veteran Carly Simon is amazing and it is nice that Janet shows her tougher side, Son of A Gun proves to be a sweet success. Come On Get Up is a great song that should be played in every club and though it sounds cliche this really is a song that makes me want to get up and dance. All in all this album explores Janet Jackson's sexuality more than ever and it is a nice breath of fresh air. More women in music should not be afraid to be more sexual in their lyrics like Janet and after listening to this album Janet has proven that she has no fear and she will say what she wants no matter what people say.
