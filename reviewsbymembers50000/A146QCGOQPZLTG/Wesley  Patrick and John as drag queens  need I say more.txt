 What a hilarious movie. I was so impressed how three straight men like Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes and John Leguizamo were able to pull off playing the roles of three drag queens. The scenes in this movie are completely hilarious. There are also great supporting performances by Robin Williams, Stockard Channing, Blythe Danner, Michael Vartan and a special appearance by RuPaul. This movie is filled with hilarious lines, funny situations, some good music, amazing acting and some touching moments. I definitely recommend this movie. This film may not have won an Oscar or a Golden Globe but it has won my heart with it's endearing characters and that's enough for me. Too Wong Foo is what great drag movies are all about.
