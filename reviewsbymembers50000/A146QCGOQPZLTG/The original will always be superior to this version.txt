 This version of the Broadway musical Bye Bye Birdie is both unoriginal and an insult to the musical. I was unimpressed with Chyna Phillips as Kim Macafee, her singing was okay, but her acting was very bland. I think that Ann Margaret's performance as Kim was much more believable. Vanessa Williams did not seem to fit the role at all as Rosie, Janet Leigh did a much better job of playing that role. The singing was horrible, the acting was awful, the only reason I gave this 1 star is because Marc Kudisch's performance of Conrad Birdie was so much better than Jesse Pearson's, he really has a great singing voice and his acting was much better. Tyne Daly's performance as Mae Peterson may have been mediocre, but Maureen Stapleton pulled it off so much better. All in all this version of Bye Bye Birdie is not one that I would recommend, go buy the original, the acting is more believable, the singing is better and the actors and actresses fit the roles perfectly.
