 I don't know why so many people are criticizing this movie, but it proves to be nothing but amazing. The only person who could ever play Annie to perfection would be Aileen Quinn, she was made for the role and the way she performs in this movie just makes Annie come alive. Carol Burnett was so hilarious as the role of Miss Hannigan even my mother agrees that no one else could play the part more beautifully than her. As for Tim Curry as the role of Miss Hannigan's twisted brother Rooster couldn't have done it any better, he really knows how to be an evil character. As for Albert Finney as the role of Oliver Warbucks the selfish millionare well his acting is very believable and he does an amazing job. Finally Ann Reinking as Grace Farell did a beautiful job, her character was so sweet and endearing and just the way she played it was perfect. All in all the songs were just brought to life, the acting was believable, the sets were amazing, the costumes were perfect, this movie has it all.
