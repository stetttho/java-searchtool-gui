 Jill Scott is an amazing singer and songwriter and what makes her even more special is she performs so well live, she just has a confident and positive vibe that the audience feeds off. It was sweet not only hearing her sing live but also hear her interact with her fans and just really get into it. I also enjoyed hearing Jill's unreleased tracks on the second cd, they proved to be both smooth and original. I cannot wait to see what miss Jill Scott has in store for us next and whatever it is I am sure she will be able to live up to her first two albums, she has enough talent and drive to remain in the music business for a long time.
