 I enjoyed watching this movie when it first came on the Disney Channel and I still enjoy watching it today. Alan Thicke gives a great performance as Todd's uptight father, a man who is so grounded in reality he doesn't even know what it means to use his imagination. Robin Riker is fabulous as the seductive and evil Denise Gore, who in reality of course is a monster. It was nice seeing Corey Feldman in this movie, who is so hilarious as Phlegm, the rock musician, head banging freak, and Amy Dolenz is equally good as Wendy, Phlegm's girlfriend and Todd's object of affection. I thought that the makeup and the special effects in this movie were actually quite good, the acting was very believable and there were some very funny moments in it. Also look for other great performances by John Astin as the priest and George Gaynes as Todd's grandfather. A wonderful movie, one that the whole family should watch.
