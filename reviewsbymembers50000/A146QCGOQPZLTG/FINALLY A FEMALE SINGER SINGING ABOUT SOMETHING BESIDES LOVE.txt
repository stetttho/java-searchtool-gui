 Pink is such an amazing vocalist. She is right up there with Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Christina Aguilera and Jessica Simpson. The only difference between her and these other female artists is that she doesn't sing sbout love but she is not necessarily bashing all men, but rebelling against certain type of men. Men who don't know how to treat their girls right, men who are just basically dogs. Her first two singles off her album "There You Go" and "Most Girls" really kick some major ass. Especially her third single "You Make Me Sick".Her album is just amazing and I can't wait to buy her second album when it comes out. Anyone who doesn't have her album you better get it. You don't know what you're missing.
