 The first time I ever heard this song was when I was watching a concert special on Fox Family from their 1998 US tour. They actually showed the video for it and I immediately fell in love with the song. So I knew that I had to get the single. When I bought this cd I was definitely not disappointed. I love the extended version, the beat is great in the beginning part, and the tunes throughout the song are so phat.As for the other two remixes of it I was really impressed with them. They have a very dance-like club feel to them.If you are a big fan of Nysnc then this is a must have. Buy it and you won't be sorry.
