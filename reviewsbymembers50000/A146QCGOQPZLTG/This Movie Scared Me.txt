 This movie has horror written all over it. It is an amazing movie. Tim Curry does an absolutely stupendous job as the clown Pennywise. He scared me to death. Every scene chilled me to the bone. Stephen King proves to the world that he is the true master of horror.All the actors/actresses in this movie are all so talented. There is just a little bit of humor added into "It" which is always good in a horror movie considering I like comedies the best. It's a movie that shows the true meaning of friendship and how the friends all come together and it's amazing to see that their friendship is so powerful that it destroys the monster. It rocks!
