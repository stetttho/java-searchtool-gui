 Although this movie was low budget and the special effects are a little bit corny and unrealistic it is still a good movie. Judd Hirsch is simply amazing as Count Dracula and Henry Gibson is hilarious as dracula's assistant Igor. John Shuck is wonderful as the Frankenstein monster and Mariette Hartley plays the part of the witch so wickedly. This is definitely a halloween movie that should be watched by the entire family.
