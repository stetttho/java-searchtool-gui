 This movie was absolutely spectacular.Wherever this movie was filmed it is absolutely beautiful, the acting is superb, and the costumes are absolutely gorgeous. Drew does such an amazing job as the lead. Her acting just took my breath away and Anjelica Houston did an excellent job playing her evil stepmother and Dougray Scott was perfect for the part as the prince. This movie made me both laugh and cry. I recommend this movie to all ages. I believe that it is a movie for everyone. It has action, romance,drama and a little bit of comedy. Ever After is da bomb!
