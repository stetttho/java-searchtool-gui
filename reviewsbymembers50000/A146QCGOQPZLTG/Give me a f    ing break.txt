 This album is an album that belongs in the garbage. First of all their first single off the album Wannabe, what a joke! The lyrics in it are so childish and do not make any sense whatsoever, I mean come on "if you wannabe my lover you gotta get with my friends" Please! The song Naked, I have no freaking idea even what the point of that song is, it talks about some girl who is naked,but what else does it explain, nothing. The only promising song on this album is Say You'll Be There. Although the Spice Girls show there soft side in the song Mama, they have songs that glorify having promiscuous sex and those songs should not be the type of songs displayed in their album especially since it is targeted at such a young audience. Spice Girls have no musical talent whatsoever and should drop out of the music business, because their material isn't music at all and is and should be an embarassment to pop artists everywhere.
