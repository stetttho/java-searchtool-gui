 Drew Barrymore just brings every movie that she stars into life, to hell with what the critics say. Drew's performance as Josie Gellar or as they called her in high school "Josie Grossie" was very believable. Watching her in the movie playing a girl who was always trying to desperately to fit in, in high school but never could and always was the butt of someone's joke. All grown up Josie is now successful and working as a reporter, she is given an assignment by her boss wonderfully played by Gary Marshall to do a story undercover, the catch: she is going back to high school. Hoping to redeem herself, Josie tries to be cool and fit in with everyone, but instead looks like a fool.She soon meets a nice guy, who happens to be her english teacher and soon their friendship turns into more than a friendship. The rest of the story is pretty much Hollywood formula romance, but it is still an enjoyable film. There are also some amazing supporting performances by John C. Reilly and Molly Shannon as Josie's coworkers Gus and Anita, David Arquette as Josie's brother Rob, Jessica Alba and Michael Vartan as Josie's teacher and love interest. Never Been Kissed is a great movie, and is something I can relate to, growing up in elementary and junior high I was never the popular one, but then I realized now that it doesn't matter if you're popular or what people think about you. As long as you have confidence in yourself, it doesn't matter what other people think. This movie does not only have good laughs, but a great message as well. Never Been Kissed proves that being a nerd is such a cliched word, that we all are nerds in our own way and that it isn't always the popular ones that find true love in the end.
