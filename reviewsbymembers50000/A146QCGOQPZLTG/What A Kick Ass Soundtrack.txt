 This soundtrack has such a great mix of songs. Wether they are upbeat or slow these songs seem to stick in my mind for days after listening. I especially enjoy the song where Lucy Pearl, Snoop Dogg and Q-tip collaborate called "You". That song is amazing. Pink is a great addition to the soundtrack and Montell Jordan's soothing and sexy singing voice in "Get It On Tonight" just hypnotizes me. If you love soundtracks to dance movies such as Fame, Center Stage or A Chorus Line then you will love this soundtrack.There is not one song on this album that I hate. Every song on it is as amazing as the next and I can't wait to see the movie!
