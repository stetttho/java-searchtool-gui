 The first time I saw this video on Making of the Video and heard it I thought it was so beautiful.The words say everything:Nobody wants to be lonely, nobody wants to cry, my body's longing to hold you, so bad it hurts inside. Time is precious and it's slipping away and I've been waiting for you all of my life" Such beautiful lyrics and Ricky and Christina's voices blend so well together. When they perform together it is pure magic. For anyone who does not have this single I suggest that you go out.. and buy it. Ricky and Christina are amazing!
