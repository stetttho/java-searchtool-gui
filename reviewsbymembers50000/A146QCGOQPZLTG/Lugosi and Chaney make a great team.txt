 I will admit at first when I heard that Bela Lugosi was going to fill the shoes of Frankenstein creature who was originally played brilliantly by Boris Karloff I was sure I wouldn't like it. But Bela Lugosi's performance as the Frankenstein creation definitely surprised me, he made the character come to life and was very believable. As for Lon Chaney he was made for the part of the wolfman, I couldn't see anyone else being this role. The eerie and haunting music was a great addition to the movie, the sets were beautiful, the makeup and costumes for the wolfman and the frankenstein monster were absolutely amazing. What more could you ask for. This movie showcased two widely talented actors who were in their prime and it is a shame they are no longer with us. This is what great horror films are all about.
