 Watching this movie I could not stop laughing. Nathan Lane and Robin Williams make an amazing comedic team in this movie. Robin Williams is very convincing as gay nightclub owner Armand Goldman and Nathan Lane is absolutely hilarious as the flamboyantly gay and overly emotional Albert who is the star of the club and Armand's partner. The situations in this movie are extremely funny such as Albert pretending to be the mother of Armand's son, Armand trying to give lessons to Albert on how to act like a man that scene is enough to leave you in stitches, let me just spew out a few of the lines from that scene: "Ohh I pierced the toast" "Albert you old so and so (flamboyantly) how bout those Dolphins?" There are also great supporting performances in this movie by the legendary actor Gene Hackman as the straight laced Senator Kevin Keely, Diane Wiest as the senator's wife Louise, Calista Flockhart as their daughter Barbara and Hank Azaria as Armand and Albert's "houseman" Agador. Here are some other great lines from the movie: "Go away I don't want to be seen I'm hideous" "You know what I'll just take one more schneken for the road, when the schneken beckons" "He blew a bubble while I was singing, he can't do that while I'm singing" All in all this is a splendid comedy and very memorable performances by Nathan Lane and Robin Williams who prove to be brilliant comedians and wonderful actors.
