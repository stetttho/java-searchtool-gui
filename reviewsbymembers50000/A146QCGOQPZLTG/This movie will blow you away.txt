 At first I was very skeptical about watching this movie. I had really bad expectations about it. But after watching I have to say this is the best action/drama I have seen in a long time. The special effects were amazing, the acting and the suspense truly wonderful, it literally had me on the edge of my seat. Chris O' Donnel's acting in this movie was probably his best ever, he was so inspiring when at one point in the movie his sister played by Robin Tunney was talking to him on the radio and said for him to go back and forget trying to rescue her he wouldn't give up on her, and in the end he did save her. It left me in tears. It was so beautiful. You have to see this movie even though as some may say it is not historically accurate. This movie has everything and more. Vertical Limit is what great action movies are all about.
