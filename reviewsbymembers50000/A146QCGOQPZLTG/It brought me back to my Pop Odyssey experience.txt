 This video is amazing, it captures the guys of Nsync so wonderfully in their concert.This tour was by far Nsync's most creative and explosive tour yet, they just took it to a whole new level. With the song "Space Cowboy" they were above the audience in harnesses and then riding on mechanical bulls, for "The Game Is Over" they were players trapped inside a video game and battling robots and an evil wizard, of course their harmonies sounded beautiful on such ballads as "God Must Have Spent" and "This I Promise You" Then for the song "It's Gonna Be Me" they in a way recreated the music video they did for that song with stuffed toys, scooters, water guns you name it and they ended the song with the remix version they did at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards. They both sounded and looked amazing, even showing the guys backstage changing costumes in between the songs was a great touch to the video. This is a great tape to add to your Nsync collection. Out of all the concerts I have been to this is the most memorable one. Watching this tape today is a wonderful thing because it brought me back to the night when I saw Nsync perform in concert, that was one of the best nights of my life.
