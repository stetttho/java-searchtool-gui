 For any of you people that consider Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey to be divas, but if it weren't for people like Liza Minnelli there wouldn't be such a term as diva. She is a perfect definition of what a diva is. She has successfully conquered both the acting and music world. She can sing, dance and is so beautiful. This video recorded live from her Radio City Music Hall performance is absolutely breathtaking it captures everything from that memorable performance: every dance move, every laugh, every note. I was blown away with how wonderful a live show Liza puts on. The songs she sang were creative, inspiring and touching, the girls dancing with her were such talented dancers, and the costumes they wore were so gorgeous. Liza gives such a great live performance, she has never lip synched onstage like some of today's female pop artists. Girls like that could learn from women like Liza and Liza is the best!
