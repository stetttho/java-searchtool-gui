 Re-Styled is a collection of Club 69 classics remixed by some of the greatest remixers on earth::Danny Tenaglia, Junior Vasquez, Boris Dlugosch, Victor Calderone, Peter Rauhofer himself and more. My 2 personal favorites include:Danny Tenaglia's exceptional re-interpretation of "Warm letherette" and Cevin Fisher's great re-visitation of the club classic "Unique" "Always Unique". Other highlights are the Razor n Guido mix of "Muscles" and Victor Calderone's mix of "Alright". Re-Styled is also a good occasion to re-discover fierce vocal performances from underground queens Suzanne Palmer, Connie Harvey, Carole Sylvan and Kim cooper.
