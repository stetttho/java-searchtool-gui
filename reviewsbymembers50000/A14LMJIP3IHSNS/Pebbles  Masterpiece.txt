 I bought "Straight From My Heart" when it was released in 1995 and still listen to it 6 years later. It sounds as if it was recorded yesterday, fresh and sunny, which is rare with this kind of music. I own all of Pebbles' work and this one is definitly my favorite. This woman is gorgeous and possesses a wonderful voice. From the funky summer anthem "Like The Last Time" to the deep and haunting "Happy", this album is one of the best R'n'B-Soul album of the 90's. Pebs' version of "I Can't Help It " is, by far, the best i' ve ever heard. Other favorites include "Soul Replacement", "Angel" and the wonderful and moving ballad "Straight From My Heart". To finish, The design of the cd is really beautiful and the booklet photos are splendid.
