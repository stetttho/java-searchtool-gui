 The best maxi-single from Cher's "believe" (with a beautiful  cover). A very good Cd including 10 mixes of "All or nothing" and  "Dov'e l'amore" by Todd Terry, Tony Moran, Almighty and more...     The best mix is, without a doubt, the "DANNY TENAGLIA CHERBOT  VOCADUB", a brilliant, underground and deep 13 minutes' track with  uplifting sounds and mesmerizing robot vocals. Probably one of the best DT  remix. And it means a lot...
