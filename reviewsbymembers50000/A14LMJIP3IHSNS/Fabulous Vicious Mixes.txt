 I didn't know Hedwig and The Angry Inch but decided to buy this Maxi-Single because of the Johnny Vicious Remixes, and I don't regret it. His remixes (and especially the "Johnny Vicious Club Mix", 10:13') blew me away. This man has the power to give any song an incredible intensity and turn it into a club bomb. His unique signature is perceivable from the first notes of the song and very reminiscent of his fantastic work for Veronica. Moreover, the lyrics of the song are totally infectious. "Angry Inch" is definitly a must-have for any fan of Vicious fabulous work.
