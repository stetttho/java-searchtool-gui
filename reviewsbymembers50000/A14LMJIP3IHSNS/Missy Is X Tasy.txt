 "So Addictive" is one of the greatest album I've heard this year.  Missy is a genius and has created a new kind of music no one had never experienced before, with elements of Rap, Hip-Hop, Dance, Techno and more. The sound of this album is one of the hottest i've ever heard. The beats are haunting, the lyrics infectious. There's not a bad or boring song on the entire album, Eveything is hypnotising. Each delivers something special...and so addictive. This album will make you want to party. It's pure Fun. Missy dares and the result is Outstanding. Praises.
