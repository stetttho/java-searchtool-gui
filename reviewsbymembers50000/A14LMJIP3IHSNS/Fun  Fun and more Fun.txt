 An excellent soundtrack for a great moovie with original and hilarious interludes from the film. ULTRA NAT's "Party Girl (Turn me loose)"is catchy and totally infectious, "Music selector is the soul reflector" is a trippy classic from DEEE-LITE's ultimate (and splendid) album "Dewdrops in the garden". Other songs are pure fun music including Dance (Chanelle), Funk, Reggae( Dawn Penn) and more... So sad that the retro disco song on the nightclub scene (Mary and Natasha) isn't included on this album.
