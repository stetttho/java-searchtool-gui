 "The Sweetest Days" is definitly Vanessa' s best album to date. This album is totally inspiring, beautifully produced, written and arranged with vanessa in the top of her form. The direction of this album is bold and original, melts several musical directions such as R'n'B, Jazz, pop and more. From the infectious 1st single "The Way That You Love",  to the sweet "Long Way Home", this album proves that Vanessa is more than just a beautiful woman. Favorite tracks include"The Sweetest Days" and "Higher Ground", two wonderful ballads full of emotion. "Constantly" is, in my opinion, Vanessa's best song ever, a breathtaking and haunting acoustic track with moving vocals from vanessa. A must-Have.
