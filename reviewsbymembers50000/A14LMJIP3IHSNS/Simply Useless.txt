 I still can't believe it..... I was such a fan of Chantay savage, yearning for this new album for years. "this time" is one of the worst album i possess. there ain't no song that saves the cd; each one looks like  the other; the production is so poor and common....a total DISASTER. I love  chantay's two first albums, "here we go again" and "i will  survive."  Steve "silk" hurley's production was simply  great, as usual. Chantay's voice is as beautiful as before...but that's  all. Don't waste your time...this album is awful.
