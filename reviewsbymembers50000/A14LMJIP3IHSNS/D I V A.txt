 This album is fabulous. "Bad mood" unites all of Lonnie' successes from "gonna catch you" and "happening all over again" to "bad mood". This is not a Best of but it seems to  be 'cause all songs are great. You'll find in this Cd' several kind of  music: pop/jazz, soul, dance and grandiloquent garage. Lonnie has always  worked with famous producers (David Morales, Junior Vasquez, John  Poppo,...). Here, the production is fresh, funky and subtle (Todd Terry,  Roger S.,..) and Lonnie's voice is purely mighty. Watch for the tracks  "love can turn around", "bad mood", "do you want  it?" (especially D.morales mixes) and the beautiful and touching  "missing you". Lonnie is fierce and lovely: a true DIVA.  "bad mood" is a treasure.
