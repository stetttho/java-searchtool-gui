 "Yum Yum" is a must-have for any garage/ Divas' lover. After several collaborations with house geniuses, the Diva gave us a wonderful album full of power, energy and emotion.  One important thing to notice is that Sabrina can sing anything, from fabulous house anthems ("Tonight", "You Need My Lovin'"), classy garage ("You In My Life"), to funk/R'n'B ("Yum Yum). Even the ballads are great, which is rare with the majority of house divas' album ("Lay Me Down"). Also worth the purchase of this uplifting album is the presence of 2 bonus tracks including the excellent Junior vasquez's club mix of "Tonight".
