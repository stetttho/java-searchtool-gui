 One of the best pop release of the year 2000. Louise comes back with a mature and sophisticated album perfectly produced by Matt Elliss and written by Louise Herself. "Elbow Beach", her 3d solo album, enlightens Louise' states of mind about love and private confessions ("The wedding song (First kiss), "In our room"). The result is an outstanding melt of dance ("For your eyes only"), r&b ("That's what friends are for") and dancin' pop creations ("Beautiful inside", the catchy "City boy fix"). Best tracks, in my opinion, are the fabulous 1st single "2 FACED" (Check out the double cd set  with club remixes and video) and the captivating "LOST"(the sequel to "In our room").
