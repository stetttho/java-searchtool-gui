 I'm a long time fan of MARK PICCHIOTTI and I haven't been dissapointed with his guitar mix of "Freedom", a flamenco party club track with more beats, guitar and additional vocals. Very good work. The "J.C's freedom of flight mix" is quite good but nothing spectacular. The Motiv 8 remix is very poor and boring, But is it truly a remix? Just faster beats....the original album version is one hundred times better.Just a bad remix from bad remixers. 4 stars for Mark!
