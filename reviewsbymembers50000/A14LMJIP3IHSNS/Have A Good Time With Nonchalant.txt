 Nonchalant is one of the best singer in the Hip-Hop world and this album stands as a favorite. Her flow is catchy but not agressive, she's got a deep voice and her lyrics are wise.The entire album is good, from fun party tracks ("It's All Love) to darker ones ("Lookin' Good To Me", "Have A Good Time").The "Non Interlude" and the Outro are gorgeous.  "Until The Day" is a must-have for any fan of impressive Hip-Hop (also check out the excellent"Take It There" featuring The Roots and Rampage available as a  single).
