 Johnny Vicious does it again. After spectacular mixes of "Release me" and "Someone To Hold",  "I'm In Love" Proves another time that the alchemy between him and Veronica is simply sensational. All the mixes are fabulous, from the anthemic "Alternate Mix" to the dark "Wave Of The Future Dub". A club favorite.
