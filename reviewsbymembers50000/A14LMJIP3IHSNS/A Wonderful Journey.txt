 If you're in love with Incognito, Satoshi Tomiie or Towa Tei, this CD is for you. MG4 is an elegant and vibring melt of several kind of music such as Acid-Jazz, Soul, 2-Step, Funky brazilian house and bossa with an "All Star Cast". Favorite tracks include: "Show Me Your Love", a wonderful Soul track featuring the exceptional N'Dea Davenport; the progressive "Star Suite"(great lyrics); and the powerful brazilian party gem "Life" (featuring Paula Lima). A Sensational album.
