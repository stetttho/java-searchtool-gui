 "This is it" sounds like a deception. Everything was there to make a good album: Twisted, one of the best house label, famous producers( Danny Tenaglia, Peter rauhofer, E-Smoove, Maurice Joshua, Cevin  Fischer,...)...The result is desappointing and very heavy: Celeda's voice  is restricted and boring, lyrics are conventional and demagogic to the  utmost, songs aren't very original and often similar ("burning  up", "try again",..). A few songs are good ( club  69's"let the music use you up", Maurice joshua's"this is  it") but forgettable. The real and only treasure of the record is  Danny Tenaglia's beautiful  "be yourself (and no one else)", a  deeeep and sensual track, the reason why i give this album 3 stars. Celeda  is cool but doesn't possess the strenght of a diva and can't compare to  Martha wash, Jocelyn Brown or Kim English....Really.
