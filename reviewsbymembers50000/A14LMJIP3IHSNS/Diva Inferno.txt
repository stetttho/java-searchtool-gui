 "Disco Inferno" is one of Cyndi's  best dance track to date. Soul Solution did an outstanding job with this production and Cyndi's voice has never sounded so powerful. It's impossible not to resist to this infectious Hands-in-the-air club anthem. The only bad point of this single is that the Plasmic honey and Boris & Beck mixes aren't really good, way too fast, and don't respect Cyndi's vocal. But  there are 4 different mixes from Soul Solution and they all rock.
