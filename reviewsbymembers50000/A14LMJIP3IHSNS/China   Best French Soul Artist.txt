 Second album from China, the best french soul artist and daughter of Dee Dee Bridgewater. "On Tourne En Rond" is as good as her first album ("China") and demonstrates one more time how talented she is. "tre la-bas", the first single from the album is brilliant, "Gabriel" is a sweet and touching declaration of love. "Y'a pas moyen", my personal favorite is a funky and jazzy song with great lyrics. If you wanna listen to real good french (and also english) music, China is there for you.
