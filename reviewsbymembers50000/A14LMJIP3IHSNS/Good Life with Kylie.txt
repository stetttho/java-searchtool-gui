 Excellent single and 3rd extract from the extraordinary album "Light Years". "Please Stay" is a great flamenco-dance track and "Santa Baby" is a sexy reprise of the christmas classic. Most notable track is without a doubt "GOOD LIFE". After dazzling intimate moments as "Paperdolls" and "Ocean Blue", Kylie gives another brilliant performance with this catchy brazilian oriented cool track. The CD also includes a beautiful calendar. Enjoy Yourself...
