 "Naked Without You" truly comes from Taylor's heart and sounds more intimate than her 3 previous albums on Arista. Taylor does what she really appreciates and the result is original and dazzling: Glorious dance anthem ("STAND", one of Taylor's best song ever), funky r&b ("unstoppable), touching ballad ("You don't have to say you love me"), hypnotising jungle influenced track ("Don't make me love you", amazing) and more. This album proves that Taylor is one of the true queen of pop, a woman that can sing anything and so well.Definitly Taylor's best.
