 Explosively funny and seductive, "Unzipped" is a clever comedy somewhere between Robert Altman's "Pret--porter" and "In bed with Madonna", with a classy  cast, a great soundtrack and delightful guests appearances. EARTHA KITT highlights the moovie with an outrageous and very glamourous sequence. Fun!
