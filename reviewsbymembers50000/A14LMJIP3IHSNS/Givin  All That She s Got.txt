 "From Now On", Robin' S' second album is definitly one of the best dance record of the 90's (and one of the most underrated). The lady truly sings with her heart and soul. Robin' S has worked with famous top producers (Todd Terry, E-Smoove, Tony Moran,...) and the result is a vibring melt of funky R&B ("It Must Be Love, "Been so Long"), Disco remakes ("All I Do", "You know How To Love Me") and dance("Midnight") Best tracks, in my opinion, are the glorious garage anthems produced by Todd Terry: "Givin' You All That I've Got", my favorite, is just fabulous, and "Shine On Me" demonstrates the incredible vocals of the Diva with intense gospel influences. Let's hope we'll have the opportunity to listen to Robin very quickly.
