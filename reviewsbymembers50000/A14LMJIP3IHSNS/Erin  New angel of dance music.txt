 I discovered Erin 2 years ago and immediatly fell under her spell. This woman is magnificient and talented. Her voice is both powerfull and emotional. "One World", her debut album, contains her 4 wonderful club anthems: "SATISFIED" (The best), "Dream Weaver", "The Flame", and "The Temple" plus great dance (""Sweet Angel", "Take Me As I Am") and downtempo songs (the gospel inspirated "One World". This album is a must have CD for any fan of good dance music. If you're a fan of Kristine W., Crystal Waters or Victoria Wilson James, Don't hesitate.  ERIN IS A GIFT FROM HEAVEN
