 The "Best of" Ce Ce Peniston is absolutely a must have cd for  any garage lover. This Album contains Ce Ce'singles From her 3  albums:"Finally", "Though Ya Knew" and "i'm moving  on". The cd melts different styles: pure garage  anthems("Finally", the wonderful "we got a love thang",  Hit by love", or "Keep giving me your love") and  soul-r&b oriented tracks ("I'm in the mood", " moving  on"). The production is perfect and almost includes the totality of  her works with her 2 favorites producers: Steve "Silk" Hurley and  David Morales. The rest of the albums is also brilliant (Eric Kupper,  Masters at Work, Soulshock and Karlin,...). Ce Ce Peniston has got one of  the most beautiful voice in the music industry and is definitly one of the  greatest dance Diva. My only regret about this cd is that the track  "I'm not over you" (from "though Ya' Knew") isn't on  it. This is probably Ce Ce 's best, an uplifting Masterpiece. Hope we'll  soon have the chance to hear a brand new Ce Ce Peniston album after her  98's track "Nobody Else". The diva deserves the best...
