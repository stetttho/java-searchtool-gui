 I've seen a lot of Woody Allen's movies and "Shadows And Fog" stands as my ultimate favorite. This movie is unique and beautifully directed. Everything' s perfect: music, photography,... The cast is absolutely brilliant: Woody Allen (he was meant to play Kleinman), Kathy Bates, Mia Farrow, Madonna, Lily Tomlin, Julie Kavner, John Malkovich, and others... "Shadows And Fog" is both a drama and a comedy and can be seen through several views: thriller, film noir, fairy-tale, with tender and rough moments.. The movie also sums up Allen's obsessions and favorite themes.  Definitly a Must-have.
