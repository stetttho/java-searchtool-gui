 I own all of Karyn White' s work and "Make Him Do Right" is definitly her best work. The Album is a classic R&B with an excellent production from Flyte Tyme duet Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, Babyface and Daryl Simmons. "Hungah", the first track (and single) is very upbeat with hot Karyn's vocals. The rest of the album is slower,with great ballads ("One Minute", "I'm Your Woman"). "Simple Pleasure" is one of Karyn' s all-time best song as  "Can I Stay with You", a touching and beautiful ballad produced by Babyface. It's been too long since we haven't heard of karyn and I do Hope she' ll be back with a brand new album . she's one of the best Soul/R&B artist.
