 "Theme From The Valley Of The Dolls" is another winner K.D. / Junior Vasquez collaboration. 7 Junior mixes and a strong club atmosphere. The best mix is the "Junior' s Arena Anthem", a progressive and dreamy club anthem with a triumphant tribal sound and killer vocals. The break in the middle of the song simply rocks. If you're a fan of K.D. Remixed, This one stands as a favorite.
