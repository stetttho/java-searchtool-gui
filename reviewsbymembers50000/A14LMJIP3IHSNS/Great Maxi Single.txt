 Here 's the Maxi-Single Tracklisting: 1- Album Version (4:10) 2- Precision Mix Edit (3:44) 3- NYC House Mix Edit (3:49) 4- Precision Mix (10:08) 5- NYC House Mix (9:32) I didn't know Tekla and this song, but the purchase of this CD was a good surprise.The woman has got a beautiful voice and the beats are pleasant. The album version is a good dance track and the Lenny Bertoldo remixes are really interesting: The precision mixes are reminiscent of William Orbit and Madonna 's work on "Ray Of Light", full of electronic Sounds and oriental rhythms. My Favorite mix is by far the NYC House Mix, a tribal club version with phat beats and a killer break. If you're a fan of the Thunderpuss mixes, you 'll love this one.
