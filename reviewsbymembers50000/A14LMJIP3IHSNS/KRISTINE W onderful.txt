 After her first album "Land Of The Living"which allready sounds as a classic,Kristine is back with a fabulous new album, less dark but more accessible. The First listening is rather amazing but hear it twice and you'll fall in love forever. Kristine's voice is as mighty as before and the atmospheres are numerous. Infectious catchy club tunes ("Stronger", "Never been kissed", the jazzy "Clubland"), great downtempo songs ("If only you knew", "Shower the people"), and ever a beautiful ballad ("All that glitters"). Best songs, "SOMEONE (WATCHING OVER ME)" and "LET LOVE REIGN" are pure moments of triumph, glorious and moving uplifting tracks. The production is clear and perfect (Tony Moran, Joe Carrano, Peter Ries, Stonebridge and more...). Kristine is back ...and Stronger.
