 I already liked very much "Can't Take That Home" but I must say that I love "Missundaztood". Pink didn't hesitate to take risks and the result is a mesmerizing, personal and original album, something rather rare in the music industry today, especially with young and ultra talented artists like P!nk. The sound of "Missundaztood" should please a lot of people: From the wonderful anthemic first single "Get The Party Started", passionate ballads ("Eventually", "My Vietnam", "Gone To California"), to intimate and very personal tracks ("Family Portrait", "Dear Diary"), P!nk has definitly proved that she's one of the most talented young artist today, who dares to surprise and amaze people in a different and fabulous way. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
