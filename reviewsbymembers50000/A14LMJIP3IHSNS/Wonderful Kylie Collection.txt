 "Hits+" is a wonderful collection of Kylie' songs from 1994 to 1998 featuring many rare, unreleased tracks and remixes. "Confide In Me" and "Some Kind Of Bliss", 2 of my all time Kylie's favorites are classics, such as "Where The Wild Roses Grow" and the Farley & Heller "Roach Motel Mix" of "Where Has The Love Gone" shines. The booklet also contains gorgeous photos by Ellen Von Unwerth. But the true gems of this collection are the wonderful acoustic version of "Automatic Love" and the sublime "IF YOU DON'T LOVE ME" with Kylie as you've never heard before. Definitly a must-have.
