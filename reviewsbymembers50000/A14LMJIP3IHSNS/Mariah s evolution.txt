 "Rainbow" is a good album, different from Mariah's other efforts. The album's concept is interesting and the photos by David LaChapelle are beautiful. Her collaboration with Jimmy Jam & terry  Lewis just works and the songs they produced are simply great:  "Mariah's theme" is one of the best song she ever sung,  emotionnal and intense. "Bliss" is original, uplifting and  celestial. I also love her duet with Snoop, "Crybaby",  "heartbreaker", "Petals" and "The rainbow  interlude". The rest of the album is more shaded: some songs are good  ("How much", "X-girlfriend", and "thank  god..."), some others are heavy and weak ( "after tonight",  "Did i do that", "heartbreaker remix").   "Against  all odds" is purely horrible, the Rainbow's disaster, the most awful  song mariah has ever done. I just can't understand why it's been realeased  in europe as Mariah's 3d single. The video is indigestible. "Can't  take that away" is 1 million time better.   i also regret that Mariah  didn't make a dance interlude with David Morales as for  "daydream" or "Butterfly", their work is always amazing  and dazzling.   I put this album 5 stars because of songs as "Mariah's  theme", "Bliss", and "crybaby". No matter the bad  songs... Mariah's evolution on this album is pure delight.
