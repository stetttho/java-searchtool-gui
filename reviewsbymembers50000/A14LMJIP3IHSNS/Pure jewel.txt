 What a Cd! "filth and dreams" is definitly Swing out sister's best effort. The atmosphere is intense and each song delivers something special and rare. This album looks like a journey. Corinne drewery's voice  is fabulous and Paul Stavely O'Duffy's production is perfect. The Cd is  good from the beginning 'til the end; Songs like "when morning  comes", "filth and dreams", or "closer than the  sun" are spellbound. "make you stay", my favourite one, is  pure bliss. With this album, Corinne and Andy prove that S.O.S.is simply  unique, one of the best group that exists......
