 I bought this album 8 years ago, heard it hundred times and love it more and more each time I listen to it. This is definitly a dance classic, one of the best club album ever released, good from the beginning 'til the end.12 songs:12 bombs.It's hard to say which one is the best but "A Shade Shady (Now prance)", "All Of A Sudden", and "Prisonner Of Love" are my ultimate favorites. Ru is THE DIVA and I do hope we'll have the chance to hear a brand new album soon. "SuperModel Of The World" is a MASTERPIECE that brings joy .
