 Regina Belle's "Best Of" is a smart collection of her works from  the 80's to the middle 90's.  Her brilliant, mighty and unique voice shines  and gives this cd a delicate atmosphere who reminds me of Jody Watley or  Karyn White' s albums. The cd contains several beautiful and dazzling  ballads such as "If I could" or "This is love".   Personnaly, I think that "didn't I (Blow your mind this time)" is  Regina's best song ever (with "I got it" from "Believe in  me"), a touching, elegant and sublime masterwork produced by the great  Denzil Foster and Thomas Mc Elroy (En Vogue, Gabrielle, ...).
