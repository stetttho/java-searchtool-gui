 Hellishly funny song from Miss M. with 6 great club remixes. Brinsley Evans samples Stardust's "Music sounds better with you" and Victor Calderone gives his ordinary tribal treatment to the song. Best mix by far is the"D.T. CONTINENTAL CLUB MIX". DANNY TENAGLIA signs one of his best remix to date and turns the original song into a delightful and hysterical club anthem. Too beautiful...
