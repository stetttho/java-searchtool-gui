 I was very impressed with this album, especially being a fan of the Broadway original.  I wasn't expecting the movie to do it justice, but I was wrong.  I enjoy this album better than the original!  There is much more energy and livliness to the music and the voices.  The singers definitely put much more passion into it than originally.    "Seasons of Love" - The greatest version ever made of this song!  This song alone is worth buying the whole album for.  "The Tango Maureen" - Even my ten year old cousin has a blast listening to this song.  It takes you in and makes you feel like you are right there dancing with them.  "Over the Moon" - Idina Menzel is absolutely fabulous!  She is so funny and so passionate in this song that you can't help but laugh and sing along.  "La Vie Boheme" - My favorite track on the album.  The group did a wonderful job.  This song makes you want to go out and march in a parade or something...  Do not miss out on this album.  It's a great piece of culture and a gem for your collection.
