All seems to be fine in Jane's life until she starts high school and meets the new girl, Taylor.  As their relationship develops, Jane realizes that she is falling for Taylor and soon learns the truth about her own sexuality.

When Jane finally comes out to her parents, it doesn't go as well as she would have hoped.  While her father struggles to accept his daughter, her mom cannot seem to do so.  With the help of a good friend and a good teacher, Jane tries to help her mom understand and accept her for who she is before their relationship is destroyed forever.
