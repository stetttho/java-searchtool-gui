 The Writer's Partner is a book that goes with me wherever I go.  With every story or script I have written, I have referred to this incredible book at least five times.  It is filled to the brim with ideas and information to help you create the ultimate story.  It offers tips and ideas to formulate and create a multidemensional plot with multidemensional characters, facts on common careers/movie genres so all your information is accurate, and backstory/subplot ideas to help you add spice to your story.  No writer should be without this book, it is practically an encyclopedia for writers.
