 I waited a while before renting this movie, because I had heard mixed reviews and I wasn't sure if I wanted to spend the time on it or not.  Within the first fifteen minutes of the movie I was sorry I hadn't rented it sooner.  The story, the town, and the characters had me so drawn in that I couldn't help but feel like I was a part of the movie.  All of the characters had a lot of chemistry, making the movie very believable.  It's a multidemensional movie that tells the story of several characters realizing and coming to terms with their sexuality.  Being that they are in a small, conservative town in the South, the risks of being openly gay are much greater.  The characters have to struggle to maintain family relationships, romantic relationships, and friendships, making the movie dramatic, humorous, and touching all at once.  Between the hilarious, sad, romantic, and touching scenes, I think this movie is great for anyone to watch, especially family and friends who are learning about and trying to accept a loved one's sexuality.  This movie makes you see that love is love and that if we all judged a little less and cared a little more, the world would be an all around better place.
