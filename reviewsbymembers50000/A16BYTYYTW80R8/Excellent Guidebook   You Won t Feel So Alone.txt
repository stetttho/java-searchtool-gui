 Of all the books I have read pertaining to coming out, this is without a doubt the most informative and useful guide avaliable for the entire family.  If you really want to understand the entire process of realizing you are gay all the way through coming out and beyond, you need to read this book.  This book is not only great for gays and lesbians, but their family and friends as well.  Through facts and testimonies of many different people (including Chastity and her parents Sonny and Cher), this book lays out the cold raw truth of the difficulties and pains of coming out to family and friends.  It's brutally honest, and even though some of the stories may not be what we want to hear, it's the truth and we all need to understand that.  Hopefully this book will help someone out there come to terms with themselves or someone they love who is struggling with coming out.  I truly enjoyed hearing about Chastity's experience and how her mother struggled with accepting her daughter.    This book is a must read, I don't know any other way to put it.  YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK.
