 First and foremost, this DVD is an absolute MUST BUY if only for the sake of the bonus materials on the second disc.  It not only includes several incredible deleted scenes and a beautiful alternate ending, but it also includes a feature length documentary about Jonathan Larson and the development of Rent.    Speaking in terms of the movie, I don't believe there are words sufficient enough to describe it.  It was beautiful, moving, bringing me and everyone I saw it with to laughs, tears, and afterwards making me want to hug every one of the people I was with.  The actors could not be more perfect for their roles, especially Dawson and Thoms, the only two actors not from the original broadway cast.  They definitely earned their roles and brought magic to the film.  The music is even better than the broadway original, sung with more passion, strength, and honesty than I have ever heard before.  I wanted to get up and start clapping in the middle of the movie.  This is a MUST see for anyone out there.  It will touch your heart.
