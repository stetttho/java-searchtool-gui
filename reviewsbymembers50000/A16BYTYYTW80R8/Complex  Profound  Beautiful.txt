 Brandon's first collection of poetry is one that will remain a favorite of mine for years to come.  From the very first poem, you can feel the pain and truth that has been bled into the pages through his words.  Although the poems are written from a gothic perspective, they are ones that can be appreciated and understood by anyone.  Definitely a collection you wont want to miss.
