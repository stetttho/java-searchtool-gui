 This album has a fresh new sound unlike any of Chely's previous albums.  These songs seem to be coming straight from her heart and soul, because the passion and strength that she sings with is absolutely incredible.  There is a good mix of different kinds of songs which makes the album interesting.  Listen carefully to "The Bumper of my SUV" and take it all in.  I've found myself listening to that song redundantly.  "I got Him Ready For You" is another great tune with more of an upbeat, fun kind of melody.  Chely fans will not be disappointed and new listeners may find themselves buying her other music after this.  Chely's new album has proved to be well worth the wait of nearly four years.  I was skeptical about buying it at first, because I didn't know what to expect, but now that I have listened to it several times through, I am very glad that I did.
