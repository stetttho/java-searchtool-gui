 I went back to Barnes and Noble three times before I bought this book and when I finally did, it changed my life.  I was sixteen at the time and found it incredibly easy to relate to.  After passing it along to several friends who all felt the same way, Sarah Dessen became our all time favorite author.  This book is about two friends who are both going through their own personal struggles at one of the hardest times in their life.  Halley is helping her best friend Scarlett through her pregnancy, because Scarlett's boyfriend was killed in a motorcycle accident.  In the meantime, Halley has met a boy, Macon Faulkner, that she is falling for.  This book is the story of two best friends and how they help eachother through the toughest year of high school they will ever have to face.  This book is a must read for all teenage girls.
