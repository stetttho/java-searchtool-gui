 J. Tarin Towers without a doubt has a gift for writing poetry.  Her words are brutally honest -- things that most of us wish we could say but never do.  This collection is refreshing compared to a lot of the poetry that has been published.  Rather than being dark and sappy, this collection is humorous, clever, and fun to read.  I'm almost always impressed with the books that are published by Manic D Press and this one surely topped them off.  This collection of poetry is one of my favorites in my collection.
