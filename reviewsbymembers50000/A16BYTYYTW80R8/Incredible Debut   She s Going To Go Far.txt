 Let me start off by saying that Idol fans may be disappointed if they don't like country music, because this album is straight out of Nashville's prime crop of music.  "Some Hearts" is by far one of the best debut CD's from any artist in a really long time.  This is an excellent mix of upbeat tunes and softer ballads -- the perfect combination of songs to make up a great CD.  Her voice is so strong and on pitch that she'll have you convinced she's been doing this as long as Faith or Martina.  She also showed us her songwriting skills on the track, "I Ain't in Checotah Anymore," one of the most entertaining songs on the CD.  This is one of those albums you'll keep listening to redundantly, because the music makes you feel so good.  Definitely worth buying, you won't be disappointed.
