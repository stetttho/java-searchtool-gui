 Many have said that no other rendition of the Phantom of the Opera soundtrack could ever compare to the Michael Crawford/Sarah Brightman original-- until now.  The passion that is poured into this beautiful soundtrack is breathtaking.  Whatever the theme of the song, the performers ooze passion and emotion.  The fresh new sound and young voices of Emmy Rossum, Gerard Butler, and the rest of the cast provide a quality musical experience.
