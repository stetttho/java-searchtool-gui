 Once again, Sarah Dessen brings to life wonderfully vivid and imaginative characters. Dreamland will make you laugh, cry, and wish you could keep on reading Caitlin O'Koren's story. Caitlin has always felt like she was in her "perfect" older sister's shadows until her sister runs away. Suddenly Caitlin's life has changed, not only because of her sister, but because of her new boyfriend, Rogerson Biscoe. It is the story of an abusive adolescent relationship and the story of the search for one's self. Dreamland teaches you the importance of loving and caring for yourself and also teaches you that each and every person is important no matter what. A must read for teenage girls. This book made me take a really good look at my life and what I wanted out of it.
