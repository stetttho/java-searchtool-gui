 "Penny and Me" is one of those songs that gives you a lighthearted kind of feeling that makes you want to tap your steering wheel and sing along as you drive.  This single is great, because you get the album version along with an acoustic version as well.  What makes this single even better is the unreleased track, "Every Word I Say."  It's an upbeat, catchy song that I can't believe hasn't been released on an album or as a radio single.  For four bucks, you get an absolute gem.  Definitely worth buying.
