 Movie Magic Screenwriter is by far the most helpful, easy to manage screenwriting program on the market.  I have used other software such as Final Draft, and have found that Movie Magic is by far the best.  It makes formatting your script as simple as possible, offering a wide variety of templates, such as television scripts, motion picture scripts, etc.  It also helps you organize your characters and makes it easy to find certain scenes with it's variety of tools to help you manage the script.  This program is definitely worth the money.
