 Skye is fifteen and trying desperately to find her place somewhere in this big, crazy world.  With a hot shot father and an emotionally unstable and unreachable mother, the challenge is much more intense.  She is struggling with her attraction to two different girls at her school and in the meantime making friends she never thought she'd have.  From page one, this book will have you absolutely hooked and as cliche as that sounds, this time I really do mean it.  The writing style in this book is more of poetry and prose than a work of fiction.  There is incredible symbolism and metaphorical usage that makes it much deeper and impacting.  This is one of those books that keeps you reading for hours, because the words just flow on beautifully.  A worthy read for anyone, especially the lover of quality, symbolic writing.
