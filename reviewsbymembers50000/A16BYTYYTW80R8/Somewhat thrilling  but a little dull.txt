 Stepford Wives started out a little slow, and I was hoping for it to pick up pace, but I didn't all that much. It was thrilling in the sense that you did wonder what was going to happen next, but it wasn't one that you were just dying to know the ending to. It's about a family who moves to Stepford and discovers that all the wives in this town are slaves to their husbands, constantly doing nothing but housework and cooking. The strange thing is that they don't seem to be bothered by it. What's even more odd is that all the husbands in the town meet at the Men's Association and nobody knows why. Joanna Eberhart (the main character) does some research on the president of the association and finds out some horrifying information that just might explain why all the wives are the way that they are. Can she save herself before she becomes one of them? You'll have to read to find out.
