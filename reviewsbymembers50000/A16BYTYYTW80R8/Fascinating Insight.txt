 Thoreau was without a doubt one of the most fascinating literary figures in American history.  While his essays and ideas are subject to much criticism, this small book gives you an interesting insight into the man that most people never knew he was.  Written by Edward Waldo Emerson, we get a first hand account of Thoreau's life from a slightly biased, but none-the-less interesting point of view.  This pieces includes a lot of anecdotes and things that we may have never learned about Thoreau without Emerson having shared them with us.  Definitely made me respect the man more than I did prior to reading this memoir.
