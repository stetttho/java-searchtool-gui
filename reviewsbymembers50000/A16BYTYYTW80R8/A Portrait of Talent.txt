 I must begin by saying this is the most incredible collection of songs I have heard in a very long time.  In these six beautiful songs, Idina shows us what she is truly made of and what lies within her own heart.  This collection is much softer than her previous album (Still I Can't Be Still).  Her vocal and songwriting skills absolutly shine, especially on track 3, "If I Told You."  The first time I listened to the song I got chills.  Please don't miss out on this CD, it is an absoutely beautiful gem.
