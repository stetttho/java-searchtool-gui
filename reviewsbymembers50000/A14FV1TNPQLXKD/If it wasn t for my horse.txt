 I must warn you about this disc,"DO NOT,DO NOT,PLAY THIS DISC WHILE DRIVING!" I bought a copy of The White Album,loaded it into my CD changer in my pickup and proceded to head to a friends house in Pennsylvania via The Famous New Jersey Turnpike. I had just passed Exit 8a when Black went into his tyraid about the Weather Channel,I was convulsing with laughter and almost drove off the road,I quickly composed myself and proceeded to my friends listening to Kenny G. as a tranquilizer.When I arrived at my friends I insisted they play the disc and was able to convulse in the safety of a non-moving environment.My friend has purchased a copy and is busy converting people to the words of THE MASTER.  If you LOVE to LAUGH,BUY this album,but do not,I'll repeat that "DO NOT LISTEN TO THIS DISC WHILE OPERATING A MOTOR VEHICLE!!!!!!  I can't believe it!I wrote this review a few years back and I was very surprised when I saw Mr.Black a few months after I had posted the review and told him I had written it,he shook my hand and asked if I was the guy driving on the Jersey Turnpike.I told him yes and he said he loved my posting.I was flabbergasted,I don't know if he still reads reviews here but he made me a very happy and loyal fan.One thing tho,I wish people would get more original,I've read at least 2 reviews that are almost downright plagerism (forgive the spelling).I hope Mr Black will return to playing small venues again.I lost it when someones cellphone rang and he yelled at them to ANSWER THE F**KIN THING! Love you Lewis!
