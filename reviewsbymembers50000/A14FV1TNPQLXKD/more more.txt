 I had seen a movie about a pub in some US city it followed the rise and fall of the establishment and at one point the owners hired a local band to play.I was instantly hooked on the band and as usual,sat through the credits to find their name,"SAW DOCTORS",of course my next move was to go to Amazon.com and do a search.Being of modest fiscal means I decided to pick one album (which happened to be this one).  As with most albums there are some songs that really impress and others that don't.I was quite impressed with the various styles,some have an almost U2 flavor and others are local Irish barband (best type).  For a variety of styles and just plain good music,by all means buy this and other ones by these guys.  Now if I could only remember the name of the movie.If you know please email me.
