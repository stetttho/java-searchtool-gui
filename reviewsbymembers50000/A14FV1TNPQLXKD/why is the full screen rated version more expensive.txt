   Why in all that is just and right is a version of a movie in full screen and r rated is more expensive than the unrated widescreen version?  Be careful when you order certain versions of movies! In my haste I ordered the R-Rated Full screen version because in my haste I thought the $20.99 DVD was the "Special" version and for $19.49 you get the (in my opinion ) better version.  How the @#$%^&&! does that work?  Just read carefully before you order.
