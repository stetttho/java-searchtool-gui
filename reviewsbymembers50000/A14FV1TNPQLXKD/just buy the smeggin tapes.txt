 This collection of the first 3 episodes of Red Dwarf are a must to anyone as an introduction to the outrageous show.I was infected with the Dwarf bug about 10 years ago by a friend living in Florida.He came to visit one summer and brought me tapes of the first 2 seasons of Red Dwarf and I was immediatly hooked.I hadn't heard of Dwarf before because it wasn't broadcast on any of the PBS stations in my area.  The story is about Dave Lister a crew member on the spaceship "Red Dwarf",he and his bunkmate Arnold J.Rimmer are in charge of maintaining the chicken soup dispensers.  Lister is basically a simple guy with a plan,to save all his pay and buy a farm on Fiji (which sank below sea level during a volcanic eruption)so land there is very cheap.He smuggles aboard an un-quarrentined pregnant cat and is put into stasis as punishment for not turning over the kitten carrying Frankenstein. After Lister is in stasis there is a radiation leak that kills all aboard except for Frankenstein because she was hidden in the hold and protected from the killing radiation.  Lister is revived 3 million years later by Holly the computer because the radiation has reached safe limits.After learning of the fate of his shipmates and resurrection of his bunkmate albiet as a hologram,he meets "Cat" a decendent of Frankenstein.  So begins the adventures of the crew(?) of Red Dwarf and their journey back to Earth.  I was a bit dismayed to find that the original theme was changed to one that was used in later episodes and certain scenes were changed and even the design of the ship was altered.Having the original TV broadcast episodes and seeing the changes which I feel shouldn't have been made,I still recommend this series highly.I only wish the music from the series was available.  Would I buy the collection? I smeggin would!!
