 Lewis Black has done it again,I have been playing this disc over and over and can't stop laughing.I have seen him twice over the past two years and I wish he appeared in this area more often.How is it that I had missed out knowing about him before then? Maybe his comedy is an aquired taste,he seems so abrasive,and his use of four-letter words may throw some people off,but after listening to him you realize the only way his comedy really works is when he's ranting.He shows you the stupidity of peoples fears,governments wonderful ways of [messing] with us,how we over reacted to situations after 9/11,and mans general stupidity.  His comedy is for intelligent people,not the easily offended ,people that can see the humor that's right before our eyes,but we seem to miss it and need a man like him to point it out.  I said this in my review of his first album and I'll repeat it. Do not,Do not operate a motor vehicle while listening to this album.Wait till you are in a non-moving envirenment to enjoy this truly funny album.  When this man appears in a club near you,go see him live !!!
