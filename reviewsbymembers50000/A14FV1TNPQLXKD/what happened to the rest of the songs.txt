  I was so hapy when a friend told me the soundtrack to "THE TRIP" was available on CD. I ordered a copy asap and waited for the postman. The day finally arrived, I opened the AMAZON package preparing for psychadelic heaven( I had the album on vinyl )and I was quite happy,but,wait!What happened to the rest of the songs???  What happened to"Joint Passing""A little head""Inner pocket""The other Ed Norton""Peter gets off"and "Gettin Hard"?Why aren't they on the CD? All the music was by "The Electric Flag",the worst travesty was cutting "Getting Hard" a sweet slow blues number with Bloomfields guitar is a delite!That's missing!!  If you can watch the movie you'll realize there are missing selections,If you owned the record and bought the CD are you cursing the music gods for the missing tracks?  I'm disappointed about the missing songs but at least I have most of the songs.  Why don't the record companies include Bloomfields movie tunes in his "Best of" albums?
