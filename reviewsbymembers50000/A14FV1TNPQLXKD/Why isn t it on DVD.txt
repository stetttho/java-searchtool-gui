  It amazes me to no end that some of the cheeesiest movies ever made are released on DVD months or even weeks after they appear in theaters. But a classic like "AFRICAN QUEEN" can sit in company archives and if released on disc would surely mean a nice piece of change in many pockets.  I wouldn't mind if it showed up on cable and I was able to record it with my DVD Recorder,but it hasn't even been broadcast in months.  How can this happen?
