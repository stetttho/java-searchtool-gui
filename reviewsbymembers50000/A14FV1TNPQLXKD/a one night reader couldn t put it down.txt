 I read Wolfen quite a few years ago,shortly after it came out in paperback.Not too many books have grabbed me and compelled me to read just one more page ,before I go to sleep.Needless to say ,I read the blasted  book in one day till 3 am.  The story is basically about a species of  wolf,The Wolfen,that are the basis of the werewolf legends.They are a  highly evolved species and you are allowed inside their pack ,you hear  their thoughts,what makes them choose their kills. They attack with such  speed,one character explains this by telling the two detectives ,if they  saw a wolfen,your throat would have already been ripped out.  As I said I  read the book in one day and night,I had just put the book down ,when my  dog came in and more or less indicated she had to go for a walk.In March  ,at 3am,my luck,I looked under every car in the parking lot,jumped at every  noise and couldn't relax till we were back in my apartment.  I hope this  book is published again,it really is terrific.Not at all like the movie.
