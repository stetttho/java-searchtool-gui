 I am surprised at the limitd amount of Bromberg albums available on CD.This "album" is really a combinatin of two albums,my memory escapes me on the one title ,but I still have a very old copy  of"BANDIT IN A BATHING SUIT",I may be wrong but I believe this  was the last album before the band broke up.  The band is so  versitle,blues,country,Irish fiddle tunes,dixieland and rock combined .  Every member of the band was given a chance to showcase his talents.  I  first saw the band at The Philadelphia Folk Festival many,many years ago  and have enjoyed its music ever since.  Hopefully some more albums will be  released of this talented but sorely overlooked group.  If you never heard  The David Bromberg Band,by all means get this album post haste.
