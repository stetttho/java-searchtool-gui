 I have Windows XP UPGRADE on my computer for about 3 months now and am very impressed. Some words of advice though,it doesn't seem very stable if you have win 98 installed,mine crashed terribly into a totally unrecoverable mess.I wiped my main harddrive and did a clean install of 98 then installed XP Upgrade,another horrible crash.After three failed installs I did a bit of research and then called Microsoft support,do yourself a favor and call the free support (it's a toll call but not very long) instead of calling 1 800 number where they charge [money] for same info.  Best is to reformat harddrive and do clean install,go into Bios and make the cd drive the boot drive install will start and ask for Windows 98 or Win me disc,then will proceed with install.I went with NTFS ,you have a choice FAT 32 or NTFS, FAT 32 is same file system as 98 and I believe Me too,NTFS is more stable but that's a decision you should make.  All in all it's a great system,great but not perfect,if you have older hardware like joysticks,(my Microsoft Sidewinder Forcefeedback Pro was unsupported)and make sure you download the current drivers for your hard ware.  Take your time,it's a great operating system.
