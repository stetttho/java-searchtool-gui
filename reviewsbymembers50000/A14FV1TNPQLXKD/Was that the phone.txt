 I can't stop watching this movie. I plan to have friends or relatives over for a first viewing and hide my cell phone nearby to ring up a disturbing end to the movie.  The story is about a disturbing video tape at a woodsy resort,seems TV reception is so bad the resort bought VCRs and supply guests with tapes (some bought ,some left behind).  Four teenagers rent a cabin,watch the tape,the phone rings shortly after the end of the video and tells them ,they have seven days to live.Seven days later all four die under mysterious consequences.  One of the girls that died has an aunt a reporter at a newspaper  (Naomi Watts) she hears about the killer video and decides to follow up on the story.She finds and views the tape and spends her time trying to solve the mystery before her time runs out.  I was so impressed with the visuals and the almost constant rainfall even the bizarre music ( if that ever is available ,I'll buy that too).  I've sen Ringu and it's great too but this version seeems more haunting plus Ringu doesn't have Naomi Watts.
