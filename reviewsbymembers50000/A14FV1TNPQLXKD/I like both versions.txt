  Dune (David Lynch or Allan Smithee ) versions,not the Sci-Fi Channel series,is a "love it" or "hate it" movie.  I read Dune before seeing the movie and was ready to watch Lynchs' version,I have seen movies based on books I've read and most don't follow the book too closely ( ex:Kubrick's "The Shining")so I was prepared for the worst.  I was very happy with the Lynch version and have watched it many times since,I also bought the soundtrack.After a few years I heard  of "the long version" and had recorded it when it showed  on Sci-Fi over two nights,then spent hours editing out the countless commercials.I was not satisfied,I was sure it had been censored and kept searching for The Full Version.  I was sooooooooooooo happy to find it listed on Amazon in February ,of course I ordered it and aside from the narration change by Virginia Madsen to I believe was Frank Herbert I am very satisfied.The longer version explores the history before 10191 and the reliance civilization had for "Spice"in religion and in space travel and the effects its production had on the people of Arrakis.  It is worthwhile to invest in both versions and be happy like me.
