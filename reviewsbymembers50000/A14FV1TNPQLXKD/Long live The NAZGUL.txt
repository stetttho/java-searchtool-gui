 I've read this book many times since I first purchased the paperback I forget how many years ago,each time I enjoy it even more than the last time.My poor paperback is falling apart and is taped together in so many  places.  Martin creates a legendary band,surrounds it with believable  characters and plot.  I  prowl through record and cd shops hoping oneday to  see a Nazgul album.Maybe some day.  If you loved the rock  music of the  late 60s and early 70s ,by all means read this book.   I want a copy in  hardcover this time.
