  Mash is a show that almost anyone who has seen either first run or in syndication loves. I remember watching it with my parents till I got a job that forced me to miss the last 3 years of MASH and that was pre VCR.  I have enjoyed watching it on FOX networks but I know I was missing something. I have every season on DVD so far and will order the 9th,10,and the final 11th season when they are available.  Every season of MASH is my favorite. I have one wish ,for someone to release the songs Col.Potter and the gang sang on the show.
