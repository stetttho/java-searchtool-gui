 This book is the best I have ever read not only because of heart stopping action, a great story or high lierary quality, It is because of it's ability to teach me something so interesting when taught in the correct  way. Shogunite Japan is one of the most interesting time periods that has  ever been. Yet it is also one of the worst represented. Clavell's book  shows us a view of the world through the eyes of a man used to living in  the sewer that was England at that time, and places him in the civilized  world of Japan. The novel is gripping and I guarantee once you have started  to read you will not be able to put it down.    P.S. Not many people  realize that Shogun is actually based on the story of the Japanese General  Ieyasu and an Englishman named Adams.
