 This pretty good, it has a good story, great in-game movies and adequate gameplay. However most of the marketing for this game has centered around it being a sequel to Red Alert. This is simply not true. The two games have  almost nothing in common and Red Alert is a far better game. In saying this  I mean that Tiberian Sun takes a huge step BACKWARDS in terms of gameplay  from Red Alert. Gone are the ships and air planes to be replaced by boring  helicopters and cheap "hover units".      However this game is  not a total waste it has a very good storyline and execellent cinematics,  featuring performances by several Hollywood stars (well maybe not stars but  close enough). The graphics are pretty good but other games have done  better.      Sure it's a classic and if you really like the series go  ahead and buy it. But if you want the true best strategy game of 1999, go  and check out Homeworld it's a far better game.
