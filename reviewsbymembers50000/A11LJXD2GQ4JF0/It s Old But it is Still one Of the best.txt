 This is the second best computer game of all time as far as I am concerned (only supassed by Half-life). The graphics are kind of dated now but the gameplay is still soild and loads of fun.  The game contains all of the  best gameplay while being intermixed with a good story. The levels are  designed very well and never seem to "feel" the same way  twice. Of course one of the best parts of this game is using the  lightsaber in regular gameplay or against six Dark Jedi. No other Star Wars  game has been able to capture the feel of the lightsaber like this  one. The sound effects are very good and the soundtrack is classic Star  Wars with perfect timings to get the right music for what you are  doing. I can't think of anything more to say than, if you haven't already  played this game, you are missing out on one of the greatest games of all  time.
