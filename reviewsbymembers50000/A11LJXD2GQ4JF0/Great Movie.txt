 I really like this movie, it was interesting, action packed and most importantly followed the Star Wars story line. Some people have critisized the Phantom Menace's plot though I think it is one of the best I have seen  in a while. Of course the main critisizm of the plot was that it seemed  unfinished. My answer to this is: well duh. Episode 1 is not quite as good  as the original trilogy storywise, but what can you expect it is basicaly  the first chapter in a story and first chapters are never the best. And hey  having a story that's "not quite as good as the original trilogy"  is still pretty good.       The acting is pretty good all around with the  only exception I can think of being Jake Lloyd (the young Anakin). I kinda  thought his acting left a bit to be desired with such lines as  "yippee", and "wizard". However this is more than made  up for by the stellar perforamnces of Liam Neeson (Qui-gon Jinn) and Ian  McDiarmond (Senator Palpatine).       In terms of special effects I still  can't believe that The Phantom Menace didn't win the Oscar. They were  simply incredible and no other movie effects in history has even come close  to the ones in Episode 1.     All in all I would recommend this movie for  everyone. It's a fun family movie but there are layers to it so as to make  it interesting for everyone. Have Fun!
