 This is the best game I have ever played. It is hard to explain and words hardly do it justice.    Half-life is a mostly scripted first person shooter. It is the scripting that truly makes it great. I still remember  the first time I saw 2 Marines jumping out of their helicopter and sliding  down the rope towards me. That was about the time I realized they were  shooting me. It's times like this when you forget you're playing a game and  begin to think you really are there.      I can guarantee that this game  will change the way you look at computer games. It is in a word  "Perfect". If you don't already own this game I strongly suggest  that you get it because if you don't like it you probably aren't from this  planet (I guess you wouldn't like because the game has some anti-alien  undertones).
