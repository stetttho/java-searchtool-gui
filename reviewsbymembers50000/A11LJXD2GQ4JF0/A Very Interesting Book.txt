 I unlike some others rather enjoyed this book. I thought that the first person perspective was handled very well. I also thought that it was a good idea to present the Jedi Academy series from a different point of view.        The story itself is very good and Stackpole once again shows he is a  master at conveying the feel of a fight through writing. This is one of his  best novels and I was gripped the whole way through, so gripped I finished  it in two days!      If there is one thing I don't like about this book  it is the fact it was released in hardcover a year before it was released  in paperback. I know it isn't the first book to do this but it is kind of  annoying seing it in a book store in hardcover and knowing you can't buy it  because it costs too much.      All in all this is a very good book and I  would suggest it for fans of Star Wars and non-fans alike.
