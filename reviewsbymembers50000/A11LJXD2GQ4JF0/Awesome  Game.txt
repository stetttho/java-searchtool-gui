 Well this is one of the few games where it's hard to find any problems. I loved Rollercoaster Tycoon and would recommend it to anybody, from a hardcore gamer to someone just starting to play games, this game is that  much fun.     The major strong point in this game is the gameplay. It is  VERY addictive and VERY fun. The graphics aren't exactly what I'd call  industry leading but hey they aren't supposed to be.      People will  undoubtably compare Rollercoaster Tycoon to Sim Theme Park. I my opinion  there is no comparison RT wins all the way, even though STP has more  features (3-D view, first person view, etc.). STP just can't capture the  fun the way RT does.     So Rollercoaster Tycoon gets my recomendation  for any age or skill level. Have fun!     Oh yeah and for a little  twisted fun try removing a piece of rollercoaster track in the middle of  the ride!  hehe
