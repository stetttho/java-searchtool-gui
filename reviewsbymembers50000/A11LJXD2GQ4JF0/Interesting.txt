 This novel is very interesting in that Arthur C. Clarke takes a completely different approach to the idea of Man being a space faring being, than in his other works. It's basic premise is that an alien race arrives on Earth  they eradicate war, racism and starvation. Earth is changed but then it is  discovered that the aliens are in fact planning something.      It is a  dark story, it can almost be descibed as the opposite of 2001. Yet it also  has some interesting simularities.      I would recommend this book for  most people though this is not A.C.C.'s best, check out the Rama series and  of course 2001, it is still a very interesting story.
