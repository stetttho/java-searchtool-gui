 When I bought Firestorm I was expecting a normal expansion pack - few new units, maps etc. But once I started playing I realized that there was much more to it than that.     The biggest improvment over Tiberian Sun is  story. The story is much more interesting and although the in game movies  suck it dosen't matter because most of the plot twists are in-game anyways.  Special units have been created just for one part in the story, such as a  huge robot, which is a nice touch.     Although the music is being sold  as faster paced and more like Red Alert it's pretty much more of the same.  Graphics also don't change too much.     The new units are pretty cool  but the Reaper is the only one that I really liked, unfortunatly you can  only use it in Multiplayer. The new Juggernaut artilery unit is alright but  it can't really aim that well and the Nod Art. unit is still superior in my  mind.     All in all Firestorm makes Tiberian Sun a much better game and  if you already have TS then by all means buy Firestorm.
