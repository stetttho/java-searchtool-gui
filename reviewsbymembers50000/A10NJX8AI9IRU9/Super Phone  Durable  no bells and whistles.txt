 If you are looking for a phone that can withstand dropping (twice) water, and dust, this is for you. Nice grip, classy design, I have the bumblebee version in yellow and black. Vibrate option, can use DC either as walkie-talkie or more privacy is optional by pushing a button and using DC as a phone where only you hear. Six hundred entries, web access, no color screen, but no biggie on that.    Buttons solid, phone is a little larger than most phones ,but worth it . Nextel service is great.!
