 This is a great phone...  1. Nextel is awesome in customer service. THis is my second phone, both were shipped within one day. I had them in 48 hours.  2. The PTT is great, you don't rack up minutes. My wife and I use this all the time, nice feature. In fact, don't get this phone unless you plan to use this a lot, otherwise this is just another phone.    3. Volume on this phone is great, speakerphone loud, but adjustable.  4. Tough little phone..good for cops, construction, firecrews, military, anyone in a dusty, hot, or extreme environment. I am none of the above, but drop my phone a lot and work it hard, and like something a little more durable.  5. DO NOT buy this phone if you are looking for great color in the screen, the latest in graphics and software, etc. It is a good, solid phone, period.It is not real fashionable, I have the yellow and black bumblebee model, but a nice solid feel.   6. You can have internet access, more bells and whistles if you want, but if want that stuff, get something like the i830, Treo 650, etc.   GOOD, RUGGED, DEPENDABLE PHONE!
