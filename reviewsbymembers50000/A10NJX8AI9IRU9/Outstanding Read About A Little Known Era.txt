  If you would ask the average high schooler today about this period of history, you would mostlikely elicit blank stares. Flint has done a masterful job of bringing this era to life. I particulary like what he has done with the Native American issues which treat them realistically, in the reality of that era, and without worrying about what is politically correct or installing some kind of revisionist history.  You won't want to put this one down, and I think you will find it is well done. No real faults, although the dialogue amongst characters is not as crisp as it could be...but all in all , a great read!
