 As a pastor, I really struggle with the growing trend every few years (Left Behind, Prayer of Jabez) of one person's take on the Gospel becoming the end all.   If this book stirs discussion, and guides your faith , great. However, in looking up many of the scriptural passages they are retranslated by the author (Self help is no help at all appears nowhere in scripture!), and endnotes are always more intellectually dishonest than footnotes, because authors know you will not look them up if they are not on the page.     Also, what kind of God can be manipulated by us "making Him smile?" do WE have that kind of power? And if God TESTS us by making bad things happen, what kind of loving God is that?    One thing for sure-Richard Warren is getting rich, and I hope this books is helpful to some, but next year it will be forgotten and something else will take it's place. Read Marcus Borg's "Heart of Christianity" instead, and he has footnotes!
