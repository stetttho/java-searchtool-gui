 When I heard they were releasing this, I was a bit concerned. Would the soundtracks be intact? Quality of the shows? Cut footage?   I am pleased to say that everything lives up to the bill. While a few minor scenes were cut, most of that had already been down for the networks upon reairings.   The music, 80's and pastels rock! "Smugglers Blues" is my fav!  Some bummers: Bonus material is pretty scarce, and the set up sucks..front and back of three cds, with no way of figuring out the episodes until you get into it. Nice packaging, but the CDs and formatting of order need some work!
