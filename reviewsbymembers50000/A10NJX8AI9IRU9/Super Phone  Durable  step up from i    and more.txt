 I have had several nextel phones over the past couple years. I have used the i530 before, this phone's predecessor, and felt that phone was great EXCEPT there was no way to ID callers without flipping open the phone and also there was no color screen. Presto! These features and more on the i560. Let me list pros and cons:  PROS  1. You have to love the durability of this phone. It takes a pounding, and is dust, shock, and vibration resistant.   2. It is MUCH lighter than the i530, i355, and many other Nextel "brick" phones.  3. Aforementioned color screen, Java apps, can use the internet, email, and text messaging if you so desire.  4. External called id screen with flip closed, shows caller, time, etc.   5. Plenteous ring tones and if you don't like what they offer you can download more.  6. Of course, DC/PTT is a biggie...you have to love the walkie talkie.  7. Black rubberized casing has NICE side grips to keep phone from slipping and and is sturdy. Meets military specs.  8. UP to 600 contact entries, what I like is it gives you under one contact home, mobile, a second home #, pager #, etc.    CONS  1. This phone is DURABLE, not a looker. If you want glamour, go somewhere else.  2. Buttons are flat in panel and while visible, and bright, are a bit easy to slip while dialing.  3. Phone has no bluetooth unless you get adapter and headset.  4. My battery gave me 145 hours talk time, slighty less than advertised, but it was a first use.   5. Screen could be a little bigger.  ALL in all, four out of five stars!
