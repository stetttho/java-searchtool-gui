 Ok, let's face it...you are a Nextel user, love the DC/GC, and use the phone for business or pleasure, but your phone is   1) Humongous Brick (I355, i315, i530, i325), but durable  2) Small (i830), but susceptible to scratches and tinny sound, and either not resistant to heavy use or just too dang odd looking to be a Nextel phone....   This is the answer! I have been using my i836 for a week-it is great! As a previous user of all the above phones, this is the best....feels lighter than the i830, sounds better, and the casing holds up better.  Comes with all the features...not only DC/GC, but web and message capable, bright color display, and a NICE case from Motorola for your belt, leather case, nice and easy access.  All the usuals....datebook, GPS, call listing, java apps, etc.   Hey, I can never go back to the bricks......this is a great phone! Five stars !
