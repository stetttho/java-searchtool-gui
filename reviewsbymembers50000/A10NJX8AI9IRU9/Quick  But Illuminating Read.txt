 Pun intended, but this does illuminate and  fill in a lot of the details of Dan Brown's Angels and Demons. It alphabetizes all the main characters and sites/terms in Angels & Demons, and provides a good background on church history as well as the Vatican, the artists Bernini and Michealangelo, etc. While not as detailed as books like Secrets of Angels & Demons, it does the job. For the lover of history, art, and/Catholicism.
