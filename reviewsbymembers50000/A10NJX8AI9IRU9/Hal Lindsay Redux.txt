 As a pastor, this book disturbs me. The primary purpose of the scriptures are not to predict the future, but to deepen our relationship with God.  Any baby boomer will remember Hal Lindsay's 'Late Great Planet Earth, in the 70's, which predicted the end of the world by the Soviet Union in 89. When that did not happen, it got revised. Gorbachev as the anti-Christ, the Pope as the anti-christ, books like this get lapped up in any crisis...same during Gulf War 1.  And, I happen to agree we need to have close ties with Israel, but we also need to dialogue with the moderate Muslim World as the President is encouraging, otherwise the killing will never stop.   Save your money, buy Marcus Borg's "The Heart of Christianity Instead"
