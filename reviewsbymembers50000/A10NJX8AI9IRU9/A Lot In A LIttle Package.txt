 Pros: This is a great phone. It can do everything you want, from   the direct connect to calling, speakerphone or not. But is also has Java apps, web access, and text messaging.  The color screen is bright and easy to read. Unlike other Nextel phones (I had the i530), this one has a nice screen to see the number calling before you open the phone. You can answer it with the flip ,or still decide whether to take it or not.   I have the bronze, it is a nice color, and attractive little phone.   The DC is great, volume levels super, and it is nice Nextel is finally providing smaller phones.   Cons: Buttons are a little small for big guy like me, and while the battery life is good, does need to be charged about every night..not a problemo.
