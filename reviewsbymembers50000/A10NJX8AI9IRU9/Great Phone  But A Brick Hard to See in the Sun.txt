  The phone itself is fine, and I got great reception. But I sent this back recently, for several reasons:  1. I live in the desert and could not see the color screen outside. It needs much higher resolution.  2. It is a an abosolute brick in size. It reminds me of cell phones in 1990. It is huge...but if you like durable phones, it will withstand a lot of drops, water, dust.   3. I have the i530 now, I don't like the bw text screen, but much smaller, and same durability.   A dissapointment, but some may like it.
