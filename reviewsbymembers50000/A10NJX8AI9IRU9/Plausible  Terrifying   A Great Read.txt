 I picked up this book not knowing it was alternate history. Wow! Gingrich and Forstchen take the well known battle of Gettysburg and add some great twists.  I won't rephrase what has been said in earlier reviews, you can get the general plot outline there. What I loved about this book is how the characters came alive in all their humanity...this is raw war, and it shows the reaction to war, the shock, the digust, the nerves, the vomiting, the loose bowels (sorry, but it is reality). This is not a caricature of heroes past, but showing them in all their honor, fear, glory, and humanity.   I also found myself thinking a lot ....what if? What if Lee had flanked at Gettysburg instead of Pickett's charge? What if he had won a large battle south of Gettysburg and threatened DC while essentially destroying the Army of Potomac? And what if after the fall of Vicksburg US Grant had been called east? (the next book I am reading now).  A great read, whether Civil War buff, looking for a good read, or military expert.
