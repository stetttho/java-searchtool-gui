 I read the book cover to cover. I was previously familiar with many programming languages and HTML development in FrontPage. I needed to learn ASP proramming. In the end, I did. I thought the book was pretty  high-level in too many instances. I needed to refer to web sites (which  there are many) dedicated to ASP development many times to find lower-level  details. As others have mentioned, the examples in the book (not the CD)  are code snippets and the author goes over every line each time the code is  presented. For some aspects of ASP used in the example, that's extremely  redundant after 2 chapters. Also, there are many references in the  beginning chapters to code that would be covered in later chapters. And  now, after developing some pretty sophisticated pages for a site, I rarely  refer back to the book.  This book is, to me, a beginner's book, but you  should already be familiar with HTML, web development, database access and  some tool like FrontPage for creating web sites. There are some typos and  mistakes, but they are minimal and should be obvious, even to a  beginner. I'd recommend the book if you already know web development and  programming in general and want to find out how to do it with ASP. It's  the only ASP book I've read or looked at in detail and therefore can't  compare it to others. How this helped you make a decision.
