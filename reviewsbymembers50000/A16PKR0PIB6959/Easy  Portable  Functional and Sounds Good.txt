 Got my wife an 20GB iPod for Valentines Day and she listens to it all the time. When it came to hinting about a Mother's Day present, she wanted these speakers.  I have an Apple Store nearby so I stopped in and they had them on display. I was concerned that that they are so small (like two other iPods on either side of the unit in the center) that they would sound poorly, but they actually sounded very good.  She got them this morning and immediately set them up. It runs on 4-AA batteries but I imagine she'll use the supplied AC Adapter almost all the time accept if we were to bring them someplace where there might not be a place to plug them in. She was amazed at how compact the unit was and thought the speakers were missing until I showed her how it flips open. They also supply a short adapter to connect an external device to the speakers as well as a lined case to store the speakers when not in use. So she "docked" her iPod in it, turned the power on, pressed play and it worked like a charm. It really sounded good. She moved the unit to the kitchen, put the volume maybe halfway up and we could here it all over the floor that the kitchen is on. Set lower, it can play without disturbing others. Plus, important for her (or it was when she was always carrying it around) is that it charges the unit. Maybe now with the speakers and it being plugged in, she won't be commenting that she forgot to charge the iPod again.  Granted it has only been 1 day, but she's already said multiple times today how cool it is and how good it sounds. That's all that matters to me! ;-) I'd highly recommend considering this unit to add to your iPod experience.
