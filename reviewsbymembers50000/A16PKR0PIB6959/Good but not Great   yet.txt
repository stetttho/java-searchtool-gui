 I've used Street Atlas for many years. The latest release isn't a significant upgrade from the previous version of Street Atlas. There are updates to changes made in roads and points of interest, but not much beyond that. I think the routing engine could use some work. I'd like to see a routing choice of "least turns" added so that it makes an efficient route with the least number of turns/roads. I actually own the latest Delorme Map n Go product and it does a much better job at routing between two points. The combination of the two products works well since maps are interchangeable between the products. The software works great with the Delorme Earthmate GPS and I imagine with most/all NMEA receivers. While driving I usually throw the Overview Map up in the corner and it would be nice to have a direction/speed window you could put up too (vs the very tiny text showing current speed and distance to next turn). The GPS Status window has the info (plus much more) but it's bigger and takes up more screen real estate then a direction/speed specific window would. Also, though you can set it for voice prompts as you approach turns, most laptops aren't loud enough to be heard over normal driving noises. I haven't looked at competing products since I first purchased Street Atlas so I can't compare the functionality and accuracy against products such as the Microsoft Streets. Even with all the minor annoyances, it's probably my most used product outside of normal office productivity apps and I would recommend it for folks looking for street level map data with routing and GPS capabilities.
