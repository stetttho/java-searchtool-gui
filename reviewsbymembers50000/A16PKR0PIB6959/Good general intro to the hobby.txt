 My sister-in-law ordered this for me for Xmas 2003 but it just shipped in April.  I haven't read the book but it seems to be a very good overall review of the hobby. The chapters include the following: 1 - Starting Off (A quick overview of the sport and its history) 2 - Cache On (Various web sites, cache types & TBs) 3 - The Technology (GPS, compasses and maps) 4 - Lost in Style (Map reading, using the GPSr,  5 - A Good Walk (Being appropriately dressed, food & water) 6 - On the Hunt (Loading the waypoints and finding the caches) 7 - In Hiding (Hiding a cache) 8 - Geovariations (Variations on the sport) Appendix A - Resources Appendix B - Outdoor Safety Many have joined the hobby, as I have, not as hikers enhancing their hiking, but those with a GPS and intrigued by finding caches most people don't know are all around them. If you fall into this category, you're likely not familiar with what would be common knowledge for those already consumed with the sport of hiking and the info provided in this book can help get you more aware of that portion of the hobby.  For those that are wondering what Geocaching is all about, it's probably easier to pick up the book and get a good overall feel without having to spend time searching various sites. The book isn't expensive and I'm looking forward to reading it and hopefully getting out of it some information that will make Geocaching even more enjoyable.
