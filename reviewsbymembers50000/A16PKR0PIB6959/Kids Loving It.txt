 Took a while to get it up and running. It's an older game and doesn't really support WinXP out of the box.  I got it to work by telling XP to run the game in Win95 compatibility mode. That at least eliminated a Indeo Codec message on launching the game which prevented it from getting past the error dialog.  Then I needed to update my video driver because it was leaving the intro image on top of the game (rendering it unusable).  After doing all that, the game is working well and both my kids (girls 7 & 9) are really having fun playing it. They haven't even gotten to the non-board game activities included on the CD. I'm sure they will play this often, ... it's a great deal.
