 I have a GPS V that I really like and this is one of the best add-ons for it or any Garmin GPS.  The GPS V comes with the required mounting bracket, and other models do too, but if not, you need to make sure you get it along with this. This friction mount is relatively small but stays well on all dashboards I've used it on. It's pretty flat so it travels well in a suitcase or carry-on bag. It allows you to position the unit in the most appropriate spot in the vehicle and then using the clap attached to the GPS, adjust the angle of the display so it's optimal.  Detaching and re-attaching the clamped unit with the friction mount couldn't be easier. For such a small and inexpensive add-on, I couldn't ask for more.
