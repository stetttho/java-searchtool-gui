 A readable but unremarkable story set in the pit of all excess, Hollywood.   This is not the first book with the Jimmy Gage protagonist, and it would be helpful to start at the beginning.  The story contains a few plot twists to keep it interesting, but they could have been more artfully done.  The Killer's ultimate motivation is never made clear.  In addition, the protagonist's coup de main's are executed just a bit too easily. This book is OK for the beach.
