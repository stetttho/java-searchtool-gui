 I ate up "December 6" by Martin Cruz Smith.  Smith is the author of "Gorky Park" and "Polar Star" with the Inspector Arkady Renko of the Moscow PD character.  I'm a fan of the Renko series.   "December 6" is a historical, intrigue novel set in 1941 Tokyo days before the Pearl Harbor attack.  The main character Niles is an American expat club owner who grew up in Japan.  He is neither totally American or can ever be Japanese, but he loves Japan and the Japanese.  Think Rick in "Casablanca" and you have most of the character.  The whole story takes place in about four days (with flashbacks for background) as Niles tries to get out of Dodge, avoid his enemies, and help his friends.  No good deed goes unpunished should be the subtitle. I'm a sucker for historical novels.  I found the pre-war Tokyo and China setting to be very interesting having been to Japan and read a bit on the political history of the period.  However, I believe the author verges on histrionics in his explanation of the embargo as the cassus belli.    Recommended.
