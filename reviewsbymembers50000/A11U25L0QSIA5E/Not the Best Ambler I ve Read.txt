 First, the review above is not for "Background to Danger". "Background" is about a freelance reporter named Kenton who down on his luck agrees against his better judgement (but not financial need) to carry some suspicious papers across an international frontier.  The story revolves around the difficulties of eventually delivering the papers. As with all Ambler's books set in pre-WWII Europe its interesting to read the author's explaination of the current world politics when he has no knowledge of the coming war.    The plot of this story is actually pretty thin.  We've all seen it before.  However, the original copywrite is 1934.  This must have been pretty heady stuff back then. This is not the best Amber I've read.  "A Coffin for Dimetrios" is probably a better place to start with this author.
