 This album was originally 'New York state of mind' availble in Europe and Japan.  I guess it was re-labeled after 9/11. Ms. Lee growls her way through the old chestnuts in this album swallowing her "R's" in a charmingly Japanese way.  Although listed in several magazines as one of the best jazz albums of 2002, it left me cold.
