 Fans of James Clavell's classic "Shogun" will enjoy reading of the historical figure the novel was based on. However, this really the story of western trade with Japan in the early shogunate and the east in the 1600's using William Adam's (Anjin Sama) as a "hook".  The Samurai William character does not feature too large in the narrative. Those interested in the subject, and wanting a quick read will enjoy this.  Recommended.
