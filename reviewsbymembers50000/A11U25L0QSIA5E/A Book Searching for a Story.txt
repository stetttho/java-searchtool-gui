 "Flu" is a quick, easy, read that skims over the 1918 Pandemic and introduces the reader to the current science of influenza. What I am most greatful for is the book's introducing me to Crosby's "America's  Forgotten Pandemic".   However, the book draws no solid conclusions,  and has no real ending.  It also leaves threads hanging at the conclusion.   (We are never told from what virus strain (H?N?) the recovered RNA  indicated the 1918 flu belonged.  Finally, the chatty biographies of the  books personalities were really annoying to have to wade through.  (Does it  really matter that Kirsty Duncan does Celtic dancing?) Pass this up and  go straight to "America's Forgotten Pandemic".
