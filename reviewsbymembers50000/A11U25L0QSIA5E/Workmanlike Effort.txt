 "Sensei: A Thriller" is an OK piece of edu-tainment.  Its a crime novel about capturing a killer that includes a lesson on kendo.   The author's prose is wry and at times amusing: "Long Island in the summer is like the Mekong Delta, hot and humid, but with more concrete".  This made reading the story easier.  However, the story takes too long to develop and ends too quickly.  The Japanese characters remain very stereotypical.  Oddly, this book violates the Thriller formula, in that it has no female love interest and no sex.  Women are mentioned very infrequently, and play almost no part in the story. The book is readable, but unremarkable.
