 While primarily a history book, it contains a decent explanation of the technology.  However, I thought it provided a substantial (~250 page) case study on the difficulties of building out a network with (then) bleeding edge technology and primitive engineering and management techniques.  There are many possible analogies to be made between this cable and the internet.  For example, The Crown just about financed its construction the way DARPA financed the early Net.
