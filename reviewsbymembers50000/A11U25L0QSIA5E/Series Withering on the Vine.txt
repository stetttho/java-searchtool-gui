 I've been growing less and less enchanted with the series as it goes along.  This continues its decline. Initially, the spectre haunting Rutledge held me fascinated. Was the Rutledge nuts or haunted?  However, as the series continues we get no deeper into Rutledge resolving his psychological conflicts.  (It would have been better, if he was just haunted.)  I assume he's going to have to visit every county in Britain, Scotland, and Ireland (at one book each) before its resolved. Also, this book continues the author's recent perchant for making the least credible character to be the murderer.
