 This is NOT the Second Series.  It is an over-priced, 10 episodes from the first half of the second season (the second half started airing in January 2006).    This is a particularly grim rip-off of fans, considering how the first season series DVD was so complete and comprehensive. (I really recommend the First Series DVD.) It is really venal of them to release this, trying to fool people into thinking it was the complete 2nd series.   DO NOT BUY THIS EXPECTING THE FULL SECOND SERIES.  This Faux 2nd Series will disappoint you, and leave you hanging.  Wait until the COMPLETE SECOND SERIES is available.  (I fully expect an equally over-priced "The Complete Second Series" DVD release.)
