 The Sennheiser HD580's are lightweight, and can be worn comfortably for a long time.  The sound is a bit 'Bright', reproducing trebles better than bass.  Potential cons are the 'Open' nature of these cans.  Your music will be heard by your neighbors.  Finally, the twin (left and right) corded cable that hangs in front can be an annoyance.  Why not a single cable entering on the side?  These cans are good, but not great.
