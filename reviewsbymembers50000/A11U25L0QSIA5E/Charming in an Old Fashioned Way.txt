 "The Levanter" is one of the original (copyright 1974) Terrorist novels that are very popular today. It is 1972 and the Middle east is changing (again), in response to the Israeli victory in the Six-day war and the pressures of the Palestinians refugees on neighboring countries.  The main protagonist is a western businessman, the owner of a firm long established in the Middle east.  A Palestinian group threatens the man, his family, and firm to use them to strike against Israel.  The man threads a tangle of personalities, movements, obligations, and politics to preserve everything he cares about. This is a good read from a historical point of view.  The author has a familiar, although now considered old-fashioned style (probably the result of much copying).    In fiction, it shows how little has changed in the Middle east in the last thirty-years.
