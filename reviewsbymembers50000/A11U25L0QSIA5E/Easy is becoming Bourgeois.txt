 "Bad Boy" is a traditional Easy Rawlins mystery, taking place in the 60's.  Frankly, I liked the earlier Rawlin's books cuz the character had more energy and had a more licentious life-style.  Easy's realization that Chesterfield's were killing him and he should stop smoking (despite their therapeutic effects after tight situations) is interesting, but reminds me too much of my own whitebread life.
