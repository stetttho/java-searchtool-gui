 I've purchased six of these containers to hold tea.    The containers each hold about 125 g of loose tea and are air tight. The body is sturdy and attractive looking.  The containers stack easily.  If I have a problem with the container, it is that the acrylic top is not very thick.  Its actually somewhat flimsy compared to the body.  The clear top of one of my containers has become 'crazed' with stress cracks.  In addition, another one has developed 'bubbles' in it, which I think came from Bergeumont (not known to be corrosive).  At less than $5 these containers would be a bargain.  At greater then $5, they are over priced.
