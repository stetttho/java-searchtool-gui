 PARTING THE DESERT is a quick read that will fill-in the interested on the Suez Canal.  However it reads more like an ode to Ferdinand de Lesseps and could have been his biography. Frankly, I believe the story would have been better told if there had been a larger discussion of the technology and management developed rather than the battle of egos that delayed the project. A better story of accomplishment is A THREAD ACROSS THE OCEAN by John Steele Gordon about the first transatlantic cable.  Incidently, both projects were occuring at the same time. A good filler for those interested in the politics of the French 2nd Empire, but, does not add much to those looking for the history of technology and innovation.
