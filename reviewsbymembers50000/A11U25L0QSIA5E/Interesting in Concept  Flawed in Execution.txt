 As interesting as a mystery set in Madrid at the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War may be, the stage setting can't save a book without an ending. The protagonist (Carlos) is a fine character.  However, he is joined by a pantheon of clichd men and women.  Carlos's development also suffers (possibly from a lack of another 75 pages).  How quickly would you expect a civil war hardened member of the Gardia Civil who executes a Communist women with his pistol on pg. 16, start sleeping with "Reds" and inviting them into his home? So, this novel is a good start for the author.  The period (at least in English) is underdeveloped.  However, the author has to learn how to successfully wrap-up in 30 pages, or at least don't dig the hole so deep.
