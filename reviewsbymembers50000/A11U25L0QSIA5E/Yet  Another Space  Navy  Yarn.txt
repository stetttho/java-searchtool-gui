 Overly verbose riff on the Royal Space Navy cliche. This is a quick read and has some interesting culture clash points to make, but depends too much on tedious soliliquies to keep the plot moving.   The tech and battle scenes seemed to have been borrowed from the LENSMAN series of EE Doc Smith.  Along the way, the author sets himself up a franchaise. It would have been good, if it was 100 pages shorter.
