 "Pattern Recognition" by William Gibson is a techno-mystery.  I'm hesitant to recommend it.  I liked it the same way I liked  "Riddle of the Sands: A Record of Secret Service" by Erskine Childers. "Riddle" brought to mind 1903, "Pattern" brings to mind 2003.    Everything in Pattern is bleeding-edge.  Action takes place in London (just left there), Tokyo, and NYC.   The (female) main character is like `Faith Popcorn', a professional trend identifier with major phobia's.  (In the real world she would be perscribed anti-depressents.)   A media mogul assigns her a quest to find the source of mysterious, compelling film snippets (The Footage) being anonomously posted to the internet.  The Footage is getting a cult following on the internet.   There is a background plot about her ex-spook father missing in the 9/11 attack.  Beautiful people, titanium iBooks, international cell phones, e-mails and websites, cryptography, the NSA and the Russian mafia all get mulched in to solve The Footage mystery and lead to the main character's personal redemption. I liked the way it was written and where/when it took place, not because the story was particularly well plotted.      So, I liked it.  But it was a better handbook on how to be cool than a techno-mystery.
