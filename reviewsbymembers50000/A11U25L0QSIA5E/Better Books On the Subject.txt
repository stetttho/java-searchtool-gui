 I was familiar with the late Dr. Weigley.    I had met him a couple of times.  He was a scholar.  However, A GREAT CIVIL WAR is not his best work.  Dr. Weigley was an expert on 20th Century Military and Diplomatic History.  He was also knowledgeable on the American Army.  The American Civil War was not his area of expertise.  While the text is brief, I found his frequent references to the 20th Century operational art of war out-of-context, and frankly not appropriate.  His analysis of the diplomatic aspects of the American Civil War are the best part of the book.  There are better books on the American Civil War.  However,  there is always something to be learned from Dr. Weigley
