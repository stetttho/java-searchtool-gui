 This story is well plotted and set, but the prose was atrocious. In general, I liked the story, with its intricate cross, and double-cross.  The setting was also well-done, although I remember Barcelona as shabbier and smellier.  The Katixa character was well rendered, but Pascual lacked motivation. What really hurt the novel was the clich??d and overly-intellectual prose.  This flaw was most noticeable in the beginning.  For example, there was the terribly over-used description of Katixa being ???lithe as a jungle cat???.  But, my favorite passage (This had me running to the dictionary.) is listed below: ???Pascual runs Benigno to earth in a grimy ???tasca??? in the Carrer del la Merc???e, with a crapulous demimonde clientele.??? The Thriller-reading public is generally not interested in building their vocabulary. Either the author needs to be slapped-up against the side of the head for writing this, or his editor needs scrounging for letting it be published in a Thriller.   (But, the author???s verbosity did teach me a new word: ???fellatrix???.) There is a lot of Terrorist inspired fiction market right now.  ???Lying, Crying, Dying??? is too flawed to compete with the best of them.  I think with at least as much concentration on his prose as his storyline this author may have some future potential.
