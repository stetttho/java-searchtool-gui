 I just finished (last night) "Kingdom of Fear" by Hunter S. Thompson.  He has always been a personal fave, but his later books have lacked the energy of the earlier works.   But, he can still turn a phrase.  "Its better to be shot out of a cannon, than squeezed out of a tube."   This book has the "jumbled" story lines that have appeared in his later work.  It makes it harder to read than it ought to be.   I shouldn't be reading HST while living in my current vortex of anger and frustration.  Know where I can get a Kevlar vest?
