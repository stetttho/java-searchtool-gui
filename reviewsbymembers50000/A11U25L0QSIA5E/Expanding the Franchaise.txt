 The plot of the Story very Chandler-esque with a bit of a James Ellroy hink.    However, the heavy 'oppressed negro' theme got quite boring. Mosley is a one trick pony with characters.  'Fearless Jones' is 3/4th 'Mouse' and 1/4 'Easy' from the Easy Rawlin's series.  Paris Minton is a riff on the 'Jackson Blue'(?), genius, cowardly, burglar who stole Jesus's savings character from Easy Rawlin's with a dash of Mosley himself. I think the author needs to decide, which series to go forward with.  I vote for Easy Rawlin's and not more of the same in Fearless Jones.
