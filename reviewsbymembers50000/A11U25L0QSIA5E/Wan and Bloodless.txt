 First, let me state that I have a lot of respect for Ms. Ullman as an Essayist on computer technology and techie org behavior. Being a refugee from geekdom, THE BUG: A NOVEL accurately describes the technology and socio-dynamics of writing software in those bygone days.  However, the novel is wan and bloodless.  Ms. Ullman's prose is crisp and clean to read, but it fails to convey strong emotion.  In particular, she misses the potential for the humor, ironic, puerile, or otherwise in the story. THE BUG: A NOVEL is a read that evokes in me a lot of nostalgia, but it is hardly, "gripping, exciting, and compelling".
