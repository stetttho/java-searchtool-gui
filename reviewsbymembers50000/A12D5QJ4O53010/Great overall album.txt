 This album is worth it just for the ballads: "Headed for a Heartbreak" and "Without the Night," which are both very powerful songs.  I think "Headed for a Heartbreak" is one of the best songs to come out of the 80's.   "Madalaine" and "Seventeen" will pump you up as well. All the songs are good with the exception of Purple Haze which is aweful.  That makes 10/11 songs good, with a few being excellent as mentioned above.
