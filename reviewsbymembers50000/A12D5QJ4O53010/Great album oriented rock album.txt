 First of all I have all of leatherwolf's studio albums, so I have a good feel for their sound.  Leatherwolf is a great underground 80's mellodic metal band.  The way they combine their three guitars and keyboards sets them apart from other bands.  Unlike their previous two self-titled albums (why they did that is beyond me), this album sounds more like arena rock.  God, I wish I could've heard them play this in a huge stadium!  Anyway, you can play this album from start to finish without having to skip a song.  I listen to alot of 80's metal and some 90's metal and there are not too many albums you can do this with besides any Ratt or Motley Crue albums, which are in a league of their own, in my opinion.  On Street Ready, there are some faster songs here as well as a couple of gems, namely the ballads:  "The Way I Feel," and especially "Lonely Road."   There are a couple of songs which are weaker and borderline cheezy, like Street Ready which tries to be "tuff" but isn't, and "Spirits in the Wind" which tries to be spooky or satanic but isn't.  Nonetheless they aren't aweful songs if you like 80's hair metal.  Taken as a whole, this album is very strong but should nonetheless appeal to any 80's metal fan.
