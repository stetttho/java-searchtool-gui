 For starters, I was dissappointed to find out that this book is mainly about the Big Island of Hawaii, although it devotes a few pages in the back of the book about the other islands.  Another caution:  there are many parcels of cheap land on the Big Island due to the volcanic, and seismic hazards to these lands, and one's exposure to vog, risk of tsunamis, or living with lots of rain.  Many areas of the Big Island lack electricity and city water.  The author of this book makes little metntion of these hazards and inconveniences, unfortunately.    There is also much "filler" in this book, things which, like the other review said, one could easliy find in a phone book or online.  Nonetheless, there are some interesting tips scattered throughout the book.  Overall, I think this book could have been reduced to a 5-10 page pamphlet with no loss in its utility.   I have also read Affordable Paradise and So You Want to Live in Hawaii, which, as far as I know these are the only books devoted specifically to this topic.  However, these books were somewhat lacking as well (in different respects), so you will need to consult many other sources in your quest to decide if you want to live in Hawaii.
