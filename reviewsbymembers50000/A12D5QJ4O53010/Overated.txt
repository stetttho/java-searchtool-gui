 Based on the previous 5-star rave reviews written here, I decided to give this book a try, especially since it's two books for the price of one.  But when I opened up the book, I discovered that you don't even get Mackay's complete book; you get just the chapters relevant to finance/investing.  Because I was reading the book primarily for insight into trading/investing I thought I would make do.  However there was very little of that to be found, and when it was found, it was typically written in verbose, archaic English, sandwiched between many pages of irrelevant historical minutea such as how exactly transactions were conducted in the 1700's.  There are a couple good gems, but nothing which has not been repeated in more modern books in much simpler language.  E.g. The Money Game by Adam Smith or Market Wizards, or Mindtraps by Barach or any of Tony Oz's books.  There are sooo many good trading books out there to read that reading this was a complete waste of time.
