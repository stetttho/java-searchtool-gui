 I paid $55 for this album on eBay a couple of years ago from a guy in Germany.  Since then it appears it has been re-released, which will give others a chance to learn how good it is at a much lower price.  If you are considering their first (1984) self-titled album, this one is far better.  In fact, of their three studio albums this one is the best, with Street Ready coming in a close second.  Their opener, "Rise or Fall" is an awesome song with some prog-metal elements in it, featuring great guitar work, which is not overdone.  The other songs are not prog-metal like in structure.  They are more straight, pure 80's metal.  "Cry out" is my favorite song, and is better than many 80's songs you hear on the radio.  Likewise, the incredible, tremendously moving ballad, "Share A Dream" is in a league with some of the best power-ballads to come out of the 80's PERIOD --- and I mean it compares with Skid Row's "I Remember You," "18 & Life," or Whitesnake's "Is this Love" and the like.   Moving on, I like "Magical Eyes" because it is a clever play on words: you can see it as either "Magical Eyes" or "Magical Lies."  The only weak songs on the album would be the cover "Bad Moon Rising" and maybe the last song, but overall this album ROCKS.
