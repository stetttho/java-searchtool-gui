 The first thing you have to know about this book is that it is written by a Rabbi and his wife, so you are getting a Jewish perspecitve on how to date smarter.  I am not Jewish and found their approach and much of their advice helpful, and you can too.  Because of this however, the book is a bit conservative on the issues of physical intimacy.  So if you buy this book thinking that SpeedDating is just an easy way to get laid, you are seriously mistaken.  Since this book was written by two people, it is awkward to read.  The reason I say this is the point of view changes constantly and I found this confusing.  In high school English class, kids are tought to use one point of view for their essay (even if it was co-authored) and stick with it.  Yacoov and Sue Deyo (the authors) fail to do this with this book switching freely between "I" and "We."    I found the parts on what to do on specific dates to be very helpful.  I also liked the idea of having a date coach, someone who you can talk with throughout the dating process.  Also, their description of various types of relationships, particularly the shooting star relationship was very helpful.  In fact, if Tommy Lee had read this part of the book, he would not have married Pamala Anderson after only knowing her for four days.  He would have also avoided a jail sentence and a custody battle which resulted from this tumultuous shooting star relationship.  That alone should be enough to convince you to buy this book (despite its awkward writing style)
