 First of all, the original release is 1984 not 1986.  This album is not as solid as Leatherwolf's other albums, but you can still play it without having to fast forward or skip any songs.  One of the problems with this album is I think they try too hard to promote a tuff guy / death metal image on this album which does not go over too well.    "The Hook" is my favorite song on the album.  It is not a ballad, just a straight metal song with a good begining.  The "Leatherwolf" song features some really cool guitar work in the middle which is very unique in all of my experience listening to the heavy metal/ glam metal genres.  Most of the songs on the album are okay -- there are no standouts and no weak points.  As much as I like leatherwolf (the band, that is), I would not recommend this album to start but I would go straight onto their self-titled 1987 release which is better produced and worlds better.
