 This album is great all around, with no bad songs. It is a must have if you even vaguely enjoy the eighties rock/hair-metal genre (e.g. Poison, Motley Crue, Skid Row).  Heck, I mostly listen to thrash metal (e.g. Whiplash, Megadeth, Slayer) and I even like this album!  This album still sounds just as good as it did back then!  (It is a good sign to see an album stand the test of time - we forget the bad ones and let the cream rise to the top, so to speak.)  Listen to this album, and it will also take you back to a time when big hair was cool and tight jeans were in.  Aside from the obvious hits "You Gave Love a Bad Name" and "Livin' on a Prayer, "my favorite song is the ballad, "Never Say Goodbye."  It has to be one of the best ballads of the 1980's.  This song ("Never Say Goodbye") still blows me away, especially the guitar solo towards the end that is out of this world.  It literally gives me goose bumps every time I hear it - seriously.  Psychologists say this is caused by the release of chemicals in the brain which create an experience likened to that of having great food or great sex.  That should be reason enough to get this album!
