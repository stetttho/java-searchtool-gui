 While much of what this Mr. Garrett writes can be helpful to someone new to the hobby of metal detecting (such as learning how to pinpoint targets, and how to dig for coins), this book must be read with these things in mind: 1) It is heavily biased since it is written by Charles Garrett of Garrett metal detectors.  He neglects to mention or picture other metal detecor brands. 2) Mr. Garrett's discussion on detector technology is largely obsolete. 3) Many of the claims presented in the book are highly sensationalized and idealistic.  Sure, the stories about people finding gold coins and hoards of buried coins are entertaining to read, but even my local coin dealer who sells coin detectors says he has never heard of anyone finding such items.   4) This book does not give a well-rounded view of the metal detecting hobby.  Mr. Garrett only emphasizes the good and the sensational, making it sound like anyone can make a lot of money metal detecting coins.  This is just not the case unless you make metal detecting your part-time job.  To find the good coins, you will have to spend a great deal of time researching (which Mr. Garrett mentions) and even then, you will have to dig a lot of trash.  You can spend three hours in a field and all you find is a button and a few current coins.  Garret's book gives you the impression that gold coins are buried right in your backyard.  This is simply not true.  Avoid this book, as it is nothing more than an elaborate Garrett sales brochure.
