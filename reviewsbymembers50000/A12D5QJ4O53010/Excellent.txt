 Buy this cd now if you are into 80's music.  I suggest getting the cd with the bonus tracks including "I Will Survive," a great forgotton song.  You will not regret your purchase as all the songs are fantastic.  What makes this album distinct is the fullness of their guitar/bass combination which permeates every song. Just listen to "Bastard," "Too Young To Fall In Love," and you'll know what I mean.  The louder the songs are played, the better.  This album is adrenalizing and exhilerating and an experience which you will not forget.
