 This book is great for someone who is a beginner in learning how to invest in individual stocks.   I bought this book because it was written by Peter Lynch and everyone knows he is a great stock picker.  Basically, the book describes how your "inside" knowledge and intuition about various companies gives you an edge over others.  It is well written and paid for itself.  I already doubled my initial investment in the stock marktet with one equity and have earned positive returns on all others using the tips described in this book.  I believe you can to.  After reading this book, get out of boring mutual funds and into stocks where you can earn some real ROI.
