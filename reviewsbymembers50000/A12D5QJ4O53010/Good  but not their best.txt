 I don't think this is the best ratt album out there, but it is certainly good.  It is slightly more homogeneous than their other albums, and I think this is because the whole album culminates into "Round and Round," which is a great song.  However, the best song is "The Morning After" which has a Zepplinesque drum beat.  The reason I don't give this 5 stars is because there are some weak songs here which don't belong such as "She wants money" and "in your direction."  "Scene of the Crime" is also a bitter song and ends the album on a sour note.  Nonetheless, the remaining songs make this a good disc.
