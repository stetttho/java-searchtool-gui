 I will say upfront that I have only heard one song on this album, and that is "Wildest Dreams."  When I first heard it on the radio, I thought this was some vintage previously unreleased Maiden that was part of some new compilation album.  But when I heard that this song is new, my mouth dropped.  I was blown away by the sound.   Music this good CAN'T be from 2003, can it?  This sounds like it is old school, true to their roots 80's style Maiden.  Maiden, unlike Metallica, at least adheres to the philosophy that if their ain't nothing "broke" with your music, DON'T FIX IT.  Unlike Metallica who went downhill after the black album in their sorry attempt to become "mainstream," Maiden sounds as good as ever.  I can't wait to hear the other songs.
