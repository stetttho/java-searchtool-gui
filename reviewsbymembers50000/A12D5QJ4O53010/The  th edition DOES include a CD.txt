 I am holding beside me a 6th edition with the CD in the back of the book. The 6th edition DOES include a CD, unlike what the previous review wrote.  I had to write this so others are not mislead.  Maybe some books people are selling don't include it -- what to do?  Just ask the seller if their book has a CD with it.  Mine does, and others do too.
