 This is my favorite piano album by far.  I have owned it for over five years and still love it!  People who like this record may want to listen to Kissen's interpretation as well.  Some of his playing I like better (like No. 12 which he plays more fluidly and with more grace), but overall Capanella's playing is fantastic! Liszt was a brilliant composer and when his Hungarian Rhapsodies are played by Campanella, it is MAGISTIC to say the least!  Her playing also evokes a tremendous amount of emotion.  Buy this album and you won't be dissappointed!
