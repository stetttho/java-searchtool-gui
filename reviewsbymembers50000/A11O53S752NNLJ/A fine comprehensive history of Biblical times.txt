 The value of this volume is threefold, and all are noteworthy.   First, Josephus' account of the historical events and people in Judea during the 1st century A.D. has no peer.  Josephus' facts are the most reliable from  any secular historian during that period.   Second, Josephus' histories  corroborate the Biblical accounts.  Josephus, a Jewish general captured by  the Romans during Judea's struggle for independence which ended in 70 A.D.,  mentions John the Baptist, the Herodian rulers of Judea, Pontius Pilate,  and Jesus Christ.  Josephus "fills in the blanks" by supplying  detail not mentioned by the New Testament authors and gives flesh, bone  (and blood) to the characters the Gospels and the Book of Acts relates.    Third, the translator, William Whiston, adds insightful and invaluable  footnotes throughout the text.  Whiston corrects Josephus where necessary  or gives the reader more detail in support of Josephus' assertions by  reference to other primary sources, many of which are no longer extant.   Where Josephus refers to Jewish customs, Whiston explains them for the  Gentile reader. Thus, this book is best used as a reference book, though  reading through Josephus' complete works is fruitful.  The book is fairly  compact for one containing 1000 pages.  The pages are thin, which allows  for its compact size, but which causes any highlighting or margin notes to  "bleed" through to the reverse side of the page.  The font size  is 10 point, which makes for comfortable reading on the eyes.  The  appendices contain very helpful charts, including one which lists those  excerpts from the Bible which run parallel to Josephus' chapters. This is  a great source book for any historian or Biblical scholar.
