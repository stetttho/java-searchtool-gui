 A well-written book which chronicle the last days of an aging revolutionary, Rubashov. The whole novel was set around a prison in which Rubashov was being detained. His crime - the most heinous possible - the  betrayal of the revolution. It is obvious, that he was falsely accused  (intimations of the history of the Soviet Union under Stalin).  In this  place, Rubashov began to reminiscene about his past, the betrayals of  individuals for the higher cause of the Revolution and the party. In  between, we witness his interrogation, first under Ivanov and then under  Gletkin. Throughout the interrogation, Rubashov was reminded of the logic  of the revolution where the ends justify the means and truth is whatever  that is useful at the moment. And in his own particular case, he must be  sacrificed for the good of the party and the Revolution. Using the  presuasion of this logic, first under the more urbane Ivanov and latter  under the more brutal Gletkin, Rubashov who has been wavering in his faith  of the party was convinced and hence was "sacrificed" in a  kangaroo court.  This book examines the totalitarian regime of Stalin  with its philosophy of convenience and its consequences. At a more personal  level, I found this book a chilling tale of morality when such a philosophy  of conveniece is adopted and our humanity is thrown away in the  consideration of politics. It is a must-read book to understand the dangers  of totalitarian regimes be they of the right or left.
