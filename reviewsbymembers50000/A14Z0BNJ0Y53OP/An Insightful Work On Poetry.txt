 Most of us are afraid of poems because as we read it, we can't seem to make head or tails as to what we have read. Therefore, for those of us who have "poem-phobia," I recommend this delightful little work. In  this work, Eliot ask the question of what is poetry and the use of  criticism in poetry as well as the relationship between the former and the  latter.  Eliot proposes to start the enquiry by reviewing the history of  criticism starting from Elizabethan era untill that of his time. Through  the course of the exploration, I was enthralled by Eliot's insightful  opinion of critics and their opinion as to what is poetry and its uses.   I was particularly drawn to the final chapter of his work which does not  offer any final word to the questions which he posed but rather giving us  advice as to how to read poems (in particular the modern poets, i.e., 20th  century). I was very glad to have read this work because it sure beats  reading a heavy college text on how to read poetry.
