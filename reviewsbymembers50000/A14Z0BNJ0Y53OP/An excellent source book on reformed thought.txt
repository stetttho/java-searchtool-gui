 This book gives an excellent overview of reformed theological thought from its inception in the 16th century to the 18th century. I have nothing but praise for the editors' selection of works which ranges from the well known  theologians such as John Calvin to the lesser known but equally important  theologians such as Turretin. The selection of the works are also well  balanced by not giving too much emphasis on any particular reformed  theologian.  The editors are to be commended for organizing the book  around the main themes of reformed thought and for the excellent  introductory essay on reformed theology at the begining of the book. I  believe this is a great help for those who are just begining to explore  reformed theology. Definitely a must-book for anyone who have an interest  in reformed theology.
