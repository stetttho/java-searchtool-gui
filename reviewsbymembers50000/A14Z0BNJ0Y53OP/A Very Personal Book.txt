 Although the letters found in this slim little volume was written to a young man, almost a hundred years ago, yet I found it  deeply personal. It is as if Rilke is addressing no one else but to me. I cannot but admire the  warm and graceful prose as well as the sharp insight which the poet has to  offer about poetry and life. It is a book which many a reader will return  to from time to time. I know that I would.
