 This book is the first of a series of five books that covers the historical development of Christian doctrines from the second until the 20th century.  In this book, Mr. Pelikan covers the development of Christian doctrines from the second until the seventh century which essentially was a crucial period in history of Christianity where early Christians struggled to formulate key doctrines, e.g. the Trinity, Christology, Anthropology, etc, that would ultimately shape the development of Christianity.  Mr. Pelikan has rendered the Christian community a great service through this book as it document the landmarks of the faith once delivered.  I highly recommend this book to any Christian who wishes to deepen his/her understanding of how and why Christians hold to certain teachings. This book is a welcome relief for any Christians who seeks to understand the historical dimension of the faith, thus enabling them to view how they are connected to the living apostolic Church from the early believers to today.
