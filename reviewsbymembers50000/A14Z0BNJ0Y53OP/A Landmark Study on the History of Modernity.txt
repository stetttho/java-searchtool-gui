 It has been said that to understand one's present, study the past. And this is exactly the strategy used by Toulmin in trying to make sense of our postmodern present. By studying the trajectory of modernity from it's  inception in the Renaissance to the mid-1979s, Toulmin has succeded in  demonstrating the "decline and fall" of modernity's  worldview. The most important chapter of the book, for me personally, was  the final chapter which argues for the need to adopt what he calls  "skeptical rationality" rather than the foundational rationality  of modernity.  All in all an important study of modernity which should be  read by any one who is interested in the zeitgeist of the present.
