 The Razor's Edge is simply a must-read book. In it, Maugham details the life of Larry (the protagonist of the novel) as a man who is searching for the meaning of life.  Perhaps what makes this book unusual is the fact  that it takes the perspective of the author (yes, Maugham, is one of the  character in the novel)as he observes the protagonist's quest. Along the  way, Maugham also delves into the action and motives of other characters as  a contrast to Larry.  At the end of the novel, as Larry expound on the  fruits of his quest, Maugham wryly observes, he is too earthly and  pragmatic to share Larry's vision. Yet, at the same time, he cannot help  but admire Larry's quest for meaning. I found myself agreeing with  Maugham. It is a novel which I would recommend for everyone to read as it  captures a phase of life which all of us would have gone through.
