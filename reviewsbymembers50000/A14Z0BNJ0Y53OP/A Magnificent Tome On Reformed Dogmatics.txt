 Spykman's tome on dogmatics (systematic theology as it is known in the US) is rather unusual. He organizes his work not along the traditional lines of systematic theology which usually starts off with a prolegomena follow by the usual topics on God, Anthropology, Christology, etc. Rather, his work is organized along the lines of biblical narratives such as Creation, Fall, Redemption, and Consumation where the usual topics of dogmatics are located.  Although unusual, it does give the reader a good overview as to how the dogmatic doctrines of Protestant (Reformed) Christianity are related in terms of salvation-history. More importantly, it makes this work easier to read and grasp as a whole when compared with the traditional approach of organizing dogmatics.  Coming from the Reformed (neo-Kuyperian) tradition, Spykman has shown an irenic temper by not over-emphasizing certain cardinal tenets of the Reformed tradition such as church government and predestination. By focusing his thoughts along the lines of salvation-history, Spykman has succeded in bringing to the attention of the reader the centrality of the Christian faith rather than the sidelines. All in all a very important work in dogmatics which should be read by Christians of different traditions, in particular, his prolegomena which gives some interesting suggestions as to how dogmatics should be done. A brief word of caution, this work is not meant to be read by someone who have no background on theology or at least a passing acquitance with dogmatics or history of Christian doctrines. You will get lost in the maze of discussion of this tome. For this reason, it is good if you read other works on systematic theology (especially those within the Reformed tradition) to get a grip on this tome. It is not an easy-going book because of its subject but a rewarding experience awaits the reader who takes time to digest it.  All in all, I recommend this work to anyone who is serious about systematic theology.
