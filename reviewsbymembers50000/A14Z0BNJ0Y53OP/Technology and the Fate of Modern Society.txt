 George Grant, is a subtle and penetrating thinker with regard to technology and the fate of modern society. In this slim volume, Grant in a series of essays details the need to find a way to think about technology, i.e., the way we view technology and its impact on society.  By discussing a diversity of thinkers such as Simone Weil, Nietsche, Plato and Heidegger as well as that on the issues of euthanasia and abortion, he has shown to us the historical fate of modern society which is infatuated with technology. The picture he painted is not pretty but I believe that one must have the courage to see historical reality as it is and not shy away from it. Only then, can we begin to look at ways to avoid the coming ruins of modern technological civilization. All in all, a very important book for anyone who is concerned with the fate of modern society.
