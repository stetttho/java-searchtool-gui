 There are many A+ certification guides to pick from and this was one of the ones I used. Probably no one book or source alone is sufficient to satisfactorily pass the two certification exams, but this book can be one of them. The other one I used was by Mike Meyers, "All In One A+ Certification Exam Guide." This book is strong in two important areas. First, it is concise, well organized and easy to read and to use for review. Second, the exam sim software on the CD was very good practice for the real tests. For detailed explanations and descriptions, you need to use some other source. But this is the book I used for my final review preparation just before taking the exams. The reason I cannot give this book a top rating is because there were some very major errors that were just plain wrong in the book. You can use the Windows 98 CD to boot and install the operating system, yet this book states otherwise many times. There were also other errors that I was able to detect because I had thoroghly read Mike Meyers' book. Still, this was a very good review and practice resource.
