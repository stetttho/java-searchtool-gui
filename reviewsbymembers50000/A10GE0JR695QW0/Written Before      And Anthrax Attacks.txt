 This book is amazing.  Dr. Osterholm has the knowledge and background in bioterror techniques to scare sense into any American.  What is most remarkable is that this book was written in 2000 before the 9/11 attacks and the subsequent anthrax mail attacks.  There are even quotes in the book from domestic bioterrorist suspects who threatened to send plague through the U.S. mail to their victims. You will read warnings about Osma Bin Laden and Iran, Iraq and North Korea.  When you begin to realize that most of the warnings have already come true, you begin to really become concerned that the impending biorterrorist small pox attack is an inevitability rather than just a remote possibility. All concerned Americans should read this book.
