 This book actually got me confused when I read it after taking the Microsoft Official Curriculum course.  I thought I understood most everything at the end of the MOC course.  Then while studying for the exam I read this Exam Cram and found myself in a worse position.  Week areas of the book include IPSec, security, remote access and routing. I found the book so unsatisfactory that I read and studied the Syngress/Osborne 216 book just get my bearings again.  Wish I could return the Exam Cram book to Coriolis, but wouldn't you know it -- they just went out of business.
