 This book has at least 50 good tips of useful information that go beyond any wizards.  Reviewers who say this book has nothing but wizards, probably did not actually read the book.  There are sidebars titled "Under The Hood" and "Real World" that provide explanations and suggested practices.  There also are sections entitled Note, Tip, Secutity Alert, Caution and Planning that provides additional emphasis and information.  The authors specifically state that "... this book is required when you want to do something slightly out of the ordinary--or when you need additional understanding of what a wizard is doing." (See page xxii.)  In my humble opinion, they accomplished that feat very well.  I have been using SBS since version NT 4.5 so I'm not a newbie.  Yes, some of the information may already be known to experienced users, but it is nice to have it all at your fingertips.  It also can validate your current practices and give you confidence that you are doing it right.
