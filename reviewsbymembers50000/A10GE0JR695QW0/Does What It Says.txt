 This book is great for a review.  It does what it says -- Exam Cram.  This book is great as a review resource.  No one should attempt to use this as a primary study guide.  Then again, it isn't meant to be anything more than what it claims.  This book can be helpful in preparing for the 210 Exam and I recommend it as a supplement to your study materials.
