 Scott Mueller's 13th Edition is the latest in his classic work on personal computers.  This PC hardware repair manual is the best on the market. Considering that PC hardware is designed, engineered and manufactured by so many companies around the globe, it is amazing that there even exists a single compliation that brings all these diverse hardware facts together in one book. This book is to the computer technician what an auto shop manual is to a mechanic.  You get all the details of the hardware so that you can work competently and confidently. The author is a dedicated expert on computer hardware and the computer industry is lucky to have him share his knowledge and to keep updating this usefull tool each year.  There is no other book that comes close to this one for PC hardware facts. Highly recommended.
