 Richly illustrated pages strewn between the tale of Leo Fender's company.  At least it was his company in the beginning until it was purchased by Columbia Broadcasting System in 1965.  Then in 1985, CBS offered the management of Fender to buy out the company for an amount that was just over liquidation.  If that had not happened, there would have been a much shorter version of this book because Fender would have been disolved. Fender went on to recapture its earlier successes by reissuing copies of its classic statocasters and the rest is history as they say.  It was amusing to read about how Fender had to go searching for vintage Fender guitars around the country so they could purchase them and take them back to the factory to copy them.  They had to buy their own manufactured guitars at steep vintage market prices so they could mass produce the copies. The whole story is facinating and makes for interesting reading about a remarkable company that stayed in business dispite some of the mistakes of its owners and operators over the years. This is a must read for any Fender owner or would be purchaser.
