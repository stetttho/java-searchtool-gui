 I have a huge problem with a book title claiming that it is about "ethical hacking" when it is anything but ethical. Of course, unless you are also a sixteen year old, like the author, and you get big kicks out of showing your friends how you can hack into your own computer. The book has a chapter on altering viruses so that they will not be detected by antivirus programs. Ethical? Not in my opinion. Most of the book is somewhat trivial, contains nothing new and is even mundane. The book starts out explaining how to hack into a Windows 95 machine that you have physical access to. As I read chapter after chapter, I kept expecting and hoping for something a lot more. Telnet for remote access, ICMP and NetBios commands are nothing new. It is more like a compilation of hacker/cracker website info. There are pages and pages of nothing but programming code for those who want to see under the hood of some of the tricks. I admit that I am not a programmer and could have cared less. The book is great disappointment. There is no central theme or purpose that I could determine. This book can't hold a candle to "Hacking Exposed" or probably most other books on network or computer security.
