 After years of meditation and studying, the Buddha was asked what he had learned from it all and he replied with one simple word - "awareness."     Meditation is thought to be the way to achieve enlightenment or awareness so it seems natural to explore what meditation is and how it is done.  Besides different techniques of meditation, there are also different types or goals of meditation.  This book explores the differences between concentration, awareness and devotional meditation.     Another type of meditation espoused by Steven Harrison is actuality meditation.  According to the author, "getting awareness is as simple as getting to where we already are."  There are no meditation techniques to practice.  Awareness is a fact of life that can't be started or stopped.  He tries to tell us "how to be in the moment."     This book touches upon some good insights about meditation, even if one does not accept the author's conclusions and the basic thesis of his book.
