 At 154 pages, this book is a short and an easy read.  You can tell that the author is also a lecturer because the book seems like it makes a few basic points that could have been projected on a screen using PowerPoint slides.  This book is not an intellectual analysis of data, but more like an inspirational pep talk. You are practically presented with an outline in each chapter, complete with bolded headings and sub-headings.  This book is also filled with poignant quotes from notable people spanning the ages of history.  This approach is appropriate and effective for this subject matter. The thesis of the book is simply find what taps into your creative passion in life and you will find the work you love.  The book actually does give you a methodolgy to follow to uncover what at first seems to be an amorphous task.  The "Focusing Questions" the author presents throughout the second half of the book is an opportunity for the reader to reflect and think about how this can make sense for him or her. The title of the book may be a little misleading.  "Finding the work you love" is not referring to actually getting the job.  The title is referring to finding within yourself what it is that you would love to do for your life's work. The audience for this book could be anyone from the high school or college graduate to the senior citizen.  Anyone who is not sure what contribution they want to make for the rest of their lives might benefit from a bit of focused insight and reflection.  Even if you are sure about what your life's work is, the book could still be valuable as a reinforcement that you are on the right path for you.
