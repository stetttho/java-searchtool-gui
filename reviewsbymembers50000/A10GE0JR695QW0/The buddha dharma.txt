 The best little book on Buddhism that is available.  Masterfully written.  This book needs to be studied, not just read.  It is worthwhile to read again and again. If you only read one book on Buddhism, then this is the one to read.  The author is an American Zen teacher whose clarity of explanation will appeal to the American Zen student.     Steve Hagen prefers to call Buddhism "the buddha-dharma."  He states that "It's a process, an awareness, an openness,  a spirit of inquiry -- not a belief system, or even (as we normally understand it) a religion.  It is more accurate to call it 'the teaching of the awakened,' or the buddha-dharma."     We start by learning the four truths:  (1) life involves suffering; (2) this suffering arises within us; (3) we can end the most profound and existential forms of suffering; and (4) the way we end this suffering is by following the eightfold path.  The existential angst we experience from the unanswered question of what life is about is at the heart of our suffering.  The buddha-dharma is like a journey.  By following the middle way we can reach enlightenment and nirvana.     There are three kinds of suffering, or duhkha:  (1) pain, both physical and mental; (2) change; and (3) being.  Our goal is to just see.  We must awaken from our confusion.  We need to see reality for what it is.     The eightfold path is a concrete way for us to practice bringing about the cessation of duhkha.  The eight aspects of this path are right view, right intention, right speech, right action , right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right meditation.     Nothing in this book is offered as something you are to believe.  Somehow through his life of contemplation the Buddha was able to formulate these notions.  They are simply a guide.  The Buddha can only point the way.  It is left for each one of us to find the way for ourselves.
