 If you never read one of the other A+ study guides, you probably would never know what you are missing. This book is way too short on explanations and the practice questions would never be enough to get you through the real exam. With that said, there is no good reason to spend any time studying this book.  There are too many other great alternative sources that can do all the things that this book cannot.  First, start with Mike Meyers' All In One A+ Certification.  Then, use the Syngress Osborne A+ Certification Guide Third Edition.  I breezed through the two tests with just these books.
