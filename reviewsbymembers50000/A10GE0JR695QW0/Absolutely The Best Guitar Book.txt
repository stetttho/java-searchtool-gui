 Having recently purchased a Stratocaster with Marshall amp after years of not playing, I needed a refresher on my chosen instrument.  What a wealth of information I found in this fabulously illustrated and organized book. Once I picked this book up I couldn't put it down.  It covers about everything you wanted to know that is related to guitar playing.  The author gives you a concise bio of 20 different legendary guitar players, a complete background of guitar manufacturing and specs, guitar playing, maintenance and repair, soundstage and recording.  You can jump around to whatever chapter interests you and read it in any order you desire.  Every single page is filled with information and no paper is wasted in this book. I challenge anyone to show me a guitar book that does a better job.  I've looked at a lot of them and this one is in a class by itself.
