 This is an engrossing book about the early Christian Church's struggle with defining the nature of Jesus.  What many Christians probably do not appreciate is that in the Forth Century, for nearly seventy years the Church hierarchy fought each other tenaciously regarding the views of a priest by the name of Arius.     The Arian controversy threatened to divide all of Christendom.  Radical Arianism believed that Jesus was not God at all, while Conservative Arianism believed that Jesus became God by growing in wisdom and virtue.  Interestingly enough, it was the Conservative Arians in the Eastern Roman Empire who believed that Jesus was not God by nature, but that he earned his deification by growing in wisdom and virtue.     The significance of this book is two fold.  First, it illustrates the development of defining the nature of Jesus and how one group happened to win over the other group, but it could have had a different outcome if not for certain historical events.  What Christians today take for granted as absolute truth is shown to have been a closely fought battle for hegemony and doctrine.     Secondly, it is only my own theory, but maybe there was some Buddhist influence in the Eastern Roman Empire that helped formulate the Conservative Arian view that Jesus grew in wisdom and virtue to the extent of deification.  Rather than reach nirvana, Jesus reached godhood.     The historical struggle of doctrinal views in the early Christian Church should be fascinating reading for both Christian and non-Christian alike.
