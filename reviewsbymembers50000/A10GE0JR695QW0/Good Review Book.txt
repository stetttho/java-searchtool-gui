 There is a lot of information packed into these little exam cram books. These series of books will never be able to teach someone how to be network administrator, but they don't pretend to either. There are no books written that I have seen that are the only study guide that you will need for the MCSE exams, with the exception of the W2K Resource Kit.  No one is going to sit and read those tech manuals because they will bore even the hardest core tech to death.  You need to pick something you will like to read so you can get an understanding of the subject area.  If you want it short and concise, the Exam Crams are pretty good.  Forget about any of these authors being a Nobel Prize winner for technical writing or even complete accuracy.   Coriolis just went out of business, so there are not going to be any more Exam Crams.  I used this book for review, but I also studied a lot of other sources.  I'm interested in passing the exams, but also learning the subject area at the same time.  BTW, the 215 was easy to pass.
