 The most striking feature of this book is its size.  Over 1200 pages covering hardware and software for the COMPTIA A+ exam is almost intimidating at first sight.  However, when you start to read this tome, it is actually a pleasure it is so well written. Mike Meyers is a knowledgeable authority, an able teacher and an excellent writer.  Sitting down to read technical information is not always interesting to even the hardest core computer afficionado.  The author's clear explanations and descriptions make the technical points easy to understand.  The added benefit of his writing style makes the material enjoyable to read.  No other book in this category brings all these strenghts together in one book. Even after years of using and building my own computers, this book had a lot to offer me.  Thanks to this book, I think I finally have a solid understanding of how the computer works.  I knew before what I had to do to build and get a computer working, but now I find I have a more thorough understanding of why it works. The test questions at the end of each chapter were very helpful as well as the practice exam on the included CD.  You may want to supplement this book with another book that has more test questions for additional practice. Some reviewers have criticized the book for the numberous typos and a few technical errors.  It is obvious that the editing of this book was sloppy and I suspect that there was a rush to get this to press in time for the new A+ exam, which this covers.  However, these flaws are really minor in comparison to the book's overall excellence.
