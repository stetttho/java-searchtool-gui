 Albert Einstein spent the last twenty years of his life attempting to formulate a unified Theory Of Everything (TOE).  Although Einstein was unsuccessful, physicists may now have reached that goal.  With the advantage of testing and measurements from particle accelerators and other advances in technology, modern day physicists finally have the tools that were not available to Einstein in his day.     Modern physics rests upon two foundational pillars.  Einstein's general theory of relativity provides a theoretical framework for understanding the macro universe of stars, galaxies, clusters of galaxies, etc.  Quantum mechanics provides a framework for understanding the micro universe of molecules, atoms and subatomic particles.  These two theories have been experimentally confirmed, but are at the same time mutually incompatible as they are currently formulated.     By substituting the attributes of subatomic particles as being one dimensional vibrating strings rather than as point-particle material constituents, the incompatibilities between quantum mechanics and general relativity are resolved.     The warping of space and time, the constancy of the speed of light, the expanding universe, black holes and the time just before the big bang all concern general relativity.  Planck's constant, wave lengths and frequency, and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle are the concerns of quantum mechanics.  Calabi-Yau shapes, eleven dimensions (ten for space and one for time) and M-Theory all concern string theory.     The quest for knowledge is a never ending journey not unlike our quest for enlightenment.
