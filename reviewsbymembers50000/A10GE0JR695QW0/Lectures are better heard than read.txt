 This short book is a collection of lectures given by this eminent physicist. Unfortunately, the content of the book reads more like a Sunday afternoon discussion than a serious and intense investigation into what the title of the book promises.  I always hate to be mislead and the title of this book is misleading to me.  If an author is going to be as bold as to adopt the title of his book as the "Theory of Everything" and the "Orgin and Fate of the Universe," then I expect something more than a recapitulation of a series of theories that may lead up to a theory of everything. The brevity of the book leaves so much unexplained.  If I had not already read other books about string theory, quantum physics and relativity, I would have lost the significance of the thesis as the author "tip toes" lightly over these topics. This is a book written by a brilliant mind in a complex field of study.  Frankly, I expected a lot more.  Perhaps the author was targeting a certain audience, which I was not member.  This is good example of going too far afield to reach a general readership.
