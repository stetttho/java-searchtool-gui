 Finally a movie from Tarantino! This is an awesome movie, period. Some people say it is too bloody, too much action, not enough story, etc. but that is not true! Kill Bill 2 takes care of the story aspect and as for too bloody...have you seen Reservoir Dogs? Pulp Fiction? Whatever. Kill Bill has amazing fighting scenes too cool to describe. So many memorable scenes and lines. Uma Thurman was also absolutely wonderful here along with the other wicked bad guys (or should I say girls). The Japanese release of the DVD is also better - it has more scenes, etc. and will be releasing in theatres in North America soon (according to Tarantino). WATCH KILL BILL!
