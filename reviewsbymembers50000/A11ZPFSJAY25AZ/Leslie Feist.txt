 Feist is an amazing Canadian artist, part of the Broken Social Scene group. She's starting to get a bit bigger now with various songs of hers playing in random places such as in stores, etc. The album is perfect if you're looking for soft, background music. Favourite tracks include Gatekeeper, Let It Die, Leisure Suite and Inside and Out. She's got a captivating voice. On a cold day stay in, light the fireplace, and turn up your CD player with Feist in it. Also check our her video Inside and Out (it's pretty cool).
