 I saw somebody else's review saying "The Best Series Ever" or something along those lines and I totally agree. This is one hilarious series. You really get to love the characters and everything goes along so well. The one camera, low budget, no laugh track thing works really really well and makes everything even more hilarious. There are so many memorable things here. This DVD package is great because it has everything put together. The special is a great finale to the series (very missed). BBC's The Office is something everybody can watch and fall over laughing with.
