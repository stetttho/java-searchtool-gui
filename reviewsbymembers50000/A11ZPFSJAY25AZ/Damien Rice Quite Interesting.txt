 I first heard his music in the movie Closer and I assume many people also first heard Damien Rice there. I was intrigued by the song in the movie (Blower's Daughter) and went to check out his album. There are quite a few really nice tracks here such as Volcano and Cannonball (great two guitar track). Those two are his most "normal sounding", shall we say, songs. The other ones are pretty interesting and different sounding. This is a album worth checking out - he's a talented guy and has a different style.
