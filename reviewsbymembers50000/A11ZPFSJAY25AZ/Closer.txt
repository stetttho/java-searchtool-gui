 I was very eager to see this movie when I saw the trailer and heard about it. Julia Roberts, Clive Owen, Jude Law and NAtalie Portman! I am in love with all of those actors but...not in this movie at all. It is supposed to be edgy, ground-breaking, fearless, tackling things like sex, cheating, etc. But it doesn't come across shocking or interesting. The excessive swearing and use of vulgur words stops being shocking in 10 minutes. Then you are left with these four people who are completely unstable. The idea of the movie, so I was told, was that the harder one tries to get closer to somebody, the further away they are from you. Sure. That works if you are these four individuals who do nothing but swear and cheat on each other so that they are all stuck in this crazy love square. There is no sense of connection or liking to any of the characters on screen so any time they cry, yell, smile (which is almost...never) the viewer just sits there blinking. The acting and script is awful. I don't know why Clive Owen and NAtalie Portman won awards over this (even though I love both actors). The movie just consists of "WHEN DID YOU SLEEP WITH HIM?" "I HATE YOU" "I LOVE YOU" "PLEASE COME BACK TO ME" "SLEEP WITH ME" "YOU ARE DISGUSTING" and on and on. The only thing that is watchable is Natalie Portman who is gorgeous in this movie (especially that end scene). But boo hiss to this.
