 The Notebook is...sappy, unrealistic, romantic and everybody wants to say "ugh, it's SO cheesy!" but everybody ends up liking it even though it IS very very sappy. It's a guilty pleasure but they make this movie in a way that gets you into it and feeling not so bad about liking it. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are great in this film (Rachel is absolutely gorgeous). They DID win best kiss at the MTV movie awards. Haha. It's a great romantic film to watch with your boyfriend/girlfriend os bunch of girlfriends. Guys will say "oh I was dragged to see it with my girlfriend" but secretly they will like it (hah). Don't watch it with people who will be like "this is SO unrealistic!" the entire time. It really ruins it because you KNOW it won't be realistic. It's just the "most romantic movie" ever!
