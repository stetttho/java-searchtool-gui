 The Incredibly True Adventures of Two Girls in Love is a really cute movie about two seventeen year-old girls and their relationship with each other. The two actresses are pretty good here - sometimes the acting is a little strained or unnatural but overall it's good. It's really cute and you just find yourself going AWWW. Basically, it's an essential movie to see/own in a lesbian collection. It also has appeal to everybody, not only lesbians. One of the better/best lesbian movies. Also, fans of Laurel Holloman (seen on The L Word TV series) will enjoy watching her here!
