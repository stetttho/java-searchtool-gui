 I used to watch this show when I was around 9 years old huddled with my older brother and parents in the middle of the night. It seemed like the middle of the night but in reality it wasn't late at all. Anyway, Tales from the Crypt seemed like a distant memory in my childhood - something that I really really enjoyed watching and missed. I saw a cartoon version on a kids station one day and it was the most horrible thing ever. So, it is about time this DVD has been released! When I watched the old episodes, sure, some parts seemed a little funny (such as the outdated cryptkeeper) but this series was definitely very strong and very good and includes many famous actors of the time. It's about time this was released!
