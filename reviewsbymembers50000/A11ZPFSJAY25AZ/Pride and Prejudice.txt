 Oh how I love this series. The book, on the otherhand, I did not enjoy so much. However, this is a great adaptation and is a lot more exciting. Darcy (Colin Firth) is wonderful of course and so is Elizabeth. The costumes are nice and the acting is great. The DVD doesn't have great features though and it's not very exciting. But, to just own this series on DVD is really nice.
