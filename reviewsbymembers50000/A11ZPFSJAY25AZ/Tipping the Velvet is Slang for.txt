 You'll just have to read the book to find out. But read it you really really must. Tipping the Velvet is the first novel by Sarah Waters and is extremely original. I read Fingersmith by her before this and was intrigued by her original story lines that make you jump, cry and laugh. Tipping the Velvet was no different. In this the storyline isn't quite so twisty and turny but you get really hooked onto the main character. The descriptions are amazing and put you in her shoes - in an exotic, saucy and interesting world. I can picture everything Sarah Waters describes as she puts the reader into a great journey.
