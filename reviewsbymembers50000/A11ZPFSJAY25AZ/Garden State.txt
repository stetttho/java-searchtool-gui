 Garden State is a great movie. It is very touching, funny, interesting and original. Zach Braff did a really good job directing this movie and who can help not loving Natalie Portman. Garden State also has an amazing soundtrack to go along with the movie. Overall, it is a really feel-good movie with memorable lines and scenes.
