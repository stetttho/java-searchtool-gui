 I am a very very huge No Doubt fan (mainly of their older music, though). I was kind of skeptical about Gwen going on her own and especially so when I heard it was a pop/dance album. I did like her first single release though (What Are You Waiting For?)!!!! That is a great track. When I first got the album I was really disappointed and nothing seemed that great. However, when I keep listening to it the weird but catchy beats and grooves really get to you such as Hollaback Girl and Rich Girl. This is an album that you can't really listen to normally and over and over again but it is awesome if you're dancing or at a party. The chorus' are just really easy to sing along to and remember, perfect for listening to with friends/in a group. It's one of those things were everybody will remember the lyrics and sing along to. Not the best album and certainly not related to No Doubt but it ain't bad.
