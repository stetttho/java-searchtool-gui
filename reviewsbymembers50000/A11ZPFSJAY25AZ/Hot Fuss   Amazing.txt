 The Killers are an amazing group and this album is awesome! My favourite tracks are Mr. Brightside and Andy, You're a Star. If you like music such as Franz Ferdinand (which is also great) then you'll also like The Killers. They've got an amazing energy to their music that makes you want to jump around and sing along. It's loud but not noisy and too hard. Very catchy.
