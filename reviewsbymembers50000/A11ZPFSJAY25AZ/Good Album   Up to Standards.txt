 I am a huge Coldplay fan and listened to their first album over and over again. It was one of those CDs for me that never got old and something that you could just listen to for a long time. X&Y is a good next album with some great tracks such as their single, Speed of Sound (their best song of the CD). It's a great album but I don't feel like it is as good or better than the first. If you like the first one, you will definitely still like this one - the style is the same. Just don't expect something to blow you away.
