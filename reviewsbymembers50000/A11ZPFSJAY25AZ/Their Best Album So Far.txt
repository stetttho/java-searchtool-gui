 "Set Yourself On Fire" is their best album so far. Plus it's one of the top albums of 2005 - that says a lot right there. They are also part of the Broken Social Scene group, along with Feist, Jason Collett, etc. The album has a good mix of slow and fast tracks (favourite ones including "Sleep Tonight", "The Big Fight" and "Celebration Guns"). Also great to crank up on a cold night and sing along to. Something that is unique is that there are both female and male vocals which adds that special oomf to the album.
