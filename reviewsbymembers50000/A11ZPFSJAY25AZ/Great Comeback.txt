 I was always a huge fan of Mariah Carey - big enough to buy her Glitter album. Unfortunately for all of us that was a real let down. Mariah Carey disappeared for a while but with Emancipation of Mimi she is having a great comeback. Her first single, We Should Be Together, is a great track and goes back to what she is good at. There isn't a trashy, trying to be young, getting skanky feel to this album. There are still some hip hop tracks with Jermaine Dupri, Nelly, Snoop Dogg, Pharrell, etc. but they are good (especially It's Like That). Some of my favourite tracks are also: One & Only, Shake It Off and Fly Like a Bird.
