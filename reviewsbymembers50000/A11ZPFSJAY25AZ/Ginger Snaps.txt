 Ginger Snaps is one of the best teenage/werewolf movies. The werewolves are, I admit, a little campy but they get better as you watch Ginger Snaps 2 and 3. Plus what werewolf movie isn't campy. That though, does not matter. The story is touching, interesting and amazingly witty and funny. The two sisters have an amazing bond and the chemistry between the two actresses are great. I'm a big fan of Ginger Snaps and it definitely deserves to be a cult classic. There is a Special Edition DVD sold in Canada and that one is the DVD to buy. It has special features and is a lot better.
