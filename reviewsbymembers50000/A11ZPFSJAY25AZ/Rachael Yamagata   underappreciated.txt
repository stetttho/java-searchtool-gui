 I first heard Rachael Yamagata in the movie Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants and was absolutely in love with that song in the movie (Be Be Your Love, which I think is the best track). I went to get her CD right away and was so surprised that she isn't more well-known. She has a very sultry voice that is extremely captivating. She has kind of a warm, relaxing voice similar to Norah Jones. But, she's more upbeat then Norah Jones such as with tracks 1963 and I Want You. But then there are those tracks that make you want to sit back and relax and just listen to that gorgeous voice (I'll Find A Way, The Reason Why). There's a mix of jazz, lounge, pop. This is definitely worth getting and listening to. Her EP is also a great addition if you like this type of music. I hope to see her more often.
