 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was the worst out of the series so far. I did enjoy the first few very much but this one was not as good. I still finished the book very very quickly but Harry in this book bothers me very much. This whole adolescence/teenage attitude does not work. He is much too abrupt and odd in this book that many people find him not likeable. Harry is growing up but the characterization of him in this book is just weird and annoying. However, it is still a very popular book and you just "have to" read it if you are a fan of the books. Hopefully the next will be better.
