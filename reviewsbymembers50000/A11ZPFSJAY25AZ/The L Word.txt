 "The L Word" is a great series about a group of lesbians in LA. The characters are all so interesting and they all have amazing chemistry. Also, the show appeals to all different people. By far, Marina (Karina Lombard) and Bette (Jennifer Beals) stand out the most, in my opinion. You find yourself in love with one or more of the women and dying to catch the next episode. How convenient when you have the entire season on DVD. The puppet show (extra feature) is also SO hilarious. I can't be the judge to say how realistic the show is a portrayal of lesbians in LA (although how realistic is Sex and the City, etc.) but all I know is is that I love the show. Can't wait to get Season 2 on DVD (out soon!!!)!!!!
