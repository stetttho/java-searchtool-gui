 I first heard KT's track "Black Horse and the Cherry Tree" on the radio and found it rather catchy. I got her album and was very impressed. Her music is similar to Rachael Yamagata and Sarah McLachlan and there is no doubt she has a beautiful voice. Her tracks are also great if you play guitar and/or piano and like to sing along. A few of those tracks have a really groovy and catchy beat/tune that makes this album stand out. Keep your eyes on KT Tunstall.
