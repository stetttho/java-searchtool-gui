 I saw tons and tons of people reading this book on the subway every day so I decided to go out and buy it. It really was a great book and worth reading. Yann Martel writes about an adventure one boy has by himself on a boat with a slew of animals. It's an amazing journey and the ending is absolutely wonderful. The only thing is I didn't get the feeling of absolute genius or the feeling that I had to keep on reading. However, it is a very interesting book and definitely worth reading.
