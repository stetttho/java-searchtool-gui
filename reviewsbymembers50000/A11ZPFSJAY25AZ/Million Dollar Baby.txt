 This was an amazing film and definitely deserved Best Picture and Best Actress. Hilary Swank did an amazing job in this movie as the determined female boxer. Clint Eastwood gives another great hit. In the beginning some people feel like it's just another one of those glorious boxing movies but it really isn't. Of course I don't want to ruin any of the story but it's really really touching and moving. Be warned though, this is one of those movies that will leave you feeling sad and bad. Have another happy movie to watch after this one! But it's a really great movie - good directing, acting, story.
