 I was at the specific concert that this DVD was filmed at (Afterglow tour when she was in Toronto). All I can say is Sarah McLachlan is absolutely amazing live. There are no words to describe her performances. Not only that she has a beautiful voice, etc. but the concert experience is amazing because she doesn't just deliver each song as it is on the CD. There are variations, buildups, climaxes...just amazing points in the concert where you feel like you are going to explode and yell out I LOVE YOU SARAH MCLACHLAN. This DVD is a great capture of the concert and has a very good live CD that comes with it (constantly listening to it!). The extras are a little skimpy but it is definitely worth watching and McLachlan live in concert is enough to propel this to five stars.
