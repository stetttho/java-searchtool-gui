 BBC does it again. The first time it was Tipping the Velvet, a much more saucy book and TV adaptation. This time, Fingersmith is more subtle but is marvellously done. If you are a fan of the book, then you will not be disappointed at all. At first glance I thought the two lead characters didn't really look like I would have imagined them to be. But as the movie went on they really grew into their characters and everything was wonderfully done. I thought it would be hard to do because the first part and second part of the book are in two different views of the two girls but the TV adaptation did a good job of that too. Costumes, sets, acting, accents, were all great!
