 Maroon 5 hit it big with their song This Love, which I admit, was a catchy tune and I did like it and sing along. However, their album is not very solid. They've got tracks that just seem really plain and like filler tracks. The other single which was Sunday Morning is a nice song. But their other single She Will Be Loved gets on my nerves. The lead singer has a high nasaly voice but it didn't bother me in some of the songs. But in that song and some others it does. So I can't really listen to this album for more than one rotation for example so it ends up sitting there in the corner. If you like She Will Be Loved (assuming you've heard it on the radio or something) then the album should be fine but for those that don't really enjoy his voice all that much this album isn't strong.
