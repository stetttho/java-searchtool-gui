 Kissing Jessica Stein is a great movie - it's funny, cute, etc. It is definitely one of the best lesbian movies...a feel good one. This is one of the movies that has appeal to everybody and is made like any other wide-release film versus small indie lesbian films. It is an essential to have in a romantic/comedy/lesbian collection.
