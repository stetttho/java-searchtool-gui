 Being a big fan of Alias, I love Jennifer Garner. Daredevil wasn't a great movie but I found that Jen was really beautiful and cool in it. So, I was pretty excited to see her star in Elektra. But what can I say? The story is...ahhh, so cheesy and so bad. The acting...the everything! Nothing is great. The only thing that can pull the movie through is looking at Jennifer Garner! But how long can you do that and be entertained? Also, that would have been easier to do if her costume wasn't that ugly. Lots of people wanted the traditional costume back that wasn't seen in Daredevil but it didn't look good! Sigh. No comment.
