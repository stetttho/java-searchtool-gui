 House of Flying Daggers is a very solid asian movie and I was glad it was released in North America. There are beautiful scenes of cinematography and costume design. The fight scenes are done very very well (the best one being when Takeshi Kaneshiro shoots his arrows at the four guys surrounding Zhang Ziyi). To make things better there IS the beauty of Zhang Ziyi and Takeshi Kaneshiro. However, the thing I have against this movie is that the ending is so entirely cheesy in a bad way. It gets a little overly dramatic and you kind of sit there like HAH. There is less fighting and more "romance" but in a cheesy way. I would definitely recommend Hero over this and comparing it to another asian hit, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, this movie is worse in comparison. However, still a great watch.
