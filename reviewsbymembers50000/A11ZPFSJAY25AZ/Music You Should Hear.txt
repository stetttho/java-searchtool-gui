 I first saw Tegan & Sara on Amazon's "music you should hear" section. I really like their album. So Jealous is a great followup to their previous record If It Was You and takes it to the next step. Their music is like a punky-indie-rock-pop and their vocals sound something along the lines of Gwen Stefani on crack. (That's not a bad thing). I had this CD on heavy rotation when I first got it. The only problem I would say is that because of their vocals some people may not be so into their sound and may get a little sick of it after a while. Anyway, definitely check this CD out.
