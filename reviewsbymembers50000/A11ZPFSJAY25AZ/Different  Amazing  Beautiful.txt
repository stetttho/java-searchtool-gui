 Metric's new album Live It Out is different from their last album. In a good way. Their sound is better. Less high-singing Emily and more flipping out parts, more guitars, more rock. There are times when you want to just get on your feet and jump and spaz out and dance. Metric has definitely brought it to another level in this album. To be perfectly honest if you asked what were some of my favourite songs I would name off basically the whole CD. If you lived their last album I think you will like this one even more (as I did). Also, if you get a chance to see Metric live (they are on tour right now) then DO SO. They are amazing. Emily Haines is beautiful. Their new album gets 5++++ stars.
