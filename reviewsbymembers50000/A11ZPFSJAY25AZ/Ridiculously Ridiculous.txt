 But I'm a Cheerleader is just a ridiculous movie but it's also hilarious, touching and cute at the same time. The main character, Megan, is a little "off" because she listens to Melissa Etheridge, has a picture of a hot girl in her locker and doesn't enjoy making out with her boyfriend. So, her family and friends decide that she is a lesbian and sends her to a "rehab" centre to teach boys and girls how to be straight. The movie is very funny and has two great lead actresses.
