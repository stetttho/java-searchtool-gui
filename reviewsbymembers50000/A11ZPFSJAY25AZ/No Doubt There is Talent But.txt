 There is no doubt that Jack Johnson has talent and that he has some great tracks. Sitting, Wishing, Waiting is an absolute hit and I love that song (learn to play it on the guitar!). I was excited for the album but it's not very original. His songs sound really similar to each other with only one or two that are different. I am a fan of his and there is no doubt that he's a great musician but In Between Dreams just isn't AMAZING. For new fans of his it certainly lives up to standards and you won't be disappointed.
