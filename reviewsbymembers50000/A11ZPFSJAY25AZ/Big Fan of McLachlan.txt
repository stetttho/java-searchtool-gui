 I am a huge fan of Sarah McLachlan and was so excited to get another album of hers. The reason I didn't give it five stars was because I feel like it still can not compare to her old albums with classics such as Sweet Surrender, Building a Mystery, I Will Remember You, etc. However, it is still a very solid album with beautiful songs (my favourites being Fallen, Stupid and Train Wreck). I think at first you feel a little disappointed but as you listen more and more to the album it really grows on you. Afterglow is also one of those albums where you can continue to listen to for a long time without getting bored of it. Fans of McLachlan will not be disappointed and it's clear that she will continue to attract fans both old and new.
