 Okay, the first time I tried to watch the movie I couldn't get through 20 minutes. I sat there thinking WHO IN THE WORLD WOULD FIND THIS MOVIE FUNNY. But then, the second time, I watched it with a group of friends and was forced to sit there in misery. Well, I wasn't in so much pain after all. You really have to watch this with the right group of people. Some parts of it are, I admit, quite great and hilarious. I can now understand why some people find it so funny. However, I'm still not a fan of this movie.
