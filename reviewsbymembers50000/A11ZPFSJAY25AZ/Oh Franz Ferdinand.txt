 When I first listened to Franz Ferdinand's first album I was in love. I was so excited for this release. Indeed, it lived up to the Franz Ferdinand sound. It's groovy, great and fun to listen to, makes you want to stand up and jump, etc. The problem I have with it is that it sounds similar, actually, the same, as their previous release. It's hard to change your sound but it's a big deal when your music sounds too similar. If you liked their first album there is no doubt that you will like this one. But, just be warned that if you're looking for something new, you won't find it.
