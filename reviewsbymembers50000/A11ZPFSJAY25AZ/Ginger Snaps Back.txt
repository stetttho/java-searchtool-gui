 This third movie is a great addition to the series. Although it has nothing to do with the other two in terms of timeline, story, etc. the movie still stands well on its own. The scenery is very beautiful and the entire feeling of the movie is eerie and has a good atmosphere. The story drags a little bit 3/4 of the way and the other male characters get to me sometimes. ALso, this lacks the humorous scenes found in the first Ginger Snaps. However, the girls (Emily Perkins and Katharine Isabelle) are still amazing and I love the strong sisterly bond. Costumes are also great. Definitely worth watching if you are a fan of the series.
