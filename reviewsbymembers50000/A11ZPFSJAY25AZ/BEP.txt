 Black Eyed Peas is a great group who creates original music with catchy beats, great grooves and they've got Fergie, a great female voice. This is a solid album with lots of tracks and each one of them is interesting and different. You can listen to Monkey Business dancing in your underwear. Basically you can't help but groove along. Great tracks: Don't Phunk with My Heart, They Don't Want Music, My Style, Gone Going, Disco Club. Okay basically, there are a lot of great tracks. Buy this album and dance and sing along!
