 I am a huge White Stripes fan and so glad they came out with another album (with rumours of their splitting, etc.). Anyway, this is a different sounding album - there are less guitars, more pounding pianos...a really different sound. If you are a fan of only their released singles then this may not be the album for you but if you are a full White Stripes fan then I think it is still a great album. Very interesting indeed.
