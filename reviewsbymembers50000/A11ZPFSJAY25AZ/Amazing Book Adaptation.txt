 I loved this movie! I am a huge fan of the book series and found the movie to be just as good, if not even funnier. Jim Carrey did an amazing job as Count Olaf and made the movie so hilarious. The children were great (SUNNY WAS SO CUTE) and the entire feeling and atmosphere of the movie was absolute brilliant. The costumes were very well done. This special collector's edition DVD is worth getting.
