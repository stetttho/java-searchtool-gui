 Yes! Volume 2 ties the Kill Bill series together so nicely. It fulfills the classic Tarantino dialogues and storylines. But it also has amazing fighting scenes reflective from the crazy first volume. The fight between Elle Driver and The Bride is crazy and is the best thing ever. The movie becomes surprisingly very touching near the end and the soundtrack goes SO well with it (take a listen to those songs, by the way). Some people found it too slow (volume 2) but if you watch the first and the second together, which is what was meant to happen, it works perfectly. Amazing movie. Great action. Great story. Great acting and characters. So memorable.
