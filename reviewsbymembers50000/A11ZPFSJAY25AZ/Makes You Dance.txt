 And I'm not a dancer. Anyway, I first heard Controller.Controller live when they were playing for free at UofT's frosh week concert. I was really getting into their music. So, I picked up their EP and it's amazing. Great energy, great beats/grooves. If you like music by Metric or Franz Ferdinand I think you would like Controller.Controller. This album is obviously too short and the only thing I would say is that their tracks are all fast on this (because it's their EP). Their new album "X-Amounts" comes out TOMORROW (October 11th, 2005). I'm hoping that it's amazing. Check this out, people!
