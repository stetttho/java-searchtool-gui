 Fingersmith is another amazing novel from Sarah Waters. At first I thought I would find the language a little tedious for me but it turned out to be beautifully written. The atmosphere she creates is great and the characters are just so loveable and engrossing. I don't want to give anything away, but this is the first novel that made me go @#$*!@#$)! in the middle of the night really loudly and that says something. It was really well written how the first part was in one girl's view, the second was in the other's and the third both. Basically, it's a very very engrossing story with twists and turns. I most definitely recommend this book!
