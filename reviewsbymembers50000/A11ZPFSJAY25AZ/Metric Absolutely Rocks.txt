 When I first heard IOU over the radio I was totally captivated. Their album is amazing and has catchy tunes, great lyrics, a funky/rock sound and excellent vocals. Definitely get this album and you won't stop listening to it. Also, if you get the chance, catch Metric in concert because they are amazing live.
