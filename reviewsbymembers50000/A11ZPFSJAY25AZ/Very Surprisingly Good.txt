 I'm not a big fan of popish music but this was a nice surprise! I heard a track of hers in Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants (she is on the soundtrack) and I checked her out. Natasha Bedingfield has a nice voice and her album has catchy grooves and nice tunes. There are some really pumped up songs (such as I'm a Bomb, Frogs and Princes, If Your Gonna) that make me want to go out jogging (which in fact this is good for).
