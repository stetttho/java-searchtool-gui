 This is a great album. I first heard Jason Collett's older tracks (such as Blue Sky) but didn't really think it was anything really special. Lately I heard him open for Metric. His music was obviously different than Metric's and the crowd was a little impatient to see Metric hit the stage. But, I picked up his album afterwards and realized that it's really amazing. He has a great voice and this album has a great summer-y, light, happy feel to it. My favourite track is "Fire" and to make things even better Emily Haines (lead singer of Metric) sings in "Hangover Days" with him. His music is rock-country. But don't get me wrong. I don't like country music but it's just a great mix of acoustic guitars, great vocals, etc. Give it a listen!
