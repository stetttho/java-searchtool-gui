 Not many club tracks can be considered as classic. Most of them are forgotten or sound obsolete after a year or so. This track is definitely one of the special tracks. Originally released in 1999, this track was played by anyone from Digweed and Sasha, to Oaky and Seaman and more.  The CD single was released somewhere in 2000, and contains the best mixes for this track: the original mix and Bedrock mix - both full version (no edits here). The original mix is a combination of deep tribal house with a mesmerizing indian(??) chant, not something you hear everyday. The drums are not punding and the unusual bass line gives a strange feeling. The bedrock mix takes the original version and turns it into "cut the crap" mix; a tech-trance sound that might smash the dancefloor, yet still keeps the spirit of the original track. I liked the Bedrock mix more than the original , but you may think otherwise. In any case, this single is a must for any lover of club music. A track that you can listen to in your earphones and sink into the deep, or dance yourself off in the club.
