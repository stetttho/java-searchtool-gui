 I don't think that Depeche Mode could select a better title for this album than "Black Celebration". To my opinion, it's DM darkest album  ever, and one of their best. The whole of this album is much more than  the sum of it's parts, and DM thinks like that too, because most of the  songs on this album are connected (not exactly mixed).Begining fast with  "Black celebration" and slowly lowering the BPM through the evil  "Flys on the windscreen" and the fantastic (best track on this  album) "Question of lust" you will find yourself sinking deeper  into the mysteries of this album. A break in this dark trance will be  "Question of time" and you'll start drifting again...Very  strange, very kinky.A dark experience. About the songs : 3 major hits  here, "Question of lust", "Stripped" and "A  question of time". However, "Flys on the windscreen" could  be a not less bigger. In fact, DM are still playing this song in their live  concert. The last song in this album "But not tonight" is a  bonus track found on CD only (in 1986 they still had to add some bonus  tracks so you will choose CD over vinyl...), which is a very good one. The  UK edition contains two more bonus tracks (a remix for "Stripped"  and a strange version for "Black celebration"). I wouldn't double  the price for these two tracks. A must have for all the lovers of the  80's dark and gothic new wave sound.
