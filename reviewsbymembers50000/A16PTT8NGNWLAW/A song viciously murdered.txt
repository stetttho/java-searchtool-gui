 When I've heard "In your room" for the first time while listening to the "Songs of faith and devotion" album I was sure it is going to be a single sooner of later. To my opinion it is the best  song in the album, and one of Depeche Mode's best songs. The song had the  sound of the classic DM - the sound that made these guys a legendary pop  group. So when the single went out, I wasn't surprised, and I went to buy  the cd-single the moment it arrived to the stores. I was dumbfounded. The  single remix is the most evil thing someone can do to a tune! Instead of  getting a brilliant DM track, you will get a boring rocky version that  lacks all the darkness of the original version, and sounds like a bad cover  from an unsuccessfull rock band. This song is fantastic, so go and buy  the album. Don't waste your money on this thing.
