 Two warnings: 1. This is NOT a trance album, not even a "real" house album. This album takes you more to the chillout side of dance (i.e. Ambient-House). 2. This album is addictive. You may find yourself in a  position when you can't click the eject button to take the CD out. Sasha  & Digweed are considered to be the most respected and of the most  sophisticated DJs today. Listen to this CD and you'll know why. The CD is  a chillout mostly, begining with two 'real' ambient tracks (FSOL's  "Cascade" is their best track ever) and slowly builds up to a  harder beat with tracks like "Obsession" and a fantastic remix  for William Orbit's "Water from a vine leaf" (yes, Orbit existed  before "Ray of light"). Surprisingly, the tracks begin to mellow  down a little towards the end, unusuall for mixed CDs - but puts you in the  right mood, with tracks from Apollo 440 and Banco de Gaia (a very fast mix  for "Last Train To Lhasa"..).  One thing that I must mention :  This is only half of the story. This edition (the US edition) contains only  one CD! I have the UK (original) edition that comes with two CDs. The  second CD is a bit more trance like, but is as good as the first. I wonder  why they sell it a single CD  here (probably to sell two seperate CDs and  make more money).
