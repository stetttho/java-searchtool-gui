 To give Sasha & Digweed a rate that is less than 5 stars, makes me  feel like a sinner, but in this case there is no choice. If you want me  to sum the review in two sentences, I'll say that when S&D release a  new album, I expect it to be innovative and different. This one is not.  Besides, it's not going anywhere - when your'e listening to the last track  of each of the CDs, you feel like listening to the first one - no  excitements. And yes, the mixes are great (but no re-editing like in  previous compilations by the duo), but the track selection hints that maybe  the guys didn't work too hard to find the new stuff - most of the tracks  can be found on most of the other new compilations (See Dave Seman's latest  releases), or are simply other mixes for tracks found in previous  Sasha/Digweed releases. Bedrock's "Voices" appears in two  versions here, the slacker's mix is interesting, and Bedrock also remixed  "The Baguio track" that ends the first CD. These are the most  interesting tracks in my opinion (if you have the US edition, you'll get  Sven Vath's "Barbarella" which is a very good track, too), but  besides that, most of the tracks are, simply put, not interesting. The  duo says that they wanted to give the sound of what they are playing in  "Twilo", but a 70 minutes CD is not an 8 hours all night set that  you can build slowly, so at the end of the CD you feel that you are just  begining to warm up. Too bad. I hope their next one will be better..
