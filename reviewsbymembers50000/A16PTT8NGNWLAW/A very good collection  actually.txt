 First, this album is not mixed, thank god. I'm really starting to get tired of all the mixed CDs. Even samplers of other record labels are mixed today, why? I want to get the whole track when I pay for it... Well, I  had to get it of my chest, here's what I think of this album: The tracks on  this album moves between progressive/deep trance and techno, and that's  good. You don't get much of these today. Some of the famous names in this  label are Humate and L.S.G (Oliver Lieb, for you) amd these two names rule  the album with 6 out of 12 tracks. My favorite track is the John Digweed's  remix for Humate's 3.2, it's a 9 minutes deep track that starts with a 4  minutes music without any drums (a great choice to start a mix set..) and  then the beat rolls in. The first track on the cd is also a great one,  Humate's "Burning Man" is a nice combination of Techno and  Industrial but also a meldic tune. L.S.G gives a typical massive track  (Freak Me) and a surprising lowbeat trance track (Fragile Pt. 2). Other  notable tracks are by Thomas Shumacher (wallbreaking techno, what else) and  a collaboration between Humat and Rabit in the Moon. I really see it as  one of the good compilation I have, but I warn you : you will not find your  standard ATB/Alice Deejay/DJ Jean stuff here, it's a harder album and you  may want to listen to it for more than once until you get into it, but it  worth it.
