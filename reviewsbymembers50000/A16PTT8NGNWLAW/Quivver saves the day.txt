 The new Trancesetters single, has much in common with its predecessor - both are common and not so exciting house tracks. However, this single has one exception, and that's the John Graham's Quivver mix. Quivver mix are usually very good, and this one really makes this single worthwhile, with a progressive trance sound, filled with lively percussions and enrergetic sound (with a hint of vocals). The rest of the mixes are more house type, and though they are all different from the original mix, none of them is notable. So basically, if you want to buy this single for one track only, then it may worth it. Otherwise, not much to look for here.
