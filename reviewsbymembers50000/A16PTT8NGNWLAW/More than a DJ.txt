 Well, it seems that Sasha had decided to go further than just DJing and mixing and decided to start produing too. After listening to this EP, I've reached the same conclusion that I've reached when I've heard  "Northern Exposure" for the first time. This guy is more than  just a DJ - he's an artist. Except the radio cut for "XPander",  all of the tracks are very long (10 minutes and up) and yet do not find  them boring. Instead, they really do what they were meant to do : put you  in a trance. All the tracks are absolutly fantastic, and I don't think  you'll find a respectable trance collection CD that doesn't have one track  from this EP. XPander has the best potential to be a radio hit, but my  favorite track on this EP is "Bellfunk". Sasha is not afraid to  put stop to the beats in this track, and so you get 2 minutes of a dreamy  chillout sound in a middle of a really poundy track. "Rabbitweed"  is a fine tune too, and Baja is a bit different, starting slowly and  climbing up. I believe that after this EP Sasha will become a very wanted  person in the production studios as he is on the clubs. You should really  try this EP and experience a sophisticated, non cheesy trance and  progressive house sound.
