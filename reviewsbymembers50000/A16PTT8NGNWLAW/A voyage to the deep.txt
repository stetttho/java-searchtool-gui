 Breeder's first Maxi CD is one of the most annoying things. All the versions on this CD are edits! So actually, you don't get to hear the mix from begining to end, but it is either faded out in the middle of it  (literally in the middle), or it starts at the 3rd minute...The only way  you can get the full verion is by purchasing the vinyl. This is also the  reason why I gave 4 stars to the CD instead of 5. To the music now : 3  tracks here, the radio edit, the Breeder mix edit and Slacker mix edit. The  radio edit is a cut frmo breeder mix. The Breeder main mix is deep and  massive, with a non standard beat and gradually growing into a very big  sound that is simply unresistible. No wonder Sasha & Digweed chose it  as an opening track to Northern Exposure Expedition. The Slacker mix edit  is even deeper, and really goes between the low bass and the wooshing  sounds of deep trance. Breeder are, to my opinion, one of the leaders in  deep trance today, and this track shows you why.
