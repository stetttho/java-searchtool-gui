 No doubt - one of the more fascinating tracks of 2000/2001. Deep bass, ominous melodies with a dark and twisted sound make this track a fantastic tune to dance to, and to listen to. 3 tracks on this single. The first one, by James Holden, is the best - with wooshing sounds, fantastic percussions and a hit frightning(...) breaks. No wonder why John Digweed plays this mix in his last Global Underground compilation (LA). This track is the main reason for buying this single. The Mark Shimmon mix is another interpertation of deep trance with a little more melodies, and the Katcha mix gives the supplies for the trance lovers, with a happier and faster remix. Now I'm waiting for the next release of this guy with the teeth breaking name. Listen to it and you'll know why.
