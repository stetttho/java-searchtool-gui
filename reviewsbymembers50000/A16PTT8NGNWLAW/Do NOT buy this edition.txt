 When I saw that this single is out in US edition [at this lowprice] I've purchased it at once. When I recieved it, I've placed itat my stero system and turned the volume up. Less than 10 minutes after, I took it out of my cd player, and I don't think I'll play it anymore. The cd is a continues mix!  The only reason I'm buying singles is because I want to have the songs and mixes from begining to end! The songs are not from the begining to end and mixed with each other, so you can't use them for your own mix.
