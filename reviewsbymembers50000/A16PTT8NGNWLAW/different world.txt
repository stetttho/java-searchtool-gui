 The remix cd contains 3 different mixes for this track by today's top DJs. Every DJ gave his own sound to the track, and none of the remixes is even close to the original, lowbeat version. Is it better? Depeneds if you like  club tunes. I liked the mixes, and I can't compare the to the original -  it's simply a different thing. The ATB mix is the disappointing one. You  can hardly hear the unique ATB sound in that mix, and for some reason it  seems as if the vocals are not synchronized with the beat...It seems that  ATB didn't have any idea for a remix to this song. The Ferry Corsten  remix is simply a killer. Corsten managed to bring his smashing club-trance  sound to the tune, added a great melody and still kept a link to the song.  This is the hottest track in the cd. The subsonic legacy remix is a  fantastic track too. It is not a floor burning track like ATB's and  Corstern's remixes, but it really sounds like a Moby track. You could place  this track in Moby's "play", and you would think it is one of his  "real" tracks. The sound reminds me something between  "Natural Blues" and "Run On". So it's a great mix  too. It is really a successful remix cd, and it gives new life for this  track.
