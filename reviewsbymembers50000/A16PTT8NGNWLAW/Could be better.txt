 Something is happening to the underground dance music during the last year. Something bad. Besides the fact that it is not an underground music anymore but a commercial stuff almost like Britanny Spears, the deep trance is dying and instead comes the deep/progressive house. The problem with this style is that it is not really interesting. It's very repetitive and dull, which makes it good for starting up a set, but later you must change the style of music in order to make the set worthwhile.  Since there is nothing unique in the type of music there is also nothing special in any of the mixed CD released in the last year or so by some of the greates DJs today. Can you really tell the difference between "Global UnderGound Amsterdam" by Nick Warren, GU Nu Breed 4 by Sander Klinkenberg, Renaissance Desire by Dave Seman or this album? If I had all of these albums unlabeled I wouldn't know who mixed them. And that's part of the problem. Not that it can't be different - checkout the Latest Danny Tenaglia and the John Digweed's releases, and if you are lucky to own it, the "Planet Progressive" by Cass. So what do we have? We have an OK album. The mixing is flawless, but I've expected different stuff from Van M. All of Jimmy Van M releases were progressive trance, but this album is standard house, no more - maybe because it's a "Bedrock" release. The first CD is more house, yet more progressive and interesting, while the second CD tries to be a bit more "trancier", but somehow can't lift up from first gear. Notable tracks: John Johnson - London,Night Stalker - Mo Shic and Zeiden, Quivver (of course....) - One last time. There are no bad tracks here, but no excellent tracks either. At the end, you get an album that won't rally excite you nor really disappoint you, like the other albums I was talking about. Simply passes you by.
