 This was my third Cure purchase. After "Disintegration" and "Staring at the sea", and eventhough it's a remix album, I've found it mostly beautiful. Some tracks are simply extended radio mixes,  like "Lullaby", "Fascination Street",  "Lovesong" and "Hot Hot Hot". So basically - these are  longer versions for the songs. I really liked "Lullaby" and  "Fascination Street". These versions are long, but not  boring. The other songs are remixed. "Close To Me" brings a  surprise by introducing a slow and funky drum machine, but this takes  something out of the song (liveliness...). "Pictures of you" does  the same, but sounds nicer, maybe because the original song was a lowbeat  too. "The Walk" and "A Forest" are also including new  vocals, and I liked them alot. I guess that many people won't like that,  but I think that the versions for these songs are better than the  originals! Unfortunately, the last 4 songs are not as good as the first  7. "Inbetween Days" is simply a waste of time and the new track  "Never enough" sounds more like a forgotten B side. Mostly,  this album does the job, and you will find yourself listening to it many  times.  A small note : The audio cassette edition contains a version of  "Why can't I be you", which does not exist on the CD. That's too  bad, because it's better than few of the tracks in the CD.
