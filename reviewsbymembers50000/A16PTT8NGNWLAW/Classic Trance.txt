 Binary Finary released one single. It was released in 1998 and was called "1998". The track was so good, that all of the big names in the club scenes remixed it, and it had two more releases "1999" and  "2000". All of them are remixes for the same tune. To my  opinion, the "1999" is the best. It includes the original mixes  from "1998" and some new mixes. The "2000" edition  contains new, but not so hot mixes. The CD begins with Kay Cee radio mix.  A good selection for a radio mix. It has a euro-trance sound that the  lovers of ATB/Alice Deejay/Ayla will fall for. It has the clear and slick  prodution of today's euro-trance. The 4th track on this single is the  extended mix by Kay Cee which is, of course, better than the radio  edit. The funny thing about the original mix, the second track, is that  it is the less interesting sound is this single. It is true - the original  version is not so hot. The Matt Darey mix has the familiar sound of Darey  - strong and a bit slow drums that rocks the room. Lot of energy in this  mix. But THE mix on this single, the one that made "1999" such a  hit is the Paul Van Dyk remix. PVD took the original mix and injected it  with steroids. The PVD mix is a fast club-trance mix with a break in the  middle with a rising that will drive any clubber crazy..PVDs mix is the  best reason to buy this single. The last mix on the cd is Marc Et  Claude's Answering Machine Mix. It is as it sounds...An answering machine  over a strange mix of this track. Interesting. Overall, this single shows  that good mixes can totally change a tune. A great trance tune, real trance  - not house, that will make you move weather you like it or not.
