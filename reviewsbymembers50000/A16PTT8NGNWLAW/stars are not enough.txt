 Wow! And I really mean it! If you want to know why Sasha & Digweed are the most respected (and successful) DJs in the world, listen to this CD. This CD shows how a good DJ can create a set that will put you in a  trance (eventhough it's a chillout album, not trance) just by building the  atmosphere around you as the music moves along. The mixes are amazing,  you can't really know when one track ends and the next starts, but the  songs are totaly different from each other. The album begins with mellow  sound of Gus Gus and Phurry Phreaks (it's Chicane, actually...) and moves  to a harder beats like Uberzone (a killer track) and hybrid.  Another  thing, most of the tracks on this album were remixed by these master DJs,  so even if you have the original tracks and remixes, they do not sound the  same.  The whole of this album is much more than the sum of its parts.  It's, without no doubt, one of the most wonderful albums I've ever heard.  Just close your eyes and start floating. You probably see that the  avarage rate for this album is 5 stars. So I'm not the only one who think  that about this album. BUY IT!
