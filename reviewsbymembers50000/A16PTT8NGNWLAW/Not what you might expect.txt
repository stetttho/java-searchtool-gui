 Well, I bought this album after listening to tracks like "Shine" and "Heaven will come" (The club mix). I had some kind of expectation from this album, and I'm sorry to say I was disappointed.  Except "Forgiven" and "Shine" which are the club tunes  in this album, the rest of the tracks are very slow and kind of Enigma  style, but not as good. Even "Heaven will come" appears in a low  beat version here. So why 3 stars?  The answer is the second CD, which  contains remixes for the album hits, and was mixed by Paul Oakenfold. This  CD can make you move, and I've found myself listening to this CD most of  the time (and to "Shine" on the 1st CD). If you are just  looking for the hits, go for the Maxi CDs. Otherwise, you may find this  album a little disappointing.
