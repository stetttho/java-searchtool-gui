 I don't know if it's me or Paul Van Dyk. It seems to me that PVD had become a little soft in the edges, making his tunes a little too commercial (especially "Tell me why") and becoming a big star. Perhaps it's  because that trance had become such a popular trend and I'm moving to  deeper sounds, I don't know. This maxi cd is a proof and a disproof of my  opinion. The main track :"Another way" is very melodic and a hit  like, even more than "For an angle". The sound is floating and  the beat is good, a great track for a party, but I'm not sure that you'll  ever hear it at 3 am. On the other hand, the AA side track (once, on  vinyl days, double A sides singles came with side A and side AA...)  "Avenue" is a hard trance tune, with less cheese and more bass  and energy. This one will be played by some late night/early morning DJs.  The remixes of "another way" are good, too. They take out most of  the softness of the radio mix and club mix and make this track more  interesting. At the bottom line, if you are a PVD fan, most chances you  won't be disappointed. More than that, I guess that this single will  introduce PVD to a larger audience. And again, I can't finish without  some comment on the edition : unlike the US edition of "Tell me  why", the US edition of "Another way" is the best one. Not  only it is the cheapest, it contains all the mixes from the European  editions (you must purchased CD1 and CD2 in Europe to get all the mixes).
