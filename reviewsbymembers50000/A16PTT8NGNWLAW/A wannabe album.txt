 Well, it seems like my opinion is different from others' in this album.  I've decided to buy this album from a relatively unknown DJ because of two reasons: Usually, "global underground" never let me down, and  because of the tracks (mixes by humate, cass & slide, timo maas and  other respected names). I was expecting to be thirlled, and I wasn't. I  don't know if it's the selection of the tracks or the way they were mixes,  but the album is boring, period. The first CD,according to the booklet  attached, is more to the mellow side of trance and this is how it sounds,  unfortunately it gets nowhere and every time I listen to it, I usually  break, and move to track 10, which is the best track on the cd (and the  only one that has a 'personality'). The second cd supposed to be the  aggressive one. It begins in quite a low beat, as usual, but instead of  moving up to a harder sound as long as the mix goes, it stayes at the same  level as it started, and when it ends you are quite surprised that nothing  really happened. Perhaps Anthony Pappa needs some more experience  selecting tracks, because his mixes are not bad at all, but the album  itself is a big disappointment.
