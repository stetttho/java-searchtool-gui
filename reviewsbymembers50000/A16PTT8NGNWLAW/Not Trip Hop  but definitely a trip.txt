 I guess that this album is classified as a "Trip Hop" album, and Trip Hop lovers will probably buy it. I'm a trip hop lover, and I bought this album of course, and found out it is not trip hop. Still, it's a  fanatastic album. Trip Hop uses the drums and sinths of Hip Hop to make  sound more like ambient. This album doesn't have this sound. It doesn't  sound like Portishead, Massive of Mono. It sounds like Hooverphonic : a  sound that is almost pure acustic (they use orchestra) but still will be a  favorite of electronic sound lovers. The album begins quite fast, with a  strange drum & bass beat over slow string tune ("Battersea")  and kind of slowing down until a noisy break in the middle  ("Lung") and then goes down to slower and a very darker  sound. Three tracks in this album have a male vocal. That's an  interesting thing, because most of the bands usually have one leading  vocal, and it adds to the diversity of sounds. Pay attention to  "Club Montepulciano" and "This Strange Effect", which  are, for my opinion, the best tunes in this album, listen to the voice of  the singer almost breaking every glass in the house, and be hypnotized -  like I was.
