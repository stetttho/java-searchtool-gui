 Hey! Paul Van Dyk is a killer, and his remixes are killers, but pay attention: This album contains all PVD remixes until the begining of 1997. A year later PVD moved to a different label (Deviant) and issues a  collection there called "Vorsprung Dyk Technik - The Remixes  92-98", which contains all the tracks from "Prespective" and  the remixes from 1998 too (includes Flaming June, 1998 and For an  angel). So look for this album - the price is the same, and you get 3(! )  cds with the best of PVD.
