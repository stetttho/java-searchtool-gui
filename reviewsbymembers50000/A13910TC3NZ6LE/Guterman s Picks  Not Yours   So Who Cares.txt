 My son bought this book a few years ago.  Having read Guterman's previous book, "The Worst Rock and Roll Records of All Time", I was anxious to read it....what a disappointment! I am an avid collector of music on vinyl, tape, and CD.  Like most of us, I buy what I like and don't buy what I don't.  Much to my surprise, I found that I owned only about 4 of the records that Guterman raves about.  The author picked Rod Stewart's "Every Picture Tells a Story" (a record I've listened to and do not care to own) as the greatest rock album of all time...need I say more?  It's more fun to say crass things about bad records than it is to say great things about records you like but which are disliked by others. If you care what the author thinks...then by all means buy this book.  If you feel strongly about the choices you have made, then ignore it because you'll likely come away with a bad opinion of Guterman if he doesn't validate many of your picks. I give the book two stars mainly because the topic is so subjective that it really doesn't need to be written about.  And also because I think Guterman is somewhat pretentious and his taste in music questionable.
