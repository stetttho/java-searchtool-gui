 As football movies go, "The Replacements" doesn't break any new ground.  I found it rather similar to "Necessary Roughness" except that the latter movie dealt with a college football team on probation whereas this film is about a pro team that replaces its striking players with unknowns looking for a second chance at glory.  The rather ugly word "scab" comes to mind here and thankfully is used only a few times in the film. Keanu Reeves is good but unremarkable as ex-college quarterback Shane Falco, who choked in a bowl game only to become a footnote in college football history.  One customer reviewer refers to Reeves' performance as a "comeback", but I question the accuracy of that statement. "The Replacements" is Reeves' first movie since "The Matrix", which although critically panned did reasonably at the box office and is somewhat of a cult favorite.  I for one don't think his career was in decline to begin with.  Gene Hackman turns in his usual fine performance as the team's coach, rehired by owner Jack Warden. As one might expect with this type of picture, the replacement players are a ragtag unruly bunch until Falco provides some much needed leadership.  From there, the team continues until its last game before the playoffs by which time its regular quarterback has decided to cross the picket line.  I don't want to spoil the rest of the picture but I'm betting you already know how it ends by this time.  Although very predictable, this movie is still fun to watch because it doesn't take itself that seriously.
