 I'm not persuaded by many of the comments that Anthology Two is somehow better than Anthology One.  Anthology Two covers the Beatles' career roughly during the period of time in which four of the band's most successful albums (Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, and Magical Mystery Tour) were produced.  For that reason, many are more likely to identify with this collection...but that doesn't mean it's necessarily superior. "Real Love" is somewhat of an improvement over "Free as a Bird", but it still suffers from overproduction at the hands of former ELO frontman Jeff Lynne.  Unquestionably both tracks would have been better had George Martin produced them.  Despite that, this collection is worth owning for the alternate takes of "Strawberry Fields Forever" alone...they're priceless.  The outtakes of "It's Only Love" and "Tomorrow Never Knows" are quite good, a version of "Taxman" with a different ending and an outtake of "And Your Bird Can Sing" featuring a giggle fest are also noteworthy.  There are two rather stripped takes of "Fool on the Hill" that I liked as well. Because this collection contains songs that are more popular and well-known by the Beatle fans everywhere, it will likely be the most commercially successful of the three anthology collections.  In my view, that doesn't necessarily make it better than the other two...just slightly more interesting.
