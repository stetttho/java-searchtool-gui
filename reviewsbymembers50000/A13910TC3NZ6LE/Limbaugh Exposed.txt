 Whether you agree with Rush Limbaugh or not, this book is required reading.  FAIR, never an organization to gladly suffer distortion or misstatement of fact from either the political left or the political right, contradict numerous statements made by Limbaugh on his radio and television show with facts.  Liberals will love it, ultra-conservatives will decry it.   As evidence of the effect this book has had, look at the negative reviews.  None of them disputed any of the book's claims with anything other than vitriolic language and name calling, most were too cowardly to put their names to their comments, and several of them contained grammatical, punctuation, and spelling errors.  I believe this tends to show the maturity and intelligence of the typical "dittohead" who worships Limbaugh with a fierce loyalty similar to the Hitler youth of the 30's. Read the book and decide for yourself.
