 I gave this book two stars because it does somewhat accurately portray Lincoln in his final days.  Sadly, it lacks any semblance of credibility after that.  I have read every known account of the facts and circumstances surrounding the Lincoln assasination and have presented many talks on this subject.  In my opinion, Balsiger's book ranks with Louis Weichmann's as one of the worst and most unreliable volumes on the subject.   Factual information is either ignored, misinterpreted, or given short shrift.  The "conspiracy" to the degree one existed was between John Wilkes Booth, Lewis Paine, George Atzerodt, and David Herold (and to a lesser degree, Michael O'Laughlin, John Surratt, and Samuel Arnold).   ... Balsiger's book does little more than make sensational claims that the author cannot support without discrediting, reinventing, or ignoring historical fact.
