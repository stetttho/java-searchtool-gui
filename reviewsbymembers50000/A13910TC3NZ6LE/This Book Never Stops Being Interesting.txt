 I have owned two previous editions of "The Book of Rock Lists" and will soon be buying "The New Book of Rock Lists".  Why?  Because it's fun to read, witty, and incisive!  The rock and roll heaven portion, where various deceased rock stars are broken down in terms of how they died, is definitely worth reading. One or two others have already castigated author Dave Marsh for having somewhat of a left leaning bias in his stinging criticism of the PMRC and certain religious zealots, as well as his categorization of famous right wing rockers.  I disagree with the reviewer who referred to Marsh as being "PC".  However, if you turn your political filter off and you're not thin-skinned, you'll have some fun reading.
