 A friend of mine gave me "Goin' Coconuts" as a gag gift several years ago.  The joke was definitely on me.  This film is replete with hammy acting, insipid attempts at humor, and villains so inept it hurts to watch.  If you like the singing of Donny & Marie Osmond (I don't), that is about the only saving grace of this mess. Okay for the "goody two-shoes" crowd, but otherwise a pathetic attempt at entertainment.  Now I've gotta go watch some paint dry.
