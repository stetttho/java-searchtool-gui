 Before fully considering whether "Unfit for Command" has any literary merit to it whatsoever, there are several things the prospective reader should consider.  First, author John O'Neill was a vocal critic of John Kerry when the latter joined an antiwar Vietnam Veteran's group and started speaking out against the war.  O'Neill's criticisms were refuted and he was quickly forgotten, but now some 30 years later he crawls out from under his rock to pen an embittered, vicious screed that is based primarily on interviews with individuals who served in Vietnam during the same time as Kerry, but NOT on the same boat.  Given O'Neill's obvious bitterness and jealousy over Kerry's success, as well as the highly suspicious timing of publication of this book in the midst of one of this country's most divisive presidential campaigns (and spearheaded by a family friend of Kerry's opponent), only a blind partisan or a fool would have the temerity to call this book accurate or to believe the ludicrous claims made therein.  Calling this reprehensible book exploitive would be too kind, libellous would be more accurate.  Those who dare to call John Kerry a traitor would do well to examine the motives and credibility of the author of this outrageous work of fiction.  I wonder if O'Neill is angling for a job with The American Spectator after the election?
