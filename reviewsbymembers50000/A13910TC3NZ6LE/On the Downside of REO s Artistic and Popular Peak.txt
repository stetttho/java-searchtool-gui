 To anyone who actually liked this album:  I have a pristine vinyl copy played only once that I'd gladly part with (you pay shipping and handling). REO Speedwagon, once a top rock band of the 70's with hits like "Ridin' the Storm Out" and "Roll With the Changes", show that they lack staying power.  This collection is replete with syrupy pop drivel like "Can't Fight This Feelin" and "One Lonely Night".  REO peaked with "Hi Infidelity" and took a nosedive with this loser of an album.
