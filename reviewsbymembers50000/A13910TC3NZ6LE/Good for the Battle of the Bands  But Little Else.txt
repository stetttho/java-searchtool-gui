 Frequently, sequels are never as good as the movies from which they were spawned.  "Caddyshack 2", "Beverly Hills Cop 2", and  "Look Who's Still Talking" immediately come to mind.  Sadly,  "Blues Brothers 2000" follows that same trend. Just released  from prison (in which brother Jake died), Elwood Blues goes about  reassembling a band.  If he was capable of doing this without Jake, then  why didn't he do it in "The Blues Brothers"?  Easy answer:  he  couldn't.  Elwood's lineup includes an annoying kid (J. Evan Bonifant), a  marginally adequate vocalist (John Goodman, in the worst role he's ever  played), and eventually, Elwood's long lost brother (played by an obviously  embarrassed Joe Morton)who has become a Captain in the Illinois State  Police.   The only redeeming part of this motion picture is an all star  "battle of the bands" blues jam featuring big names such as Eric  Clapton, Blues Traveler, B. B. King, and Johnny Lang (among others) that  will blow your socks off.  Sadly, even that cannot save this awful motion  picture.  In reality, "Blues Brothers 2000" is nothing more than  a good blues jam preceded by an insipid and uninspired action movie that is  uninteresting and unentertaining.  I hope the soundtrack album saved this  stinkburger from becoming a money loser for the studio.
