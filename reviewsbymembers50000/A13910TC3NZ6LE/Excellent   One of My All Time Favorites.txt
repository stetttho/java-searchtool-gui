 Pardon my enthusiasm, but "Pleasantville" has to be one of the movies I'd take with me to a desert island if I could only take a VCR and a handful of movies with me. The only problem I have is a minor one with  the message of this movie.  What is it trying to say?  Some think that it  is promoting a liberal or communist agenda (Murray, KY, you're an idiot!),  and one might discern a rebuke of racism (remember the "No Service to  Coloreds" sign?).  It also seems to be saying that if you use your  imagination and allow for the possibility of change, you and your world  will change along with it. The cast is excellent and turns in very good  performances.  Keep your eye on Reese Witherspoon and Tobey Maguire - I  predict more good performances from them both.  Jeff Bridges and Joan Allen  are as usual excellent in this movie, and William H. Macy showcases his  considerable talents as the best character actor of this decade.  This  movie also marks the final performance of another great character actor,  the great J.T. Walsh, who died while the movie was in  post-production. The cinematography and special effects of this movies  are simply breathtaking, especially when the town changes from black and  white to color, and the music is beautifully scored by Randy Newman. This  movie had an average box-office run which might have been better with more  promotion, but I strongly recommend you check it out!
