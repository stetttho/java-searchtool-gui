 If you want to read an objectively written book about Ronald Reagan, his years as Governor of California, or his presidency, pass on this book.  From the outset, it is clear that the author, one of Reagan's inner circle and possibly the worst Attorney General of the United States this side of John Mitchell, cannot help but fawn over the Gipper.   Meese's every word is embued with such a slavish devotion to Reagan that he glosses over some of Reagan's more questionable accomplishments and policies, always portraying episodes in an "us verus them" fashion where the "us" is always right. Anyone seriously considering the purchase of this book would do well to ignore the review of jmarkwhite, whose way of dealing with negative reviews of the book is to engage in juvenile namecalling.  Here's the bottom line...if you're a big fan of Ronald Reagan and are blind to his faults (and believe me, he had some), this is the book for you.  If you want an objective view of the man and his impact on America, look elsewhere.
