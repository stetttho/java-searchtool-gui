 This album was a seminal part of every teenager's album collection (including mine) in the 60's right along with the obligatory Hendrix and Cream albums.  Granted, the remaining tracks  couldn't compare to the title cut, but at 17 minutes plus, who the hell  cared?  That said, I  would recommend that anyone considering buying "In a Gadda Da  Vida" purchase a turntable and buy a used copy in vinyl at a record  store.  The sound quality of the CD is the worst of any album I've ever  heard.  The guitar solos in particular were mixed down way low and lose the  ambience and sonic clarity of the record.  The only thing stopping me from  giving this CD a lower rating is the fact that at least someone had the  guts to try and do it...and at least left the drum and organ solos in  pretty good shape.
