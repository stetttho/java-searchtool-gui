 Please don't take this review as a knock on any of Bach's works; in fact, I read The Richest Man in Babylon some time back and thought it was a basically good book that offered sound advice.  The problem I have with The Automatic Millionaire is that it is essentially a collection of tips that I've heard on a number of financial planning shows over the years.  Unless you've been living under a rock and not paying attention to any of the many financial planning programs on TV and radio these past several years the fact is you simply don't need this book.  The core message of the book is that you can become an automatic millionaire if you essentially live like a miser.  That's not a startling revelation now, is it?  I imagine Bach has himself become a millionaire from sales of this and his past books and I'm sure that if you follow the principles in The Automatic Millionaire you might actually become a millionaire.  The question is whether you'll live long enough to enjoy the results of your efforts.  Save your money and watch more CNN/FN instead.
