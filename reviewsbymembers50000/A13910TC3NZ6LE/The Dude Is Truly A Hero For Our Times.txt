 This is IMHO the best movie the Coen brothers have ever done.  I like all of their movies except "Barton Fink" which was a real stinkburger. Jeff Bridges is positively brilliant as "The  Dude", and John Goodman as a whacked out Vietnam vet made my sides  ache from laughing so hard.  Julianne Moore was also quite good as a  pretentious performance artist.  My only complaint about this movie would  be that Steve Buscemi was underused. We also see brief but effective  appearances by Sam Elliott (as the narrator), Peter Stormare (as an  empty-headed German nihilist), John Turturro (as a hotheaded Latino Bowler  with purple shoes),and Ben Gazzarra (as a porn producer). Particularly  noteworthy in this movie is the Busby Berkelyesque "Gutterballs"  sequence which is The Dude's dream of starring in a bowling porno flick  with Moore.  Set to the tune of "Just Checked In To See What Condition  My Condition Was In", it is the funniest scene in the movie and alone  merits the purchase of this video. As one of the previous customer  reviewers said: "The Dude abides, and so do I".  It just doesn't  get any better or funnier than this!
