 I like live albums because they're usually raw and gritty.  You get to  hear the band without the benefit of too much processing, and the ambience  is incredible.  To that end, I unflinchingly admit that "Two for the  Show" is without a doubt the best live album by any band.  The fact  that it happens to be by one of my favorite bands of all time, Kansas, is  just icing on the cake.  My second favorite live album, the Little River  Band's excellent and underrated "Backstage Pass" has been  unavailable for years. All of the tracks here have incredible sonic  clarity that one would not normally expect from a live album.  Given the  complexity of most of Kansas' material and the instrumental parts, the  producers did an incredible job putting this collection of songs together.   I can only say that I have two complaints, both minor:  the omission of  "Closet Chronicles" in the transition from LP to CD, and a subpar  performance of "Carry On Wayward Son".  This is more than  compensated for by Rich Williams' guitar solo and Kerry Livgren's piano  solo following "Dust in the Wind", followed by an abbreviated  version of "Lonely Wind" with a searing harmony vocal.  I also  like the extracted portion of "Lamplight Symphony" which is used  as a segue to "The Wall".   The fact that there are no reviews  for this CD below 5 stars ought to be telling you something.  Buy this CD!   After 22 years "Two for the Show" remains my favorite live rock  or pop album of all time, and it still brings a smile to my face and a song  to my heart.
