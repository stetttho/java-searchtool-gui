 I consider "Maroon" to be my favorite Barenaked Ladies album for two reasons.  First, I think it represents the most interesting collection of songs they've ever put together on a CD, ranging from subjects as diverse as infidelity ("Off the Hook") to meeting one's demise in an auto accident ("Tonight is the Night I Fell Asleep at the Wheel"), to Hollywood marketing hype ("Sell, Sell, Sell"), to the angst of growing up ("Baby Seat").  Second, I consider it a signifcant album because multi-instumentalist Kevin Hearn, who was diagnosed with Leukemia shortly after the recording of the band's previous album, "Stunt", was around to contribute (and thankfully still is; his Leukemia has been in remission for about 6 years as of this writing).  For this reason I find the bonus track "Hidden Sun", sung by Kevin, to be especially moving.  One gets the impression that he is revealing to the listener some insight that he discovered during his fight to stay alive.    There are only two tracks on this CD that I'm not overly crazy about: "Conventioneers", which tells the tale of two attendees at a business convention engaging in a brief dalliance; and "Helicopters", a rather dark song discussing the protagonist's reaction to war.  As the Amazon.com review stated, one can easily discern the influence of early XTC in some of the band's tracks, and as one customer reviewer noted a bit of Beatles as well ("Go Home" reminds me of the Beatles' "Act Naturally" from a stylistic point of view).  The lyrics to almost every one of the tracks in "Maroon" reveal an unusual depth of articulation and expression.  Steve Page and Ed Robertson never fail to amaze me in that regard.  And it should of course be noted that this CD was produced by legendary producer Don Was.  Simply put, there is a lot to like about "Maroon", and the fact that it gets a prominent spot in the CD changer in my car ought to tell you what I think about it.  This one is definitely worth a listen.
