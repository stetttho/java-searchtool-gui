 One other reviewer on this site mentioned an ongoing problem with the hotsync cradle on this model.  The cradle is not the problem...it's the Palm device itself.  When working properly, the 500 series Palms are great little handhelds.  The manufacturer has an ongoing quality control issue with units that fail to hotsync after anywhere from a few days to several months of use.  In my particular case, it stopped working three days after I received it as a Christmas gift from my wife. I've been to a number of forums where this problem has been discussed in detail.  In some cases the hotsync failure has been attributed to software problems, but in the vast majority of cases an internal defect in the handheld has turned out to be the culprit.  Palm's "fix" for this problem is to send the consumer an "enhanced" model which in reality appears to be a factory refurbished unit.  Although the company ships it at no cost to the consumer, the consumer is expected to bear the cost of returning the defective unit to Palm.   Although other owners have knocked Palm's customer support service, I can honestly say that my dealings with them have been quite good.  These people are not to blame; they're only doing what their supervisors tell them to do.  The fault here lies with a company that produced a defective product and is trying to get out of its responsibilities as cheaply as possible.  I sold my Sony CLIE PEGS320 when my wife bought me the M500, now I truly regret doing so.
