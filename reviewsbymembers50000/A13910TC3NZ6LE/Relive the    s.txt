 My teenage and young adult years were in the 1970's, so this boxed set of 70's music on CD calls to mind many memories with the music that was going on in my life during so many of those magical moments.  Sure, there's a lot of kitsch here, but some of the most memorable songs of this decade were not always the good ones.  Leaving the bad songs out would be something akin to having only a selective recall of the times.  Songs like "Afternoon Delight", "Having My Baby", and "Disco Duck" still receive a fair share of notoriety to this day.  No other decade of the 20th Century had so much musical activity, both good and bad. Despite the obvious schlock, there are still a number of good pop songs from the decade in this collection.  "Signs" by the Five Man Electrical Band, the Theme from "Shaft" by Isaac Hayes, and the Main Ingredient's "Everybody Plays the Fool" are just a few examples of the fairly well-balanced collection of pop, rock, and R & B songs that appear in this set.  Many of the tunes are interspersed with audio snippets from political and cultural events of the decade, such as Richard Nixon's famous "I am not a crook" speech.  They make reliving the 70's an even more poignant experience. My wife and I both enjoy this set because of the memories it brings back, and we enjoy listening it on the CD player in our car (not a "Chevy Van")on long trips.  If you can't afford the somewhat high cost of the boxed set, the majority of the tracks in the set are also available separately on Rhino's "Have a Nice Day" collection, now up to 23 volumes.  Any way you buy this collection of songs, it's still a stone groove, man!
