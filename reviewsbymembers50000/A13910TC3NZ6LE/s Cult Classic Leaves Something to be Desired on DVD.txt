 "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" is truly one of the funniest films to come from the so-called "me" decade.  The fact that this  picture has such a cult following is a testament to its staying power and  relevancy in 2000.  I predict that in 2010 it will still be a good snapshot  at high school kids in that era. It's clear to me that amazon.com  reviewer Marshall Fine doesn't have a clue about movies when he refers to  Cameron Crowe, who scripted this picture, as an "overrated  filmmaker".  To the contrary, Crowe has established himself as one of  the brightest of the most recent crop of filmmakers.  His script as well as  Amy Heckerling's direction in "Fast Times", show that they really  have tapped into what makes high school kids of the 80's tick.  Sean Penn  turns in the performance of his career as Jeff Spicoli, a stoner with no  direction and little ambition (other than to have Van Halen play at his  birthday party, of course).  This movie also marks the acting debuts of  Judge Rheinhold, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Forest Whitaker, Anthony Edwards,  and Eric Stolz.  Ray Walston's brief performance as a crusty teacher is  also noteworthy. My only complaint about this motion picture is that  certain scenes which were added to the television edit of the movie were  deleted for the DVD.  They helped give some direction to the plot and will  be missed.  That aside, "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" is to 80's  high school students what "Porky's" was to 50's high school  students and "The Hollywood Knights" was to 60's high school  students.  I'm still waiting for the definitive comedy film on 70's high  schoolers.
