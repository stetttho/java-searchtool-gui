 "Rock Spectacle" gets played more than just about any other CD in my collection.  Even if you don't like the music of Barenaked Ladies, there's no denying that this is an exceptionally well engineered live album that does a first rate job of capturing the energy and fun of a live Bnl performance.  The songs were recorded when the band was touring in support of the "Born on a Pirate Ship" CD.  In my opinion, the best and most noteworthy tracks on this CD are: Brian Wilson-Ed Robertson's acoustic guitar style has never been better than in this version of a song that originally appeared on the shamefully underrated "Gordon" CD. "Break Your Heart"-I think this angst ridden song about ending a relationship one of the best songs Bnl has ever recorded.  Steven Page's searing vocal just rips your heart out, and keyboard player Kevin Hearn is in fine form playing minor chords from what sounds like a Hammond B-3.  Much better than the studio version on the "Pirate Ship" CD. "Jane"-Great guitar work by Robertson, along with great drumming from Tyler Stewart.  I frequently hit the repeat button when this song is going in my car's CD player.  Way better than the original studio version from the "Maybe You Should Drive" CD. "What a Good Boy"- A favorite of long time Bnl fans and a very good song, done even better live.  As one previous reviewer mentioned, "Rock Spectacle" would make a very good introductory CD to someone who is not familiar with Bnl's music.  For the listener who loves the band's live shows, I humbly suggest taking a trip to www.barenakedladies.com, where for a nominal fee you can download authorized bootlegs of concerts from their "Everything to Everyone" tour.  As good as they are, they're still a far cry from the craftsmanship and sonic impact with which "Rock Spectacle" dazzles the lister.
