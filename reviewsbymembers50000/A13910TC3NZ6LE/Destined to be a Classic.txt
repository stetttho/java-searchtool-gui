 First of all, I feel that Pat Boone should be congratulated for making this CD.  Sure, it [made angry] a number of the self-righteous who refer to themselves as "Christians",.  Curiously enough, the response from metal purists has been much more positive. I think Pat was trying to do two things: indulge an interest in heavy metal and reach out to those metal fans who may have been alienated by those self-righteous pseudo Christians who view metal as Satanic and not in keeping with traditional Christian values.  Many others think he was trying to be deliberately funny and it certainly comes off that way in the execution, perhaps unintentionally. So how does it work?  Well, I have mixed emotions.  As comedy it succeeds well.  The concept of a rather unhip white guy crooning (as opposed to screaming)  these songs with big band accompaniment (as opposed to guitar driven distortion and power chords) works quite well and is funny.  But again, I think that Pat was trying to show that he was sincere in trying to portray himself as a kindred spirit with headbangers throughout the world.  Pat's covers of metal anthems are certainly well executed although not as edgy as the originals, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Whether you view Boone's effort as schtick, an effort to reach out to the disaffected, or just plain silly, this CD is worthy of your time and attention.  Many reviewers are already comparing it to the less than stellar vocal albums released by the likes of William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy in the 1960's, and those albums are considered classic if not collectible merely for their camp value.  "In a Metal Mood" is almost certain to become a classic in that tradition.  Pick up a copy while you still can.
