 "The Firm" stands out as a shining example of why one should read the novel before watching the movie made from it.  I noted that some reviewers have criticized the music, which I always thought of as being out  of place in this picture.  The two biggest problems I have with the movie  are Tom Cruise's ham-handed acting performance and an ending that strays  from that in the novel and simply is too implausible.  A previous customer  reviewer commented that Cruise's character would have been killed by the  mobsters, and I agree wholeheartedly with that assessment.  If Cruise had  been a little more restrained, and if the producers had followed Grisham's  book more faithfully, I believe that it could have been a much better movie  than the forgettable waste of time that it ended up being.
