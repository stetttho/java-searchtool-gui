 While many listeners of R.E.M. argue passionately that "Murmur" is their best work, I respectfully disagree.  "Reckoning" ranks as the best and most fully realized album R.E.M. ever produced and in my  opinion is the best album to come out of a decade littered with the likes  of Madonna and Michael Jackson, not to mention various glam rockers, hair  bands, and pretentious English beat groups.  The jangly 12 string playing  of Peter Buck on songs such as "South Central Rain" and  "Seven Chinese Brothers" are simple yet complex at the same time.   Michael Stipe bares his soul on plaintive, muddy vocals with a beauty yet  to be surpassed by any other vocalist.  Simply put, this is an album of  straight forward, unassuming and beautiful tunes crafted by one of the best  rock bands of the last 20 years.  If someone ever asks me to name only one  album I could take to a desert island with me, "Reckoning" would  definitely be that album.
