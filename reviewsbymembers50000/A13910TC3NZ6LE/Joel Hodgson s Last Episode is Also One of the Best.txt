 "Mitchell" marks the last MST3K episode featuring Joel Robinson, who in this episode finds his way back to earth in an escape pod disguised in a crate maked "Hamdingers". Additionally, this particular  episode marks one of the relatively few times the series took on a movie  genre other than sci-fi.  The results are hilarious, and it makes you  wonder why Best Brains, who produced the series, didn't consider lampooning  more godawful cop and detective movies.  The 70's were full of movies like  "Mitchell" that deserved the MST treatment just as much! As  mentioned by numerous other reviewers, the "baby oil" scene is so  smarmy that Crow can't help but throw out the wisecracks...which definitely  makes an improvement! One final note:  The MST3K Episode Guide mentions  that Joe Don Baker was furious over this particular episode and made some  threats to various cast members.  Whether true or not, it certainly adds to  the legend!
