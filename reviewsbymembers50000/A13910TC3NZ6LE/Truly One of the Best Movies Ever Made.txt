 If any one of the many movies Kevin Costner has made established him as a major box office star, it would have to be this one (although Dances With Wolves ranks a very close second). As I've mentioned to many of my  friends, when you mix Costner with Iowa and baseball you have a  entertainment trifecta (of course I grew up in Iowa so I may be  prejudiced).  This movie is superb and succeeds on every level.  It's a  beautiful story of hope and redemption.  Costner plays the Iowa farmer  portrayed in W. P. Kinsella's novel with just the right amount of wide-eyed  wonder mixed with a spirit of adventure. Amy Madigan is also well cast as  his wife Annie.  I only wish my wife were as indulgent of my crazy ideas.   Although I disagree with a previous customer reviewer who thoroughly  trashed this picture, I do agree with him that Tim Busfield was irritating  (as he is in virtually every movie or TV show in which I've ever seen  him). Two or three really great scenes stand out in "Field of  Dreams".  James Earl Jones' speech about baseball is one of those  classic pieces of solliloquy in motion pictures that people will remember  50 years from now, right up there with "here's looking at you,  kid" from Casablanca.  The scene near the end of the movie where Ray  plays catch with his father is enough to bring a tear to the eye of every  man, and the wistfulness of a time gone by that Burt Lancaster shows us as  "Moonlight Graham" is simply elegant.   I often think about  what I would personally rate as the top ten movies I've ever seen in my  life, and I have to say that the top spot on my list is a tossup between  this movie and "Pleasantville".  Perhaps I'll watch "Field  of Dreams" this weekend and think about it some more.
