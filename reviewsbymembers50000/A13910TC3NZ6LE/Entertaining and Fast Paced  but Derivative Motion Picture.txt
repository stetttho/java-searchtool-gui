 Amazon.com's reviewer is absolutely correct when he says that "Boiler  Room" borrows unashamedly from "Wall Street" and  "Glengarry Glen Ross".  On that basis it would seem that there's  very little to recommend the movie, but it actually is much better than  that. Giovanni Ribisi (Saving Private Ryan) stars as a young college  dropout who becomes a junior broker at J. T. Marlin after being introduced  to a senior broker by a mutual friend.  Soon, Ribisi's character starts  climbing his way up the ladder and becomes an self-assured alpha male  aggressively selling worthless stock.  Soon he begins to find out that  everything is not what it seems. The pacing of this picture can best be  described as frenetic, set to a hip-hop background.  The brokers are loud  and aggressive, with more than a touch of arrogance.  A secondary story  line involving a conflict between Ribisi's character and his father (played  by Ron Rifkin) seemed pointless and could have been deleted in the  interests of resolving questions that arise at the somewhat abrupt ending  of the film.  Ribisi turns in a decent performance, although I really  didn't find it to be credible.  Vin Diesel, on the other hand, steals the  show.  Ben Affleck is very good in a somewhat limited role, and the  considerable talents of Tom Everett Scott (That Thing You Do!) were  seriously underutilized.  Overall "Boiler Room" is a good, but  not great, motion picture.  Among movies of the same general subject matter  it's better than "Wall Street", but not as good as  "Glengarry Glen Ross".  Look for the scene in which the J. T.  Marlin brokers are watching "Wall Street" at the home of one of  their own-it's worth your time.
