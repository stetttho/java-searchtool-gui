 As far as pop music goes, the 1980's goes down for me as one of the worst and most forgettable decades.  It started out with carbon copy punk bands and then went to pretentious Brit groups like Duran Duran and Kajagoogoo, and then to soundalike hair bands like Triumph and Ratt.  And of course there was Madonna as well.  Sandwiched somewhere in between were bands with no artistic merit...like Mister Mister. By now we all know about "Broken Wings", a dreadful, dreary song with a lyric literally ripped out of a Beatles song (Blackbird) that became an instant staple of pop radio.  Mister Mister followed this up with an even worse song, "Kyrie", which sounds like a bunch of dorks at a campfire singalong.  After that, the band faded into obscurity (thankfully for the rest of us). "Welcome to the Real World" is, for all practical purposes, a testament on vinyl (or mylar, in CD form) to the vapidity and forgetability of 80's pop in general.  Thanks to Prince and Culture Club, at least the decade wasn't a total bust.
