 I believe that Kansas hit their commercial and artistic stride with three  albums: "Leftoverture", "Point of Know Return", and  this one.  As other reviewers have noted, "Monolith" is somewhat  uneven and not as good as the other two albums in what I refer to as  "The Kansas Trilogy"; nevertheless, it is still a good LP with  several enjoyable tracks, particularly "On the Other Side",  "People of the South Wind" (a personal favorite of my wife), and  "A Glimpse of Home".   Please ignore the rather stupid remarks  of one previous reviewer who said that this album would appeal only to  dedicated "can hear no wrong" fans.  Although I'm a fan of  Kansas, I'm also objective enough to dismiss Kansas albums that I thought  were less than satisfactory (for example, "Audio-Visions" and  "Power", both of which I believe to be no longer available). If  you have heard "Leftoverture" and "Point of Know  Return", you'll probably like "Monolith", but to a slightly  lesser degree.
