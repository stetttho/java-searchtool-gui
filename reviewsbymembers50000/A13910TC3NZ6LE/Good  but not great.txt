 I went to a Handspring Prism after my Palm M500 (actually, two of them) stopped hotsynching.  Although it performs well and I really like the color display, there are two major drawbacks.  First, it is too bulky.  I thought this would not be a problem for me but unlike my Palm, I find myself somewhat bothered by the fact that it won't fit into my shirt pocket.  Second, the display washes out in sunlight and is difficult, almost impossible, to see. The Visor series is advertised as being "infinitely expandable", and it is.  The problem is that while there are currently more expansion options for Visor than for Palm, those options come at a rather steep price.  Furthermore, prospective buyers should also be aware that Handspring intends to get out of the personal digital assistant (PDA) market and concentrate on communicators such as its new Treo series.  This might dry up the expansion device market and make the modules even more expensive than they currently are. If you know what you're getting into, the Prism isn't a bad PDA.  Personally, I think the Visor Pro is a much better deal for the money.  Although it doesn't have a color display, it does feature 16mb of memory (to the Prism's 8mb) as well as a slightly thinner case, and costs about the same when you factor in the $50 instant rebate currently being offered by Handspring.
