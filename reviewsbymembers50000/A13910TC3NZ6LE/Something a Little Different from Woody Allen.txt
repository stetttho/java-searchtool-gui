 I've never been a big fan of Woody Allen's more mainstream movies, but I really liked this film.  Allen draws upon his knowledge of jazz to bring the life of fictional jazz guitarist Emmett Ray (the second greatest jazz guitarist in the world), and a completely irresponsible and idiosynchratic person.  Who else would take his dates to the dump to shoot rats?  Despite his considerable talent, Emmett lives in fear of his idol, the great Django Rheinhardt.  For those of you unfamiliar with jazz, Rheinhardt really existed and during his lifetime was one of the finest guitar players the world has ever known. Sean Penn, an actor who is sadly better known for his brief marriage to Madonna than for his considerable acting skills, turns in an Oscar-worthy performance as Emmett, playing him as a lovable but quirky and ultimately vulnerable character (Penn received an Oscar nomination for this portrayal, incidentally).  Uma Thurman appears briefly as Ray's socialite wife who marries him more out of curiosity than love.  Samantha Morton practically steals the movie away from Penn as the deaf-mute girlfriend who unconditionally loves him despite Emmett's inherent self-centeredness and lack of trustworthiness.  The director appears briefly explaining the life and times of Emmett in documentary style.  Although I didn't particularly care for this way of presenting the picture, it was at most a minor distraction. Whether you're a jazz afficianado or just appreciate an interesting character study, this motion picture is worth a look.
