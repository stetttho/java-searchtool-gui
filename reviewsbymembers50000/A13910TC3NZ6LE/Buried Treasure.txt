 As a huge fan of Michael Nesmith's solo work, Tropical Campfires gets my enthusiastic recommendation as one of Nez's best works...Even if you've only heard one or two of Nesmith's songs, like Joanne, this is the CD that I think defines whether the casual listener becomes a fan or not.  The songs are intricately crafted and beautifully performed.  My particular favorites are Yellow Butterfly and Moon on the Rio Grande.  The latter is a song that never fails to relax and send me to a comfortable plane...a high compliment for any song or songwriter!  Every track on this CD is worth a listen, although I wasn't particularly crazy about Julianna. The only album of Nesmith that surpasses this one in quality is Live at the Palais, sadly also out of print (I own three copies)!  I highly recommend that you go out and buy a copy of Tropical Campfires while it can still be had!
