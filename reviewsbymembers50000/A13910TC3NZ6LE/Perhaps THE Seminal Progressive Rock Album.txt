 We all know that the likes of Emerson Lake and Palmer, Yes, and King  Crimson left their mark on the musical landscape way before Rick Wakeman  made this album.  But the point is not who did it first but rather, who did  it best.  Simply put, "Journey to the Center of the Earth" is  just that-the best. This album, recorded live with the London Symphony  Orchestra, the English Chamber Choir, a small ensemble of rock musicians,  and David Hemmings as narrator of the Jules Verne book, turned out to be a  masterpiece and the best album of 1974 if not of the entire decade.   Wakeman layers synthesizer noises, riffs, and hooks with the orchestra and  guitar, bass, and drums for a dazzling and picturesque effect.  This music  is so evocative that I'm going to start doing what one customer said he  does and start listening to it in a darkened room for the "beneath the  earth" atmosphere. I will admit that after 25 years the music  doesn't stand up quite as well as it did in 1974 when I first bought (and  promptly wore out) "Journey to the Center of the Earth" on  8-track tape.  The lyrics seem kind of hoky now as well.  Nevertheless, I  still consider this above all to be the most influential and best album of  the prgressive rock movement and one that every fan of this genre should  experience.
