 There's a phenomenon in the law known as "jurynullification", which means that even though a person istechnically guilty of a crime, a jury will refuse to convict a defendant if it feels the motive was proper.  Basically, that's the premise of "A Time to Kill", John Grisham's first and best novel.   I note that one previous reviewer (the British gentleman who claims to have studied law) wrote a rather scathing review of the movie.  Apparently he feels that this sort of thing can't take place in an American courtroom.  Having been an attorney for some eight years now, I can tell you that it can and does!   The big screen version, directed by Joel Schumacher, is right up there with Francis Ford Coppola's direction of "The Rainmaker" as the best and most faithful adaptation of a Grisham novel into a movie.   If I have any problem with this movie, it's that Sondra Bullock (who's star was on the rise at the time this movie was being made) got top billing.  Anyone who's read the novel can tell you that her character is a rather minor one, and the major figure of this movie is Jake Brigance, portrayed with distinction by a relative unknown (at that time) by the name of Matthew McConaughey.  Ashley Judd turns in a fine performance as his wife, and Kevin Spacey is his usual excellent self as the DA.  Samuel L. Jackson was also well cast as the anguished father who avenged his daughter. Although there are some detractors who say that this movie glorifies vigilante justice, I would say that they're missing the point.  The point is that we as a society have gotten to the point where we will occasionally excuse a person from otherwise criminal conduct if we agree that his motive was pure.  The irony in it all is that those who committed crimes against blacks in the early days of the civil rights movement in the American South often escaped accountability by the very same means.
