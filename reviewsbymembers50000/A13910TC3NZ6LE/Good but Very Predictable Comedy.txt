 First of all, let me say that "Deuce Bigalow: Male Giggolo" garnered far fewer negative remarks from customer reviewers than I expected.  Although this picture is certainly less than politically correct  with some of its humor, I completely disagree with the reviewer who  referred to it as "mean-spirited".   Rob Schneider turns in a  fine performance as Deuce Bigalow, a fish tank cleaner with a dead end job  and no romantic prospects until he is asked to house sit for a  "man-whore".  After damaging the house he has to make $6,000  quickly and turns to-you guessed it-male prostitution.  This plot opens up  a number of possibilities and almost succeeds in answering the question of  what kind of woman would want the services of a male prostitute.  Deuce is  paired subsequently with an overeater, a woman with a growth disorder, a  woman with narcolepsy, and a woman with Tourette's syndrome.  Along the way  he falls for a woman who also has an imperfection-a prosthetic leg.   Unfortunately this woman doesn't know Deuce is a male prostitute who was  hired to go out with her by her friends.  I won't tell you how the picture  ends other than saying its very predictable. What I find particularly  noteworthy about this picture is that it uses afflictions as comedy fodder  but somehow manages to do so without ridiculing or denigrating, a nice  touch for this kind of movie.  The humor sometimes frequently gets kind of  childish and silly, but then again those who purchase or rent "Deuce  Bigalow" usually know what sort of humor to expect from a movie  involving a former SNL cast member.  It's a good one to rent, but given the  predictability of the plot and the rather tepid level of the gags I would  definitely not purchase this one, especially on DVD.
