 I think one of the main reasons this movie worked so well for me is because I was about the age of Betsy's brother when Watergate happened.  Dunst and Williams are dead on accurate as two 15 year old girls in the early 70's, and the plot is very clever and imaginitive. The rest of the  cast turns in at least fair performances with the exception of Bruce  McCullogh and Will Farrell who are absolutely awful as Woodward and  Bernstein.  I personally am not a fan of Farrell's but at the very least  they should have been playing their roles a little more straight and  without all the goofy schoolboy stuff. My only other complaint was that  many of the 70's songs used in the movie were not in synch with the events.   For example, when Nixon (played by the always funny Dan Hedaya) makes an  announcement on TV that was supposed to take place in 1973, a song that was  not released until 1974 can be heard playing.  This may not bother most,  but I'm pretty up on the music of the era and distracted from my enjoyment  of this motion picture. I won't spoil the ending, but it is funny and  extremely well-done (double entendre and all).   I am sorry that people that have little perspective of what life was like during the  Watergate scandal just won't get this movie.  If you remember those days or  really want to know what they were like, I recommend it highly. Until  Bernstein or Woodward tells us who "Deep Throat" really was, the  explanation in Dick will do the trick!
