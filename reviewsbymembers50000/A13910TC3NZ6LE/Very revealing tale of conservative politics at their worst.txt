 "Capitol Games" is a very revealing book that takes the reader behind the scenes in one of the most controversial Supreme Court appointments in this country's history.  Phelps and Winternitz have written  a well-researched tale of how Thomas was picked by the Bush White House  over several more qualified candidates to replace the retiring Thurgood  Marshall on the Court.  If you ascribe to the principle that only the best  and the brightest should be appointed to the Court without regard to race  or ideology, you will be surprised or, as I was, angered.  Although this  title is out of print, I strongly recommend finding and reading it to find  the truth behind what amounts to little more than blatant manipulation of  the appointment process (I will admit to having some bias in writing this  review, by the way).
