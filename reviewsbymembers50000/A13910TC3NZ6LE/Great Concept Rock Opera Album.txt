 Many people don't know this, but "The Moth Confesses" is one of the earliest "rock operas" if the term can be fairly applied to a collection of songs based on a central theme.  It tells the story of falling in love for the first time and the innocence that goes with it, the eventual breakup, with the lovers eventually seeing each other later under radically different circumstances. To be sure, this 1969 album sounds somewhat dated by today's standards, but the feel that it gives the listener is unique.  One of the tracks on this album, "Morning Girl", was released as a single to a less than enthusiastic response.  Maybe some of you will remember it for the line "read your box of Cheerios, and powder-puff that pretty nose, and go and find your man where the wild ones grow".  I thought I'd never hear this record again and am glad to be reacquainted with it.
