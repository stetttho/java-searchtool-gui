 Cray has done an admirable job of chronicalling the life and times of one of the most influential and misunderstood men of the 20th Century. The book portrays Warren initially as an ambitious politician with  uncompromising moral values during the early part of his career and life as  Alameda County District Attorney, California Attorney General, and  California Governor (hardly the political hack that a previous reviewer  described).   Appointed as Chief Justice of the United States in 1953,  "Chief Justice" describes in intricate detail the decision-making  process that went into the most far-reaching and criticized court decisions  in the history of the Supreme Court, including "Brown v. Board of  Education", "Mapp v. Ohio", and "Miranda v.  Arizona".  Cray does a first rate job of showing the reader the  conflict Warren had in reconciling a fair result to his pre-appointment  philosophies of the law.   Cray has done a first rate job with this book  in portraying one of this country's most influential and enigmatic persons.   Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down.  As an attorney, I've  always had great respect for the landmark decisions of the Supreme Court  under Warren, and I recommend this novel to anyone who has ever criticized  "judicial activism".  After reading "Chief Justice", as  well as "The Bretheren", I have come to realize just how thankful  we as a society should be for Warren's service on the Court.  No matter how  hard his less enlightened successors (Burger; Rehnquist) have tried to roll  back the import of the major decisions of the Warren-led Supreme Court,  those decisions will hopefully always stand the test of time.
