 This album, as well as the excellent "Leftoverture" and the  slightly uneven "Monolith" represent what I call the "Kansas  Trilogy"; that is, the three best albums the group has released to  date (I haven't heard "Somewhere to Elsewhere" yet). Kerry  Livgren wrote the majority of the tracks on "Point of Know  Return", but I have never seen that much dissimilarity between his  writing style and that of Steve Walsh, who is the band's other principal  songwriter.  Every song on this album is entertaining and listenable.  I  particularly like "Portrait (He Knew)", a ditty about Albert  Einstein, "Closet Chronicles", a song depicting the life of  Howard Hughes, and my favorite song is the somewhat bittersweet  "Nobody's Home", with a particularly moving violin solo from  Robby Steinhardt. If Kansas is, as many have stated, the best  "art-rock" group of the 70's, then "Point of Know  Return" is unquestionably the most polished, best-executed example of  that genre.
