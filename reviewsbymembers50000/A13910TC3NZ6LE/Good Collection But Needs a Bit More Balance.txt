 I'm a huge fan of Les Paul and Mary Ford and I own a copy of the "Legend and the Legacy" box set, so I may be a bit biased in my review of this disc, which frankly I think is a little top heavy with the vocal works.  There are only a few instrumental tracks here, and while those are very good indeed, some of Les's best stuff was left out.  Had I been compiling this disc I would have included "Brazil", "Caravan", and my all time favorite Les Paul instrumental piece "Little Rock Getaway", in which Les cuts loose with just about everything in his arsenal.  Like "Lover", it's a very interesting and complex arrangement that's a joy to hear.  I'm also a little puzzled as to why some of Mary Ford's best vocal work was left off this disc.  I would have gladly traded her cover version of "Tennessee Waltz" for "Cryin'", a song that I consider to be one of the most beautiful things she's ever sung.  "Dry My Tears", a song with which Mary Ford and Les Paul and closely identified, was also left out.  That aside, I am thankful that the powers that be saw fit to include an edition of Les and Mary's radio program that features "Avalon", "Where or When", and "I'll See You in my Dreams", three songs that I would love to have heard in full on the box set.  All in all, I think this is a fairly good collection, albeit a bit heavy on the vocal hits and not nearly representative enough of Les Paul's extraordinary guitar talent.  Until you're fortunate enough to find the box set, this collection will have to do.
