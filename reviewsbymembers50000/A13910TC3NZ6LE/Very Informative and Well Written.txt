 When I first read this book, I prepared myself for somewhat of a conservative slant, given the tone of many of Rehnquist's decisions since he was appointed to the Court in 1971.  However, and quite surprisingly, this book is well-written and does not attempt to present a conservative  view of the Supreme Court.  As the previous customer reviewer noted, this  is an excellent book for the layperson who wants to understand how the  Court functions.  As an attorney, I find it concise and written so as to  explain the inner workings of the Court without trying to be patronizing or  condescending.  I'm highly impressed!
