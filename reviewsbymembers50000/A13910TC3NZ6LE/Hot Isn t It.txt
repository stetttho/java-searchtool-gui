 "Summer in the City-Live in New York" is a standout album by Joe Jackson.  I like it much better than "Live 1980-86", which I also own.  On this sprakling collection of familiar Jackson tunes and cover versions, Joe performs with a stripped down trio comprised of him, longtime bassist Graham Maby, and Gary Burke on the drums.    I never fail to be amazed at the clarity and sound quality of this CD.  It equals or exceeds the quality of many studio recordings, and I would go so far as to call it one of the best engineered recordings I've ever heard.  As for the songs, Joe's renditions of the Lovin' Spoonful's "Summer in the City" and Steely Dan's "King of the World" are excellent, although I didn't care much for his version of the Beatles' "Eleanor Rigby." The best tracks on this disc are the "Fools in Love/For Your Love" medley (the latter a creditable remake of the Yardbirds hit), a stunningly beautiful performance of Duke Ellington's "Mood Indigo", and the medley of "Be My Number Two/Hometown/It's Different for Girls".  Joe takes a somewhat different approach to his performance "Hometown" than the stuio version heard on his excellent (and sadly out of print) "Big World" album of 1984, turning a cynical guitar driven song into a wistful voice and piano piece that is truly one of the most beautiful pieces I've ever heard him perform.  Sadly, this type of arrangement did not suit the CD's final track, "One More Time".  The original studio version on the "Look Sharp" album has much more bite and verve.   Joe, if you read these reviews I could definitely do with another disc of performances like this.  "Night and Day 2" is okay, but it can't touch this one!
