 I had to write this review after reading so many rave reviews of "Heat", which is overrated compared to "Thief".  It makes me wonder how many of those customer reviewers are adolescents or  young adults who have not seen this picture. This motion picture is  somewhat similar in plot to "Heat", but with considerably less  violence (until about the final 30 minutes).  James Caan is at his best as  an ex-con trying to play his cards close to the vest when he makes a deal  with a mob leader that ends disastrously.  I find myself agreeing with the  customer reviewer who wrote that this was Caan's best acting performance  ever.  The intensity and feel of "Thief" make it a far superior  movie to "Heat", with excellent supporting performances from  Willie Nelson, Tuesday Weld, and Jim Belushi. Especially noteworthy is  the performance of Robert Prosky as Leo, the mobster who thinks he's got  Caan's character under his thumb only to get his comeuppance.  Look for  Rick Rossovich and Dennis Farina as Leo's hired muscle.   In addition to  a great plot and great performances (hallmarks of almost every film Mann's  ever done) is a soundtrack by Tangerine Dream that really rocks!  Rent or  buy this movie, and if you like it, start your quest for the soundtrack  album immediately!  You'll be glad you did. Don't get me wrong here,  "Heat" was a good movie.  "Thief", however, was done  first and done better
