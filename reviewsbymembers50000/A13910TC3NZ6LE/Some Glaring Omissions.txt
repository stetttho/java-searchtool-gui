 I'm a huge fan of Les Paul and after reviewing the track list on this CD, I don't see how anyone in their right mind could call it an "all time greatest hits" collection.    While tracks such as "Mockin' Bird Hill", "The World is Waiting for the Sunrise", and "Vaya Con Dios"  among the duo's best loved and best known songs, I find the omission of "How High the Moon", one the their biggest hits, to be unforgiveable.  Equally astonishing is why "Dry My Tears", the theme song of Les & Mary's 50s radio show, and "Cryin'", arguably the best song Mary Ford has ever sung, were excluded.  I would much rather have had those tracks included in the disc than the cover version of Patti Page's "Tennessee Waltz", and the ersatz "Meet Mr. Callaghan".  It's also hard to understand why the only Les Paul solo instrumental track on this disc is "Bye Bye Blues".  "Lover", the song that propelled Les into the spotlight, and "Nola", a song that enjoyed worldwide popularity, were inexplicably left out.  While this is a decent collection of the work of Les Paul and Mary Ford, it is definitely NOT their all time greatest hits.  The record label ought to be sued for false advertising.
