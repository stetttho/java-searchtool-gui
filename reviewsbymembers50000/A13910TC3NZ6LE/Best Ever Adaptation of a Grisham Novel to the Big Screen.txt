 As is typically the case, I read the excellent novel by John Grisham before watching this motion picture.  As is not typically the case, though, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Francis Ford Coppola should be one of only a few  directors even allowed to direct a big screen version of a Grisham novel  (and they should keep Sidney Pollak the hell away from them)! This movie  abounds with excellent performances from Matt Damon, Jon Voight, Mickey  Rourke, Claire Danes, Danny Glover, & Danny DeVito.  Coppola and the  cast clearly got their mojo working on this one.  The only reason I gave  this picture 4 stars instead of 5 is that it failed to include Grisham's  portrayal of Rudy Baylor in his last year of law school and the breakup of  the firm in which he thought he had a secure future.  It also doesn't do a  very good job of telling us how Rudy met Miss Birdie to begin with (again,  read the book).  This novel came out just as I finished law school, and my  wife thought that Rudy's early struggles really made the book.  I agree  with her. Coppola settled for a really good movie when he could have made a  great one instead.
