 Do yourself a favor.  If you want a compilation of early Tubes classics from the 70's, pass on this CD and buy "The Best of the Tubes-Millenium Collection".  The version of "White Punks on Dope" which appears on T.R.A.S.H. is a godawful edit that loses the sonic mayhem which makes the original a punk classic.  This same criticism goes for the live version of "Mondo Bondage" which appears on this CD.  The original studio version from the first Tubes LP (available on CD) is much better. The studio version of "Bondage" is also included in the Millenium Collection.   My other criticism of this collection is the somewhat questionable decision to include "I'm Just A Mess", in my opinion the weakest track on the "Now" album.  The Millenium Collection includes "Pound of Flesh", a much better track from the same album (which by the way should be released on CD if anyone from A & M Records is reading this review).
