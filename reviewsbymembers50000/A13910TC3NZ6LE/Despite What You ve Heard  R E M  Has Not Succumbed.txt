 I'm frankly amazed at the number of negative reviews that this CD has received.  Granted it's somewhat dark and foreboding, and the dearth of guitar work is painfully evident.  But after the much overrated "New  Adventures in Hi Fi", this seemed to me like the next logical  direction for R.E.M. to take musically.  "At My Most Beautiful"  is Stipe's most emotional and heartfelt composition since  "Nightswimming".  Different isn't always bad, at least not on  this CD.
