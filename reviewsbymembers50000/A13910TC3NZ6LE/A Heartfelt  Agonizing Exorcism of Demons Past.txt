 Judging from the amount of negative reviews this book has garnered, it seems that Bob Kerrey just can't win.  Some rather ignorantly and cynically criticize it as a tome of self-aggrandizement by a still aspiring politician.  Others, particularly political conservatives, gleefully lambaste Kerrey with hateful diatribes based on his politics rather than on anything of substance or fact.  Still others think he owes them some sort of explanation about his role in Vietnam.  They are, as one previous reviewer of this book stated, "unpardonably arrogant." "When I Was a Young Man" represents Kerrey's attempt to exorcise some of the demons that have haunted him since his days as a young man.  He looks wistfully at his childhood and college years in Lincoln, Nebraska, and goes on to tell about his career as a Navy SEAL and his deployment to Vietnam, where he lost a leg and was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.  As most of us also know, he was also involved in a most unfortunate mission that resulted in a number of innocent civilians being killed.  Kerrey clearly doesn't dwell on the subject for reasons best known to him, but to his critics I would say that he doesn't owe you an explanation.  Further, unless you were there and faced what he did you have no right to criticize.  This book represents Kerrey's attempt to deal with the horrors of war in the best way he knows how.  I found it to be an interesting read well worth my time.  But if you want startling revelations about what is best characterized as a tragic incident that unfortunately occurs in armed conflicts, you'd best look elsewhere.
