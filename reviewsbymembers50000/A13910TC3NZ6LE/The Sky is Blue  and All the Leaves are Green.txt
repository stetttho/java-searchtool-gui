 This movie received its fair share of bad reviews, and much of the criticism centered on the quality of the cinematography and sound.  Keeping in mind that this was Trey Parker's first picture and had a very limited budget, I must say that I believe those criticisms are for the most part exaggerated.  In fact, I think this film is much better than anyone had a right to expect under the circumstances. "Cannibal! the Musical" is the story of the ill-fated journey of Alfred Packer and his party from Utah to Breckenridge Colorado when they became stranded and without food resorted to cannibalism, with Packer being the lone survivor.  Parker plays the title role and the usual suspects-Matt Stone and Dian Bachar-play members of the ill-fated party.  Those who have seen "Orgazmo" may recognize the oriental actor who played "G-Fresh" in that picture in the role of an Indian chief here.  The acting is good, but you won't see any Oscar worthy performances here.  I found the movie to be quite entertaining although somewhat uneven and not quite as funny as "Orgazmo" or "Baseketball".  The musical numbers are all very good and have very clever lyrics (a strong suit of Parker's).  You'll be singing them to yourself for days afterward. Overall, I think Parker acquits himself well in "Cannibal! The Musical".  Check out the credits at the end of the film and you'll realize that this was Trey's baby from beginning to end.  If you're not squeamish or a prude this motion picture is worth a look.
