 I rented Jackass-The Movie having only seen a few random stunts on MTV.  I really was not into Johnny Knoxville's brand of humor, but my son insisted that it was one of the funniest movies he'd ever seen.  He was right...sort of.  Some of the stunts had me laughing like I hadn't laughed since high school, while others were looked so painful or repulsive that I cringed. I liked the rent a car demo derby sketch, the golf cart stunt was hilarious, and the part where the guys shoot bottle rockets out of their rectums was insanely funny.  On the other hand, the scene where the guy eats a yellow snow cone made in part from his own urine was something I could have done without.   As I might have expected, the reviews of this movie run the gamut from completely offended to totally loved.  One reviewer who trashed the picture made a reference to Tom Green (who is not in this picture) which makes me believe he hadn't bothered to take the time to watch the movie before panning it.  Personally I thought it was for the most part interesting and funny although it does feature some totally repulsive scenes that will offend most viewers in my age group (I'm 46).     My advice is to watch the movie with an open mind...and a finger poised over the fast forward button on your DVD player just in case.
