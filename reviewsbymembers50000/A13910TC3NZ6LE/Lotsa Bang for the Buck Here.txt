 The CLIE S320 was my third PDA in the sub $... price range and in terms of features and performance, it stands head and shoulders above the competition.   The main thing that makes the S320 such an attractive buy is that it is one of the few (if not the only) PDA in this price range to feature a rechargeable lithium battery.  Second, although the display appears to be slightly smaller than on a 100 series Palm, it is easier to read and features a much more usable backlight.  Third, it is expandable.  The lowest priced expandable PDA made by Palm is the M125, which typically sells for about $... more and does not have rechargeable batteres.  Fourth, the jog dial makes it much easier to navigate through the desktop than using the stylus, although it admittedly takes some getting used to. The only negatives about the S320 is that it does not come with a hotsync cradle, although it does come with a separate sync cable and battery charger.  I don't find this to be much more than a minor inconvenience.  The display to me appears to be slightly smaller than that of a Palm, but the fact that it is much easier to read and features a better backlight than the Palm more than makes up for it. I have had only a brief opportunity to compare the S320 to the Handspring Visor series, which I also think is a good buy for the money.  To me, the CLIE has a more contemporary look than the Visor's cheap "plastic calculator" look, although they are similar in performance, depending on the Visor model (I'm speaking about the Neo series here). Overall, Sony has managed to provide a number of good and useful features in the S320 for its price.  It can be bought almost anywhere for approximately $....  This one is well worth a look.  Unfortunately, I'm selling mine because my wife bought me a Palm M500 for Christmas, a PDA which is only slightly better than the CLIE but costs twice as much.
