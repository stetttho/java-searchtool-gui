 A few of the reviews of "Reindeer Games", mostly negative ones,  refer to it mistakenly as an action picture.  I don't agree with that  characterization.  This is more like a good crime drama, with a little bit  of action here and there. Ben Affleck portrays a prisoner who along with  his cellmate is ready to leave prison.  When the cellmate unexpectedly  dies, Affleck takes his place and meets a woman (Charlize Theron) with whom  the cellmate had a "pen pal" relationship.  He is soon  unwillingly recruited by her brother (Gary Sinise) to assist in a casino  robbery.   The plot was interesting and has more than a few unexpected  and somewhat implausible plot twists, but it nevertheless entertains.   Director John Frankenheimer's stock in trade is taut political dramas such  as "Seven Days in May" and "The Manchurian Candidate",  which typically don't feature much gunplay or violence, and the violence in  this film is certainly restrained compared to what one would normally  expect to see in a motion picture of this nature.  This may be what some  viewers found so disappointing. The acting was good all around.  Sinise,  in particular, shines as a malevolent truck driver with just a hint of  Charlie Manson.  Performances like this leave little doubt as to why he's  one of the best supporting actors in motion pictures.  Dennis Farina, also  a favorite of mine, is very good as a disenfranchised casino manager.  I  recommend "Reindeer Games", but not as a "shoot-em-up"  good-guy bad-guy movie like "Die Hard".
