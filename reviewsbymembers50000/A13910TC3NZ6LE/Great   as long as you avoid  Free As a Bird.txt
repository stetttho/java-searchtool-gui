 Anthology One is, as many other reviewers have said, a collection intended primarily for hard core Beatle fans.  The sound on many of the early recordings is, as you might expect, raw and rather poor in quality.  But rather than whining about "scraping the bottom of the barrel", fans of the fab four should delight in gaining valuable insight into the early days of the band.  Fortunately for us John, Paul, George, and Ringo all became better musicians and vocalists. I avoid comparisons between the two discs in this set because I believe they complement one another.  In the second disc one hears an obviously more polished, professional sound than on the first, but that doesn't mean the first disc is rubbish-far from it.  My favorite tracks on the set are "Three Cool Cats", "Besame Mucho", and interesting live versions of "This Boy" and "I Want to Hold Your Hand".  My least favorite tracks are "How Do You Do It", which George Martin had intended to be the Beatles' first single (fortunately, the band persuaded him to release "Love Me Do" instead) and "Free as a Bird", which suffers from overproduction by Jeff Lynne and sounds more like ELO than the Beatles (I have this same complaint about "Real Love" on Anthology Two as well as most of George Harrison's "Cloud Nine" album).  In the hands of a different producer, I'm sure this song would have sounded more "Beatle-like".   Despite the few negatives, Anthology One is overall a very good collection and a must have for diehard Beatlemaniacs.
