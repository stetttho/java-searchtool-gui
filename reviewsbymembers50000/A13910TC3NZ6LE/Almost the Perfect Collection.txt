 I was a fan of the Grass Roots in the late 60's and early 70's and had most of their singles back then.  Although this collection is pretty good and includes most of their hit singles, the glaring omission of "Walking Through the Country", a chart single from 1970, is the one thing that keeps this from being the definitive Grass Roots CD.  Those interested in the band's complete discography would do better by purchasing the two CD collection available here on Amazon.com and elsewhere.  Even though it costs more, the additional songs are worth the added expense.
