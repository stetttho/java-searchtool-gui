 If it weren't for the fact that Maltin's guide does serve as a good reference for determining the plot of any given motion picture, it would otherwise be as worthless as its author.  The guide is of absolutely no worth in determining the relative artistic merit of any motion picture  because Maltin has shown throughout the years that he wouldn't know a good  movie if it slapped him upside the head.  Furthermore, he tends to show a  rather strong bias for artsy movies, particularly foreign films.  At least  other critics like Shalit, Ebert, and Reed are a little more objective and  even-handed in their reviews.  If being a critic means being at odds with  the movie-going public 90% of the time, then Leonard Maltin's your  reviewer.  I put him right down there with Michael Medved as being a hack  masquerading as a movie critic. More simply put, there are better movie  guides out there than Maltin's.  Haliwell's, for example, is a lot more  objective and a better buy for the money.
