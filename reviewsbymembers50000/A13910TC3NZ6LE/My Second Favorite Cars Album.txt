 "Heartbeat City", in my opinion, is one of the best two or three albums to be released in 1984.  Sure, there is a fair amount of criticism that the songs are a bit too techno and sterile, but I think that's what gives the album it's edge. Among the criteria I use in judging any album is how many really good songs are on it.  Not just songs that I can tolerate, but ones that I really like.  In this regard, "Heartbeat City" scores 9 out of 10, almost as good as "Candy-O", my favorite Cars album.  In fact, this album spawned 5 single releases-that's no mean feat.  "I Refuse" is about the only track I don't like.  "Why Can't I Have You", "You Might Think", "Magic", and the title track are all outstanding songs.  "Drive" is a tour-de-force and one of the best singles releases by any band in an otherwise forgettable year of pop songs.   Except for some rather tepid lyrics, "Drive" had the potential to become a standard in the tradition of the Beatles' "Yesterday". Even after 16 years, "Heartbeat City" is not all that dated.  Give it a listen.
