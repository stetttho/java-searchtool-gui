 My son-in-law talked me into watching this movie, and I must admit that it's quite good.  De Niro is at his best as a meticulous if not obsessed criminal, and Pacino is his usual excellent self as an equally obsessed law  enforcement officer. The supporting cast, including Val Kilmer, Ashley  Judd, and Tom Sizemore all turn in good performances.  Amy Brenneman was  somewhat underutilized, and her rather insignificant part in this movie  made me wonder why she was even cast in the first place. One only needs  to spend a few minutes with this movie to know that it's a Michael Mann  production.  The visuals, attention to detail, the pacing, and music are  all trademarks of Mann's.  The plot, unfortunately, is somewhat derivative  of one of Mann's earlier movies, the excellent and underrated  "Thief", starring James Caan, Jim Belushi, and Willie  Nelson. Overall, this is a very good movie that could have been greater  with a more beefed-up plot.
