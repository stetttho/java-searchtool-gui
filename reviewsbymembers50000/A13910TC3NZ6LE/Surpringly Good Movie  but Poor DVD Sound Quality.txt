 "She's All That" is an engaging teenage version of "My Fair Lady", that succeeds because of strong acting and chemistry between the two leads, Freddie Prinze Jr. and Rachel Lee Cook.  At least one  reviewer from Michigan seemed to have some sort of feminist agenda  in her negative remarks about this picture.  My advice is that you watch  without your agenda filter on.  If you do that, you'll find this to be one  of the better teenage romantic comedies to come around in a while.  In my  opinion, it's better than "Ten Things I Hate About You", a  teenage Taming of the Shrew which I also liked. Having said that  "She's All That" is a good motion picture and worthy of your  time, I must warn you that you'd be better off seeing it on VHS than DVD.   Occasionally movies suffer in sound quality when undergoing the transition  to DVD.  Unfortunately, this is one of the worst examples I've ever heard.   Stick with the VHS version and you'll be happer for it.
