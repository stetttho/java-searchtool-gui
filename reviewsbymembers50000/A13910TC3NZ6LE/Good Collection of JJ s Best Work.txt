 I highly recommend this disc for someone who is even a casual fan of Joe Jackson and wants to explore the many facets of his musical career-from punk angst to jumpin' jive to Cole Porteresque pop songs and beyond.  The selections on this disc represent the best tracks of the many musical pallettes from which Jackson has painted the musical landscape. Most critics of "best of" collections, including myself, will always complain that one or two songs they thought had merit were left off.  Two reviewers bemoaned the exclusion of "Real Men" from the "Night and Day" album.  I know many gay men think of this song as sort of an anthem, but it hardly qualifies as one of the songs that shaped Jackson's career so much as album filler.  The two singles that " N & D" spawned are sufficient for this collection but if another track off that disc had to be included here my vote would have been for "Chinatown" or "Cancer".  One other reviewer complained about the live version of "Memphis", but I liked the ambience of that version and have no problem with it whatsoever. So what would I have included on this CD?  Well, more of Jackson's soundtrack music.  "Rhythm Delivery" or "Shape in a Drape" from the soundtrack to the motion picture "Tucker" would have been nice.  Joe also scored the theme music to a television detective series in the 1980's called "Private Eye" that had a lot of punch to it.  Maybe they're being saved for ....dare I hope?... a future Joe Jackson box set.  Given Joe's contempt for music videos and other conventions of contemporary music, it's probably just wishful thinking on my part. Until someone wises up and gives us that JJ box set, this disc will have to do.
