 Please don't pay attention to the previous reviewer who referred to this collection as a disgrace and advises readers to buy T.R.A.S.H. instead.  The latter has a terrible edit of "White Punks on Dope", the band's signature song, whereas this CD features the song EXACTLY as it was recorded on the first Tubes album.  It also features a live version of "Mondo Bondage" that isn't nearly as good as the studio version which appears on this CD (and also on the first Tubes album). This is by far the better collection, but don't take my word for it.  Listen to both and judge for yourself.  If you liked "White Punks" as much as I did, you'll pass on T.R.A.S.H. and buy this one instead.
