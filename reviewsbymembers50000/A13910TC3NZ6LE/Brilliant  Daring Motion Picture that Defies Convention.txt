 Paul Thomas Anderson has made his masterpiece with Magnolia, a daring movie that may forever change the way we look at motion pictures.   Magnolia deals with a variety of subjects:  coincidence, redemption, forgiveness, loneliness, and love-all with incredible understanding and empathy.  The whole of the movie is greater than the sum of its ensemble cast parts.  As many know, Tom Cruise received a well-deserved best supporting actor Oscar nomination for his part as a multimedia sex guru with a painful past.  But there are so many other affecting performances in this picture, like John C. Reilly as a lonely police officer, Melora Walters as his coke-sniffing love interest, William H. Macy as a former quiz-kid, Jason Robards as Cruise's dying father and Phillip Seymour Hoffman as his male nurse-just to name a few.  Paul Thomas Anderson's direction brings out inspired performances from everyone in the cast. One of the most touching and emotional parts in Magnolia is the "Wise Up" sequence, set to Aimee Mann's incredibly haunting song.  It must be experienced to be believed.  Mann's songs are used extensively in the excellent soundtrack, as well as a couple of vintage Supertramp compositions-"The Logical Song" and "Goodbye Stranger". A word of warning to the viewer.  Magnolia is not the kind of motion picture that one can sit through and be entertained.  Thinking and introspection are required.  But if you invest your time and emotion, the payoff is worth it-even at three hours plus in length. The DVD is chock full of features and includes a second disc that includes Aimee Mann's "Save Me" video, trailers, and a video diary of the making of Magnolia.
