 I have been very happy with my i705 and agree for the most part with the other reviewers.  The form factor is quite fine, and the device seems to be (so far) very dependable.  If you need wireless web or e-mail capability, the i705 is a bargain at its price. The biggest single problem with the i705, in my opinion, is the rather pricey PalmNet service that you must subscribe to if you wish to take advantage of its wireless capabilities.  Palm's "associate plan" is for all practical purposes a joke and if you get more than ten e-mails per month it's not worth the money.  Unlimited service costs considerably more and if you're a heavy e-mail user, it might be worth the cost.  Personally, I think it is not.  The i705 is a quality product and in my opinion is infinitely more dependable than the M500 I owned before it, but unless you really need wireless capability, live in an area covered by PalmNet, and don't mind being gouged by their obscenely high subscription rates, I'd pass on this one.
