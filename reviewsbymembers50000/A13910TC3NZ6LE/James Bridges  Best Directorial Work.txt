 I found myself compelled to write this review for a number of reasons:  (1) I graduated from law school (although not Harvard), (2) My mother and James Bridges were childhood friends, (3) I've been an admirer of John Houseman's work for as long as I can remember, and finally (4) I've watched this movie several times and like it. Timothy Bottoms stars as James Hart, a midwestern boy literally dumped into his first year of Harvard Law School.  John Houseman is Professor William Kingsfield, a curmudgeonly contract law professor about whom Hart has ambivalent feelings of dread and admiration. Lindsay Wagner is Kingsfield's daughter, with whom Hart is having a relationship. This picture brought the so-called Socratic method of instruction into the light of day and doubtlessly inspired many professors of subjects other than the law.  It no doubt also inspired many impressionable young men to consider a career in the law (as it did me).  But the reason to really enjoy this movie is neither of those...it's Houseman's electrifying performance that netted him an Academy Award for best supporting actor.  This film also stands as a testament to the short but spectacular directorial career of the late James Bridges, who went on to direct "The China Syndrome" and "Urban Cowboy" among several other films. It should also be remembered that this picture inspired a short-lived CBS television series of the same name in which Houseman reprised the Kingsfield role.  The show spawned the careers of, among others, Jon Lovitz of Saturday Night Live fame and Jane Kaczmarek (of the TV series "Malcolm in the Middle") and after its rather short-sighted cancellation by CBS was picked by Showtime, who ordered new episides, giving the series another five years of life until discontinued in 1984. Did this picture have an impact?  Absolutely.  Was it good?  You bet!  And to James Bridges, wherever you are "thanks for the career advice...and hello from my mom!"
