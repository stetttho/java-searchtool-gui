 Orgazmo is truly one of the funniest motion pictures I've ever seen.  Trey Parker directs and stars as Joe Young, a Mormon missionary who inadvertently winds up being cast in an adult film as Orgazmo, an erotic superhero.  Dian Bachar plays an MIT graduate cast as his sidekick, Choda Boy.  Matt Stone plays an overenthusiastic production assistant similar to the "Scotty" role played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman in "Boogie Nights".  Real life porn stars Ron Jeremy, Chasey Lain, and my all-time favorite, Juli Ashton, also appear. Although "Orgazmo" is certainly a risque movie, I find myself agreeing with one reviewer who pondered the fact that it received an NC-17 rating despite having only a very brief amount of nudity and only moderate use of adult language.  Rating notwithstanding, the movie is simply hilarious.  Parker, despite his reputation, is very believable as a naive young man drawn into a very tawdry occupation.  The rest of the cast is quite credible, and the movie's theme song (written by Parker) had me falling out of my chair laughing. This picture obviously won't be for everyone.  Those who are thin-skinned enough to be offended by "South Park", and those really hung up on religion should avoid this one like the plague.  Nevertheless there are reviews from people of that sort here, which leads me to conclude that they just wanted to vent their indignation over something they probably never watched in the first place but would like to keep you from seeing.  Decide for yourself whether you're comfortable with the subject matter and if you are, watch and enjoy.
