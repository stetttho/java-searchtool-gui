 I bought "First" on 8 track tape shortly after I graduated from high school, largely on the strength of "Clouds", which had been released as a single.  Most of the other tracks turned out to be surprisingly good and it quickly became one of my favorites.  Several people have already commented on the "Clouds Suite" and I enthusiastically agree with their comments.  "Lorilee", "Sail Around the World", and "Soap (I Use The)" are also well-crafted pop gems worthy of a listen.  "Do You Believe He's Comin'" is a somewhat hard-edged profession of Christian faith that many contemporary Christian artists would do well to emulate.  The only track on this collection that I consider weak is "Sunday Riders", a somewhat half-hearted attempt that despite an infectuous guitar lick has some of the lamest lyrics I've ever heard from a songwriter of Gates' considerable talent. To the reviewer in Australia who said that many of the songs on this album were lifted from Gates' "Goodbye Girl" album, the fact is that this album was released 4 years before "Goodbye Girl".  Other than the title track, the only original song on that album was "Took the Last Train".  Every other track from that album was either from "First" or Gates' excellent sophomore effort "Never Let Her Go". After listening to this album again, I am truly disappointed and somewhat astonished that David Gates' post-Bread career didn't take off.  Thankfully, with this album we have the opportunity to hear these great songs again.  I sure hope that "Never Let Her Go" gets released on CD soon.
