 In the few chapters of this book that I've read since purchasing it, Catherine Crier has done a superb job of explaining what any clear thinking, intelligent person already knows-that the religious right is attempting to thwart democracy by perverting the judicial branch of government.  Although Crier seemingly comes across as a bit of an alarmist at times one cannot deny that she has researched the topic well and provided abundant source material.   What I find particularly noteworthy about "Contempt" is how Crier artfully points out the judicial activism that takes place on the far right, and how the term "judicial activism" has been co-opted by social conservatives to serve as a codeword for any sort of court decision that challenges their attempt to turn America into a religious theocracy.     As is the case anytime a book like this is published there will be the usual band of ignorant wingnuts (like Timothy Cornwell) slagging this book and questioning the credentials of the author.  The intelligent, objective observer would do well to avoid paying attention to such blather.  Crier is not a liberal; she's a moderate Republican with libertarian leanings.  She is also a former attorney and judge so I think it's far to say that she has a pretty good idea of what she's talking about.  If you are sincerely concerned about the tone this country has taken under George W. Bush, the religious charlatans who have effectively taken control of the Republican Party, and the hypocritical, corrupt politicians who do their bidding then this book is for you.
