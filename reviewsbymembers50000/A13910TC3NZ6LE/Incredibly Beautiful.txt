 The soundtrack of Heaven's Gate, by David Mansfield, is an underappreciated gem.  Sadly, because this soundtrack is so closely related with one of the biggest box office flops of all time, it will go largely ignored.  That's too bad, because it ranks right up there with Avalon as one of the best film scores of the 1980s. The exquisite blend of Eastern European folk melodies and Western music that permeates this soundtrack make it a joy to listen to.  Particularly noteworthy are the accoustic guitar version of Strauss's Blue Danube Waltz as well as Doug Kershaw's Mamou Two Step, a piece that Kershaw fortunately chose to make available on some of his CDs.  If you can't locate this soundtrack at least listen to that piece.  I'm pretty sure you'll be sold on the artistic merits of this CD if you do.
