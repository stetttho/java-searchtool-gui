 I absolutely loved the original "Caddyshack" from beginning to end.  If I had to choose the top 10 comedy motion pictures of all time, it  would definitely be on my list.....and then there's "Caddyshack  2". This sequel picture brings none of the characters from the  original "Caddyshack" back except for the gopher-and even he has  gotten a little full of himself.  The acting is terrible all the way  around.  Jackie Mason is not funny (and in my opinion, never was), Robert  Stack eschewed whatever dignity he had left when he agreed to take the part  of a snobbish country-clubber, and one gets the impression that Dyan Cannon  is only there for window dressing-or to make a few bucks.  Dan Ackroyd was  somewhat funny, but that doesn't redeem this worthless, bloated carcass of  a movie in any respect. I'd give that fetid piece of dung of a motion  picture zero stars if I could.  Since I can't, the only thing I can say to  prospective viewers is to avoid this one at all costs!
