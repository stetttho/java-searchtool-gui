 Nobody will ever accuse the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences of having common sense or good taste.  I'm still scratching my head trying to figure out why this film was beat out by "Shakespeare in Love",  and why Jim Carey, who turned in the best performance of his career in  "The Truman Show", wasn't even nominated for best actor. The  plot of this movie is simple enough-Jim Carey plays a young man whose  entire life has been entertainment for the rest of the world.  He dares to  reach beyond the giant bubble which is his universe to see what's out  there, only to be foiled.   Of particular note is the scene toward the  end of the film where Truman reaches the end of the dome shaped studio and  is told by Christoph (Ed Harris) about his world.  This stands out as one  of the most magical scenes in an extraordinary motion picture. I realize  that this movie isn't for everyone (my wife, for one, didn't particularly  like it), but Carey's performance alone justifies the purchase of this  video.  He displays a vulnerability and childlike fascination that is  unlike anything I've ever seen.  A very good supporting cast includes the  shamefully overlooked Ed Harris, as well as Laura Linney. "The  Truman Show" is one of the most brilliant and overlooked motion  pictures ever made.  The ersatz "Ed TV", which followed a similar  plot, doesn't begin to approach the craftsmanship of "The Truman  Show".  Hopefully, the Academy will make up for their slight of Jim  Carey with "Man on the Moon, which appears to be his second acting  tour de force.
