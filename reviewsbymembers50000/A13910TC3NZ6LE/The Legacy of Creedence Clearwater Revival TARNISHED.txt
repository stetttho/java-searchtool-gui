 There are few among us who would disagree that Creedence Clearwater Revival was one of the best bands of the 70's and one of the best singles bands of all time.  So, why this collection?   Credence Clearwater Revisited was born out of the hatred and animus for John Fogerty on the part of former bandmates Stu Cook and Doug Clifford, who prompted Fantasy Records president Saul Zaentz to sue Fogerty for allegedly plagiarizing one of his own songs (Forgerty eventually won the lawsuit).  The wounds run deep and any chance that the band would ever reunite ended with the death of guitarist Tom Fogerty in the mid 1980's.  Fogerty, to this day, refuses to perform with Cook and Clifford and wouldn't allow them on stage when the band was inducted into the Rock N' Roll Hall of Fame.   The songs on this disc are performed competently, but John Tristo is no John Fogerty in the vocals department-he simply lacks the intensity of Fogerty and sounds a little too polished.  The instrumental work is excellent, particularly by ex-Cars guitarist Eliot Easton.  And the tracks are for the most part faithful renditions of the originals. One question remains, however-why buy this album when most of Credence Clearwater Revival's body of work is still available on CD, and it costs about the same?  For those who like the songs don't care enough about what John Fogerty brought to rock n' roll, Recollection will do.  John Fogerty is reticent about performing much of his old Creedence Clearwater Revival material and there's a good reason for that; namely, that the original recordings simply can't be improved on.  Fogerty has moved on, and so should these guys.
