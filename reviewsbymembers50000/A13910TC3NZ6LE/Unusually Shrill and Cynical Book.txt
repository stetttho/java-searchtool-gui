 Quite simply put, "Slouching Toward Gemorrah" is Robert Bork's  embittered parting shot at a society he doesn't forgive for its criticism  of his ultra-conservative views.  Unfortunately all Bork does is engage in  shrill criticism of everything from contemporary music and television to  the Catholic church.   Unfortunately, there's not much to read about here  other than hateful polemics from a bitter, shallow man whose outspoken and  out of touch views cost him an appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court.  Bork  is best remembered as nothing more than a footnote in American  jurisprudence and a shining example of the utter nonsense that the Reagan  era stood for.
