 I think one of the best tests of an album's quality is if the songs still sound fresh and interesting years after its release.  Well, 27 years have elapsed since Steve Miller recorded Fly Like an Eagle and after all this time it's still a very enjoyable album to hear.  I like every track on this album with the exception of Sweet Maree, which seems kind of aimless and doesn't really fit well with the rest of the tracks.  I also must take issue with the reviewer who referred to Miller's cover version of Sam Cooke's You Send Me as "by the numbers".  The tight harmony vocals on this track are superb and make it stand out as one of the best tracks on the album.  My favorite tracks are You Send Me, The Window, Serenade, Dance Dance Dance, and Mercury Blues.  In my personal opinion, this CD is one that any rock afficianado ought to own.  It's a classic from a year that brought us a wealth of great music.
