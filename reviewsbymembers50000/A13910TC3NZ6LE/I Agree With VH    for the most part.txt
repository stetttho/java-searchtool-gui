 I consider "Revolver" to be the best Beatles album of all time for a number of good reasons, but I'm not sure I would go so far as to call it the best rock album of all time.  There are a number of other worthy contenders from other artists. Having said that, I see that at least a few reviewers are somewhat obsessed as to whether VH-1 was referring to the 11 track Capitol release of the LP for the American market or the 14 track British version.  Since the featured version of "Revolver" is a CD with 14 tracks, I assume that's the one voted on by VH-1's "panel".   "Revolver" stands out among other Beatle albums because the tracks show a progression from the harmless, innocent earlier works like "She Loves You" and "I Want to Hold Your Hand" that would be fully realized by "Sergeant Pepper" and "Magical Mystery Tour" a few years later.  George Harrison comes into his own as a songwriter with "Taxman", an acerbic observation of British taxation.  "Tomorrow Never Knows", "Eleanor Rigby", and "Dr. Robert" show John Lennon and Paul McCartney reaching out and experimenting with song topics and styles.  Yet there are still connections, however tenuous, to earlier works in songs like "Got to Get You Into My Life" and "And Your Bird Can Sing" (my personal favorite).  Only "Yellow Submarine" seems out of place...I don't think it fits in with the rest of the album. Beatle fans all have their favorites, and many will prefer "Sergeant Pepper", "Rubber Soul", and "Abbey Road" to this album, but "Revolver" is a snapshot of the Beatles in transition from hitmakers to serious songwriters and for that reason alone stands out as their best.
