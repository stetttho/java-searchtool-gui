 I don't believe that there's such a thing as a bad Doors album.  "The  Soft Parade" came perilously close, however.  My biggest problem is  not with the songs so much as with their arrangements.  Someone came up  with the idea of trying to put string arrangements to most of the tracks in  the grand tradition of Phil Spector, and the simple fact is you can't do  this on a Doors record without blunting its sonic effect. As a result,  the songs that were not sweetened by swelling orchestral music, notably  "Shaman's Blues, "Do It", "Easy Ride" "Wild  Child", and especially the title track, come out as the edgy,  convention-defying kind of material we've come to expect from the Doors  instead of the fluffy ear candy that is the remainder of the album with the  exception of "Running Blue", where the use of horns didn't seem  to inflict much damage.   In my ranking of the six studio LP's the Doors  did with Morrison, "The Soft Parade" is tied with "LA  Woman" for dead last place.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, given  the fact that the Doors' entire catalog is better than the best albums of  some other bands.
