 Despite the inevitable comparisons to other animated features like Shrek, Monster's Inc., and Toy Story, I liked Ice Age.  Many have criticized it as being derivative of the other pictures, particularly Shrek, but I disagree.  The characters are well-developed and somewhat more interesting in Shrek, and the story is slightly more entertaining.  The animation is superb, and the Scrat character appears from time to time to keep this movie from taking itself too seriously or becoming monotonous. The characters are well-voiced, with Ray Romano providing the voice of Manny the Mammoth, John Leguizamo doing Sid the Sloth, and Denis Leary voicing Diego the Sabre Toothed Tiger.  Leguizamo, whose comedy I've never particularly cared for, does a first rate job with his character.  Romano sounds like he's going through the motions, but I suspect that's what his character is supposed to be doing. For those who need some basis of comparison, I would rate Ice Age as slightly better than Shrek and definitely on par with Monster's Inc.  The humor occasionally might seem to be a bit of a reach for younger viewers but this is what gives the movie staying power with audiences of all ages.  One or two have criticized its "bad humans" message, which is nothing more than a one time reference to hunting.  It never becomes cloying  or beats the viewer to death with the message as in Spirit, which was released around the same time.  This is a good family movie that should be a seminal part of any collection.
