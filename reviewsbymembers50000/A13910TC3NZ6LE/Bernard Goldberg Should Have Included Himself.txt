 Ever since his departure from CBS News Bernard Goldberg has taken to exorciating in print just about everyone who disagrees with his own narrow minded view of America.  "100 People Who Are Screwing Up America" is his latest and most pathetic attempt to date.    The problem is that if he wanted to engage in a full and fair discussion of people who really are screwing up America he should have included himself as well as people like Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Ann Coulter, and Michael Savage for what they have done to civilized political discourse in this country.  Civilized political discourse, rather than blind adherence to political extremism, is the very essence of what America is all about.  Just read the uninformed, ignorant comments by B.C. Hackman in his review if you want proof of how bad things have really gotten in this age of spin groups and Swift Boat Liars.  Michael Moore and Al Franken are included in Goldberg's list, but it should be noted that these people represent the political left's reaction to the individuals that Goldberg conveniently neglected to list, thereby leading to the conclusion that this latest work is just another hackneyed screed written for the same right wing audience that has bought his other books.  I'm surprised Goldberg didn't want to title this book "The New Mein Kampf".  It seems to be going in about the same direction as the original.
