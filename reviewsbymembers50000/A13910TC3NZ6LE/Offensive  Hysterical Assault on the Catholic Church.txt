 Christian fundamentalist author Jack T. Chick unleashes an indefensible, hateful assault on the Catholic church.  He cites few facts in support of his conclusions and those he does cite are from questionable sources.  His knowledge of world history is sadly lacking, and it shows in abundance here.   Chick is to the Christian religion as the Taliban is to the Moslem religion.
