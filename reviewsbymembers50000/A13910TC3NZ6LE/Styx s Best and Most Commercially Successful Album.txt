 I categorize Styx albums in two categories:  pre Tommy Shaw and Tommy Shaw  because Shaw's presence changed the musical direction in which the band was  going, mostly for the better.   In the "pre-Shaw" period,  "Equinox" is unquestionably the group's best album.  In the Tommy  Shaw era, "The Grand Illusion" is easily their best work and  overall the band's best album ever.  Few albums by any band are as  completely listenable and entertaining from first track to last.  In  addition to the the band staples "Fooling Yourself", "Come  Sail Away", and "Miss America", come several other tracks  worth mentioning, such as "Castle Walls" and my personal  favorite, "Man in the Wilderness".  If I had to choose the  weakest song on "The Grand Illusion", it would be  "Superstar", but I even like that song, albeit not quite as much  as the rest of the album. "The Grand Illusion" is in my mind  Styx's pinnacle album, as they followed it up with "Pieces of  Eight", which was not quite as commercially successful and bordered on  being somewhat pretentious (their next three albums,  "Cornerstone", "Paradise Theater", and "Kilroy Was  Here" would prove to be even more so).  "Illusion" captures  Styx at its creative and commercial zenith, and aside from their Greatest  Hits album and "Equinox" is the only other Styx album a serious  fan needs.
