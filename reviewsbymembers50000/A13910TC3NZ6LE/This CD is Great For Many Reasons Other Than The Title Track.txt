 My brother bought this album when it was first released in 1972.  After many repeated listenings over the years, it's still great.  Some may say that it's "been goin' in and out of style" ala Sergeant Pepper's  Lonely Hearts Club Band, but the fact is that American Pie never left it's  audience so much as its audience left it.  The fact that only one customer  reviewer rated it at less than four stars is a testament of its staying  power (and I might add, that reviewer falsely asserted that the full length  version of the title track did not appear on this CD, which probably  accounted for the low rating). Sure "American Pie" is a rock  classic and a staple of both classic rock and oldies stations everywhere,  but the fact is that this album has so much more to offer.   "Vincent", hardly the weak song that the Amazon.com reviewer  rather stupidly portrays it to be, is a beautiful and lyrically rich tale  of despair, loneliness, and disappointment.  It's beautiful in it's  simplicity.  And many other customer reviewers have spoken eloquently about  the shamefully overlooked "Sister Fatima" (which disappeared from  reissues of the original vinyl LP but was restored in the CD  version). The song that moves me the most is "Empty Chairs", a  wistful song of lost love and loneliness that is in my opinion the   beautiful and overlooked track on this CD.  Listening to it brings me to  the verge of tears.  For those of you fortunate enough to see Don McLean's  recent PBS special "Starry Starry Night", special guest Garth  Brooks performed a first-rate cover of this song.   "American  Pie" withstands the test of time as a quintessential recording in the  vein of many of Bob Dylan's earlier works.  It deserves a place in the  collection of anyone who considers his or her self to be a rock  afficianado.
