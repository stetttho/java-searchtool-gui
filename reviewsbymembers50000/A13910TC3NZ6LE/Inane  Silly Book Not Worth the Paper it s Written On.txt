 A friend of my wife's gave her "The Next Step" as a gift several years ago.  The most charitable thing I can say about the book is that it is naive and condescending in its advice to "new Christians".  Its author, Jack Chick,  is famous for writing numerous fire and brimstone "comic" books that depict eternal damnation for anyone disagreeing with his beliefs, such as Catholics (referred to as cultists).  If you are the type of Christian who believes that ours is a spiteful and vengeful God and that Jesus taught you to judge and hate your fellow man then this book belongs in your collection.  True Christians would do well to avoid this hysterical nonsense.
