 First off, a word of warning to those who haven't seen the unrated version of Old School...the menu screen features topless girls.  Not that I'm a prude or anything like that, but it might be a good idea to send younger children out of the room BEFORE you put it in the DVD player. Having said that, I feel it is necessary to address the comments of one customer reviewer who asked how anyone could dare to compare Old School to the classic Animal House and complained that the plot had been "done before".  As to the first complaint, it should be noted that Old School was produced by Ivan Reitman, who has been associated with a number of great comedies in the last few years, including Animal House.  As to the second, I must respectfully disagree.  The notion of some thirty somethings starting their own fraternity has not to my knowledge been done before, although this movie is somewhat derivative of college comedies such as National Lampoons Van Wilder and PCU.   The basic plot of Old School is simple enough-three 30somethings played by Vince Vaughn, Will Farrell, and Luke Wilson decide to relive their college days by starting their own fraternity.  All three actors are in top form here, even Wilson, who is cast against type as a straight man.  But it's Vaughn's performance as the group's leader that really makes Old School funny.  Jeremy Piven, also cast against type, is the uptight dean of the college who carries a grudge because he was picked on by Wilson's Farrell's and Vaughn's characters when they were younger.  Much like Animal House's Dean Wormer, he tries to get the frat tossed off campus but is unsuccessful.   While Old School isn't quite as funny as Animal House, it is certainly worth watching as it carries on the comedy tradition set by that film, although the formula is slightly different.
