 As with most of today's bands, record companies have a knack for releasing "greatest hits" or "best of" collections ad nauseum to entice us consumers to give up our hard earned bucks.  This CD is a perfect example.  Although this collection contains tracks not originally included in "The Cars Greatest Hits", there's very little here that wasn't already available in the excellent Anthology set, "Just What I Needed", that Rhino Records released several years ago.   This collection does the original "Greatest Hits" album one better in that it includes many favorite album tracks that get considerable "deep cut" airplay on classic rock stations, but it really isn't superior to the anthology.  As is usually the case with "greatest hits" albums, fans will lament the exclusion of certain songs or the inclusion of certain others.  Personally, I could have done without "Tonight She Comes" and "You Are the Girl", both of which I consider inferior songs and which were not included in the original "Greatest Hits".  Nevertheless, they were minor hits for the band and probably should be included in this collection if for no other reason than to satisfy completists. Unless you're a rabid fan or a completist, there's no reason to buy "The Complete Greatest Hits" if you already own the anthology.  If you don't and are trying to decide which one to purchase, I'd still go with the anthology because it comprises overall a much more interesting collection of songs, has rare alternate versions of a few tracks, and a very thorough and informative booklet on the band's history and career.
