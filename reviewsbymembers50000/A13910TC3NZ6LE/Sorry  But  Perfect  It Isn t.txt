 After asking this movie I feel compelled to ask "what were you thinking?" to a number of people: John Travolta, Jamie Lee Curtis, Director/Screenwriter James Bridges, and his collaborator, Aaron Latham.  All of them (with the exception of Curtis) were involved in "Urban Cowboy", but apparently they went to the well one too many times with this picture. This movie is awful on so many levels.  The script is bloated and pretentious, the directing is laconic, and the plot is predictable.  Travolta and Curtis were annoyingly cute and cliche, and Marilu Henner is without a doubt the worst actress in Hollywood with the possible exception of Rosanna Arquette. This stinkburger of a movie put the brakes on a few careers or at least caused a downward spiral.  Travolta went on to make even worse films (like "The Experts" and "Look Who's Talking") and practically couldn't get arrested until redeeming himself in "Pulp Fiction".  Bridges didn't direct another film until the good but somewhat uneven "Bright Lights, Big City" (sadly, his last film).  Curtis survived, but barely. Bad directing, bad casting, and a bad script do not make "Perfect" even mediocre.  Walk away from this train wreck if you can.
