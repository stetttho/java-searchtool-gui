 My wife and I both read "The Street Lawyer", and while we both agree that it's a pretty good read, my wife found it somewhat boring and depressing while I found it to be an interesting and thoughtful look at the interaction (or better still, the lack of interaction) between the legal profession (of which I'm a part) and the homeless.  There's no doubt that the profession could and should do more for those who are less fortunate, and I think this book does a good job of putting that into perspective, although it is just a bit preachy.  Aside from a somewhat incredible part about a homeless man holding the members of a law firm hostage, it is a believable and forthright look into the world of poverty law and pro-bono work. What I find particularly bothersome and somewhat offensive were the somewhat politically charged opinions of some other readers that this book was a springboard for the author's political views (of which Grisham doesn't appear to have made his readers aware), or that it is written with a "liberal" viewpoint.  It's unfair and rather ignorant to refer to anything that attempts to raise social consciousness as "liberal".  This is yet another example of how the dreaded "L" word gets overused these days by self-absorbed, ignorant people who disagree with anything that brings attention to the social problems of this country that they'd prefer we didn't talk about because it reflects their own selfishness and greed.   Read the book with your political filter (of whatever persuasion) turned off and enjoy it for what it is.
