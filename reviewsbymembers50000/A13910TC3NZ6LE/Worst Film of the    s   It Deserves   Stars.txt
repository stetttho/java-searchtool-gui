 I've puzzled over "Natural Born Killers" for a longtime trying to make sense of it.  Is it a satire on violence?  Is it acomment on the social attitudes toward violence?  Who knows?  Who cares?  I can hardly believe that Quentin Tarantino wrote such an awful screeenplay, considering that I generally like his work. Perhaps it's the fault of Oliver Stone, fresh from having scored a huge miss with the bloated, incredibly poor "JFK".   This movie is simply unwatchable, a God-awful mess.  It is unclever and takes itself too seriously to be satire, so it must be social commentary.  Unfortunately, there are other movies which do a better job of making the point that this film tries to deliver, so it really doesn't break any new ground.  "Natural Born Killers" falls flat as either a satire or a message film. The plot is thin, the premise is stupid, and the acting is marginal.  Fortunately, Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis should be able rise above what has to be one of the worst career choices they've ever made.  Kinda makes you wonder whether this is the movie that put Robert Downey Jr. over the edge. The bottom line is that "Natural Born Killers" is a motion picture without a mission other than the glorification of gratuitous violence which has been done, and done better, by other films. I originally had my review entitled "Second Worst Film of the 90's", but after careful reflection I have to say that my initial choice for worst film of the 90's, the overhyped and hackneyed "Titanic", is better by comparison.
