 "Silver" is a collection of 29 songs from Cheap Trick's 25th Anniversary concert, held in Rockford, Illinois in 1999.  For long time fans of the band, it stands alongside "Cheap Trick at Budokan-The Complete Concert" as a must have. The collection includes most of Cheap Trick's better known songs and includes one song from each of the band's albums.  The band receives some very capable assistance from a number of family members and friends, including Robin Zander's daughter Holland assisting her dad with vocals on a very touching rendition of "Time Will Let You Know" (including the Harlem High School choir).  Rick Nielsen's son Daxx assists with percussion, and other Zander and Nielsen siblings play on various songs.  A string section from the Rockford Symphony Orchestra adds to the punch of songs like "Dream Police" and my personal favorite, "Stop This Game".  Guest stars include Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins on "Just Got Back" (featuring the Bun E. Carlos Drum Choir), Slash on "You're All Talk", Everclear's Art Alexakis on a version of the Beatles' "Day Tripper", and former bassist Jon Brant on "If You Want My Love". Without exception, each song in this collection packs a whallop, even Cheap Trick's only chart topper "The Flame" (which has never been one of my favorites).  Simply put...these guys were smokin', and they pulled out all the stops to put on a great show for the hometown crowd!   "Budokan" showed the world why Cheap Trick was one of the greatest live bands of all time.  "Silver" shows the world that a quarter of a century later, they still are.  Long live Cheap Trick!
