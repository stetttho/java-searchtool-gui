 I've been a fan of Randy Newman since his "Little Criminals" album of 1978.  And although he probably didn't do much more than lip synch in it, I consider his "I Love L.A. video to be the best video ever  made (take that, you Thriller fans)! But Randy Newman's musical forte is  in scoring and soundtrack work, whether for television shows like the late  and unlamented "Cop Rock" or for movies, like "Ragtime"  and "The Natural", just to name a  few. "Pleasantville" falls into the latter category.  His score  of the 1998 movie starring Tobey Maguire is his best work yet.  "The  Pleasantville Theme Song" is very evocative of 50's tv shows like  "Father Knows Best" and fits the mood of the movie. "Real  Rain" is a particularly beautiful piece of music, especially the  climax of the piece.  In the movie, you hear it both in the rain sequence  and in the scene where Bud sees the color television sets in the window of  the appliance store.  It sets a mood of unfolding and discovery of the new  and works incredibly well. But the best piece of music on this  soundtrack, as mentioned by other reviewers, is "The Mural".   Again, this piece is used twice in the movie:  once when the townspeople  see the mural, and earlier in the movie where Bill Johnson is looking  through the art book that Bud has brought him from the library.  I get  teary-eyed listening to this piece, and I don't know of a single piece of  music in any score of any movie that creates such emotion except for  "Father Kobe's Preaching" from the soundtrack of "The Truman  Show". I think it'll take Randy Newman a while to outdo himself on  this one.
