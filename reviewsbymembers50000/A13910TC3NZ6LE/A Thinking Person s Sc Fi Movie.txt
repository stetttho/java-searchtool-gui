 I'm not a big sci-fi fan, and I always thought that other sci-fi cult classics like "Stargate" and "Blade Runner" were highly overrated.  But having seen this motion picture, I have to say I'm very  impressed. If you're into technical and special effects, they just don't  get any better than they do in "The Matrix".  No question as to  why this motion picture won as many technical Oscars as it did...eat your  heart out, Lucas and Spielberg! The reason I refer to this movie as a  "thinking person's sci-fi movie" is that some will have a tough  time following the plot.  This is a picture to which you MUST pay attention  to understand.   I would have given this movie five stars instead of  four, but I thought that Keanu Reeves' acting performance was a little more  wooden than usual.  Laurence Fishburn, on the other hand, has never been  better.  I also thought Joe Pantoliano was a questionable casting decision  as the turncoat, but it didn't distract all that much from my enjoyment of  this motion picture. "The Matrix" is one of those pictures that  sort of raises the bar for others of its genre.  I understand a sequel is  in the works, and I believe I won't wait for it to come out on home video  this time.
