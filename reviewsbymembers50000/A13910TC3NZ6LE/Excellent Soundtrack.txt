 The "Plesantville" soundtrack is one of the most enjoyable soundtrack albums I've listened to over the past two years.  If I had any complaint, it would be that there's not enough of Randy Newman's excellent  score.  That and one of the two tracks by Fiona Apple; namely, "  Please Send Me Someone to Love".   On the other hand, Apple's  rendition of the Beatles' "Across the Universe" is quite good.   Although I personally consider Apple to be at best a mediocre singer who  lets her angst interfere needlessly with her music, at least her rendition  of this song won't have John Lennon spinning in his grave.   The  remainder of the soundtrack consists of quintessential songs of the 1950's,  such as Buddy Holly's "Rave On", Dave Brubeck's "Take  Five", and Elvis Presley's "Teddy Bear".  This is one of  those soundtracks where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts  because the songs all fit together and create the mood of the movie.   Otherwise, it would be another forgettable 50's compilation disc.
