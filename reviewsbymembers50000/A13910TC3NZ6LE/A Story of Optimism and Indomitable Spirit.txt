 Being a car enthusiast and having read about the Tucker automobile and its inventor, I saw this picture at the theater and rushed out to buy it when it became available to purchase. "Tucker-The Man And His Dream" is the story of auto maker/inventor/visionary Preston Tucker, who bucked incredible odds to see his dream of a revolutionary car come to life.  Jeff Bridges plays the title role with such energy and enthusiasm that you end up thinking this guy could conquer the world.  Joan Allen is her usual excellent self as Preston's devoted wife, and Martin Landau is brilliant in his Oscar-nominated role as Tucker's somewhat skeptical business partner.  Christian Slater, in one of his earliest screen appearances, plays Tucker's oldest son.  Although they are on screen together for only a brief period of time in the picture, it is wonderful to see Jeff Bridges with his father, the late great Lloyd Bridges.  The elder Bridges plays Homer Ferguson, a U.S. Senator from Michigan who instigated a probe and subsequent prosecution of Tucker by the Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly defrauding investors (Tucker was eventually exonerated after his company folded due to the negative publicity). All of the acting performances in this picture are superb, and the pacing is almost frenetic.  These factors, along with a rather ingenious use of transitions by Director Francis Ford Coppola (who coincidentally owns one of the few Tuckers left in existence), create a busy feeling that conveys to the audience that Tucker has got the world by the tail and is pulling hard...hold that tiger!  Combine all of this with an excellent soundtrack by Joe Jackson (unfortunately very hard to find these days), and you have what one reviewer accurately describes as one of the greatest movies that hardly anyone ever watched.  If you haven't seen "Tucker-The Man And His Dream", check it out...you won't be disappointed.
