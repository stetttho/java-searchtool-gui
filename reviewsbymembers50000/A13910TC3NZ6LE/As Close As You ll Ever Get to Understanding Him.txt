 I read "Will" in the early 80's and was fascinated.  It provides the reader with somewhat of a glimpse as to what makes G. Gordon Liddy tick, but the tone of this book leaves no doubt that its author is also making a huge investment in his ego.  Therefore, I recommend that the reader take a good deal of his story with a grain of salt.   Although I consider Liddy to be one of the most deranged and outright weird persons on the American political landscape, this book is nevertheless a good read because you'll get to understand (and if you're of his political persuasion, perhaps even agree with) the environment that breeds such an enigmatic persona.
