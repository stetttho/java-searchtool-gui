 The M130 is my 6th PDA, having previously owned the m100, m125, m500, Sony CLIE PEGS320, and a Handspring Visor Prism.  In terms of form factor, features, price, and dependability it blows them all out of the water!  I bought my m130 the day it came out on the market (March 7, 2002) and I haven't been disappointed one bit.  It's been completely trouble free, hotsyncs every time without fail, and has a brilliant color display that in my opinion is superior to the m515.  I personally prefer the m130's slightly thicker form factor and smaller screen over the m515, and I really like the ability to change faceplates to suit whatever mood I'm in at the time.   I've heard that the m515 has the same manufacturing glitch that has plagued the m500 and m515 and after three warranty exchanges on my m500 I cannot in good faith recommend the m515.  I can and do recommend the m130 though.
