 As a huge fan of Randy Newman's work I think this CD is representative of some of his best vocal work.  The selections range from the wistful emotional "Marie" to the uptempo "I Love to See You Smile", from the soundtrack to the film Parenthood.  On a personal level, I would like to have seen "In Germany Before the War" and "Rider in the Rain" from the Little Criminals album included here, and the failure to include two of Newman's most poignant songs, "Guilty", and "I'll Be There" is almost unforgiveable.  Nevertheless, there's still a lot to like here. If you like this CD I humbly suggest you also explore some of Newman's film score work, for which he received a long overdue Oscar last year.  The "Guilty" box set is a good place to start, but I strongly recommend the scores to Ragtime and Avalon (both sadly out of print) as well as Pleasantville, which is still available.
