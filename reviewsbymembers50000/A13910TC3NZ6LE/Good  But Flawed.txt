 Although I have seen this picture well over a dozen times and although I think it's basically a good movie, I must be objective and admit that "The Green Berets" is basically a propaganda piece that at the time of its filming was an attempt to change public sentiment about our country's involvement in Vietnam.  For this reason, as well as the healing period our country went through after Vietnam, the movie seems rather archaic and naive today.  Those on the far left ridicule it.  Those on the far right treat it with the reverence of a Biblical tale.  The truth about "The Green Berets" is that it lies somewhere between these two extremes. The Fort Benning, Georgia filmed training sequences appear to be as real as anything I ever saw while I was in uniform.  The combat sequences, however, contained a fair share of errors, most notably the well-known "sun setting in the east" flub.  The acting was rather wooden, especially from Wayne as well as Jack Soo, portraying the ARVN officer, and the plot meandered from being quite good in some parts to being downright silly in others. The most important thing to remember about this movie is that it should be taken for what it is...a good war movie.  To casually dismiss it as irrelevant or hopelessly out of step with the truth simply doesn't do it justice.  In similar fashion, it's rather stupid to portray it as an homage to the American way of life and characterize those who point out this picture's many flaws as "un-American", as one previous review did.  This picture is best enjoyed with the viewer's bias, be it liberal or conservative, turned off.
