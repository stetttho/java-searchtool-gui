 I saw "Left Behind" at the behest of one of my friends.  Leaving alone for the moment that I detest Kirk Cameron and have hated Clarence Gilyard since his days in "Walker, Texas Ranger", I cannot in good faith recommend this motion picture to anyone.  The production values are awful, the acting is one-dimensional and wooden, and the dialogue comes off as being rather cloying.  And did I mention the "special effects?"  There's nothing special about them at all.  Even "Battlefield Earth" looks like Oscar material next to this befuddled mess of a movie.   There are a number of rave reviews for "Left Behind" on this site.  Curiously, they seem to coincide with the impending "re-release" of the film in theatres (originally this picture was released direct to video).  One must seriously consider the credibility of those reviews, as many so-called "Christian" groups made known their intent to use any means necessary to get people to see the picture in theatrical release.  One would be well-advised to ignore the hype.  If you still want to view this movie, I recommend renting a VHS copy as a less expensive alternative to the cost of a movie ticket.   "Left Behind" is not only the title of the movie, it describes what those thinking of buying it should do...leave it behind!  It is little more than right wing religious propaganda with no artistic merit.  In a few short years it will garner the dubious distinction of being second only to "Plan Nine from Outer Space" as one of the most laughably bad motion pictures ever made.
