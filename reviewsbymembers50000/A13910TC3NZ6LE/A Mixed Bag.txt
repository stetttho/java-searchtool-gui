 "Bummed Out Christmas" is a collection of Christmas songs that are are considerably less cheerful or uplifting than the type of music usually associated with the holiday season.  But these songs are not really all "bummers." Some of the songs express the hope of optimism in spite of a minor problem, as in "Somebody Stole My Santa Claus Suit".  Some others tell funny stories of holiday setbacks such as "Santa Came Home Drunk" and "Christmas in Jail".  Still others are hauntingly beautiful and poignant, such as "Christmas Eve Can Kill You".  And "Don't Believe in Christmas" is a rather catchy song of cynicism and disdain for Christmas.  There are two songs on this disc that merit special mention because they are so wretchedly awful.  "Santa Got a DWI" is a rather stupid novelty tune about the jolly fat man being arrested for drunk driving in his sleigh.  Sherwin Linton's vocal is so irritating that I wish the police would beat him with a rubber hose.  "Lonely Christmas Call" is a godawful old George Jones number that is so depressing it will have rednecks and trailer park denizens everywhere crying in their beer. Some of these songs will bum you out.  Others will make you laugh.  Still others will just annoy you with their stupidity.  This is what you get in "Bummed Out Christmas".
