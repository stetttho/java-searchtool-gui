 Undoubtedly, many will make comparisons between this motion picture and "North Dallas Forty".  For the most part, those comparisons will  be invalid.  The question of which of the two movies is the greatest  football team of all time would be like comparing the Green Bay Packers  teams of the 1960's to the San Francisco 49'ers teams of the 80's.  Both  pictures are great, but they provide the viewer with a snapshot of  pro-football in different eras.   "Any Given Sunday", at almost  three hours running time, is easily Oliver Stone's best picture since  "Born on the 4th of July".  It stars Al Pacino as a beleagered  football coach of a losing franchise and Cameron Diaz as the MBA owner who  has inherited the team from her late father.  They both turn in fine  performances, but it is the performance of comedian Jamie Foxx as an  egotistical young quarterback that makes this all work.  Dennis Quaid is  quite effective as an aging quarterback whose injury paves the way for  Foxx's character to show his stuff.  Jim Brown is excellent as of the  team's assistant coaches and Pacino's old friend.  In addition, there are a  number of fine performances from L. L. Cool J., Lawrence Taylor, James  Woods, Matthew Modine, Clifton Davis, Ann-Margaret, and even Oliver Stone  himself.  Look for former Oklahoma and Dallas Cowboy coach Barry Switzer in  a cameo role as well as one of my favorite character actors, John C.  McGinley, as a full-of-himself football analyst.  Charlton (NRA) Heston  also briefly appears as the league commissioner. The action in this movie  is good, and juxtaposed against the rap music background really makes it  seem almost frenetic at times, even the slo-mo shots.  Anyone thinking of  viewing this picture would do well to ignore the scathing remarks of both  Amazon.com's reviewer and of Leonard Maltin, who apparently disliked it for  reasons I can't quite figure out.  It is a good picture, and one of Stone's  best.  I highly recommend it.
