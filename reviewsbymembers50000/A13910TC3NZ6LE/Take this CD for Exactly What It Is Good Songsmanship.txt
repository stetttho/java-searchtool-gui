 I disagree with the customer reviewer who refers to "Night and Day" as "taking gay life into the mainstream".  That statement appears to have been made on the basis of one of the CD's more controversial songs "Real Men", which unflinchingly explores male masculinity.  As a whole, "Night and Day" is not about gay life and to interpret it as such on the basis of one song does injustice to Joe Jackson's considerable talent.  His sexual proclivities, real or imagined, are not relevant to the music.   This album worked very well as an LP (which I also have), because sides one and two are referred to as the night side and day side respectively.  The night side had more uptempo numbers, while the day side included mostly slower songs.  They're all well-written and well-performed, however.  The more interesting tracks, from my point of view, are the dark and mysterious "Chinatown", the somewhat glitzy (and slightly paranoid) "TV Age", "Steppin' Out" (Jackson's most commercially successful song to date), "Breaking Us In Two", and "A Slow Song".  The aura that this collection exudes is one of Jackson attempting to be a modern day Cole Porter...and for the most part he succeeds.  Jackson proves himself to be one of the best tunesmiths of our day, and he has surrounded himself with a cadre of capable musicians.  The result is one of the best pop albums of the 1980's. This collection is well worth getting...but listen to it for the craftsmanship of the music and not for some sort of hidden message.  You won't be disappointed.
