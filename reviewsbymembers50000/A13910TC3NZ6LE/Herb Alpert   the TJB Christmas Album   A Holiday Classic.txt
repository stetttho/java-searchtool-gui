 I've been a fan of Herb Alpert since I was about 10 years old (I'm 43 now).  I first bought the Christmas Album in 1969 and promptly wore it out.  This album brings back fantastic memories of my childhood in the 60's and  is still relevant today.  Of particular mention are Herb's version of  "Winter Wonderland", which is so hot it melts Parson Brown, and  "Jingle Bell Rock" with the stripper coda reminiscent of David  Rose.  If you wanna remember Christmases of the mid to late 60's, buy this  album.  There were a lot of imitators back then, but Alpert stands the test  of time!
