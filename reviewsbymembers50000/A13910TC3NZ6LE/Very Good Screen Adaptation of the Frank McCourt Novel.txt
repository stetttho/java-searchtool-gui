 "Angela's Ashes" is for the most part an autobiography, but it also succeeds as a poingant coming of age story.  Emily Watson turns in a  workmanlike performance as McCourt's dedicated and determined mother.   Robert Carlyle is outstanding as the alcoholic father, kind and loving but  with the skewed sense of priorities that can only result from alcoholism.   He plays this role to perfection. Those of you who are thinking about  renting this movie should be advised that although it is quite good and  well-acted, the viewing experience is not likely to be uplifting.  Although  this is not a motion picture about alcoholism per se, "Angela's  Ashes" is much like that sort of picture in that it is incredibly  depressing.  I found myself several times comparing it to "Leaving Las  Vegas", another incredibly powerful yet quite depressing motion  picture.  It's so powerful that I find myself not wanting to relive the  experience, meaning it's unlikely I'll ever watch this film again.  This is  not a complaint but rather a testament to the power of this motion picture.   The only complaint that I could make is that the pacing is painfully slow,  as if to make the viewer suffer with the family.  If that was the  director's intent, he succeeded admirably. Overall, I must say that while  "Angela's Ashes" is a very worthwhile motion picture, it does not  entertain so much as it draws the viewer in and enlightens.
