 For me, John Grisham's books fall into two categories:  excellent and mediocre.  Unfortunately, "The Bretheren" falls into the latter of these categories. The plot of the book is simple enough:  three  disgraced and imprisoned jurists run a gay correspondence scam (or  "The Angola Scam" as referred to in the book) from behind prison  walls and unwittingly ensnare a presidential contender handpicked by the  Director of the CIA and supported by a cabal of defense contractors.    "The Bretheren" is eerily ominous in showing how a  presidential election can be bought (the party of the candidate is never  really stated, but there are subtle hints he's a member of the GOP), and  the timing may or may not be coincidental.  This book tries to be as  ambitious as "The Pelican Brief" in portraying the author's  perception of contemporary politics; unfortunately, it falls far short of  that novel because it doesn't portray the suspense and paranoia that made  "Pelican" such a good read (despite the disappointing transition  to the silver screen).  The ending was also flat and contained none of the  panache of earlier and better works such as "A Time to Kill",  "The Rainmaker", and "The Street Lawyer".  Despite this  flaw the character development, long a strong point of Grisham's writing,  is as good as always. Overall, I'd have to put "The Bretheren"  with "The Chamber" and "The Partner" as Grisham's  "also-ran" or "b list" works.  This book could've been  a contender.  Unfortunately, it runs out of steam too quickly and the  ending disappoints.
