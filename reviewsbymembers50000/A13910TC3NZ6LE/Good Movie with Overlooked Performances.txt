 I watched Far from Heaven mostly on the strength of its reviews, particularly of Julianne Moore's performance.  Although she received an Oscar nomination for her part in this film, she sadly lost to Nicole Kidman.  My wife and I watched about half of the picture before she finally asked the question that I had in my mind-why wasn't Dennis Quaid nominated for an Oscar for this movie? Todd Haynes' obsession with 50s melodramas shows in just about every aspect of this story of a picture perfect 50s marriage crumbling apart because of the husband's homosexual urges and the wife's interest in a black gardener (played by the always excellent Dennis Haysbert).  The attention to detail, the music, the costumes, the camera angles, the cinematography - are all very reminiscent of the kind of movies my mom used to watch.  Personally, I thought the pacing of this movie was much too languid for my tastes, but that's the way they did 'em back then.  While I wouldn't go so far as to call Far from Heaven a "chick flick", it's not one that will likely register with men.  The reason anyone, male or female, should watch this picture is the standout performance delivered by Quaid.  Don't get me wrong, Julianne Moore was good.  But Quaid was clearly at the top of his form here.  I find myself in agreement with the critics who were disappointed that he was overlooked by the Academy.
