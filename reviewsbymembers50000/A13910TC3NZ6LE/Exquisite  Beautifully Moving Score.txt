 Rachel Portman is better known for composing lighter, more whimsical pieces and is not normally associated with rich, melodic scores such as that which she composed for "The Cider House Rules".  This CD  proves that she's every bit the equal of the acknowledged masters in this  field such as John Barry (Dance With Wolves; Out of Africa), James Horner  (Field of Dreams), and Randy Newman (Pleasantville; The Natural; Edward  Scissorhands).  Portman's score is, to put it simply, one of the most  beautiful and moving pieces I've ever heard.  Particularly noteworthy are  the Main Theme, "Homer Leaves the Orphanage", "Burying  Fuzzy", "Goodnight, You Princes of Maine", and the End  Credits. Overall, the pieces work do an excellent job of conveying the feel  of the picture without being overdone and schmaltzy.  There has been some  criticism of Portman employing the main theme, with minor variations, to  underscore other moments in the movie.  I personally think the criticism is  unwarranted.  Obviously she had a sense of what it would take to make this  score work well, and I take no issue with it.  When the music is as  beautiful as this, I see no problem in doing variations.  I only wish Randy  Newman had done this with his excellent "Pleasantville" score  (it's probably no coincidence that both of my favorite soundtracks are for  movies starring Tobey Maguire).   If this CD is any indication of what  Rachel Portman is capable of doing with a musical score, I for one wish  her a long and successful career.  I look forward to hearing more of her  work and highly recommend the original motion picture score of "The  Cider House Rules" as one of the best I've ever heard.
