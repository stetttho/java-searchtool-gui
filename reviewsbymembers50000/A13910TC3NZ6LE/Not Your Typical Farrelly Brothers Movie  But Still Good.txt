 "Outside Providence" is a surprising movie.  Since it came from the Farrelly brothers, I was expecting little more than the type of humor that was the staple of "Dumb and Dumber", "Kingpin",  and "There's Something About Mary".  What I got is a very well  done if not predictable "coming of age" story. The film is set  in 1974 and features Shawn Hatosy as Tim Dunphy, a stoner sent away to a  private school by his single father, played by Alec Baldwin (who calls his  son "Dildo).  I'm not a fan of Baldwin's but was mightily impressed by  his performance.   At school, Tim finds a new circle of friends (not  abandoning his old ones) and falls for fellow student Jane (Amy Smart).  He  also struggles against an uptight, mean-spirited dorm master.  The comedy  is politically incorrect and sometimes even gross, as you might expect from  a Farrelly brothers film, but the coming of age story gives this movie some  degree of substance that has been lacking in their previous films.   Although the plot is almost painfully predictable, "Outside  Providence" succeeds in being interesting and entertaining. The VHS  version of this film also features an alternate ending.  After seeing it,  I'm glad the brothers stayed with the first.  It resolves all of the  questions that come up in the movie in a much more satisfying way. One  reviewer described this movie as "charming".  I think that says  it right.  Perhaps one of the reasons I think so is that I graduated from  high school at about the same time as Tim and his friends and can really  identify with the struggles they go through.  I consider this to be an  exceptional motion picture (which also includes an exceptional soundtrack  featuring a great collection of songs from that era).
