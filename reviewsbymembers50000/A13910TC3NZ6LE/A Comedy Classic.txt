 I've been a Bob and Tom fan for about three years now, and I was really gratified to see them release a collection of their greatest commercial parodies, songs, and gags.   When speaking to Bob and Tom, one usually  tells them "you guys rock!"  And on this two CD set, they really  do!  To be sure, longtime fans of the show will find some of their  favorites as well as some that they were indifferent to any perhaps didn't  really like ("I Want to be Like Hef" is not one of my particular  favorites), but there is truly something for everyone here. Some tracks,  such as "Prisoner of Love", "Dear Penthouse", and  "Dicken's Cider" are enduring comedy classics that are often  requested on the show.  There are plenty of tracks by guests of the show as  well, such as "Wild Bill" Bauer's "Uncle Arnie/Russian  Roulette" which still makes me laugh every time I hear it. One  should be warned though, that this collection is not for those who suffer  from political correctness or are rather puritanical in their tastes (I'd  suggest old Bill Cosby albums for those folks).  But if you like ribald,  risque humor, this is without a doubt the best collection yet.  I can  hardly wait for Volume 2!
