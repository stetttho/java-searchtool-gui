 "Blast From Your Past" came as a bit of a surprise to me after listening to some of the more self-indulgent solo work coming from the other Beatles.  There's nothing gimmicky or pretentious about the songs on this disc...they're nothing but good old, straight forward, toe-tapping rock and roll numbers with a fair share of covers thrown in. "You're Sixteen" was released in 1973 and is a particular favorite of my wife's because it was sort of an anthem for her (she had just turned sixteen).  It still rocks!  "It Don't Come Easy" is still hands down Ringo's best post-Beatles single and is every bit as polished as anything Lennon, McCartney, or Harrison released during that time.  "Photograph" is another gem of a pop song.  The weakest track on the CD is, in my opinion, "Back off Boogaloo" which struck me as rather silly. No other reviewer has mentioned it yet, but in my opinion the best track on this CD is Ringo's excellent and underappreciated cover of the Platters' "Only You" which was released as a single in the fall of 1974 and quickly faded into oblivion.  Although the arrangement is much different from the original recording, it still has a sparkle and a charm all it's own. If you're looking for a CD full of well-done pop songs that will bring a smile to your face, this is the one for you.
