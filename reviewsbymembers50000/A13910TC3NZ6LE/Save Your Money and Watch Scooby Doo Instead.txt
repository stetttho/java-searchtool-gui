 "The Blair Witch Project" is tied with "Eyes Wide Shut" for the most overrated and downright silly movie of 1999. The plot is really pretty simple -  a bunch of Gen X'ers get lost in the woods,  say the "F" word a lot, and get picked off one by one.  Nothing  you can't get from your average episode of "Scooby Doo", except  for the language and violence.  But even if foul language and wanton  violence are what you want in a movie, there are still better choices than  this.
