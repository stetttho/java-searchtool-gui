 The title of this review may overexaggerate a bit, but by the late part of the 1970's the music scene was awash with disco bands.  Pop and rock had become an anachonism by this time, and even the major acts of the day had sold out to the craze (example:  the Rolling Stones' "Some Girls" Album). Enter the Knack...something different, yet familiar.  Very reminiscent of the Beatles and the Kinks.  "Get the Knack", as well as Pink Floyd's "The Wall", served as a life preserver for those of us who still had some pop sensibilities left.  Along with the "Disco Sucks" bumper sticker which I had on my car, this album was the antidote to disco that succeeded where punk failed. Every song on "Get the Knack" is a treasure, from the uptempo "Let me Out", and its segue into "Your Number or Your Name" to the rather silly "Frustrated".  My favorite tracks are "That's What the Little Girls Do", with a guitar hook reminiscent of the Beatles' "I'm Looking Through You", and the slower "Maybe Tonight", which has an early Kinks flavor to it.  The lyrics are a little sappy, but the musicianship is superb. This album also spawned two singles releases:  "Good Girls Don't", a portrait of teenage lust and "My Sharona", a virtual disco protest anthem.  I still consider it to be one of the most important songs of the late 1970's.  After repeated listenings, it still hasn't lost its hard edged, infectious sound. The Knack's sophomore effort, "But the Little Girls Understand" tried to build on the success of "My Sharona" with the derivative "Baby Talks Dirty", but it never had the magic of "Get the Knack".  For historians and completists as well as for the casual listener, this album is a must.
