 Blue Moon Swamp is, to my thinking, a breakthrough album of sorts.  John Fogerty stopped making records after the somewhat uneven Eye of the Zombie about 12 years before, and with this CD he is back and better than ever. The best track on this disc, by far, is Hundred and Ten in the Shade (for which Fogerty taught himself to play dobro).  You can practically feel the sweat dripping off of your body when you listen to it.  Blue Boy and Bringing It Down to Jelly Roll (the latter a tribute to Jelly Roll Morton) are also worth a listen.  And then there's Joy of My Life, a great love song written by Fogerty for his wife which features a first rate dobro solo. In many ways, this is Fogerty's best solo recording and one of the most polished collections of songs ever released by any artist.  As I recall, it won a well deserved Grammy for record of the year in the year of its release, and after one listening you'll instantly know why.
