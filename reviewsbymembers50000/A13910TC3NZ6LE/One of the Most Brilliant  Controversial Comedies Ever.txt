 I have to disagree with the amazon.com reviewer's comment that "Dogma" was subpar.  I also part company with the reviewer who wrote that he couldn't imagine a fervent Catholic not being offended by the  picture (okay, maybe I'm not a fervent Catholic, but I enjoyed it).    "Dogma" centers around the attempts of Loki and Bartlesby  (Matt Damon and Ben Affleck), two banished angels, who attempt to regain  entry into heaven by way of a loophole in church law.  Linda Fiorentino is  a dubious lapsed Catholic (who works in an abortion clinic, no less) who is  recruited by the angel of God (Alan Rickman in his funniest performance  ever) to stop them and thus save humankind.  In her travels from Illinois  to New Jersey, she is assisted by two two prophets (director Kevin Smith  and Jason Mewes), the 13th Apostle (Chris Rock) and a muse (Salma Hayek).   I did NOT think that Hayek stole the show here, contrary to the amazon.com  reviewer.  That distinction belongs to Mewes, who as a foul-mouthed stoner  of a prophet trying to cajole Fiorentino into sex kept me laughing myself  silly.  Additionally, I thought Alanis Morrisette was horribly miscast as  God with a silly smile plastered on her face, but these are minor  points. Those who don't like or are offended by this movie probably don't  have much imagination or don't care to be inquisitive as to matters of  faith.  "Dogma" asks a number of "what if" questions  that seriously challenge conventional Catholic theology and in that measure  succeeds well as a motion picture.  For those who are uptight about the  message and satire of this movie, I say "lighten up and enjoy!"   This is comic genius at its best!
