 We have gone through two previous editions of Crampton and Rees' exhaustive work (prior to the VH1 endorsement) in our household and will probably be buying this edition in the near future. "Rock Stars Encyclopedia" contains entries on most of the major (and several minor) rock stars and acts, including time lines charting events in their respective careers such as personnel changes, deaths, album releases, single releases, and major concerts.  I have seen one or two minor errors in the previous editions, yet the authors are kind enough to ask readers to submit corrections if any errors are seen in the text.  Don't expect to be doing so however because these guys are right about 99.9% of the time. This book is frequently resorted to as the final say in arguments between me and my son, a virtual expert in the field.  It is invaluable to afficianados of modern music.  I'd give this book 10 stars if I possibly could...it's that good!
