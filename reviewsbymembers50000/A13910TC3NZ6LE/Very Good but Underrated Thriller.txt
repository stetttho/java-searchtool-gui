 This movie is one of the sleepers of 1999.  It had a very short run at the box office before being released to video, which after watching the movie I found really surprising. Arlington Road is a well-done thriller about  domestic terrorism and paranoia that seems very appropo for our times  (forget the anti-Clinton rantings of the idiot, er, reviewer below who  appears more interested in promoting some paranoid right wing agenda than  in honestly  and objectively reviewing a movie).  The ending is quite  surprising and alone justifies watching this movie.  Robbins and Bridges  both turn in very good performances, as does Joan Cusack as the wife of a  terrorist bomber.  The only thing that kept me from giving this movie a  higher review is that the plot seems rather implausible.
