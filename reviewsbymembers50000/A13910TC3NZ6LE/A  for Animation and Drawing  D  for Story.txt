 Spirit-Stallion of the Cimarron had the potential to be a first rate animated feature.  First rate animation, breathtaking drawing and backgrounds, and Matt Damon voicing the "mind" of the title character. Unfortunately, the achilles heel of this movie is a weak, heavy handed story that seems more bent on political correctness than on telling a tale.  There's nothing wrong with a storyline that exposes past injustices but this movie uses it as an offensive weapon in the finest tradition of propaganda films.  Ultimately this renders the picture inappropriate for younger viewers, which is a shame because it's an otherwise an excellent movie.  The animated feature Ice Age also takes a swipe at the way mankind has treated animals in the past, yet unlike Spirit it manages to do so without getting bogged down in its own sense of self-importance. My suggestion?  If you're an older viewer with a strong feeling about animal rights this is the film for you.  If you're looking for something to entertain your kids, pass this one up for Monsters Inc. or Ice Age.
