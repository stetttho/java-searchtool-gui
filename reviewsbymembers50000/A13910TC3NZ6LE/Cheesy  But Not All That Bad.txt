 I'm disappointed by the number of reviewers who called themselves longtime fans of Barenaked Ladies but who trashed this collection just the same.  To be sure there's some real schlocky stuff in this collection, but there are also some very good tracks.    I liked BNL's version of "Jingle Bells" and I even liked Steven Page's alternate version of the refrain (Batman smell, Robin laid an egg, etc.), but his vocal style left a lot to be desired.  The instrumental versions of "Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer", "Wonderful Christmastime", and "O Holy Night", all presumably done by keyboardist Kevin Hearn on a synth, were so-so (listen for the missed note in the refrain on "O Holy Night") I absolutely hated "Deck the Stills" (Crosby Stills Nash and Young sung over and over to the tune of Good King Wensceszlas), and "Carol of the Bells".  The standout tracks on this CD are "Green Christmas", a somewhat curmudgeonly gripe about commercialism and the holiday season done by Ed Robertson, "Elf's Lament", an uptempo number about Santa's elves and their presumed lack of job satisfaction, and "Snowman", a rather sad song sung from the point of view of a snowman.  "Footprints in the Snow", with vocals by Robertson, has a nice country flavor to it.  My favorite track, hands down, is Steven Page's "Hannukah Blessings", a pretty number with beautifully tight harmonies and great mandolin playing by Kevin Hearn.  Even though I'm Catholic the beauty of this song cannot be understated.  Kevin Hearn's "Christmastime" (Oh Yeah) is okay but a little pedantic, and Jim Creeggan's "Christmas Pix" is a nice piece.  "Auld Lang Syne" wraps up the CD, sung so beautifully it brings tears to my eyes.    All in all "Barenaked for the Holidays" is a good holiday CD, certainly not any better or worse than holiday collections by other artists over the years.  It's a little silly to be sure, but then again that's the charm of this band.  Give it a listen.
