 One previous reviewer wrote that this album is not for everyone.  I wholeheartedly agree.  However, if you want to gain a better understanding of R.E.M. and the creative process that led to watershed albums such as  "Murmur" and "Reckoning", then this album is an  absolute must. I particularly liked "Voice of Harold", which is  essentially Michael Stipe reading the liner notes from a gospel album to  the tune of "Seven Chinese Brothers"...very catchy and clever!   "Burning" is a creditable version of the old Pylon song, and the  covers of Velvet Underground material, especially "Pale Blue  Eyes", are better than the originals (OK so sue me, I never liked The  Velvet Underground)! And the drunken version of "King of the  Road"?  I laugh every time I hear it.  The segue from the Walter's  Barbeque ad to this song adds a raw, gritty dimension to a band that was  trying to make its mark on the music scene.  Sorry to have to disagree with  you purists, but I liked it! And now for the extra added bonus:   "Chronic Town"!  Jangly guitar riffs, infectuous percussion, and  muddied, almost intelligible vocals.  I'm really not trying to be sarcastic  - its an incredible record!  So what if Stipe forgot half the lyrics to  "King of the Road?  It's a bargain at twice the price!
