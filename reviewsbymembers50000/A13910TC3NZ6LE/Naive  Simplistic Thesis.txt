 Michael Medved first came to the attention of the American public with "The Golden Turkey Awards", a well-written and somewhat witty observation of some of the worst films ever produced in Hollywood.  In "Hollywood in America", Medved decries this same industry for not putting out more films that fit within his rather narrow focus. As written, the book is rather naive and suggests that virtually every film that ever came out with a rating other than G is trash and not worth watching.  This is not a pretty world in which we live, and to suggest that filmmakers should sugarcoat movies to present only sweetness and light is patently absurd.  But this is exactly what Medved seems to be striving for.  He has become a darling of the conservative right but in the process discarded semblance of credibility and integrity he may have had as an objective film reviewer.  Nevertheless, we can take comfort in the fact that he hasn't become as insufferable and arrogant as Bill Bennett in his castigation of Hollywood and the film industry.
