 I'm a big fan of Barenaked Ladies, but I have to admit that "Everything to Everyone" threw me for a loop.  I resisted buying it based on negative word of mouth reviews (i.e., it sucks; you won't like it; it's not your "typical" Bnl CD).  I wasn't knocked over when I first heard it, but neither was I disappointed.  Although I think "Another Postcard" is an irritiatingly silly ditty and a poor choice for the album's first single, it has this knack for getting into your head like an earwig.  After one or two listenings you'll be singing along with it, at least the chorus line. In my view, "Maybe Katie", a catchy pop tune about the ambivalence some guys go through in dating older women (with kids) would have made a much better first single and I imagine when "Postcard" starts slipping that the label will release it.  Other tracks worthy of note are "Next Time", which shows a heavy XTC influence, the bluegrass tinged "For You", which sounds like it belongs on the soundtrack album to Cold Mountain, and the breezy, light "Shopping", a lighthearted blast at commercialism that has turned out to be one of my favorite tracks.  As with "Next Time", it sounds very much like XTC, but it has a unique 60s downtown influence to it. One previous reviewer referred to "War on Drugs" as boring and pretentious, a characterization with which I disagree.  I think it has great lyrics but a melody that I almost think is predictable for a song about suicide.  The main problem I have with this song lies in Steven Page's vocal, which to me sounds strained and off key.  Nevertheless, it sends a message to the listener about the futility and uselessness of suicide almost as strong as R.E.M.'s "Everybody Hurts" and deserves a listen. The bottom line is this...although "Everything to Everyone" isn't as slick as "Stunt" and will probably never enjoy the critical or commercial success of "Maroon", it's still an excellent CD from the best Canadian band this side of Rush.
