 I've been a fan of REO Speedwagon since the beginning.  Having said that, it pains me to say that this is an atrocious live collection unbefitting of one the the best rock bands of the 1970's.  It is a shameful followup to "Decade of Rock and Roll" and doesn't come close to matching the excellence of that album.  Numerous personnel changes, mostly driven by Kevin Cronin's rather huge ego, have rendered this band a shadow of its former self.  This disc is full of weak, halfhearted performances.  The group sounds like it's just going through the motions or trying to fulfill an album obligation.  No heart, no soul.   Avoid this one at all costs.
