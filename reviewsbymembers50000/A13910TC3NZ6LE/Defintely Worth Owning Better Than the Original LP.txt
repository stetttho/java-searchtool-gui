 I was a big fan of Cheap Trick at Budokan when the LP was released in 1979.  This CD compilation goes it one better.  The concert is presented complete, with the tracks in the original order (including several that didn't make the cut to LP in '79).  To top it all off, the whole shebang has been digitally remastered. How does it work, you ask?  I don't think the word "excellent" does it justice.  This two CD set, as at least one other reviewer noted, should be a seminal part of any serious CD collection.  This set packs a sonic whallop and says unflinchingly that Cheap Trick was at that time (and for the most part still is) one of the most dynamic live acts in rock n' roll.  Bonus tracks include PC/MAC video performances of Auf Wiedersehen and Surrender.   I have only one minor complaint.  A small bit of dialogue that occurred prior to the final track, Clock Strikes Ten, was omitted from the mix.  Robin Zander introduces the tune with "here's one I'm sure you all know" in the original LP but curiously this was missing on the intro in the "Complete Concert" set.  This is a minor point however and should not seriously detract from the enjoyment of what I consider to be one of the best live rock albums ever made.
