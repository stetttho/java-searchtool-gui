 ...  Having read a number of historical accounts of the era, I found the picture for the most part accurate (I  agree that the encounter outside of Lawrence never occurred and was  probably staged for dramatic effect).  What I find most surprising about  the picture is Ang Lee's mastery of the subject matter.  Clearly he knew  what he wanted and got it on film.  In my opinion, Lee acquits himself on  this film at least as well as he did in "Sense and Sensibility".    The acting by this ensemble cast is quite good.  Skeet Ulrich is very  turned in a fine performance and Jewel was, surprisingly, quyite good in  her first movie performance.  Tobey Maguire shows once again why he is  clearly the best young actor in films today.  One word of warning-this film  is quite violent.  If you can handle that, then I highly suggest watching  this motion picture.
