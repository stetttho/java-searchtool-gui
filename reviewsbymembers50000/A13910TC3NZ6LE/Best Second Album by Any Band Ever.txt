 I must enthusiastically agree with all the other customer reviewers who raved about this CD.  Most classic rock stations play a lot of tracks from the Cars' debut album, but Candy-O remains my favorite.   Each and every song on this CD is catchy and makes you want to turn the volume up a notch or two.  I'm personally not that crazy about "Nightspots", which I consider the weakest track on the disc, but it's still listenable.  "Shoo-Be-Doo", with it's segue into the title track, and "Dangerous Type" get my vote for the best tracks on the disc.  The latter song conveys a sense of darkness and foreboding, as if something really bad is going to happen if singer Ric Ocasek keeps up his relationship with the girl in the song.  Greg Hawkes' mesmerizing keyboard work is at its best in this track, as well as "It's All I Can Do".   Last but not least, the cover of "Candy-O" gets my vote as one of the most erotic album covers of all time.  The cover art by Antonio Vargas, who illustrated for Playboy in the 60's and 70's, is incredible.  I'd have bought the CD just for the picture alone, but guess what?  The music is fantastic too!!
