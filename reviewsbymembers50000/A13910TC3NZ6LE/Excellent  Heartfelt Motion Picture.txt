 I had put off watching Avalon for a long time because I was afraid I would be lukewarm to a film about an immigrant family coming to America and the abandonment of tradition by its next generation.  How wrong I was!  Avalon is the third element in Barry Levinson's "Baltimore Trilogy".  It falls somewhere between Diner (to which I would also give 5 stars) and Tin Men (to which I would give 3 stars) in quality, but it has more sentiment than either. Armin Mueller-Stahl, who I had not seen before this picture, turns in an excellent performance.  I take some degree of issue with Amazon's description of the movie as starring Elizabeth Perkins; she is in fact plays a minor character.  Personally, I found her performance one dimensional.  Joan Plowright's performance as the family matriarch is much better.  Aidan Quinn and Kevin Pollak, the latter of whom I have been a fan of for years, are nothing less than excellent.  Yes, this film can get ponderous and a bit long in the tooth, but I would hardly dismiss it as "artsy" or "cutesy".  To those who gave this movie negative reviews, I would respectfully suggest that you have forgotten what great filmmaking is all about.   The soundtrack to this film is one of Randy Newman's best ever.  Sadly, it is no longer in print.  It complements this film beautifully.
