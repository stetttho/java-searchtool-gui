 I became hooked on The Odds after hearing "Heterosexual Man" on our local college radio station.  I then went out and found "The Odds Quadrologue", a demo tape made for BMG that featured this track plus three additional songs.  I liked it so much I ended up buying "Bedbugs" a few months later. I have heard The Odds compared to Toad The Wet Sprocket by a number of people and would for the most part agree with that comparison, except to say that The Odds' songs feel a lot more loose and unstructured.  "Yes Means It's Hard to Say No" (with piano work by Warren Zevon) is a catchy, infectious song.  "What I Don't Want" is also a polished gem of a song, but my favorite track on this collection is "It Falls Apart" with its hard-edged guitar attack and dual vocals. "Bedbugs", along with the equally excellent "Neapolitan" CD are two excellent collections of songs by one of the most shamefully overlooked bands this side of The Smithereens.  I highly recommend it.
