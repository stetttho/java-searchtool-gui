 I own all the volumes of "A Very Special Christmas" and consider this one to be the best.  Maybe I'm sort of a Grinch, but I detest Whitney Houston's version of "Do You Hear What I Hear?" and Stevie Nicks'  interpretation of "Silent Night" which appear on previous  editions.   To be sure, some of the songs are better than others.  I for  one liked "Christmastime" by the Smashing Pumpkins...it's  refreshing to see one of this country's best alternative bands try  something a little out of the ordinary.   My hands down favorite on this  disc is "Christmas" by Blues Traveler.  The lyrics are especially  interesting and portray John Popper's initial indifference to Christmas,  followed by his getting caught up in the Christmas Spirit, followed by his  anxiously awaiting next year's Christmas.  It's a truly beautiful and well  done piece. Also worthy of mention is "Ave Maria" by Chris  Cornell and Eleven.  Cornell's vocals, as well as a very good arrangement  of this classic, make it a standout on this collection and alone justifies  the purchase price. The other tracks range from beautiful simplicity  (Enya's "Silent Night") to raucous and fun (No Doubt's "Oi  to the World).   As previously mentioned, this is the best of the  "Very Special Christmas" series.  Give it a listen.
