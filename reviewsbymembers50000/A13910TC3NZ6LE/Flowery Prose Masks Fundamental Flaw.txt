 George F. Will is better than just about any other author I know in using flowery prose to mask what I consider to be his biggest problem; namely, his failure to communicate with readers and hold their interest. Instead of being the insightful and introspective look into the game of baseball its author hoped for, it comes across as pretentious and muddled.  While I love baseball, I found this book to be inane and boring. As far as I'm concerned, "Men at Work" represents Will's swing at a 3-2 outside pitch.  I hope he never writes a book about golf.  Pass on this one.
