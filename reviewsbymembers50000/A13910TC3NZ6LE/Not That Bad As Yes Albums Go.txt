 I have to take issue with the many negative reviews that "Tormato" has gotten from other customers.  Many of those reviewers use the word "completist" in describing those who would buy this particular album.  Well, I am not a completist ("Tormato" and "Fragile" are the only Yes CD's I care to own), nor am I a hard core fan of the band (I hated Tales from Topographic Oceans and 90215).  Nevertheless, I consider this to be a good collection of songs. On "Tormato", the band pretty much eschews its penchant for longer, FM radio oriented tracks in favor of shorter tunes.  Of particular note are "Future Choice", "Don't Kill the Whale", and "Release Release", all of which feature superb work from all five  members.  I can't say I particularly cared for "Circus of Heaven", on which vocalist Jon Anderson's son assisted the old man.  The standout tracks on "Tormato" are "Arriving UFO", on which guitarist Steve Howe and keyboardist Rick Wakeman complement each other to a driving beat courtesy of bassist Chris Squire and drummer Alan White.  Anderson creates a touching, reflective setting in "Onward".  The best track on the disc is "On the Silent Wings of Freedom", on which Squire showcases his talent as the best rock bassist this side of Paul McCartney, vastly superior to the overrated Geddy Lee of Rush with whom he is often compared. You don't have to be a completist to enjoy this CD, and I'll even admit it's not one of Yes's best.  But I still like it.  And you should listen for yourself and decide.
