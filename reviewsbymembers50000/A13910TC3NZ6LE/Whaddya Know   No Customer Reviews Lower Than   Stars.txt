 Obviously Amazon.com customers know what they like.  Not a single one of the customer reviews of this picture is below 4 stars...and even an idiot like Leonard Maltin gave it a decent review!   What can I say about this  movie that hasn't already been said?  Jake and Elwood, played by Belushi  and Ackroyd respectively, have been recently released from prison and are  on a mission from GOD!  They're organizing a benefit to raise money to pay  the taxes on the orphanage where they were brought up.  We encounter  bravura performances from the best blues talents in the business along the  way, along with some great comedy!  The performance of the "The Good  Old Blues Brothers Boys Band" at Bob's Country Bunker is hilarious and  alone justifies the purchase of this picture.  EVERYBODY needs  SOMEBODY...and they also need this movie in their collection. One piece  of advice...stay away from the sequel to this movie.  "Blues Brothers  2000" is god awful!
