 First off, let me say that I'm really surprised at the number and tone of some of the negative reviews of this CD.  One reviewer referred to it as "radio pap".  To casually lump tracks like "Harder to Breathe" and "This Love" with the synthetic, derivative teeny bopper crap coming from the likes Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake, Usher, et.al., suggests a high degree of ignorance and not much of a discerning ear.  This 48 year old considers "Songs About Jane" to be one of the best CDs to hit the music scene in the last few years.  The guys in Maroon 5, particularly Adam Levine, have hit upon a mixture of rock, funk, and soul that might seem derivative or formulaic in theory but that in practice produces some of the most unique and listenable songs I've heard on commercial FM radio in ages.    The only weak track on this CD, in my humble opinion, is "Shiver", which sounds kinda "boy-bandish".  I keep wondering when Justin Timberlake's going to record a cover version.  Best tracks: "Harder to Breathe" and my personal favorite, "Sunday Morning".  Adam Levine's vocals bring to mind Stevie Wonder.  Another song of note is "Not Coming Home", which features some interesting guitar work from fellow Nebraskan James Valentine.  The guitar line sounds like it was lifted from a 70s porno film soundtrack.  I think it's pretty cool.  "She Will Be Loved", currently getting airplay on commercial radio, has a smoothness and ambience to it I haven't heard since I was in high school in the 70s.  Again, Levine's vocals are superb.  Bottom line here...ignore the negative reviewers but don't take my word for it on "Songs About Jane".  If what I and others have written about the band and the CD intrigues you, give it a listen.  I'll bet you end up buying it.
