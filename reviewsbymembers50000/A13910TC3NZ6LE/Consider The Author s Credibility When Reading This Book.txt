 Louis J. Weichmann would be little more than a footnote in the story of the assasination of Abraham Lincoln had he not shown himself to be ...individuals associated with a second, almost darker tragedy...the execution of an innocent woman. Weichmann rented a room in the boarding house of widow Mary Surratt, where many of those who conspired to kidnap and later assasinate Lincoln lived at the time.  Once the conspiracy was uncovered, overzealous federal officials alleged Mrs. Surratt was an active participant.  Historical fact, as well as the testimony of the conspirators themselves, stood in sharp contradiction to these allegations.  Weichmann, who was barely acquainted with any of these individuals, testified that she was an active participant.  It was later determined that his motive was to curry favor with government officials in hopes of obtaining a federal job.  Based on Weichmann's false testimony, an innocent woman went to the gallows.  Weichmann later wrote this book in attempt to cash in on the public's thirst for knowledge.  The problem is, he had none.  He just happened to be in the same place as some of the conspirators for a brief period of time. It is with this knowledge of the author's motives that anyone considering reading this book should approach it.  Weichmann has earned his place in American history as a liar and a coward.  As an author, he is not worthy of belief.
