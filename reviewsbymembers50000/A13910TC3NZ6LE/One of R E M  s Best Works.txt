 I remember when I first bought this CD in 1992.  I was disinterested in little more than "Nightswimming" when I first heard it, but over the years and with repeated listenings, "Automatic for the  People" gets better and merits placement with "Reckoning"  and "Murmur" as one of the best rock recordings by any group in  the last 20 years. The number of positive reviews by other customers  confirms this. The songs are well-crafted, although they have fewer of  the delicious guitar and mandolin hooks that drew me to other R.E.M. works  such as "Green" and "Out of Time".  Stipe's lyrics are  simply incredible and beautifully sensitive.  I have only two minor  complaints:  "New Orleans Instrumental No. 1" seems out of place  on this disc, and "Ignoreland" has a feel and sound about it that  seem better suited to a different R.E.M. CD (love the lyrics, though)! Of  particular note are "Everybody Hurts", which is a song of  redemption and hope.  Musically, it's beautiful and ranks up there with  "Perfect Circle" and "You are the Everything" as one of  the best. In a similar vein, "Nightswimming" recalls youth and  innocence left behind.  Somehow it coincides with this album's release  (October, 1992) and brings back feelings of wistfulness for last  summer. "Monty Got a Raw Deal" is a dark and foreboding tribute  to Montgomery Clift with some very tasty mandolin licks, courtesy of Peter  Buck. "Star Me Kitten" is a dreamy song with a sensuous guitar  hook that works exceptionally well. "Man on the Moon" is okay,  but I wasn't a big fan of Andy Kaufman when he was alive, so I don't really  understand the significance of this song. One rather negative customer  reviewer earlier said that "you'd thank him" for not buying  "Automatic for the People".  Disregard him.  A few listenings of  this extraordinary CD will make you glad you did.
