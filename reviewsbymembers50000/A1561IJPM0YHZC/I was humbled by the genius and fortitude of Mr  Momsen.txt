 I applaud the other reviewers for going into such great detail.  While 99% of my feelings regarding this incredible story have already been written, I am compelled to add my final 1%. As I read the story I continually had to  flip back to the beginning to confirm that the year this was all taking  place was indeed 1939.  If I were given this book and all of the private  notes of Mr. Momsen, and then asked to replicate his studies I wouldn't  even know where to begin.  How he accomplished all of this in the late '20s  and early '30s is beyond me.  Mr. Momsen is hardly a household word, but he  makes Jacques Cousteau look like a rank amateur. This book should be  required reading for every 7th grader in the country so they understand  what it takes to be a true hero.
