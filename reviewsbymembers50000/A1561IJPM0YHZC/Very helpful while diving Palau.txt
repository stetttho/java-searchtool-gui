 I spent 10 days diving Palau in June 2001 and this book was incredibly helpful.  There are so many dive sites to choose from in this region, and this book did an excellent job detailing each and every one.  Since most dive operators in this region take "requests" rather than dictate where you're going, it's nice to have some information to make an informed decision, depending upon whether you want to focus on macro, big animal enounters, drift dives, wrecks, etc.  Going to dive Palau without this book is simply a bad idea.
