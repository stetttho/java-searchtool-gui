 I suppose it's natural for the breakup of a band (or one musician's removal as was the case with Jay Bennett being forced to leave Wilco) to cause fans to take sides and proclaim one side the victor.  This happened when Uncle Tupelo broke up and people took sides either with Jay Farrar or Jeff Tweedy. Personally, I couldn't care. They are both stellar musicians and I've enjoyed their respective work over the past several years. This album by Jay Bennett is surprisingly good and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys Son Volt/Jay Farrar, Wilco, Ryan Adams, or any other singer-songwriter who sings with passion. No, it's not Wilco, but for that I'm thankful. If he had left the band and tried only to repeat what Wilco was doing, he would be bashed left and right.  Give the man some props for doing his own thing and enjoy it for what it is...Great music.
