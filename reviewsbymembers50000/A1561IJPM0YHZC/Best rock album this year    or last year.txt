 Taken for what it's worth (read the title of the album so you're not confused), this album does just that - it rocks. Great variety of songs, great to hear the various influences scattered throughout (U2 to Velvet Underground to Elvis Costello), and simply great arrangements. It's easy to overlook his talent to craft a wonderful song, which in and of itself is not easy to do.  Too much focus is on what he did before rather than what he's offering today. I like the White Stripes enough to listen to 3 or 4 songs off their last two albums, but after that it gets monotonous and repetitive (for the love of god please add a bass player and hire a real drummer!).  While all the critics jump on their bandwagon for creating the best "rock album" this year, I wonder if they've honestly listened to this album enough times to let the magic sink in.  This album blows Elephant away on so many levels it's not even a fair fight. I personally didn't jump up and down the first time I heard this, other than for a few tracks.  After several listens, however, it really started to sink in.  This is a great rock and roll album - the best so far in 2003 and actually dating back to 2002 when Beck's SEA CHANGE was arguably the best album but it wasn't really a true rock album, thus my proclamation!   This is not his personal best (I'd vote for Demolition), but he's not competing against himself. Rock on. ebhp
