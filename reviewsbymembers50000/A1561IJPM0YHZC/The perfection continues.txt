 If the rumors are true, Ryan Adams had to release Love is Hell part 1 and 2 as EP's because his label thought they were basically not mainstream enough (whatever that means), so he created Rock N Roll.  If that's true, I honestly feel like I won the Ryan Adams lottery.  Short of being able to read the phone book and still make it interesting, I have yet to find any of his work without merit (Demolition being my favorite).  Rock N Roll is certainly different, but it's an amazing piece of work and the best rock album of 2003.  Taking a major step back to his more intimate, moody work (although by going backwards doesn't mean it's bad), the Love is Hell ep's are truly stunning work.  Ryan has always shown his best side when it comes to mellow, introspective work (the best track on Rock N Roll is not a barn burner but rather the somber title track).  Love is Hell pt. 2 continues where pt. 1 left off, and each track is simply perfect.  I highly recommend you pick this up along with pt. 1 - you won't be disappointed. This is a rare artist where you can enjoy the music without actually listening to the lyrics - just soak in the melodies, the near-orchestral chord changes and enjoy the moment.  Or, have some coffee and listen hard to the message of each track.  Either way, you won't be disappointed. Without going nuts over this guy, I will say that Ryan Adams is the most important musician working today.  Some critics would disagree, but that's because they have their heads too far up the as* of the White Stripes and OutKast at the moment.  Nonetheless, time will no doubt prove my point.  Ryan Adams is to the 21st century what Elton John and Bernie Taupin were to the 70's (except he's only one person so he gets even more credit for pulling it off).  Thankfully prolific, heartfelt, engaging, and simply entertaining. ebhp
