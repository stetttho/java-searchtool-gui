 It boggles the mind how anyone could give this album a rating of less than 5 stars.  This is the kind of album that a sixth star should be added for. Yes, it's mellow.  It's not for working out to - it's great to have on at work, reading the paper on a Sunday morning, or traveling on a long plane ride where you want to drown out everything else and escape to a peaceful place. Her voice is captivating, powerful without seeming so, and the most engaging since Fiona Apple. I can't say enough about this album.
