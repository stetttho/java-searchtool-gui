 I've never listened to Sunny Day Real Estate, but this album is incredible.  Each listen unveils something new that I hadn't previously discovered, and as far as I can tell there isn't one bad track on the album. If you like "big" rock songs with sweeping arrangements, the kind you'd like to see performed with a full orchestra behind them - then it doesn't get any better than this. ebhp
