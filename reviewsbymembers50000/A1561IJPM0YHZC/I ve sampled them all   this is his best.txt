 Rare is the artist who is difficult, if not impossible, to categorize.  One moment country down to his boots, the next a smooth crooner with incredible wit who draws comparison to a modern-day Frank Sinatra...in a strange way.  Lyle is the consumate musician and he surrounds himself with nothing but the best (if not better) supporting musicians.  This is particularly evidenced on his Live in Texas album (which I highly recommend), but for his best album start to finish, look no further than this beauty.  Songs that make you laugh, cry and just scratch your head in amazement at how he manages to survey a chapter of the human condition and then put every nuance into a 4 minute song....man, this guy is simply amazing.  What I like most about this album is that it touches upon so many genres.  Rock, country, folk, pop...put them all in a blender and you have Road to Ensenada.  With too many great songs to list individually, I highly recommend that everyone out there picks this album up.  You won't be disappointed.  ebhp
