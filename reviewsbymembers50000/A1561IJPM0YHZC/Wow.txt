 This is a tough album to categorize, with so many influences and cross-genre performances.  I'm almost hesitant to throw out comparative bands as most people do so to say that the band is therefore "unoriginal" and thus less of a band because they sound like someone else.  In reality, everything in music has basically been done before.  The challenge is to create something that stands out for being honest and heartfelt.  One look at the liner notes for this album and you'll be blown away by the sheer storytelling involved with each song.  Man, this stuff is pure poetry, as exhibited on the barn-burning romp of "This Train Will be Taking No Passengers":  == Pods of wealthy blonde gobbets with red-rind eyes getting pecked at by the heroin sparrows of the western skies, It may be married to the tracks but this train flies and it's taking no passengers ==  Not really sure what all of that means, but when was the last time you heard lyrics like that from a rock band?  The amazing thing, however, is that these aren't lyrics of self-indulgence plastered over a melancholy tune.  This particular song kicks some serious as* and it took me until about the fourth listen to the album that I really started paying attention to the meaning of each tune.  Without going overboard, this album reminds me of walking into a museum and seeing an amazing painting that you've perhaps seen a picture of.  You instantly recognize certain elements of it, but you spend the next five hours trying to figure out every nuance because you're hooked.  Well, this album should be hanging in the Louvre or the Uffizi Gallery, because it's that good.  I will take great delight in recommending this album to everyone I know and I suspect it will go down as one of the best albums of this new Century.  Can't recommend it enough.  A "6-star" album if there ever was one.  ebhp
