 It's impossible to label one Elton John album as his best, simply because he has so many.  In my opinion, his top three include his first album Elton John (self-titled), Madman Across the Water and Tumbleweed Connection.  I would, however, listen with an open mind if another listener tried to convince me that Elton's top three included Honky Chateau or Captain Fantastic or Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player.  Simply put, they are all amazing.  What's even more incredible is how quickly Elton and Bernie Taupin produced all of these albums.  If memory serves, they averaged two albums per year for the first 3-4 years of their music career.  In today's world, that's an amazing feat, but to have them be as perfect as they were, well...that's why Elton & Bernie will go down in history as the greatest duo for writing perfect songs.  Okay, Lennon/McCartney set the standard, but let's remember this is just my opinion.  Dump me on a deserted island with only 10 albums to bring with me and probably half of them would be from Elton.  For the new listener to Elton, Tumbleweed Connection is a great place to start, but get out your check book because you just can't stop there.  All of the albums I mentioned above are must-haves.  ebhp
