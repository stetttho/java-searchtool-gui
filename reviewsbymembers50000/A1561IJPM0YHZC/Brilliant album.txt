 If Damon Gough had released this as his first album, critics and fans alike would be proclaiming him the next superstar of heartfelt, melodic rock/pop.  Instead, this came out after the genre-bending Hour of Bewilderbeast and thus it is prone to comparisons and ultimately feelings of being let down by certain fans.  Taking a step back and looking at this album on its own (which we should all be doing), it is quite simply an amazing piece of work.  What's that?  You say that comparisons are inevitable and must be made? Okay, fair enough.  Then go ahead and compare this to 99.9% of the other [stuff] floating around out there and you're once again back to realizing just how wonderful this is.  Melodic, moving, emotional, surreal...it exceeded my very high expectations.  Now my only disappointment is that he doesn't release an album every month of the year.  Do what you can to find some of his live recordings (bootleg).  He usually boils everything down to its bare minimum with just him on acoustic guitar or piano, and that is where his genius shines through.
