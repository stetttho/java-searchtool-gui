 So many artists struggle to put 10 songs on an album, of which maybe half could be considered decent.  Joseph Arthur manages to create 16 for this album and there's not a loser in the bunch.   His songs are pure poetry surrounded by swirling layers of gorgeous music - sometimes simplistic folk, other times upbeat rock. But his lyrics carry each one with often times devastating results (in a good way).  Tales of love lost and struggles to love are the most common, but they never get tiring due to the diversity of the tracks. For those who do love this album as much as I do, check out Gavin DeGraw as well (his album Chariot is arguably the best of 2003). ebhp
