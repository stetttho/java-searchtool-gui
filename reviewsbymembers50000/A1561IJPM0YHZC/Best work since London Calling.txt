 I appreciate that comparing this album to London Calling is a bold statement, perhaps a bit exaggerated, but I can't remember the last time I bought an album and then listened to it around 20 times....within 24 hours. This album is that good, with incredible variety.  Several of the songs harken back to the reggae-rock days of London Calling while others break it down to the simplest form with just Joe and an acoustic guitar (to cover Marley's Redemption Song).  The rest of the tracks are somewhere in the middle, with funky grooves or ballsy riffs. Speaking of Redemption Song, this version is most impressive because Joe doesn't exactly have a "good" voice.  By that I mean someone who you'd consider a "crooner".  However, his voice works so well here - you can almost feel the anguish in his voice that he got the hard way by living a hard life. There are other tracks on this album that are simply gorgeous in their anthems and near-orchestral arrangements.  I never thought I'd say that about a Joe Strummer tune, but man it's great stuff. My only complaint about this album....with only 10 tracks, you simply want to hear more.  Maybe that's why I've been playing it over and over again. Joe Strummer was an icon of rock and roll and his legacy is left well intact, both as a solo musician and as a member of what was arguably the most influential band in rock history.  Think about it for a second.  If you could travel back in time to see any three bands perform live, how could you not pick the Clash as one of those three? ebhp
