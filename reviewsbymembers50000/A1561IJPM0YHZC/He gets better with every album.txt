 Not sure how anyone can so easily dismiss Ryan Adams.  There's no one in music who can match his prolific efforts and maintain such a high level of quality.  This EP is much more intimate than the Rock N Roll album, but that doesn't make it better or worse - just different.  Love is Hell is painfully insightful one moment and hilarious the next.  It's easy to listen to most artists working today and not even hear their lyrics.  Not so with this dude.  With the recent, sad loss of Elliot Smith, I pray that Ryan keeps recording such masterful records as this one.  We need a rock icon who's living the life and communicating his own turmoil while at the same time keeping a sense of humor about it. ebhp
