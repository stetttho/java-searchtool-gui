 While this album may be hard to swallow for die-hard SCI fans, taken for what it is, it's a great album with amazing variety.  By nature of having multiple writers and singers within the band, you get a different feel depending on who wrote/sings the tune.  Unless you like your music to all sound the same, this is one of the strongest points of this band and this album in particular. The instrumental forays on this album are amazing in that they acutally work within the context of the album.  The piano instrumental (track 7) is a thing of beauty.  Track 11 (Who Am I?) has some of the most insightful lyrics about the influence of a lost parent and the need to move on without forgetting them.  This isn't just a jam band with a penchant for herb - this is a band of serious musicians with a story to tell, a definite rarity in today's business of music. Another reviewer commented about the lack of the mandolin sound and I must admit I also miss that.  However, if you're dying for mandolin, go listen to Nickel Creek or the new Bela album! Bravo to SCI for this album.  Can't wait to see them perform these tracks live.
