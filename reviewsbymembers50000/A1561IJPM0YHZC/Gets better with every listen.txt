 This is a rare artist where it's best not to decide which single album is best.  Doing so only helps those unfamiliar with the artist decide which ONE album to buy.  Spend the money and buy ALL of the Eeels albums out there - you won't be disappointed.  Unless of course you don't enjoy strikingly insightful lyrics wrapped in musical arrangements that defy nearly every other artist working today.  Need proof of his lyrical talent?  From "Somebody Loves You":  This nagging malaise Is more than a phase It feels like a job But no boss ever pays you to lay there And think how you'll die While the tears start to well in your eyes Depressing? Yeah, when read like the poetry that it is, but coupled with the sweeping orchestral chorus that reinforces the message that "somebody loves you, you're going to make it through" - it's hard to not to feel invigorated by the talent of this artist.
