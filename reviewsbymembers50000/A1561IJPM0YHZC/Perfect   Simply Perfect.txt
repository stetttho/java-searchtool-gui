 The only previous Beck album I had heard was Odelay and I must admit I didn't care for it that much.  Sea Change, however, is in a totally different class, as though recorded by a different artist. Whatever it is that bums this guy out, let's make sure it sticks around.  This album is stunning, plain and simple.  Melodic, moody, but strangely enough NOT depressing, this album is a shot in the arm and renews my faith in music.
