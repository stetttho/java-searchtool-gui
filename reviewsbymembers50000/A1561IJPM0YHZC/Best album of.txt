 I never thought I'd say this about a Green Day album, but man is this a perfect album.  From start to finish, there isn't a weak moment. Most bands have a hard time producing one great track on an album, let alone twenty-one.  As we celebrate the 25th anniversary of the greatest rock album ever created (The Clash's London Calling), it's pretty incredible that Green Day would come up with this politically and socially barbed rock opera.  The great thing about American Idiot is that it can be enjoyed on the surface for being the rocking "anthem" album that it is.  Or, dig into the lyrics and be amazed at the insight of the group that created "Dookie".  ebhp
