 Don't let the picture fool you.  This special edition includes two handles but NOT two charging stations.  So, if you're a husband & wife and bought this to save money, be warned you'll need to share the charging station.  Not a huge problem since one charge lasts nearly two weeks, but it's something to consider.  Having said that, this Sonicare model is incredible.  So much better than my older model I can feel the difference after only a few brushes.  The slim head makes it easier to reach the hard to reach places.  Anyone still using a manual toothbrush should seriously consider this model.
