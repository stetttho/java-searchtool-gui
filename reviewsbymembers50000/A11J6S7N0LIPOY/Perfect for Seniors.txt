 I saw this video in a friend's house.  He used to not get out much and this video got him moving and now he does gardening and takes walks, which is unusual for him.  He insisted that I take a look at the video.  It gives  flexibility and warm-up exercises, chi-gung, T'ai-chi movements as exercise  and it shows a simple Yang style form from two angles.  This is enough for  most seniors.  It is the perfect introduction to how to keep your body in  great shape at any age.  Many of the exercises are also shown seated.  I  think this video could really help a lot of people.
