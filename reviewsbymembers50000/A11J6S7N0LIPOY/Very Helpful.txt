 I found this a very helpful tape, even though I've taken some T'ai-chi.  This tape teaches you the finer points about how to use the body so that is moves smoothly and effortlessly, as you are supposed to do in T'ai-chi.  I  had memorized a series of movements (a form) but my body didn't flow.  With  this tape I now understand the details.  I actually apply the principles to  a different Yang style form than is shown in the tape.  You can simply use  the principles and apply it to any form (even though a particular form is  taught here).
