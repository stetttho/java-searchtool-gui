 This video gives you detailed training in how to compete in a tournament.  But what I like best is that Robert Lyons gives no-nonsense, practical advice about how to spar effectively in any situation.  His methods are  based on common sense rather than on "style".  He shows you how  to do each technique as he instructs a black belt and uses different angles  so you can see everything clearly.  This is great training for sparring in  general - not just for Tae-Kwon-Do.  Yet you do learn a great deal about  the difference between Tae-Kwon-Do and other martial arts, its advantages  and disadvantages.  I would highly recommend this tape.
