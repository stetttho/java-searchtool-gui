 I am a T'ai-chi person and happened to see this video.  I was just amazed and got a copy more for the exercise than the fighting (though it is incredible for that, too).  The tape itself is well made and the movements  are shown clearly and step-by step.  At the beginning, the stances and hand  positions are explained in detail. It is an astounding way to exercise and  I'm sure that few could compete against it as a martial art.
