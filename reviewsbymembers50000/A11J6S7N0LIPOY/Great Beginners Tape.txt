 This is a beautiful tape.  It provides a simple Yang form and gives careful instructions about how to do each movement, how to use the body in a relaxed, fluid way and how each movement strengthens you from the inside,  physically and spiritually.  It is beautifully done and a great  introduction to anyone interested in T'ai-chi.
