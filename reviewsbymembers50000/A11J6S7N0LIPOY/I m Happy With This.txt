 This tape is clear and well taught.  This is the first time I've tried using pressure points in my sparring.  My sparring partner and I use the tape and it has added a new dimension to our sparring.  Can't say I'm good  at it yet, though.  I think that you need to know this stuff if you  practice the martial arts.  It gives you a great advantage.  This tape is  easy to follow and practice with.
