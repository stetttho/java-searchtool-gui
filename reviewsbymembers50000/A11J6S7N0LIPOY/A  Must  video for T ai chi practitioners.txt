The tape divides the subject of  Push Hands into many chapters, detailing each nuance, each technique, each  principle and showing examples in free style push hands.  It shows that  push hands is not just pushing and shoving but is a fine art which helps  you to become aware of yourself and your connection to other people.  Mr.  Klein, the teacher, explains the principles so anyone can understand them  and you can easily see, from the push hands being done, how those  principles apply.  This video is a great contribution to T'ai-chi training.
