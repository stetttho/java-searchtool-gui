 This is the best example of Wu style I've seen.  The teacher, Jiang Jian-ye is incredibly fluid and graceful.  The tape shows the form twice from two angles and then shows each movement individually with  instructions.  There is a little section at the end where Jiang explains  the basic principles.  I just love how he does this form!
