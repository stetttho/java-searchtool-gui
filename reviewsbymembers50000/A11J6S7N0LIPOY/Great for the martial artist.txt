 This is a great video to see the self defense applications of each movement.  It teaches a 60 movement Yang short form.  The best thing about it is that you see a little guy tossing a big guy around, using very little  effort.  You don't get that with most T'ai-chi tapes.  Some people forget  that T'ai-chi IS a martial art.  There is also plenty of instruction of how  to do the movements, including proper breathing, weight shifting and the  names of each movement - also the two person push hands exercise.
