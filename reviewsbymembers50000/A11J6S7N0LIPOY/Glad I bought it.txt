 I used this video to learn Chen form (without the benefit of a teacher).  The tape quality seemed fine to me.  It was easy to learn from - the camera zoomed in and out, showing every part of the body for every move.  The  movements were repeated, one by one and the form was shown a few times  straight through.  This is a nice tape.  I still watch it just to get a  feeling of the fluidity and power of the movements (hopefully to  incorporate that into how I perform it).
