 This is a beautiful form - an excellent example of internal martial arts.  The form is shown from a few angles, the self defense applications explained and the movements taught in a classroom situation, step by step.   In a separate section, you are taught how to use the body for each part of  the form.  The tape is well done and Tseng Yun Xiang, the teacher, performs  it so beautifully.  It is worth practicing this snake form even if you are  not interested in fighting, but just to be able to be fluid and flexible.   You really should see this.
