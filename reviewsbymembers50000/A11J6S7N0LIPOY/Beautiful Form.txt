 This is a beautiful, dynamic form, with lots of leaps and intricate techniques.  It is the type that would be a favorite at tournaments.  The form is shown outdoors, from a few angles, sometimes at fast speed,  sometimes slowly, with frequent stops so you can check your own position  against the tape.  Then there is another section in which the teacher  explains each movement, tips on how to get the body to move fluidly and  connect all movements to the hips so you have whole body movement.  It is  explained well.  I think anyone could easily learn this form from the tape.   I have learned the basics and can tell you that it's great fun and great  exercise.
