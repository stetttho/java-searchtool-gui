 First time I've seen this form.  Similar in some ways to Chen style but more flexibility in the body.  This form can really get you into shape.  The tape shows each movement carefully and shows the whole form both slow  and faster, and from different angles.  It also shows exercises to help you  learn to move your body like that.  This is a form you would do after  learning a more basic T'ai-chi form like Yang style.  If you want to learn  to move like a tiger, have a lot of internal power and move like you have  no bones, this is a good tape for you.
