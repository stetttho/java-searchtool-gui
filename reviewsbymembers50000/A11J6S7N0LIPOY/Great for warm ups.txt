 I use the exercises in this tape as general warm-ups for more vigorous exercises.  I started using it when I was injured and needed something easy to help recuperate.  But I enjoy the exercises and just continued doing  them.  They keep me very flexible, relaxed and energized.  There are a few  separate sessions in the one tape and each one is fun to do.  The  instructions are voiced over.
