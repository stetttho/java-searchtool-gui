 I found this video extremely interesting. It gives basic flexibility exercises by teaching a few bellydancing and a few T'ai-chi movements.  The purpose seems to be to gain control over the fine muscles of the body to  learn to move gracefully.  This video is great for people who don't have  years to devote either to T'ai-chi or bellydancing but want to derive the  benefits with some simple exercises.  The tape is clear and well made.
