 This is the video I use for stretching.  It is like taking a vacation from stress.  I feel as if I am in the class with the teacher, Jean Goulet.  The instruction is so carefully given that anyone would feel comfortable with  this video.  There are a lot of stretches here and from all kinds of  positions.  Practicing this tape regularly makes a tremendous difference in  how I feel each day - happier, less angry.  I enjoy getting up and looking  forward to my morning stretch.
