 I like this video.  It gives you two views of the 60 movement Yang form, one from the front and one from a high, rear view, which is easy to follow.  It includes simple voice over instructions (with the rear view) and a  basic discussion about T'ai-chi (voiced over with the front view).  After  that, Mr. Klein, the teacher, shows how to perform the form in various  "styles", moving like a snake, or emphasizing some particular  quality, yet using the same movements.   In this way, you can use one form  to get a variety of exercises.  It is a valuable video to get, even if you  have other T'ai-chi videos.
