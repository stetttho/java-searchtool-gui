 Aaron B. Larson, in this magnificent series of stories, has combined several of the most popular genres of the fantastic pulp fiction of the first half of the twentieth century. These include but are not limited to western, heroic fantasy, Lovecraftian horror, mystery, and science fiction. And he has also created a memorable protagonist in the Byronic Haakan Jones, a Norweigan cowboy with all the qualities of the classic western vagabond hero. The writing, narrated in first-person as by Jones, is also superior. Not only are the tales action-packed, several of them are emotionally moving as well. The incredible exploits of Jones in the thirty-six adventures collected in this volume earn him a place among the hallowed heros of adventure fiction. Fans of the old Weird Tales magazine stories will be delighted by this book. What a great TV series Haakan Jones would make!
