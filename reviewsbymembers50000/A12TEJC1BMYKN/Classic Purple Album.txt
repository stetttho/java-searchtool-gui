 This is one of the classic albums by what is unquestionably one of the greatest rock bands ever. It is superior to its predecessor In Rock and just might be as least as good as its more heralded follow-up Machine Head.  The opening title track is an experience similar to being on a roller  coaster going 100 MPH that can't be shut off. Then there is the cynical  grinder "No No No". After that, depending on whether you've got  the American or European version of the album, you get "Strange Kind  of Woman" or "Demons Eye". Either way, you get an excellent  song. The other great song on this effort is the eight minute epic  "Fools", a power-laden masterpiece where Purple pulls out all the  stops. Masterpiece of hard rock from the classic Deep Purple lineup.
