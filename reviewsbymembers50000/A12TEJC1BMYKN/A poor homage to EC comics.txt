 "Creepshow" is supposed to be Stephen King's tribute to the EC comic books he grew up on. However, his five stories for this anthology film are completely lacking in all but the most base level the wit, irony, and moral underpinnings that were a staple of that comic series. These stories are representive of only the absolute worst of the original comics such as "Tales From The Crypt" and "Vault Of Horror", the kind the editors ran when they faced a deadline and had nothing better to offer. They could have been devised by third-graders. None of them can be considered in the least bit frightening because of their predictability and laughable effects and costuming (unless you consider gore and gruesomeness in itself to be frightening, and there's plenty of that). True, the original EC comics could be gory, but the stories usually had more substance than the ones offered here. King's "The Crate", about a university professor who sees in the discovery of a crate containing a carnivorous beast from the arctic a means to do away with his shrewish wife, is probably the best of the five, but that certainly isn't saying much. If the EC comics offered stories as poor as the ones in this movie, they would have deserved their fate of being virtually banned. (Fortunately, they did not.) "Creepshow 2", the sequel, accomplishes the almost superhuman feat of being even worse than this one. This movie isn't even enjoyable as camp. A poor tribute to the EC comic line.
