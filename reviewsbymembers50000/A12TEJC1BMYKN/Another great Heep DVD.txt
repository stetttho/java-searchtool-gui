 Yet another in the series of great DVDs produced by the current lineup of Uriah Heep, my all-time favorite band. This one  documents the band's headliner appearance at the awesome Classic Rock festival in Trenton, New Jersey in the autumn of 2002 and is of the best in Heep's DVD series, with great concert footage, a wide-ranging setlist incorporating both electric and acoustic sets and informative interviews sandwiched in between the songs. Of course, for me personally, this DVD captures one of the milestones of my life as a fan. For the final night's closing number, "Lady in Black", I was one of the dozen lucky die-hard Uriah Heep fans invited to sing back up vocals and we all can be seen on the DVD. If you are a Uriah Heep fan like me, you must own this set as it is one of the most important and memorable performances of the bands long and storied career. Hey, Herrbear (the one who wrote the previous review and lives in Leesburg, VA). I live in Fairfax. Get in touch with me if you're so inclined.
