 This collection covers everything essential from the first four Iron Butterfly LPs. Although purists may bemoan the (perhaps necessary) inclusion of the single version of "Inna-Gadda-Da-Vida" instead of the 17-minute album version, this album includes just about every worthy track from that period. (Actually, the entire Iron Butterfly studio output from this period, including the seventeen-minute "Vida", could all fit on 2 CDs). I personally would have picked "Slower Than Guns" over "Easy Rider" from Metamorphosis, but hey. Rhino's packaging and track information is up to their usual standard. However, Rhino's neglect and refusal to ackowledge the two mid-seventies albums Scorching Beauty and Sun And Steel (the latter far and away the best album the band ever did) means that the collection cannot truly earn "The Best Of" moniker and must be docked points for incompleteness.
