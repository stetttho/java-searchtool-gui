 David Coverdale's third and last Deep Purple studio album also featured Tommy Bolin's introduction to the band, replacing the seemingly irreplaceable Ritchie Blackmore. This album seems to be a totally mediocre  effort, that is until one gets to the last two songs, "This Time  Around" and "You Keep on Moving" are both excellent numbers  that redeem this one and help it hold its own in the impressive Purple  catalog of the seventies.
