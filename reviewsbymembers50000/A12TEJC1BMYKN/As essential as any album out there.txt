 One of the greatest greatest-hit compilations ever compiled, Deepest Purple is simply a must have for anyone who is serious about their music collection. Twelve brilliant tracks representing one of the greatest bands  in rock history at their peak, an absolute mind-blowing collection of  tracks. You cannot not have this one. It is a go-to party CD. You get  "Speed King" and "Fireball" and "Space  Truckin'" and "Burn" and "Stormbringer" and  "Woman From Tokyo" and "Strange Kind of Woman" and . .  . oh, yeah, almost as an afterthought, you get the universally-known  "Smoke on the Water". You CANNOT do without this one, it is as  essential as the two Beatles anthologies or Led Zeppelin IV or the Stones  Hot Rocks or any other must-have album you can think of . . . the only  excuse in not having this album is that you already have all the other  albums these songs come from.
