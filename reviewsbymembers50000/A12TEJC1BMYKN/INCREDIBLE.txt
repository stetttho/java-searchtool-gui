 I actually held off on getting this album because I already had the three recent concert albums (Future Echoes Of The Past, Acoustically Driven and Electrically Driven) from which these new updated versions of classic Uriah Heep songs had been taken. I figured owning this one would be superflous. But removing the songs from a live venue into a studio-type performance gives them a new dimension, and this is one INCREDIBLE package of recordings by the current lineup of the band. It's a shame that this is such an obscure and hard-to-find release, because I defy any fan of classic rock to listen to this package and not consider it one of the greatest bands they've ever heard!
