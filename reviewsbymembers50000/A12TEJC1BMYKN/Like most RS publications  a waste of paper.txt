 The powers that be at the fishwrapper that is RS magazine have compounded a felony by updating their album guide from two previous editions. On the plus side, Dave Marsh and John Swenson, the two high-falootin' ignoramuses who were in charge of the earlier edition apparently had nothing to do with this one, which in almost any circumstance would guarantee improvement. However, the writers who have taken over for them are just as bad, and thus this edition of the Guide emerges as even more irrelevant and vacuous than its predecessor, if such a thing is possible. The discographies provided for artists of long standing are usually hopelessly incomplete, muddled, and inaccurate, and oftentimes bands or artists who were still performing at the time of this volume's release are treated as if their careers were over years ago. Mark Coleman, in particular, continually embarrasses himself with his inacurracies, superficial knowledge, and attempts to sound "hip" and "on the cutting edge" which are even more pathetic than Marsh's were. I agree fully with Peter Laffey's review below. Most of the reviewers at amazon.com can provide a more intelligent music album review than any writer at Rolling Stone.
