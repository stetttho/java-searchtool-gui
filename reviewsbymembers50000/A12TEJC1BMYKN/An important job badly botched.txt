 One is tempted to give this book the "bullet" so liberally employed by the contributors, since The New Rolling Stone Record Guide is useful only as a discography (and even at that it is spotty). The reviews are dominated by the overwhelming egotism and elitism of authors Marsh and Swenson, and are for the most part grossly out of touch with the general audience the work is supposed to be aimed at. This does stand as a good example of why Rolling Stone has to be considered with MTV as one of the two institutions that helped kill off good music. Dave Marsh is to rock and roll what Howard Cosell was to sports, only even more obnoxious and less perceptive. He is biased against many genres (particularly progressive); and even on those occasions when he does see fit to try honest analysis instead of a witty critical barb, seems incapable of offering any geniune insight into the music: His and Swenson's writing is every bit as pretentious as they frequently accuse various artists of being. The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock and Roll published at about the same time is a much better and informative reference work.
