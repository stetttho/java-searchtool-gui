 "Metamorphosis", the great lost outtake collection, finally gets its first official CD release. It had already been long out of print by the time I became a Stones fan as a teen, and the general critical and fan buzz for all the years that it was unavailible was usually a curt "Don't bother." How wrong those reports have been! "Metamorphosis" offers up several treasures for the Stones afficianado, the bulk of which consists of several fine examples of the earliest fruits of the songwriting combo of Jagger/Richards. Some of these early efforts are very good indeed, and I can't imagine how they got left off of some of those early Stones albums in favor of less interesting cover versions of blues and rockabilly standards. In addition to the earliest material, the album opens with a terrific orchestrated version of "Out of Time" which blows the "Aftermath" version right out of the water (actually, it is pretty much identical in arrangement to the Chris Farlowe version of the song which came out about that time). There is also a much rawer version of "Heart of Stone" than the one most are familiar with. One of the best outtakes on the disc, "Family" comes from the "Beggars Banquet" period, an effective work highly reminiscent of and on par with "Sister Morphine". Stones completists can now rejoice! Now, if they'd only re-issue "Sucking In The Seventies" for those rare single sides . . .
