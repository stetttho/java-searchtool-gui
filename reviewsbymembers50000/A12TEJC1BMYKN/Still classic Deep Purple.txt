 This album is often lightly regarded when compared with In Rock, Fireball, and Machine Head, and perhaps deservedly so. Yet it is still the classic lineup of Deep Purple and that means you can bet your life it is going to  be a damn good album. "Woman From Tokyo", the opener and the  highlight, is one of the best songs Purp ever did. And there's other songs  here that will reward repeated listenings by the committed Deep Purple fan.
