 Machine Head is considered by many pundits to be far and away the best album the band ever did. It of course rides the coattails of the two most well-know Deep Purple tracks, "Smoke on the Water" and  "Highway Star". "Star" isn't nearly as good as  "Speed King", "Fireball", or "Burn" which  open other vintage Purple albums, and I could easily list at least a dozen  Purple songs from this lineup that I prefer to the universally-known  "Smoke". Nonetheless, it is a classic album as everyone says.  Serving well in a supporting role to the more recognized tunes are such  minor classics as "Pictures of Home", "Never Before",  and "Lazy." And, oh yeah, the best song on the album, hands down,  no holds barred, is the jamming "Space Truckin'"
