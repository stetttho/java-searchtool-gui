 "Nursery Cryme", Phil Collins' first album with Genesis, sets the tone for their albums during much of the seventies: great music, seamlessly incorporating classical symphonics and electric rock . . . and lyrics which tell bizarre, surreal stories. Among the subject matter of this collection of songs you will find: a music box which plays "Old King Cole" and channels the spirit of a murdered blueblood, giant plants taking over the world, and a fountain which turns all who bathe in it into hermaphrodites. The best song on this album is undoubtedly the opener, "The Music Box". This little ditty tells the story of Henry-Hamilton-Smythe minor, who is murdered by a certain Cynthia Jane with a croquet mallet. When she plays a certain musical box, the corporeal ghost of Henry returns and attempts to rape her, but dissolves when the Cynthia's nurse rushes in and destroys the box. Actually, I'm relying on the story which accompanies the printed lyrics in the booklets for this summary, since you sure couldn't tell any of this by the lyrics themselves. Never mind, because what really matters in "The Musical Box" is the music, which builds gradually from a soft lazy acoustic piece, to a powefully rousing, all-out rocking finale. "The Return Of The Giant Hogweed" contains an irresitible groove. "The Fountain of Salamicis" while not quite up to the level of these two songs, does have a beautiful intro piece. The shorter numbers help balance out the major epics, and "Harlequin" is particularly lovely. A very good album. If you only know Genesis from the radio-formula crud Collins churned out in the 80's and 90's, this album may surprise you (as it did me).
