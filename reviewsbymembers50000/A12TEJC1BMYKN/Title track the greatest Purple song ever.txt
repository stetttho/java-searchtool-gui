 Deep Purple's first album after they ditched vocalist Ian Gillian in favor of future Whitesnake frontman David Coverdale. This album would be considered a mediocre Purple effort were it not for one small thing: The  opening title track is simply the greatest Deep Purple song ever done. Six  minutes of totally ripping, blazing, electrifying, mind-eexploding frenzy  with feverish guitar and keyboard solos all over the place and apocalyptic  lyrics, it alone is worth the price and rating of the album. For the rest,  there's a couple of decent rockers in "Lay Down" and "You  Fool No One" and a mildly interesting groover in "Might Just Take  Your Life", but not much else. The title track, though, is all that  matters on this one.
