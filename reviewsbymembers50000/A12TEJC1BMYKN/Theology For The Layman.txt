 As a former student of Dr. Drange's, I can testify to his meticulous clarity and thoroughness in presenting all the issues involved in an argument in a logical and concisely structured format and an objective tone that makes it accesible to the layman. Whether or not you agree with the arguments this book presents, you will be sure to find plenty of food for thought in them if you are at all concerned about theological issues.
