 This two-CD collection documents the Transatlantic label's brief experimentation with progressive rock. By far the most consistent and durable of these acts was the hard-rock oriented band Stray, and the two tracks included here ("Time Machine" and "Around The World In Eighty Days") are both sparkling jewels of heavy rock which sound so fresh they could have been recorded yesterday. Unfortunately, the rest of the compilation contains nothing to match the quality of the two Stray songs, although many of the other artists represented provide pleasant and interesting listening. This compilation encouraged me to actively seek out more Stray, unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be anything availible outside of a 2-CD anthology.
