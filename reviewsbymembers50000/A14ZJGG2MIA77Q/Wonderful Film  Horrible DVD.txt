 You know the thing I hate worst about this disc?  Not the non-anamorphic transfer, I can live without that.  And not the "Turner" logo during the overture, that's forgivable.  But what I hate most about this  (and in fact, every) edition is the incorrect aspect ratio.  This was one  of the very first full widescreen presentations (as we know it today)  accomplished by cramming three standard-issue screens together and creating  the extremely wide aspect ratio.  In fact, the 70mm prints reached upwards  of 2.75:1.  Now, it doesn't take a math major can conclude that a good  portion of the screen has been arbitrarily chopped off, and that is  something I just cannot stand for.  I demand a boycott on this great and  classic film in hopes the studio will release the edition of this film it  so heartily deserves.
