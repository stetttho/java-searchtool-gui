 Becoming weary of Akira's lackluster premiere on DVD {accompanied with my new found pact to never again purchase anything of VHS}, and being a huge fan of this wonderful film's music, I decided to purchase this nicely  produced CD.  Upon first listen, I was totally blown away.  Hearing the  intoxicating score of this amazing film evoked a form of nostalgia that  transported me back to my first viewing of this state-of-the-art animated  masterpiece.  But, enough about the film.  This CD alone stands as a great  soundtrack, with over an hour of beautifully mixtured vocals and pounding  instrumentals.  The jacket and cover were very nice, with some reasonably  well reproduced side-art.  The CD itself even had a nice print  reproduction. This masterful score serves as a well-balanced mixture of  ancient Japanese tradition and 80's cult, cyber-punk,  a frank metaphor of  the Japanese culture itself, fighting to lead the way into the future,  while deep-rooted in the past.  All in all, a wonderfully made and packaged  CD for any true 80's cyber-punk and {of course} Akira Fan-atic!
