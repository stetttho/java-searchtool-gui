 ...or however the hell long it was.  I'm sorry, but this is just a horrible movie.  The story was long and pointless {even though it was short.  Go figure.} The animation was even worse.  I know it was an early  anime, but come on!  Even stationary objects like dead bodies {there were a  lot of them} juttered up and down.  I can't comment on the sequel, but if  it was ANYTHING like the first, it is sure to be a travesty of nature.  The  one thing I'll give it is some really nice box art.  In fact, that has to  be one of the best drawn anime boxes I've seen.  It's a shame they couldn't  employ that talent on the film!  All in all, a really bad flick, even for  those slightly interested in anime.
