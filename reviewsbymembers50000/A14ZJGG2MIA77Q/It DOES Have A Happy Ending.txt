 You know, as I sit here reading other's negative reviews of this film, stating it didn't have a "happy ending", I wonder if they weren't  too busy scrutinizing every moment of this great film to realize the deep  meaning behind it.  When we first see Sam Lowry's place of work there  resides a large statue in the center of the hall with a (quite obvious)  artistic rendering of Sam (with wings) and Jill Layton. Inscribed beneath  this statue resides the basis of all the theological and metaphorical basis  of the film "The Truth Shall Set You Free".  Now , without giving  away the ("depressing ending") I explain how this relates.  Sam  lives in a totalitarian society of little hope or dreams (except, of  course, for his).  After the end (again, being  vague) Sam escapes his  restrictive bonds the only  way he can.  This may appear gloomy but as you  can see his face has a tiny smile, while humming a noticeable tune.  Don't  you understand what this means?  He's finally happy.  He's escaped his life  like a bird from a dampened cage into the open air. All the  "critics" can babble all they want, but until you understand the  themes and meanings of a film, I say you keep your opinions to yourself and  stop oppressing this already black-listed film.
