 This is one of the of the great thrillers of all time.  I try to picture this movie if it were made today.  The most notable difference is it would probally turn into a senseless gore-fest at the end.  Movies in the 50s and  60s couldnt frankly show huge amounts of blood and gore, so they had to  artistically portray the event, using the actors reactions, light , sound,  and other film tecniques (what a radical concept!). I think the ending of  this film is more jolting without the gore, allowing the viewer to  visualize it.  Unfortunaltly the times of artistic fimmaking have all but  gone, so check out this movie if you want a wonderfully-filmed thrill of a  lifetime.
