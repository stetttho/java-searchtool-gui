 Although many call this movie flawed and inaccurate, I consider it Oliver Stone's best film.  I am a huge fan of all of his work (except for Platoon which I found boring and almost completely taken from Apocalypse Now).  This film breaks the prototypical mold of Vietnam films (especially his own) and shows the entire feel of the historical era of which he is so well apt.  No, this film is not entirely accurate and I don't believe it's meant to be.  When you watch an Oliver Stone film you are transported into a noirish vision of our world through the eyes of a visual stylist and fellow man himself.
