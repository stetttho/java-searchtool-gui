 I'll cut to the chase, the special effects were new and ground breaking, but that's all.  The script, typical 90's drivel, overly long and drawn out, devoid of depth or characterization.  Most was a simple ripoff of  Total Recall and just about any John Woo film ever made.  Lacking any real  urgency or basic narrative principals, this movie (like most from this over  hyped, conglomerized excuse for a decade) is held loosely together by its  flashy style and extended use of a blue screen (Or is it green now?).      So if your in the mood for a sfx driven, mindless piece of 90's trash,  check this movie out!
