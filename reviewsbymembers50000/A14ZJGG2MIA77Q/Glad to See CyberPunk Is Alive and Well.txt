 On my initial viewing of this film, it's truthful to say I was less than thrilled.  But (like almost any movie) the second viewing was much better.   Not only was I able to catch the subtle nuances of the plot, but I was also  better informed on the techniques of animation and was better able to  appreciate it.  While obviously technically superior to Akira, I still  stand by my opinion that is doesn't quite surpass it as a film, and here's  why.  I have just finished reading the collected manga of Ghost in the  Shell and fount in it much more depth and character that the rather short  film (Is this sort of like the book/movie thing?).  The ideals proposed by  the film are intriguing, but fail to develop into much more than that.   Also, the concept of one's "ghost" is almost never touched outside of the  context of idle conversation as I found many scenes placed purely for the  purpose of meaningless exposition.  And, although I recognize the animation  of this film is obviously technically superior to that of Akira's I still  prefer Akira's animation for the simple reason I prefer the amine of the  80's in the first place.  It seems animators (in the attempt to save time  and money) prefer to simply allow their characters lips to move, as opposed  to expressing true and genuine emotions.  The only other animator who  doesn't abide by these "expressional" restrictions is Hayao Miyazaki (and  every animator can't be him, now can they?).  But, just to show I'm not  totally negative (and to tie in my lead sentence) I really enjoyed this  film as a "rebirth" of cyberpunk.  This sci-fi sub-genre has suffered much  since the likes of Akira and Blade Runner (The Matrix? Cyberpunk? Ha!) and  it's great that a film that follows in its traditions has gained world-wide  appeal.  So, I suppose this is a film any true anime buff should see at  least once (or twice) just to see where anime has been, where it is, and  where it's heading.
