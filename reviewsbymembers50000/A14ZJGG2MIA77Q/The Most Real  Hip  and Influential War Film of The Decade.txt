 For all of those looking to find an intelligent piece of American filmmaking this side of the mostly over-hyped Saving Private Ryan, this is your flick.  David O. Russell's big studio debut is nothing short of the most fantastic and surrealistic look into the madness {and humor} of war since Full Metal Jacket.  All {four} of the "kings" are, oddly enough, actors willing to prove themselves as capable of great dramatic performances {Batman anyone?}, and do it magnificently.  The wonderfully campy visual style of Russell is shown in such extremes as the hilarious and gut-wrenching "bullet cam" {not the "Matrix" one} and the subtle and silent mystique of the Iraqi torture chamber.  Probably the best young director since Paul Thomas Anderson, Russell gives us a rich visual and historic tapestry of an event that up until now hasn't been touched by Hollywood with a six-foot pole.  I will warn you, this film is definitely not for everyone and {to my disproval} was marketed as a macho, summer action flick, alienating most of it's key audience and thus failing at the box office.  But who cares!  This is a terrific piece of work by a relatively young director that {in my mind} deserves the illustrious title of film of the year.  Not much has been said of the disc thus far, but it's supposed to be crammed with {very maintaining a reasonable price.  Recommended to anyone intelligent enough to give it a chance as Neo-Hollywood "Treasure of Sierra Madre" with a Pulp Fiction-esque attitude.  Soon to achieve cult status.  A must buy!
