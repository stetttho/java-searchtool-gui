 Mostly because of my seemingly endless plight for Akira's emergence on DVD {coupled with my self-made boycott of all things VHS}, and the fact I loved the film's awesome score, I purchased this nicely made CD.  Upon first  listen, I was totally blown away.  This  disc evoked a form of nostalgia  that transported me back to my very first viewing of this landmark  animation masterpiece.  But, enough about the film, this CD does well on  its own, with over an hour of pulsing instrumentals and deep, enriching  vocals.  The CD and jacket are very nice too.  The art reproduction on the  disc and cover were reasonably well made, and the jacket side-art was a  nice touch.  The music itself is a wonderful mix of late 80's cyberpunk and  traditional eastern music and song, sure to entice a large amount of  listeners.  The various moods and themes of the disc were very well mixed  and represented a wonderful metaphor of Japanese culture, leading the way  to the future, while deep-rooted in the past.  All in all, a great feat of  music for fans of all, especially Akira!
