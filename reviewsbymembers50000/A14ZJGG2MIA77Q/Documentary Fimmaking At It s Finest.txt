 Forget those "so-called" reviewers who call this movie boring.  The entire intent of this film was to make it in a documentary style, with truthful and factual accounts of that fateful day in Pearl Harbor, while  also portraying the Japanese, not as mindless killbots, but as soldiers  serving their country.  Like A Night To Remember and 2001, this film will  stand as an immortal testament to the factual account of events in film  (Yes I know 2001 isn't even here yet, but you get my point).  With THX and  a (few) supplement(s) this disc is a must-have!
