 First off, I own this film and am glad because of it.  I know many reviewers would choose to dump on this movie, purely because it's a summer "action" movie, but, I tell you, it is something more.  Leave it to Criterion to notice the greatness in a film all would but dismiss.  Michael Bay has proven himself as a wonderful visual director, worthy of the title of this generation's Ridley Scott.  Though his first two film's {Bad Boys, The Rock} content left you feeling some-what empty, this film if full of true and genuine human emotion.  I also appreciate the Director's integrity in not drastically shortening the film.   With a rag-tag team of colorful character's this film continuously keeps you laughing, but also renews a sort of patriotism and heroism lost in our bubble-gum, quick-fix, society.  Within this film, there stands a shadowed memorial to the true forgotten hero's of the Twentieth Century, astronauts.  The brave men who, more than three-decades ago did no more than accomplish a feat though impossible by man since the first of our kind gazed into the darkened sky and wondered of the glowing sentinental that loomed over our earth.  Now, space exploration is nothing but a few whimsical jokes about under-budgeted failures and under-manned projects.  Few taxpayers realize that this branch of the Government that they refuse to support could very well be our only hope in the course of a celestial crisis, as this film so well demonstrates.   So, I ask you, when watching this film, don't immediately enter into it with a fixed mind set of a summer blockbuster, but rather a patriotic and wonderful emotional journey into the lives of a few who sacrifice themselves to save their world.
