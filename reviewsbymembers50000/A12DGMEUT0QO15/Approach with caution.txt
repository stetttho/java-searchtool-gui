 As a Norton Antivirus user for the last 4 years, I decided to upgrade to the 2005 version.  The upgrade went smoothly and the product is reportedly quite effective at detecting and eliminating viruses, however, be warned -- Norton bogs the system down quite horribly.  For example, my login time on XP went from about 30 sec to about 2 min.  Want to bring up the add/remove programs list?  It now takes about 2 min.  Logging off is noticeably slower too.  Task manager reveals that explorer.exe is pegged at 98% of the cpu during these periods.  Removing NA 2005 immediately restored my system to the snappy performance that I'd expect.  A further strike against the product is that technical support is horrendous.  Their online tech support is virtually never useful and talking to a person requires you opening up your wallet and reading them your credit card #s.  This level of support for a newly purchased product is just criminal.  What more can I say?  The product works but you better never need support on it and you may not be computing very quickly anymore.  I hate to say it, but Microsoft with their upcoming antivirus product has the opportunity to seriously damage Symantec's market share if this is the best that Symantec can do.  Until recently I'd never have considered Microsoft's upcoming products -- now I will.
