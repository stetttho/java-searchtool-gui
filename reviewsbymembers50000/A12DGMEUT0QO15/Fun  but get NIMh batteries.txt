 I put NIMh rechargeable batteries in this game and it works well, and for a long time.  (NIMh batteries can last 3-4x longer than regular alkaline batteries and stay at full strength much longer than alkaline batteries).  I do have to 'help' the game a bit by pushing the top of the trunk up when I first turn it on, but it then keeps the whole trunk pointing straight up in the sky.  The wings shoot out at a nice rate -- all of them are gone in about 1 min.  I never experienced any of the problems that others have described regarding the pieces not coming out.  My girls are delighted with this game and kids that come over love playing it too!
