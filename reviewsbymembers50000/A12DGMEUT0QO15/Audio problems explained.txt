 To those of you that have complained about awful DTS or DD sound with this DVD, I have found the answer. I rented the DTS DVD from a rental club and it was AWESOME!  I couldn't help but think that folks here that were describing audio problems with this DVD had defective systems somehow. I just BOUGHT the DVD and the sound quality is horrendous -- exactly as it was described by others here (no center channel audio, etc). Evidently there are some copies of this DVD in circulation that were manufactured improperly.  If you get one that was done right, the DVD is INCREDIBLE!  The bad ones are truly awful.
