 Beware of Epson printers!  They get good magazine reviews and that's not surprising -- they are a nice compromise between fast, quality text printing and photo printing.  They're not the best at either task but they do a decent job of both, and you can't beat the price.  They're decent printers for as long as they last, which isn't very long.  Unfortunately, you are unlikely to ever learn this from a magazine review where they have them for at most a few weeks. I've had two Epson printers in this series die on me (C80, and C82) in the last 2 years and have encountered serious issues with both printers after 4-5 months of light to moderate use.  My C84 just kicked the bucket too.  I've had the same issues that everyone else has with the printheads getting clogged and it taking many, many 'cleaning' passes before the printer works again.  Each time this happens it burns about $20 worth of ink to fix it -- a very, very frustrating experience.  I was startled to learn just how common this is.  (I had several friends comment, "Oh, you too?" when I griped about the printer).  (Note, you can improve things somewhat by always remembering to turn the printer off when you're not using it, but it's a band-aid, not a solution.  Epson has serious issues with their print heads clogging).  I called Epson today when my printer died and they wanted $10 to talk to me about it since it's now out of warranty.    I can't stand it anymore.  Goodbye, Epson, hello HP.
