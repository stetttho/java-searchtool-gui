 My experience with this set:  I've had mine for slightly over 6 months.  The picture is good for the price, although the prices on LCD sets are continuing to plummet.  Lighting is a bit uneven -- there are a couple of obvious bright spots, especially on the upper right of the screen.  Refresh rate is fast enough to keep up nicely with movies and this unit has plenty of jacks for connecting it in various ways to your system at home.  Sound is disappointing -- the set simply doesn't get as loud as a TV should and the sound is subpar in general.  If you want to turn it up a bit to overcome some background noise, you may be in for a rude surprise.  You certainly won't be enjoying rich sound, that's for sure.  The worst news of all -- my set is almost 7 months old and after running it at about half max volume, the sound has degraded and has become downright distorted, as if the speakers or sound decoding circuitry have been damaged.  BEWARE -- this unit has a truly awful 90 day labor warranty and I know I'll be in for a rude shock when I send it in for repair.  This is easily the worst repair performance of any TV set that I've ever bought in my life.  (I still have a 16 year old high-end Mitsubishi tube TV that looks and acts as good as the day I bought it).  I bought this on a credit card that doubles the warranty and I'm still out of luck.  My suggestion: keep looking for another TV.  Evidently Magnavox doesn't build them like they used to.
