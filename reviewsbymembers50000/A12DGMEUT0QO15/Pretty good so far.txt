 I've had this player for about a week now and am reasonably happy with it.  I bought this player to replace my 3 year old Sony DVD player that couldn't read my burned DVD-R or DVD+R media.  Not a problem with this unit -- I've thrown DVD+R, DVD-R, and DVD+RW disks at it and it's had no issues whatsoever, nor has it had any problems reading the several Netflix rental DVDs I've thrown at it.  So far, so good.  The picture on my 4:3 tube TV is excellent, as you'd expect, although it seems slightly darker than what I'm accustomed to, even after fiddling with the various cinema modes.  Startup time to read DVDs is definitely longer than with my 3 year old player although if it buys you the ability to read almost any disk format, it's not a big deal if you have to wait 10-15 seconds to get started.  The multi-disk memory is an excellent feature, allowing you to remove a disk and play others and when you put the disk back in, the player will take you right back to where you left off.  The only disappointment so far is that when presented with a moving, intricate picture with fine lines, the lines tend to 'wiggle' as the picture moves.  (This is noticeable in the rails and fine lines of the buildings in the opening of Mystic River as the camera pans across them).  My 3 year old Sony did NOT have this issue but my understanding is that this is a very common issue with DVD players.  Given that this is an (...)$80-$90 player that will do progressive video (which I'm not using yet) and seems to be happy with whatever media you throw at it, I'd suggest giving it a shot.  October 04 update -- the "wiggling lines" problem I noted in Mystic River turned out to be very unusual -- I think I've only noticed it in one other movie out of the 50 or so I've watched since writing this review.  It's not a big issue.
