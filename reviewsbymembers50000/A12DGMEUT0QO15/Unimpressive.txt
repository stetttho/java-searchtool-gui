 In one word, I'd describe the light put out by this bulb as "blech"! On the plus side, it's nice and compact and should fit in any lamp. I've got 4 other brands of CF lights in my house and I have to say that this has been the worst of the bunch in terms of light.  Lights of America and Satco both make bulbs with nice warm yellow/white light that somewhat resembles conventional lights.  The Panasonic bulb has a noted white/purple tinge to it -- yuck! The *only* way this light would be minimally acceptable would be if it were the only light on in a room -- put it in a room with another lamp with a conventional light bulb and you'll see just how bad the light truly is. I bought two of these -- one a 15 watt the other a 20 watt.  I ended up returning the 20 watt and am now sorry I didn't return the 15 watt too. To add insult to injury, the Satco bulbs I picked up from my local lighting store cost $4 -- this bulb was $12 until recently. Do yourself a favor and try another brand!
