 I liked this book - despite the fact I am basically a crocheter (which M's Murphy never addresses in her book, stating that some work sounds like it's been crocheted and her aversion to synthetic yarn).  M's Murphy details her journey into knitting, along with several other folks' experiences with knitting. She has some small projects at the end of the chapters that would be good for a beginning knitter such as myself.  She seems much more interested in fitting knitting to suit her title and chooses her interview subjects to prove it. The chapter about the Waldorf School was especially interesting. She seems to be a bit enthralled with the celebrities that knit,  It won't take the place of a good pattern book, but it is an interesting read for the times you're trying to rest your hands or inbetween projects. It would also be a good gift for a knitter or even as recommended reading for somebody who wonders why you like to knit.  If you liked "The Knitting Sutra", then you will most likely enjoy this book.
