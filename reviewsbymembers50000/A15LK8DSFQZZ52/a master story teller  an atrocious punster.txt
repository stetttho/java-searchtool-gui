 Bennett Cerf has had many careers over his lifetime - publisher, lecturer, newspaper columnist as well as television personality (the host on "What's My Line", seen on the cable channel Game Show Network). But one of the things Mr Cerf was most famous for was making people laugh. In "The Sounds of Laughter", Mr Cerf serves up some help for those who like a good joke or a bad pun, but especially those who have to do public speaking. The book is divided into various catagories - politics, history, wildlife (among others) and of course, puns. And all of the jokes are suitable to tell any audience of any age. There are history lessons (including an interesting quote from Adolph Hitler) as well as famous folks' anecdotes such as Dorothy Parker and Gertrude Stein.  This book is definitely a funny one for people of all ages and especially helpful if you happen to do a lot of presentations. Slip one of these jokes into your presentation, your audience is laughing - and you got them eating out of the palm of your hand. So give it a try - you'll really enjoy yourself.
