 Maybe you;re lucky enough to have this strip in your local newspaper - or lucky enough to get "Mr Boffo" or "Cats With Hands". At any rate, Joe Martin is one of the funniest cartoonists that are currently working. This book, of course, is "The Best Of Willy and Ethel" and it truly is - Willy and Ethel are similiar to Fred and Ethel Mertz or Ralph and Alice Kramden in that they don't have this lovey-dovey huggy kissy relationship and that helps produce the fireworks and laughter.   Give this book a try - I think you will really enjoy it.
