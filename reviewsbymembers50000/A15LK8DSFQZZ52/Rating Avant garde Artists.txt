 This book is a collection of reviews and essays written by Hilton Kramer. Mr Kramer is a well respected art critic, known for his well trained eye and writing style.  So what time period is the "Avant-Garde"? Mr Kramer believes it is the period of time from 1855 to the 1950s. The reviews are divided by time periods, as well as the nationalities of the artists. The reviews are well written and don't have the snobbish point of view that some art critics use, that only the critic can decide what is art. This book helps set different art movements in a historical perspective, so the reader can easily see what else was going on in the art world when the art was produced. The book also contains black and white photos of various art work - it's a shame they couldn't have been done in color. That is my only complaint about this book. I recommend this book highly for old and new artists alike - or even if you're just interested in art - to see how art is put into the historical perspective as well as for the enlightenment the reviews give the reader.
