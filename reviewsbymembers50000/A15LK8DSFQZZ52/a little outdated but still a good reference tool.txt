 I know, microwaves are fairly common, you've had one forever and  why would you need a cookbook? Because, more than likely, you're not using your microwave to its full capacity - you're just nuking tv dinners or making popcorn without realizing there's so much more you can be using it for - such as bread pudding. Yes, you can make yummy bread pudding in your microwave and have it anytime you want, or even fix it for a special someone. Or how about Chicken Divan? or Veal Chop Suey? Mr Deacon takes you throught a 5 day microwave cooking course, originally designed to make fols feel more comfortable with their microwaves. Now his instructions show you how to broaden your view and your usage of a microwave oven. There's even a test to tell if your microwave is properly calibrated so you'll be able to cook more efficently. There's even a "calorie counters" section. I recommend this book to all of you who just use the microwave to make popcorn or heat up water - find out how time saving and efficent a microwave can be by using this book.
