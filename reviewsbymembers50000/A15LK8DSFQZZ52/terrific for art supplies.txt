 This catalog is great for finding and buying various art supplies. It seems geared more for art teachers, but everybody that uses art supplies (yes, that means parents as well as Sunday school teachers, Girl/Boy Scout leaders) can use this catalog. The descriptions give you all the important information for the individual products. The range of items carried is extensive and you can find almost any type of craft/art you can think of in this catalog. The prices are also very good.  I can tell you from dealing with this company, they ship quickly and accurately. It's a great catalog (as well as a great company) for art supplies.
