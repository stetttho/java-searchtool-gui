 I have always been fascinated by the beautiful blue and white Royal Copenhagen Christmas plates. This book not only tells you about the various plates, it also provides a short history of Denmark. It also includes the legend of the Christmas plates, which I was unfamiliar with - apparently, there was a Christmas custom of wealthy folks giving their servants plates with all sorts of wonderful food on it. The servants, being poor, admired the beauty of the plates and began to hang them on the walls for decorations. Later, the servants of one employer began copmparing their plates with the servants of another employer. The plates started to become more important than the gifts and much work was done to make them more decorative.The plates began to have the year put on them, so the receivers would know exactly which plate was given which year. Thus the custom of the Christmas plate was started.  There is much more info in this book - it contains pictures of the plates and the background of the scene depicted on the plate. If you are interested in the Royal Copenhagen Christmas plates, this book will be a great resource for you.
