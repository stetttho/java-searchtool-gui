 This is an older crochet book, but still has plenty of good patterns. M's Calder gives the basic instructions on the various projects, but leaves the details (colors, design) up to the reader.  The crocheted items are colorful as well as inspiring. Most projects are made in the (American) single crochet (British double crochet and are easy to understand and create. I recommend this book highly to spice up your crocheting.
