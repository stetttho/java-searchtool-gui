 This is an excellent book if you want to expand your crocheting into working with beads. The instructions are clear and concise, the projects are lovely and it is well written. The only thing bad I can say about this book is you will have to search for it - but if you crochet and want a helping hand to incorporate beading with your crocheting, this book is well worth the search.
