 Sure you do - this was a hot show in 1986 and they are currently rerunning this on tv and the show hasn't lost its charm. Max Headroom, as you may remember, is the hipper alter ego of Edison Carter (Matt Frewer) and his adventures in the future. Carter is a top notch tv reporter, the lovely Theora  Ward, the controller, is played by the lovely Amanda Pays.  The show gives you a dark smokey view of the future - and this book, the starting movie of the seiries, replicates that look, It has the script from the movie, as well as action shots.  If you're interested in how 1986 viewed the future or just a fan, this book is for you.
