 If you feel constrained by traditional afghans or maybe you just want to learn new stitches, this is the book for you. In the process of creating an afghan, you will learn different stitches and techniques. SOme may be familiar to you, some may not be (some weren't for me and I've been crocheting a very long time). It's a neat way to challenge yourself without making a commitment to make a complete project out of any particular stitch. I recommend it for beginner and experienced crocheters.
