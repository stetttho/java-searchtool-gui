 This is the correspondence between George Bernard Shaw, the famous playwright, and Beatrice Campbell, a famous actress at the time, over the course of forty years. Though both were married to others, they seemed to have loved each other. There is no evidence of a physical affair, but it definitely was an affair of the heart.  The play, "Pygmalion" (which was the basis of the musical "My Fair Lady") was inspired by Mrs Campbell. Eventually she did play the part of "Eliza" on stage, but it was only after much pleading by Mr Shaw. When she finally did finally play the part, she was wildly successful with it. This book is a wonderful look at the lives of these two famous people and their love for each other. Read it and enjoy.
