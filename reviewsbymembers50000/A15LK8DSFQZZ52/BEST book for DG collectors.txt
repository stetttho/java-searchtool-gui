 It's amazing to even try to fathom the depth of this work - in the years before personal computers and the Internet, Hazel Marie Weatherman painstakingly gahered information from various resources to create this book. Mrs Weatherman even went door to door in areas where the factories had closed down to talk to the workers.  The result is a beautiful labor of love. Catalog reprints, arrangements of glass, print ads and info on the various factories fill this well researched book. Almost anything you can think of (advertising premiums, fish bowls, ashtrays) is in this book. If you are interested in this beautiful glassware, or know somebody who is, this is definitely the book to own. You will refer to it constantly.
