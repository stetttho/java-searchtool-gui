 I bought this book originally because of the low price and because the cover art made me curious. I was very pleased with the patterns featured and the clear concise instructions. I have been crocheting for about 30 years and it's very unusual to find patterns that are as well written as in "Take Up Crochet". It's a great book for somebody new to crochet, but it's also great for an "old dog" such as myself to learn some new tricks.
