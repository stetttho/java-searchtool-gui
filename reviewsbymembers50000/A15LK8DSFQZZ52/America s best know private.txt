 Mort Walker's long suffering private, Beetle Baily, has been a staple in newspapers for many years. He's even had his own postage stamp.  This book has the black and white adventures of all the familiar characters - Sarge, Generak Halftrack and Cookie among others. The drawings are big and easy to read, a real plasure after you've seen it shrunken in the daily papers.  The characters in this book are timeless and full of humor. I recommend this book highly for all of those who want to enjoy a classic comic strip.
