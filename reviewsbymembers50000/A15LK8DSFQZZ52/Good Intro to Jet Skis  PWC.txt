 This book is geared for the kid crowd but I did learn something - that "Jet Ski" is a brand name such as "Pepsi" or "Schmidt's Bread". I thought it referred to the act of using a personal watercraft (the proper name for these modes of transportation).  There is a brief history of the sport and a glossary of the terms used. For instance, the term "barrel roll" means pretty much what it does for PWC as well as flying, except hopefully with flying you won't get all wet. There's also a section on water safety and various resources for this relatively new sport. If you're planning to purchase one of these personal watercrafts and you have a youngester who will be using it, I recommend this book highly.
