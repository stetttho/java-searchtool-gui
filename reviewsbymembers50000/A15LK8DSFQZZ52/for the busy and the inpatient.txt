 M's Harding writes a book that is great for beginner crocheters as well as those of us who are in a bit of a hurry. The projects are easy made and the instructions are quite clear. If you need to whip up a baby afghan for that baby shower you were just invited to that just happens to be this weekend or perhaps donate something for the school's fair, this is a very helpful book.   So if you just need to crochet something fast and easy, this is the book for you.
