 You don't even have to be involved in the healthcare profession, all you have to do is be interested in the workings of the brain. This book is filled with examples of how the brain works - how a stroke will lead a woman to neglect and even deny the existence of of the non-functioning part of her body. How you can do experiments with your own "blind spots" and watch how your brain supplies the missing information. It explains how different traumas affect the brain and the outcomes of this trauma. But it's told in an engaging humorous way, on a personal level by somebody who is absolutely fascinated by what he (and she) find out about the workings of the brain. You don't have to sit with the medical dictionary by your side, pausing every few sentences to look up a term. Medical terms are explained in laymen's language so you always know exactly what is being discussed. But it's not an easily absorbed book. It makes you think about how psychology and physical trauma to the brain are interrelated. It may, depending on your own history, make you nod in recognition at various diagnosis. You won't want to read this all in one setting because you will need time to process the information. But if you're interested in how the brain works, if you're willing to stretch your reading a bit, this is a great book to read. I recommend it highly.
