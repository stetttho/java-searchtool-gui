 This is a great book if you're trying to think who said "Beat him to death, the dog! He's a reviewer"(1). Or perhaps you wonder "What Makes a good writer of history is a guy who is suspicious." (2)Or maybe even who said "Every man is a poet when he is in love." (3)   In this book, almost any subject you can think of will have a corresponding catergory with a few good quotes. If you're writing a paper or would just like to know who has said all these wonderful things, buy this book. You'll enjoy it.  1) J.W. Goeth, "Rezenment" 2) Jim Bishop, "The New York Times"  30 Plato, "Symposium"
