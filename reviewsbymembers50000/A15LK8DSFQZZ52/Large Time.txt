 This is a great cd and a great place to start if you've never listened to the Atlanta Rhythm Section. The guitars are perfect, the drummer kicks ... and the lyrics are terrific. I realize ARS gets classified as "Southern rock" mostly based on their name - nothing wrong with "Southern rock" but the music encompasses so much more than that label can reveal. They can be bluesy as on "Ballad of Lois Malone", they can rock out such as on "Champagne Jam" and they can do a haunting ballad such as "Imaginary Lover". There has been some criticism that all the somgs "sound the same" - it's as if you said all the Beatles songs sound the same. Yes, you can tell it's ARS when you hear the various songs, just as you can tell the Beatles when you hear them on the radio - but as with the Beatles, ARS manages to give each song  distinctive without making the same song over and over again - a claim a lot of bands _can't_ make. If you're into ARS, get this cd and have a "large time". If you're not familiar with them, this cd is a great place to start. Either way, this is a terrific sounding cd that any fan of guitar rock should have in his/her collection.
