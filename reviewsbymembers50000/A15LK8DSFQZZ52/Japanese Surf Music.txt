 Yes, it is Japanese surf music - not quite the Beach Boys or Jan and Dean but definitely refreshing and original. Wild Sammy and the Royaltones rock out to the Wild Datsun (take that "Little GTO") and the "Running Donkey". And of course, there's "Pipeline" - not quite the "Pipeline" you expect, but exciting and fresh.  So grab your best surf buddy and catch on a tsunami and splash about in the waves caused by Wild Sammy and The Royaltones.
