 Sure, you've probably seen the movie or had to read the book for a class. But you never really understood what the uproar was about - a relatively simple story, right? This book helps you place the book in the perspective of whrn it was first published and why John Steinbeck's work has survived the test of time.  The book is divided into 3 parts - the first part deals with "The Grapes of Wrath" as a social document and the efforts to suppress or censor the book out of existence. The second part, much longer, deals with the book as a work of art and how the various elements in the book work together. The third part of the book offer an assessment of John Steinbeck's career and his acceptance speech for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1962.  If you want to delve into the classic piece of work known as "The Grapes of Wrath", this book gives you some excellent insight how the world was when this book was first published. I recommend this book highly.
