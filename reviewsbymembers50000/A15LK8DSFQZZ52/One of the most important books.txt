 That quote comes from the review on the back, but you have to wonder how _important_is this book? Keeping in  mind this book was written in 1945, you can enjoy this book for what it is - a sort of science fiction/fact book. For example, "Universal and perpetual peace will reign in the Era of Romic Energy...". The reasoning seems solid - no reason to fight for fuel, all raw materials could be mined from the ocean and war would be too destructive (all Mr Dietz's reasons). However, as we know, these things did not happen.  This book is recommended highly just so the reader can enjoy how the future was supposed to look from the viewpoint of 1945. It certainly is a different view than the current one and, as it says on the back cover, "should be a part of the lirary of every intelligent American."
