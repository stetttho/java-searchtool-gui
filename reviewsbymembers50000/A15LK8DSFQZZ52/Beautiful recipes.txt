 You can learn some amazing things from this book - for instance, "frogs have become so rare that most served in restaurants are imports from Poland, Turkey, Yugoslavia or Bangladesh." Besides that little tidbit, Mr Millau gives us the cultural background of dining in France. Apparently dinner starts at 8-9pm and leisure is encouraged. There are addresses and phone numbers of carious restaurants and a guide on how to select wine for your meal. But maybe you aren't planning to visit France anytime soon - not enough vacation time, too little cash or whatever. You can recreate the recipes at home. It takes some effort on your part - after all it is _French_ cooking and you wouldn't expect it to be easy. But you can replicate these with the detailed recipes provided. The photographs are beautiful and the info on the various chefs is most interesting. This book is great if you want to make something really special, say for a romantic dinner or perhaps a celebratory meal - perhaps the Mixed Bouef, it's a meat lover's delight.
