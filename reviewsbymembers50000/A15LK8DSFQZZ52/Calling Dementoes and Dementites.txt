 This is a must have for your collecton- Barnes and Barnes with Jose Ferrer? Shirley Jones with Barnes and Barnes? Come on, you _know_ you're wondering how that went.  Of course, there's the famous "Fish Heads" as well as "Party in My Pants". And Dr Demento and Weird Al Yankovic make an appearance. Oh, did I mention Stephen Stills is also here? Watching this video will erase all bad memories of Bill Mumy's ruling days as the only boy kid in television land. Get it, it's weird.
