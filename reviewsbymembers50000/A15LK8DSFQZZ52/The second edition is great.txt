 This review is about the _second_ edition of the book, which apparently is totally different than the first edition. I thought this was a great book for the history as well as the recipes. The first part of the book is various celebrities saying what kind of bagels they like - interesting, but not compelling. Then there are about 15 pages of bagel recipes - yes,_bagel_ recipes such as a basic one, blueberry (of course) and a Valentine's Day bagel, among other recipes. There's info on why a bagel is better than a doughnut for you (but you knew that already, didn't you?). The rest of the book is recipes for bagel toppings and things such as bagel stuffing. I wonder if I read the same book (again, I'm talking about the second edition) simply because there are recipes to make bagels and there's about 13 pages of vegetarian spreads, despite what another reviewer stated. There's stir fried bagels, garlic bagels, butterscotch bagels as well as my kids' favorite, pizza bagels.  The spreads are amazing - the strawberry cheese bagel is much better than the soft spread Philadelphia Brand sells. The bagel cheese pastries are terrific. I recommend this book highly as it expands your horizons in regards to what you put on a bagel. I was always a cinnamon raisin with plain cream cheese kind of person, but that mushroom spread on an garlic bagel is heavenly. Buy the book and enjoy bagels.
