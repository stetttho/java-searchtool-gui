 This book is a collection of photographs and stories of multicultural hand crafts from a traveling Smithsonian exhibition. The tumbling block quilt on the front cover is only a teasing glimpse for what lies inside the book. The crafts are interspersed with photographs of the artists as well as the artist stories.  The book is especially interesting for the cultural history it hands down - there's beautiful crocheting, woodcarving, painting (among others) as well as telephone wire sculpture. The handmade objects alone are worth getting this book for, but the stories are detailed and make this a well-rounded book. If you missed the exhibition "The Grand Generation: Memory, Mastery, Legacy", this book will give you a chance to experience it. If you experienced the exibition and want someway to convey the charm to other folks, this book can help you show how various artists make their crafts. I recommend this book highly.
