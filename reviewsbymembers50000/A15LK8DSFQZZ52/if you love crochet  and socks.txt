 You will love this book. THe instructions are clear and precise, the patterns are fun to look at (socks with toes!) and easy to do. I have made several pairs of these socks as gifts and they have always been well received. Hopefully, I'll get a chance to keep a pair I crochet for myself;)  Somebody brought up the problem of yarn, but I don't think this should be such a problem anymore. Many craft stores (A.C. Moore, Michaels*) sell sock yarn and you can also order it via the internet (Herschners**).  The patterns work up quickly and it's just so _neat_ to have a pair of handmade socks - or so the people that I have given them to tell me. I recommend this book highly.  * No, I do not receive a kickback from these people.  **No, I don't receive a kickback from these people, either.
