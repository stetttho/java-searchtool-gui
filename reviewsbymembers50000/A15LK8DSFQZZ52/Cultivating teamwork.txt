 Mr Murphy starts off his book with a sort of amusing story - he is asked to spy on the second shift employees to see if anyone punches out early. He prays he won't find anyone punching out early as he did not want to spend his career spying on other employees.  From this experience, he begins to build a "principle-based" work culture, one that cultivates and rewards teamwork. He gives various suggestions on how to make people come together and work as a team instead of being "me-opic". This is a very good book for managers or folks who want to be managers to learn how to motivate your crew to do the best thing for the greater good of the team. I particularly like how he suggests that working together brings a greater reward for the team than pulling in opposite directions. The suggestions seem sound and based on a real working environment as opposed to some management books use such bizarre examples that you're sure the writer never really worked in an office. By it and cultivate your management skills.
