 Mr Lundquist had his work cut out for him in this biography of J.D. Salinger. Mr Salinger did not so-operate with this author and has refused publicity at all times. When "The Catcher in the Rye" came out in 1951, Mr Saliner escaped publicity by traveling to Europe. Mr Lundquist pieces together what is known about Mr Salinger's life along with his stories ("Franny and Zooey", "A Perfect Day for Bananafish" among them) as well as Salinger's only novel "The Catcher in the Rye". You learn about Mr Salinger's part in the D-Day invasion, his correspondence with Ernest Hemingway and how often suicide or suicidal tendencies come up in his work. I didn't know that Mr Salinger used his own experience at prep school in Holden Caulfield's life. Mr Lundquist also shows how Mr Salinger's religious beliefs, particularly about Zen Buddhism, underscore all his writing.  This is a very interesting book about J.D. Salinger, as it examines his life through his work and not just the typical "he was born on such and such a date, married So & So and had 3 kids..".  I won't claim I understand the man or his writings completely, but it definitely does give you insight into his personality. I recommend this book highly if you want to know more about the reclusive writer of "The Catcher in the Rye".
