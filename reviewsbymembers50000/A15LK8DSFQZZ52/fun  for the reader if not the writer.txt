 If you are a Dorothy Parker fan, this is a great book. It has the seiries of "I Hate...." poems, which is not collected anywhere else, as well as other gems Dottie deemed not worthy of being republished elsewhere. Mr Silverstein's excellent use of footnotes helps explain what was going on with Dottie when various poems were written. I have always admired Dorothy Parker but I definitely wouldn't want the pain and anguish of her life.  So if you are a Dorothy Parker fan, get this book for the lost poems so you can have a full collection of this underrated literay star. I recommend it highly.
