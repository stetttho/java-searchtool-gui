 This music manages to fit any and all the moods you may be in, like a hand in a glove. It lifts your spirits when you are down, it focuses your thoughts when they are fragmented and calms you down when you're agitated. You pick a mood, the match for it is in this music. That the performers were able to record such unusual music absolutely astonishes me. How can they know what part to emphasize to express the moods.  WHen the other reviewers state "there isn't words to describe" this cd, they are absolutely right. You have to_experience_ this cd, let the sound wash over your consciousness as the waves wash over the sand.  You have to totally immerse yourself in this music, allow it to take possesion of your mind to truly appreciate it.  But don't worry - even if you can only spare 10 minutes to listen to this, you will become a changed person. If you only listen to it on your commute to work, you will feel entirely differently about your commute.   I recommend this highly for those of you who want to expand your musical horizons.
