 This book is in the form of a years worth of crochet magazines. There are special items for all four seasons, as well as items such as wedding gowns and baby afghans that do not fit into any particular season.  Yes, there are some advertisements in it, but the ads are few and far between. What is important here is the wealth of crochet talent gathered to make this book great - such folks as Darlasims, Melissa   Leapman, Carol Alexander and Nancy Brown, just to name a few.  So if you'd like to have a chance to browse thru a whole year's worth of crochet patterns, this is the book for you. That way you might be spared that all nighter on Christmas Eve trying to finish up that one last gift.
