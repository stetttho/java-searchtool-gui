 I know, you're liberated, you're not going to do housework, you'll have a maid or you'll split the housework with the roommates or your honey. Why would you need a book about doing housework? And just how can a book called "Superwoman" help you tame the housework monster?** Does the author expect you to be able to handle housework, a job, kids and all that? Not without her help, she doesn't. And M's Conran covers many bases - a shopping list, cleaning tips, clothes maintenance. Some is a little dated (the microwave section, since this was published in 1979) but by and large, it's a marvelous help to decide whether you should sweep or dust first, how to find out in cantalopes are fresh and exactly what type of maintenance your house needs is not going to change much in the last almost 25 years. The instructions on buying food is definitely worth the price of admission. And M's Conran makes it a fun, enjoyable readwhich is good because housework generally isn't that much fun. I recommend this book to all people just starting out so you will have a reference book to help figure budgets, the best appliances and all that other stuff that comes from being on your own for the first time. Even "old timers" such as myself can learn a lot from this book. Buy it and become a Superwoman or a Superman. *Shirley Conran's motto **If you're born disorganized, I suggest you try "Sink Reflections" by Marla Cilley.
