 I have to admit, I enjoy the Goldy (Bear) Schulz character and especially like the recipes. Goldy is not facing off against a rival that has a backer with deep pockets. Her hubby gets suspended without pay, her kitchen, her source of livihood and sanity, is trashed. And than there are the murders. Read the book to find out how Goldy gets out of this one and what new culinary dishes she has come up with - if you like a murder mystery and cooking, you'll love this book (as well as the others in the seiries).
