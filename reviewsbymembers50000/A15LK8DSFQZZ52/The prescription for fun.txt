 This is a funny movie about the trials and tribulations of med students, struggling thru the British med school of the 50s. It's quite a culture shock to see how much has changed since the 50s (does anyone ever see the nurses in full uniform, complete with cap in hospitals anymore?). As opposed to recent medical shows, you won't learn much about medicine from this video but you will have lots of laughs. So take this prescription and pop it in your vcr and enjoy - cheaper than your health insurance payments;)
