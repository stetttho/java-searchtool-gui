 I _love_ this album so I was extremely happy to get it on cd. The transfer is greater, Joni Mitchell's clear pure voice floats beautifully over the speakers. I'm not a Joni Mitchell fan in that I know at what point in her life she was when this music was performed. It sounds to me as if she was a young woman, with some success, trying to figure out her way in the world. I always took "Free Man in Paris" to describe her reaction to her growing popularity (I've been told I was wrong, but so what - I've been wrong before). Her version of "Twisted" is so great, I was amazed - it sounds eerily similiar to the Lambert/Hendricks/Ross version, which is also terrific. And "Court and Spark" seems to be about the ambivalence of comitting yourself to a relationship, the cross between wanting it to work and being afraid it will consume you. At least that's my take on it and I think many would agree with me on this point. I'd advise getting this cd - Joni Mitchell has a beautiful voice that she uses well in what may be her best album ever. I'm not sure I want to say it is her best ever as she has other good stuff out there - but if you're just wondering about who she is and how she fits in the singer/songwriter world, this cd is a great place to start.  So buy it and enjoy it - even while you're pondering what she is saying.
