 This dvd contains the first "Prisoner" episode that sets up the whole seiries, so of course you got to see it to understand the whole seiries. Patrick McGoohan is a top secret agent - something has happened to change his mind about his job and he wants out. He resigns, but let's face it, a top secret agent isn't just going to retire to the South of Wales and tend his garden - or will he?  I'd love to have been a close friend of Patrick McGoohan's at the time this seiries was made just to know what was going thru his head - was it a political comment? Did he feel trapped by fame? I wonder that as I type the review, but it doesn't enter your mind when you're watching the show - you're just totally caught up in the moment. Patrick McGoohan shines as a man whose determination to be his own person is never daunted by the various obstacles put in his way - and formidable obstacles exist. Rover alone is enough to give you nightmares. Buy this dvd and the other ones and appreciate how truly great television was and might still be one day - and check out Mr McGoohan's car - it's a beauty and he made it from a kit!
