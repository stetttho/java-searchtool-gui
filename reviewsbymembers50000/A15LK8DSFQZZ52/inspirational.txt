 This book is probably better suited for more experienced crocheters as there are some stitches mentioned that son't seem to appear anyplace else. I do like this book to use as a starting point to go somewhere else with it. I ended up making my first "Mile A Minute" afghan based on a pattern that's in the book. No, the pattern wasn't for an afghan, but was easily adapted for it.  I recommend this book for more experienced crocheters.
