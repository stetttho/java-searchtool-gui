 People seem to feel one of 2 ways about Enya's music - they love it or they hate it. Maybe it's the "New Age" tag that makes folks feel that way or maybe it's too mellow for them. I  happen to love it as it speaks to me on some level I can't even explain - perhaps it's the Irish roots or the lushness of the music, but it communicates to me on a deeper level than most music. That being said, I'd advise if you are interested in Enya's music or are familiar with it, this is a great cd. No "greatest hits" is truly all the greatest, let's face it - there may be something in there you or I wouldn't have chosen. But this cd is a good representation of the dream like quality Enya weaves through out her music. This cd comes close to being a greatest hits for the time period covered.  So introduce yourself or a similiarly minded friend to Enya via this cd or get it for the Enya lover in your life - you'll really enjoy it.
