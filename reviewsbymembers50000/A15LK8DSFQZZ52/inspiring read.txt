 Reading M's Mayhall is like having a cup of tea with a close friend, She talks about her journeys along the spiritual path, the ups and downs of living a Christian life. She suggests various ways to incoporate religious beliefs in your everyday life.  The effect is_not_ preachy, but enlightening. M's Mayhall points out her own shortcomings along the way and that makes the book so much more interesting. I recomend this book for all those who want to get closer to a religious world view.
