 I'm not just talking about copying your butt and faxing it to people - this is real book that deals with making books, postoids and other forms of art (think DADA) and is a gret deal of fun. You're thinking "do what's the big deal - just toss the paper on there and let it rip". Slow down. Matisse - there is actually a system for getting better copies and using the copier to its full potential - and that's not copying the latest memo on the dress code. Copy art is introduced by Steve Ditlea, leading into the history of copy machines. This gives you the background of how a copier works, who invented it and how you can make it work for you.  The second sectionshows various artwork people have created using a copier. it's pretty cool, especially "Brooklyn Bridge" to see this artwork created using something as ordianry as a copier.  The third section deals with how to go about using the copier tp achieve your desired effect. Those of you who work with collage or altered books may be especially interested in this part. It's also a great book for the mail artist.  I recommend this book highly if you are the least bit interested in paper arts or similiar crafts just to show you what can be done with a plain old office copier.
