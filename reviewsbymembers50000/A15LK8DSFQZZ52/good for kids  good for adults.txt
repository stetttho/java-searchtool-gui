 Most kids don't think about pets or where they come from - if Disney's "101 Dalmatians" is re-released, they want a dalmatian. If they see "Beethoven", well it's got to be a Saint Bernard. Unfortunately, lots of animals adopted that way end up in the shelter when they don't adjust to their families or they are "too much work". This book shows how the animal welfare movement started and what goes on at an animal shelter. It shows how you can adopt a healthy pet for a low price and also the truth about what happens to older animals that aren't adopted. This book truly is "a voice for the animals". I recommend it highly for kids who like animals and their parents.
