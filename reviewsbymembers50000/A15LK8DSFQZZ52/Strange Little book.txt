 Interesting but definitely different, this book details Harvey Grosbeck's life and his relationship with God. It's _not_ a religious or even particularly spiritual book, so don't be afraid that you might not like it because of that. I recommend this book for those of you who are interested in trying something a bit different and not "mainstream".
