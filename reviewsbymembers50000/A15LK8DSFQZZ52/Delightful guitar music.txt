 Are you a fan of acoustic guitar? Or maybe acoustic guitar backed by an orchestra? If you are, this cd is for you. Carlos Barbosa-Lima weds his guitar to some old standards, bring lovely new sounds out of the familiar melodies. There are, of course, seven Beatles songs that are done with acoustic guitar and string orchestra. How they manage to breathe new life into "Yesterday" (which I believe is the _most_ recorded song_ever-) is amazing. It still has the yearning in the music but it's shaded by something a little different than the usual recordings of this song. I especially liked "Here, There & Everywhere", which might be my favorite Beatles song of all time. Here the guitar and string orchestra make the song vibrate anew with the wonderful feeling of love. But, you're saying, what about the other music? Is it good? Yes, it is, an excellent cd for a Sunday afternoon, sort of lounging around, drinking tea and maybe looking at the papers. I was very impressed with the rendering of George Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue". It's such a different sound than what you normally get from the piano work on this piece. It is a marvelous piece of work. If you like acoustic guitar music, you will really enjoy this cd. I recommend it highly for anytime you'd like to listen to something fresh yet familiar. You'll really enjoy this cd.
