 I am a great fan of Patrick McGoohan and particularly of this seiries. This seiries is not for the faint of heart - what happens when a top secret agent decides to retire? Does he just move to the English equivalent of Florida and grow roses? Would his employer even allow him to do such a thing? And of course, WHY did he resign? These issues are explored in this seiries and it's a paranoid surrealistic view of the answers. The shows are well written and self contained and Patrick McGoohan shines as the man who yells "I am not a number! I am a free man!"  I recommend this dvd highly, as well as the other dvds in this seiries.
