 I _know_ what does a 1969 book about sex education have any relevance in this new millenium, when, as the reports tell us, middle school kids are already having sexual encounters and college age kids have "buddy sex"? Believe it or not, because the mechanics of sex hasn't changed, the book has relevance. The book is in a question and answer format that may seem a little outdated, with legal abortion, morning after pills and the growing number of never married moms.  But the questions in 1969 are the same as in 2003 - "Why do boys say one thng in the dark and something else in the daylight?" is a question that has plaqued females since the beginning of time.  And her discussion of the use of condoms is probably one of the most intelligent ones I've ever heard. M's Burn does not talk down to her readers or sugarcoat the truth It's a neat little book, good (if you are a "Baby Boomer") to show your kids about how sex was handled when you were younger. Of course, it doesn'tcover AIDS or oral sex so you won't get a complete picture of sex in the new millenium. Still, I recommend it highly due to the easy to follow format and the nostalgia value.
