 Your heart beats faster, your palms are sweaty and you are hoping against hope that fine piece is what you expect it to be - could you be dreaming or is it that rare Delft saucer? How can you tell for sure that the Limoges cup you're holding is authentic or a cheap reproduction? If you are caught up in the world of porcelain coollecting, you know how hard it can be sometimes to verify that the piece you are looking at has some value. This book can help you verify your porcelain pursuits without the wallet breaking cost of taking them home. This book features various porcelain marks used at various times by the famous (and not so famous) porcelain makers of the time. It's small enough to tuck in a bag when you make your buying rounds so you can take it to the flea markets and antique shows and you can see at a quick glance if what you have your heart set on is really as the seller protrays it. I recommend this book highly to all porcelain collectors.
