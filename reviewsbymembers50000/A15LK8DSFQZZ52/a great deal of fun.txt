 This book is great if you're tired of the usual afghan and baby sweater patterns. The projects pictured are just _great_ and truly inspirational. That's the whole idea behind the free form crochet - to create a sculptural item.  I would recommend this book for more experienced crocheters for the projects and beginner crocheters to give them more information on how crochet can be adapted.
