 This strange little book also has a strange distinction - it is Thomas De Quincey's first important work and in the revised edition, his last important work. Mr De Quincey regarded himself as "the Pope" of the poppy and his work reflects the dreams he had while under the influence of opium. When the book first came out (1822), some reviewers thought it was Coleridge's work - Mr De Quincey had to prove he indeed wrote it. Despite the use of the word "Confessions" in th etitle, Mr De Quincey does not seem repentant or remorseful regarding his use of opium. In fact, Mr De Quincey believed that the use of opium released the "majestic intellect" of a person's mind, similiar to Dr Timothy Leary's view on LSD. Those of you who are interested in pharmacology or drug addiction would be well served by reading this book. Mr De Quincey felt that his opium eating was actually beneficial to him and judging by his articulate arguments, one wonders is he could have been right. Read it for yourself and see how this type of thing was handled in the nineteeth century.
