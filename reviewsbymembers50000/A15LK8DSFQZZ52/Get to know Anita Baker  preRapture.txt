 This wasn't her breakthru album, but it is very good. It took quite some time for this cd to be available and I was quite happy to get it. "Angel" is wonderful and it fits what other work you may have heard her sing. The other titles such as "Feel The Need" and "No More Tears" are also terrific. But M's Baker's voice is such that she can take a song that isn't so great ("Squeeze Me") work for her.  I advise buying this cd and getting to know Anita Baker from her pre "Rapture" days as it's definitely worth the effort.
