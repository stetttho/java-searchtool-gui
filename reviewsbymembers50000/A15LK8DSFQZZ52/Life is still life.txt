 This book shows a little of the effects of the changing world since the time it was written. But it is still well written and it's still funny. That's because though we have other things to worry about, some basic things stay the same. And maybe it's not stated in the current trend of the week, but life is still life and family is still family. So buy this book, read a bit and see if you don't laugh out loud over it. I'm betting you will.
