 First off, this book is written by Dorothy _Rodgers_, Richard Rogers' wife (yes, the composer). The book is about interior decorating and not about_ her_ life or_ his_life - though there are some anecdotes. It's not a childrens' book unless you know children who are already into tv shows such as "Trading Spaces" or "While You Were Out". THat being said, you might wonder what this book _is_ about - it's about Mrs Rodgers designs and dishes for her home. Mrs Rodgers was quite busy in her own right. She had her own interior design company called "Repairs, Inc" and she is also an inventor and holds several patents. So she is not just trading in on her husband's name, she actually knows about this stuff. Mrs Rodgers takes you thru various planning stages of redecorating your home. You see examples from her home as well as some of her friends' homes. She suggests using your own hobbies as focal points for decoration (needlepoint, crochet, gardening, that type of hobby) and shows you how to use these items to blend in with your home.  SHe also makes suggestions on entertaining in your home, how the shape of the table influences seating arrangements and gives instructions on how to seat your guests so nobody gets stuck with a bore. There are also quite a few recipes that Mrs ROdgers has served to her guests. Some leave me cold, but that bittersweet icing recipe is well worth the price of admission. If you want to see how the other half live, or maybe you are the other half and want to get some pointers, this is a great book to read - not only for the decorating tips but for the glimpse you get into Richard and Dorothy Rodgers' lives. I recommend this book highly.
