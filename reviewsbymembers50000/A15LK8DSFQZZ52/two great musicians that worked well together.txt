 Thad Jones was an advanced trumpeter/coronetist who was self taught. He played with Hank Jones (yes, his brother) and Sonny Stitt, charles Mingus and Count Basie - very impressive. Not only did he teach himself music well, he also became a talented arranger and composer, especially well known for his classic "A Child is Born", featured magnificently on this cd. Mel Lewis was a definitive big band drummer. He had worked with Stan Kenton and Dizzy Gillepsie as well as Benny Goodman.  In 1965, these two greats got together and formed their orchestra. This cd captures the excitement of these performances. There is the swinging "Big Dipper" which Thad Jones wrote and arranged. The beautifully melodic "The Groove Merchant" is also on this cd - Mr Jones didn't write that one, but he does a incredible job arranging it and playing it. This cd is a very good representation of the caliber of music that Thad Jones and Mel Lewis and their orchestra were producing. Treat your ears to some real jazz and buy this cd.
