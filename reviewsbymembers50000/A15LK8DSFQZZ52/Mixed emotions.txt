 With any "Best of" collection, there's always a question as to "is this _really_ the best of whatever group?" In this case, it is pretty much the best of - if they had left off a few of the newer songs. And the sound quality is good, some of the mixes do not seem to be the mixes that were hits in the US - maybe in the UK they were? And some seem sped up, most notably "Ruby Tuesday". The disc is not in chronological order, which I think I would have preferred so I could hear how the band progresses. Having said all that, I strongly advise any Rolling Stones fan to buy this cd and enjoy it - it's not perfect but it's as close to perfection as a general release can get. Obviously, everybody would have different picks for a few of the songs on the 2 cd set, but most folks would agree that most of these songs are the best of the Stones. That this rock band lasted 40 years - or any rock band for that matter  - and produced a fairly consistent sound and product is absolutely amazing.  ~/o I know it's only rock and roll but I_like_ it. ~/o
