 If you have people in your life (such as sisters, daughters, neices, granddaughters) that play with Barbie and you know how to crochet, you will find this book very helpful. I found some of the instructions a bit difficult, but most are fine. And you can always use this book as inspiration to make up your own clothes for Barbie. After all, Barbie doesn't always have to go with the crowd, does she? She sets her own fashion. I would have given this book a higher rating but the pattern difficulties interfere with that. However, I do recommend this book.
