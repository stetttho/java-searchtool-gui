 M's Van Pelt brings her considerable experience and knowledge to the writing of this book. At one time, african violets were the most popular indoor blooming plants.* This book came out during that first flush of popularity for violets. This book not only has beautiful color photos, but detailed black and white line drawings. M's Van Pelt explains everything from "boy" and "girl" foliage to how to grow and show violets. There are a few outdated comments - there are now some yellow african violets and the internet has made swapping leaves a much quicker process. But her methods of plant care are clear and concise, based on the plants needs as well as the folks living in the house. If you're interested in african violets, I recommend this book highly.
