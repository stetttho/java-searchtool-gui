 I read the first part of this set in 1963 and was enthralled with it. I waited (not so patiently) for the rest of the set to come out and was richly rewarded for my patience.  The first book sets the stage for the next three and introduces the characters of Meg, Charles Wallace and Calvin> Meg's father was working for the government and has been gone quite some time, leaving Meg and her family alone. Meg's mom keeps the home fires burning, but never lets on to the children her fears. Charles Wallace was just a baby when his father left, now he's in school. And then there's Meg - not cool like the other girls, not beautiful, too outspoken and smart to fit in her class, she worries that her father has died. Throw Calvin, a sort of popular boy from school into this mix and you got the makings of an adventure. (The twins show up in this book, but later they are showcased more.) Meg and company set out ot find her father, which turns out to be a lot harder than it looks - and it looks pretty darn hard! The other books continue the adventures of this group, as the characters age and other things come along to upset their world. The books are set up as a classic good versus evil, but it never feels preachy or didactic and you will be swept away in the current of the stories. I highly recommend this for girls as it shows a protagonist who isn't cool or popular and how she handles things - not so well at times. My sons loved it, too so I know other boys would like it. I reread it every few years as it seems there's something in there I need to read again or I learn something different. Obviously, in the beginning, I identified more with Meg, but now I see the parents' point of view, too. Buy this set for yourself or for somebody who needs to be a little challenged on their reading and thinking and enjoy it.
