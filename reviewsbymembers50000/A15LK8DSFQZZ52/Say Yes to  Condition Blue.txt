 The Jazz Butcher (Pat Fish) is at it again and he brought some friends along to help him out - Alex green on tenor and alto sax, Sumishta Brahm on vocal, Tim Burrell on piano, Paul Mulreany on drums among other players - and of course Jazz Butcher's vocals as well as keyboard and guitar.  "She's a Yo-Yo" is an amazing song, "Shirley Maclaine" is definitely worth the price of admission. And "Monkeyface" - well, you just got to hear it for yourself to believe it. I recommend you buy this cd- if you like Jazz Butcher and Jazz Butcher Conspiracy, you will enjoy this music.
