 This is an excellent book for the medical records tech/transcriptionist. The easy to use book helps you out when you can't remember if vertebrochondral should have an "r" behind the "t" or not (it shouldn't for all of you dying to know;)). I generally do not have a problem with spelling but it's very helpful to make sure I'm transcribing correctly. And it's a nice gift for any of your fellow co-workers who need a little help with spelling. I'd recommend this book to any person in the medical records/transcription field.
