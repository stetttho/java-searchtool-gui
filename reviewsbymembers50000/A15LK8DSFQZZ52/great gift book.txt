 This book features drawings by Beth van Hoesen and is a great gift when you want to send somebody more than a card. The drawings are well done, beautifully colored and pair up appropriately to a Walt Whitman poem, Her drawings of animals show more about the animals then mere photographs -  they seem to reach inside the animal's personality and display it for the  world to see. The rabbit on the cover is just the beginning of the  beautiful drawings. Buy many copies of this book, so you can send it to  friends and keep a copy for yourself.
