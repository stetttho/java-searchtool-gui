 Crocheting is having a fashion revival and this book helps show why. M's Weiss keeps the projects simple but interesting, easy enough for the beginners and something fast for the experienced crocheters. Want a new bag to take to the beach tomorrow? or how about a halter top? THis book shows you how to make these items and a lot more.  I recommend this book highly for the ease of the instructions as well as the diversity of the patterns.
