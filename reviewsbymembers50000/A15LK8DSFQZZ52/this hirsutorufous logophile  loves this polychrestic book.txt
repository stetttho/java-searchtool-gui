 Try putting that in a single's ad and see what kind of response you get! Mrs Byrnes has collected some of the most outrageous, unusual (for the most part) words you have ever read. This book is great for starting a party or an argument, writing up silly tests to send over the internet to your friends and winning items from radio shows. Radio shows in my area tend to ask questions such as "What is gephyrophobia?" so the listener can call in and win a prize. Sometimes the folks make up the answers ("Fear of a geography test?") but it's easy to win when you can look on page 83 and see it means "fear of crossing bridges".  This book is also helpful while playing Scrabble, especially if you play with a person who tends to come up with unusual words - if it's not in the Oxford and it's not in this book, it doesn't count for points in Scrabble.  So buy this book and entertain your friends, torment your co-workers and tease your fellow Scrabble players with bits of information gleaned from this excellent reference book. Your friends will think you're a renable renardinstead of a logastellus lout if you use this book properly. *redhaired word-lover
