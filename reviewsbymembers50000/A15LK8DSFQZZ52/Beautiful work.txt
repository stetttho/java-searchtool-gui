 This magazine features some of the best rubber stamp art work available. The pages are in full color, so you can see exactly what was produced. There are also instructions given so you can either duplicate the art or you can alter the techniques to create your own art. One of my favorite parts of the magazine is wherre they use one stamp in several different ways. This not only inspires creativity but helps cut down on the expense of rubberstamping. If you enjoy rubberstamping, this is a great magazine for you.
