 Dolly Parton has always had an amazing voice and this time she tackles some "golden oldies" and gives them her own special touch. You've probably heard all of these songs before, but DOlly's voice makes them brand new. If you like covers of songs or you're a fan of Dolly Parton, I recommend this album highly.
