 This movie is adapted from "The Once and Future King" by T.H. White.  And you probably know the story - boy becomes king, king is betrothed in an arranged marriage, Lancelot pops in....It is _nothing_ like the book but it does have its good points.  One is Richard Harris' over the top performance as King Arthur. He, much in the manner of Rex Harrison in "My Fair Lady", speaks his songs as opposed to singing them. Suprisingly, it actually works very well. It's not the "feel good movie" of all time, but it is a good one about flawed individuals - and it was said to be President John F. Kenndy's favorite Broadway play.  So if you're interested in seeing a movie that will make you think about great leaders' errors in judgement, along with the pagentry of court life, this is a movie for you. I recommend it highly.
