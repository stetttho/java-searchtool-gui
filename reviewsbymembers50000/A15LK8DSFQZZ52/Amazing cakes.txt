 I know, you're thinking "Of _course_ it has amazing cakes" and it does - there's the fruitcake recipe (don't groan - you've never had fruitcake like this one - it's not a store bought dry one, this is the _real_ thing) and the "Best Damn Lemon Cake" but also "Mom's Apple pie" and key lime pie as well. This woman is a wizard when it comes to food. And you can be, too - she gives explict easy to follow instructions for all the recipes, as well as stories behind certain recipes and suggestions as to ingredients. It couldn't be easier unless she baked it for you and yours - but I'm sure she's busy, so empower _yorself_ and learn how to bake this stuff - your family will think you are a deity (god or goddess, doesn't really matter, does it?).  So buy the book, pick a recipe and make it your signature dessert - you know, the one they always ask you to bring to the pot lucks and such. You;ll be glad you did.
