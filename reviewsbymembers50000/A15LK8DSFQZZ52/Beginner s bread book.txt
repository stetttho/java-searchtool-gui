 If you never made bread but are curious about it, this is the book to start with - the instructions are clear and concise, the recipes are brillant. The recipes come together quickly and never fail unless your leavening agent is stale.  I use this about once a week and it is easily adaptable to a bread machine (which wasn't even around when this book was written). It has the standard yeast breads - the refrigerator dinner roll recipe is a long time family favorite and garnered a marriage proposal for me - as well as various quick breads and sweet breads. Another favorite is the pumpkin bread - I would make that for my sons to take to school the day after they visited the pumpkin farm. Another great one is the banana bread - that won my husband's heart.  Buy this book. I won't guarantee you'll win somebody's heart or impress your kids' school mates with this book, but you wil have some great recipes to practice with - and who knows - it _might do that for you. And if it doesn't, well you still got a nice loaf of bread to eat.
