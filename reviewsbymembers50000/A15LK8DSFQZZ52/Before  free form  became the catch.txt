 this book existed. Motifs are made from various materials, from braided cord to thin wire. Stitches are explored for the fun of it and patterns are easily adaptable to whatever size you need. This book allows you to explore the creativity of crochet while teaching you about the art of crochet.  THe instructions are clear and concise, the photos are brillant and I recommend this book to anyone who wants a different perspective on crocheting.
