 It's amazing to think that all these items are woven from various yarns. The color photograpy is lovely and the projects great.  The book starts off with general information about weaving. It explains what a four shaft loom is as well as a table loom. M's Gourlat details how to make a warp and how to figure out for yourself how big a warp you need to make the article. Many patterns are given, but according to M's Gourlat, "it is impossible to list all the possible ways of threading the reed."   Yarns and their properties are also discussed in this book, so you can plan what type of yarn you need to make your project. The beaded shawl, the first project in the book is a visual delight. There are all sorts of projects - tunics, ponchos, dresses - even a lamp shade.  I wouldn't recommend this book to a brand new weaver, but I think an experienced weaver would get a lot of inspiration from this book. For that reason, I'd recommend it to more experienced weavers.
