 M's Molina has put together a fantastic book on the art of thread crochet bears. I don't even work with thread that much, but this book has me reconsidering that philosophy. The panda bear is just calling to me to be crocheted, as well as the polar bear.  M's Molina's instructions are clear and concise. The patterns get progressively more difficult, but you can stick to the "easy ones" and still be quite happy with the outcome.  I recommend this book highly to all who are interested in making teddy bears, especially thread teddy bears.
