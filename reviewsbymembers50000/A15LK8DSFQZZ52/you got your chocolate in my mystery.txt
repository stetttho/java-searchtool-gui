 M's Davidson scores again with another wonderful murder mystery / cookbook. Goldy has man problems  her usual exhusband Jerk problems of behaving in a threatening manner _and_two men courting her at the same time.  Goldy decides to become a live-in cook for a wealthy couple.  And of course, that's when all hell breaks loose. Who wants the shrink dead? Why is the exhusband scting so much like a jerk?  Why does Arch run away? And which man will she pick, Phillip or Tom? Who is Pierre? And does this book have the "Strawberry Super Pie" recipe?   I'll tell you "yes" to the last question (and it is_super_) but you have to read the book for the other answers. A great read and great recipes, I recommend this book highly.
