 Webb Wilder has been described as "Fess Parker on Thorazine". If that idea tickles your brain cells, that your ears will be tickled to hear this cd. This group is difficult to catagorize - the term that comes to mind is rockabilly, sort of Bill Haley and the Comets, but that doesn't quite fit the music. It's sort of Gerogia Satellites meets the Beatles. Though the music doesn't fit into a neatly defined catagory, it is a very good cd. "Tough It Out" is the standout to me, though "Meet Your New Landlord" and "Everyday (I Kick Myself)" are running a close second.  Buy this cd and  give your ears something new to listen to - they'll appreciate it and you will, too.
