 The "usual gang of idiots" gather to make this book another hilarious hit. "Mad" takes on "Alfred Hatchplot" movie that combines all the elements of Hitchcock's movies in one craxy parody. There are posters for movies I'd like to see, such as "The Invasion on the Jolly Green Giant". The bit about illuminated signs is definitely worth the price of admission. If you enjoyed "Mad" magazine in the past (this is from 1964), you will definitely like this book. I recommend it highly.
