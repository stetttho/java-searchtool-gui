 I had wondered what M's Stoller would add to the crocheter's world.  After all, she is best known for her books on knitting. Would the knitting bias show thru the writing?  Well, yes and no. After all, M's Stoller states she knits for 9 months out of the year and only crochets during the summer months. That seems a bit weird to me, but to each their own.  The short review is if you're learning to crochet and have a high tolerance for cutesy names and lots of pop culture references, this would be a good book for you. Adrienne Yan's illustrastions are perfect for showing you where the crochet hook should be in relationship to the yarn. Michael Lavine's photography captures the crocheted work in all its glory.
