 Kaffe Fassett has done it again.The master of color has 17 wonderful projects for knitting as well as needlepoint and you just can't help but be inspired by this book. The yarns used in this great rainbow of projects are Rowan's, but you can substitute other yarns and achieve your own effects - make it to match your sofa or perhaps your love's green eyes.   The photography is by Steve Lovi, who lovingly captures all the nuances and subtle colors in Mr Fassett's work. (Mr Lovi has worked on other books with Mr Fassett.) The "Persian Poppy Waistcoat" is terrific, the "stars and diamonds" seiries of sweaters have to be seen to be believed and the needlepoint is out of this world amazing. The instructions are concise and clear.  This is not a book for a beginning knitter, but if you're looking to jump start your knitting, maybe make a truly glorious sweater for yourself or a loved one, this book is the place to start. I recommend this book highly.
