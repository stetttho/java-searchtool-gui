 This isn't the perfect crochet book as there are items that instruct you to add knitting to (ribbing on sweaters) - but if you figured out the pattern of the sweater, I have faith you'll certainly be able to crochet a rib stitch (hint - it's easy - single crochet in the back first row, the front the second row, attach using a slip stitch to the article you're attaching it to). But this book is more for inspiration - the colors and photographs are lovely, it shows you more about crochet and how it can be manipulated than most crochet books. Crochetrs complain kniiters get all the good patterns and while that may seem true, it isn't in this book. You have to have the necessary perserverance to see the item come to fruition and it's not easy to do that. Even if you don't follow the patterns exactly or just use the book as a springboard for your own items, you'll really see the use of it. But if you see it thru, your rewards will be great - and when somebody asks, "Oh did you knit that?" you can say proudly "No, I _crocheted_it."  And when they say "Oh, can you make me one, too?" - well that's for you to decide.
