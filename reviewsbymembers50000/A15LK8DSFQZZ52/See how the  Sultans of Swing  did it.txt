 This is an amazing video - where else can you see Count Basie doing "One O'Clock Jump"? You know this wonderful stuff isn't shown on tv anywhere, all you see is little snippets of it on compilation type shows. And where else can you see the fabulous Louis Prima belt out "That Old Black Magic"? It's an amazing performance. These two performances alone are worth watching this tape for - but there's also Jimmy Dorsey, Tex Beneke and Stan Kenton, along with a few others.  If you want to see how the masters od swing, the "Sultans of Swing" as it were, performed this music, get this viseo and watch it. I guarantee your spirits will be uplifted and your toes will be tapping - a wonderful way to spend 50 minutes and cheaper than a psychiatrist;)
