 This book is not for the weak of stomach or heart. It is the true account of the man who inspired Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho"  _and_ Tobe Hooper's "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre". The book is written by the judge of the trial and contains transcripts of the trial.  It is a well written book but it is extremely disturbing to realize this was a real person, a man who was regarded as "the quiet type" before his horrible crimes were discovered. If you are interested in true, bizarre crimes, this is an excellent book. My advice is to make sure you have some lighter reading before your bedtime or you could very well have nightmares  from this book. I know I _did_ and I don't consider myself as one who frightens easily. But the sheer catalog of atrocities, done by a real person on real people is truly disturbing.
