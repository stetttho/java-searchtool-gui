 Are you tired of "Mary Worth"? Find that "Dilbert" just doesn't seem so cutting edge anymore? "Zippy the Pinhead" is not hitting it for you anymore?  And let's not even discuss "Doonesbury"! Than _this_ is the book for you - Sam Hurt takes you into his surrealistic world, lawyers in love, monsters, friends and lovers and other strange things. The drawing is sort of reminiscent of James Thurber, but more detailed. I recommend highly that you buy this book and any other "Eyebeam" books you can get your hands on - it's well worth the effort.
