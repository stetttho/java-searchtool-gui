 But I think this is my favorite Enya cd currently - from the haunting opening track "A Day Without Rain" to the closing sunshine drenched "Lazy Days", this seems to be all of one piece, carefully considered and put together for the mazimum effect. If you're not familiar with Enya, I recommend you start with this cd or her greatest hits cd. If you weren't too hot on her previous cd (some folks weren't), you'll find this one invigorating. Buy this and enjoy.
