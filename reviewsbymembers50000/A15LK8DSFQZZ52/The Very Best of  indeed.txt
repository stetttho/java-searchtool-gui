 It's a great cd to own even if you already have the original issue of it. The addition of the new songs gives a greater span to view Sting and the Police's music and gives the listener a chance to see how far Sting has strayed from his original music yet how close he has stayed to that reality. Phrases such as "must buy" are often overused, but I do believe it fits this cd.
