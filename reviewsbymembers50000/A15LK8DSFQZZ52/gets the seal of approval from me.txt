 I have the 1963 edition of this book. It was given to me by a family friend, but it was already "old" when I got it (in 1973). Yhe recipes are good basic recipes for somebody just learning how to cook. I especially liked "Bert's Brioche" and find I refer to that recipe frequently.  There is information on the definition of various food ingredients, such as heavy cream, light creamas well as "instant powdered cream" which I have never heard of or seen. Various leavening agents are defined, as well as various types of flour.  This is quite a find for those of you who like to cook, who might be looking for Grandma's spice cake recipe or perhaps Mom's dinner rolls. I do feel I have to comment that though my copy is 43 years old, the book is well put togehter and I don't have any loose pages falling out. Not quite sure what happened to the other reviewer's book, but this one has stood the test of time better than some of my more recently published cookbooks.  Buy it, you'll like it.
