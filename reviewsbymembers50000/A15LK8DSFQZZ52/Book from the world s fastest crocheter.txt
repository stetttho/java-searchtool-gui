 Yes, according to the Guiness people at the Caroline Rhea show, Lily Chin is the world's fastest crocheter. Not only that, she is a talented knit and crochet designer. This book shakes up the notion of what crocheted items look like - yes, we crocheters know it isn't all those granny square pochos in forest green and harvest gold, but the world doesn't know that yet. M's Chin's designs for afghans and wearables are very interesting and look quite elegant. This is not, however, for raw beginners although the instructions are clear and precise. This is for crocheters who want to stretch their talent in a different way and do not have to worry about exactly how the stitches turn out. This is a good book for somebody who has some experience crocheting so they can see what is possible to do with the art of crochet. Crochet has never gotten the respect knitting gets and I believe this items in this book will help people see crocheting in a new way. So until that day, nake an item (or three) from this book and be prepared to explain "No, it's crocheted" to the unknowing. You'll enjoy the book and the projects and spreading the word that crochet is cool.
