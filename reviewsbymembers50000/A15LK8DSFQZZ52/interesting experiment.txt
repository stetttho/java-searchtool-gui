 This is a strange book - it is a very long narrative poem, some of which is based on "Lavina" by George Sand. It is a familiar love story - falling in love and losing love has been told in tales forever. But not in poetry such as this. It's an interesting read, just to see how the writer manages to make a poem of this length flow together into a story.  I recommend it highly.
