 Okay, I didn't cry except when I was laughing hard -and I wasn't particularly inspired, but it's still a good read. Some of the stuff is so off the wall - yet it's vaguely reminescent of folks I know. Jack Handey is up to his old tricks, inspiring the masses with his strange twists and if you liked his other books, you'll like this one.
