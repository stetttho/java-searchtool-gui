 Tired of the cards at the mall stores that never have the right image or the right greeting? Do you want a simple yet beautiful way of expressing your feelings? Or maybe you're just tired of the mass production of various holiday cards - if so, this book is for you. You don't have to be "crafty" but it does give you a slight edge in making the cards. Gillian Souter provides clear, concise instructions on how to make various cards from making the paper (not necessary but an interesting sideline) to cutwork to paper sculpture> There's rubber stamping and decoupage as well as needlepoint included. Don't let that scare you off - with the directions clearly spelling out what you need and how to proceed, you'll be making beautiful individualized cards in no time. You don't have to stick with the patterns - for instance, the satin tulips are beautiful, but with the information provided, you could make other flowers.  I recommend this book highly for those who want to show their individuality by producing a card that will be displayed and praised for years to come.
