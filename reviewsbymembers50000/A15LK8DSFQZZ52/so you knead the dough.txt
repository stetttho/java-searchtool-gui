 It's a bad pun, I know and it only works if you read it out loud, but so I'm a bit silly.. This is a very good book about baking breads and making it easier on yourself. The recipes are clear and concise and if you bake, you probably have most of the supplies you need already. M's Hunt gives a history of bread, gives some good tips on bread making and how to fix your mistakes. THen she moves on to the recipes and they are a lot easier than a lot of the bread books out there. She gives a definition of the various ingredients and the measurements, so you know exactly what she means when she says "flour" or sugar.  The illustrations also help you know what is to be done. The recipes are great - I like the sweet dough recipe with the variations (especially the turnovers, yum). The stollen is much easier to create using this book than some of the other books I have on bread making. I easn't too thrilled with the cornbread recipe, but she states up front it is "Yankee or Northern" cornbread and I am used to the other kind. If you'd like to try your hands at baking, this book would be a good place to start. M's Hunt offers a lot of encouragement and common sense advice to novices as well as long time bakers. I recommend this book highly.
