 Of course, the "hometown boy" is Baltimore's own Barry Levinson, director of such Baltimore movies as "Diner" and "Tin Men" and though Baltimore does not play any part in this movie, this film is great. Joe (Bruce Willis) is working on anger management. Terry (Billy Bob Thornton) carries around his own Merck Manual to self diagnose his various ailments. Kate (Cate Blanchett) is stuck with an unfeeling fish of a husband and sings Bonnie Tyler songs. This improbable trio come together to make this film terrific. There is no false note, no wasted scene, no gratutious camera mugging - it all flows together to make a wonderful trip. Joe and Terry become the "Sleepover Bandits", as their modus operandi is to basically take the bank manager's family as hostage the night before the heist. By using that method, they can rob the bank without worrying about police or gung-ho security guards. Along the way, Kate hits Terry with her car and winds up taking him back to the robbers' headquarters. She decided she doesn't want to go back home and goes on the run with the bandits. Somehow along the way she falls in love with both Terry and Joe. But there's a big problem - now the bandits are seen as kidnappers and the police are looking for them. They decide to try a different approach for a robbery, one in which they stick up the bank in the more traditional manner. Since they both love the same woman _and_ they are not using their tried and true pattern, many things go wrong... and if you want to know more, get the video - it's an excellent film you will really enjoy.
