 First off, there's more than four wonderful jazz musicians on this cd - there's a total of six - Al Cohn, Zoot Sims, Herbie Steward, Serge Chaloff, Elliott Lawrence, Burgher "Buddy" Jones and Don Lamond. And no, they're not brothers.  Now that's cleared up, on to the review. This is an amazing cd that captures "The Four Brothers" wonderful sound. This was recorded on February 11, 1957 in basically one take. The give and take of the musicians, the friendship all comes through in the music. And what music it is - there is, of course, "Four and One Moore" written by Gerry Mulligan, where everybody gets to strut their stuff.  When you listen to "So Blue", you can almost see the sad man sitting at the bar, wondering how to get his love back. "The Swinging Door" will remind you that these very talented musicians worked with some of the best big bands of all time - Woody Herman, Artie Shaw and Benny Goodman. "Four In The Hand" written by Manny Albam showcases the marvelous interplay between the saxophones. "A Quick One", according to the liner notes, was done "just for kicks" shines with lighthearted joy. "Four Brothers" is an old favorite of mine and they do a stupendous job with it, breathing new life into this jazz standard. All the rest of the music - "Ten Years Later", "The Pretty One", "Aged in Wood" is as solid and great as the music preceding it. So if you want to hear real jazz, made by real jazz musicians, I recommend this cd highly. A perfect cd for a Sunday afternoon or even in your car driving to work on Monday. Who knows, it might even chase away those Monday blues, it's _that_ good.
