 This is the story of "Sandy" Rogers, one of Roy Rogers' and Dale Rogers' adopted childen. Roy and Dal (I feel I know them after seeing them on tv forever) had a family made up of birth children as well as adopted children. they adopted Sandy when he was 5 years old and he had already been subjected to malnutrition and ricketts.  The story is interspersed with the story of the Rogers visiting Viet Nam to do a show there. One part will tell you a bit of Sandy's past, his desire to be a soldier and the other will tell you what Dale was thinking or doing during that time period.  Sandy had a few lingering physical as well as developmental handicaps lingering from his pre-Rogers life. He wasn't the best stufent and really wanted to be a soldier. The Rogers agreed to sign the papers, figuring he would never be able to get in the Army, if the Army knew his history. Sandy's desire to be in the Army was so strong he just omitted certain things on his application. He worked very hard but was not chosen to go to Viet Nam - it was felt his reflexes were too slow to respond in that type of environment. If you ever wonder how a woman could survive losing _3_ children and still manage to stay sane, this is a good book for you. It's inspirational and probably not for folks who would object to talk of religion, but it is a good book. I recommend it highly.
