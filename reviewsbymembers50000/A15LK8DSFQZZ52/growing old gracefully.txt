 I think, despite the naysayers, this is one of Sting's best album's _ever_. Even if you don't agree with his politics on "This War", it should at least give you something to think about and ponder. I have listened to this cd every day since it was given to me. I listen to the _entire_ cd,which for me is very unusual - I will usually pick and choose what I like better - yes, even on a Sting cd. I don't feel there is a weak song in the whole cd, which is not how I have felt about some of his more recent cds. If you're looking for the shrieking punk of "Roxanne" or the simplicity of "Fragile", this is _not_ the cd for you. The music is lush and textured, sort of a tactile sensation for your ears. I recommend this cd highly.
