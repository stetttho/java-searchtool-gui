 I had heard rumors about certain actors and actresses all my life - who hasn't - that So & So was gay/lesbian/whatever. This book discusses some of these aspects of Hollywood life as well as the various films regarding homosexuality.  There's some films I never thought had anything to do with homosexuality - for instance, the Rita Hayworth film "Gilda". I never realized the male leads played the part as if they were gay lovers. It makes total sense once it's pointed out, but I have to admit I didn't see that aspect before. Much information is provided regarding various actors' sexual preferences, even detailing Judy Garland's unfortunate picks of husbands (one was having an affair with Liza's husband - that's something for Jerry Springer!).  Most of the information is not sensationalized, however, and makes for a very good read. Much of Hollywood's past, a homosexual was forced to marry to cover up his/her sexuality. Careers would (and did) crumble if a whiff of homosexuality surrounded a star. The people who had to deal with living this lie are names and discussed, but not in a "National Enquirer" way. Their personal lives as well as their professional lives are skillfully interwoven to give you a complete picture of the person. Mr Braun treats his subjects with the respect they deserve. If you want to see how much gays and lesbians influenced the movies, this book is a great place to start. I never realized there were so many actors and actresses that were in the closet and I never realized so many films had a gay subtext. I will be looking at the movies a little differently now, thanks to Mr Braun.
