 I got this book on a whim and I was quite pleasantly surprised by the power of Mr Marquez's writing. I never read any of his work before and was not sure of what to expect. I was drawn into the story immediately, from the very first paragraph. It is a very powerful, moving book that has much to offer the eager reader.  I highly recommend this book.
