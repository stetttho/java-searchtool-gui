 to enjoy this film. If you have a big noisy family or you married into a big, noisy family, you will feel right at home in this film. Toula Portokalos (Nia Vandalos)is a failure at 30 because she hasn't met her family's goals - to mary a Greek man and produce Greek children. She works at her family's restaurant, the "Dancing Zorbas" as a "hostess". She wears thick glasses, dull clothes and her hair is unkempt. In walks Ian Miller (John Corbett) and her whole attitude changes. She works hard on her mom to allow her to change jobs and got to night school to work inher aunt's travel agency. Along the way, she acquires contact lenses, a new wardrobe and a new hairdo. But the outside transformation doesn't begin to match the inside one - she is determined to meet and date Ian. The transformation is credible - she doesn't start off looking like the "Incredible Hulk" and wind up looking like "Wonder Woman". She and Ian begin to date. Ian realizes she is the restaurants hostess and the scene is played credibly. Somehow Ian runs the gauntlet of meeting the parents and trying to obtain approval. Toula for her part meets Ian's parents - quiet and reserved, they are so totally different than her family it's a wonder she doesn't faint from the shock.  Somehow or another, despite Toula's dad's disapproval, they manage to pull the wedding off and it's believable and wonderful.  I recommend this movie highly, not just a "chick flick" my two adult sons and my husband also enjoyed the film. And take a look at Nia Vardalos' real life hubby, the one that inspired this tale - he's Ian's buddy in the coffee shop.
