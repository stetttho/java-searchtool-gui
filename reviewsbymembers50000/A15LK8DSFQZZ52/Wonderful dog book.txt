 This is a very cute book about a beloved Scottish terrier, Tammie. Tammie does not take well to being left out of the family's adventures, so he tags along whenever possible. The illustrations are quite charming, with Tammie winning your heart when he looks sad at being sent back home. This book was first published in 1935, so that age is preserved in the illustrations.  This is a good read along book, especially the tag line which children will come to expect. It's a warm comforting story from another time when the world seemed much smaller and gentler. I advise this book for anyone who likes Scotty dogs (and _who_ doesn't?) or those with children still young enough to want a bedtime story read by an adult.
