 THis is an extremely cool little cookbook not only for the recipes but for the look of it. It is printed on what appears to be brown rice paper, which gives it a wonderful feel as well as a great look. There are black ink illustrations and the recipes are printed in red ink - quite a different look for a cookbook. But you're saying, "So it _looks_cool - what about the recipes?" The answer is they are great if you're into Japanese cooking. There's Japanese meatballs (niku dango) that would be very easy to put together from what you probably already have in your kitchen. There is eel bowl (unagi donburi) which you probably don't have all the ingredients on hand. THere is also a wide range of recipes that span the simple to the much more complex and unusual (for Americans) ingredients. The recipes are clear and concise, explaining how to accomplish the recipe. THere's an introduction, explaining various aspects of Japanese cooking and assuring the reader that you don't have to be "The Iron Chef" to cook tasty Japanese foods. You may have to look around to find the right ingredients and spices for some of  these recipes.  I recommend this book highly if you want to expand your cooking skills and add new culinary delights to your table. Maybe you could even open up a restaurant that shows how good Japanese "peasant coking" can be.
