 I'm so happy this movie finally made it to dvd. I know it was because of the renewed interest due to the Broadway play, but it works for me. Zero Mostel, of course, is Max Bialystock, a down on his luck Broadway producer who is reduced to seducing little old ladies and having them invest in his play. Gene Wilder is Leo Bloom, an accountant who discovers the scheme that sets the whole movie in motion - more money can be made from a flop Broadway play than a hit. Bialystock considers it briefly and decides to act upon this newfound knowledge by convincing Bloom to join in on the scam by promising retirement to Rio. They decide to find the worst play, worst actors and worst director to make this scam pay off for them. And it looks like it could work - who _could_ like a play about Adolph Hitler complete with music and huge dance mumbers with showgirls dressed as Stormtroopers? Mostel plays a wonderful part - he was a great actor - and he is a joy to watch as he romances the old ladies. WIlder plays neurotic very well and is hilarious to watch, especially the "I'm wet, I'm in pain and I'm still hysterical" bit. Kenneth Mars (look for him on "Malcolm in the Middle" as Francis' boss at the "dude ranch") is terrific as the old Nazi pining for Hitler and ranting about Churchill. Lee Meridith as Ula is especially memorable - and if you want to see how well she aged, check the additional features section. This movie is funny from beginning to end. This is one of Mel Brooks' best movies and I recommend it highly on dvd. The colors are bright and clear, the sound is great and the additional features make this a worthwhile investment for any Mel Brooks fans or somebody just wondering about Mel Brooks' movies.
