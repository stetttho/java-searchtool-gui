 Tired of cooking the same old thing for dinner each night? Or maybe you're meeting friends from more exotic places and want to expand your cooking skills? Maybe some friend you met over the Internet are stopping by and you want to impress them with your knowledge of foreign cusine?  Then this is the book for you! There's recipes from countries from Afghanistan (Ashaks and rice pudding - yum!) to Yugoslavia (Apple cream and Slovenian plum pie - double yum!) and all points inbetween. There are expanded recipes if you're doing a buffet style dinner or having a lot of guests. The recipes are clear and concise plus you won't have to hunt every exotic food store in your city to obtain the ingredients. Some recipes just do not sound too good - the herring salad (from Finland) or the fish souffle (from Iceland)just does not make my mouth water. But there are more than enough recipes to make up for it. Ever had fried green tomatoes? There's a recipe for fried green peppers in this book. Banana pudding, which I thought my mom made up, is in here - from Nepal. there's arecipe for Swedish rye bread which is quite good. So if you're tired of racking your brains for what to cook, this book offers a lot of delicious options. Give it a try!
