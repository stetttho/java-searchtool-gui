 Do you like "Blazing Saddles" or "Men in Tights"?  How about "Monty Python and the Holy Grail"? if you like that humor, you'll live this video. This is a take off of the Dirty Harry movies, if Clint Eastwood was played by a complete psychotic gun nut that sleeps with his Magnum. Sledge, the main character/cop is played to the hilt and no group is safe from being insulted by this staggering mass of testosterone. And it is a hoot! Thankfully they have a long suffering boss and partner for Hammer to play off of, which only leads to more hilarious situations. If you enjoy Python or Mel Brooks, you'll love this video.
