 This loving biography is written by Jack Benny's widow, Mary Livingstone Benny, her brother and Macia Borie. Reading this biography takes you back to a much simpler time, when you could listen to the radio without hearing shock jocks and stupid promotions every 10 seconds. It's also a love story, one that is made sweeter by the lasting quality of it compared to the current crop of celebrities that are out now (Nicolas Cage and Lisa Marie Presley splitting after less than 4 months of marriage - who even has the thank you notes finished by then?). If you enjoyed Jack Benny on radio or tv, get this book and get an intimate portrait of this wonderfully funny man.
