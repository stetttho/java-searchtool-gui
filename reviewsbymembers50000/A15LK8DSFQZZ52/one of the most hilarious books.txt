 Take Carl Reiner, add Mel Brooks, stir and simmer with the added flavoring of the 2000 year old man comedy routine, and what do you get? One of the funniest books you will ever read! I laughed out loud at least once on every page, from page XV til the end. This book is especially welcome in this year of record snows, rising gas prices and impending war. Buy this book if you want to laugh.
