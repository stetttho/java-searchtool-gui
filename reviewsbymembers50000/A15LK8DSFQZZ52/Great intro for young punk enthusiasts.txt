 So you want to know what punk is all about? Or maybe you've sampled a few punk posers (I won't name names, you _know_ who they are) and you really want to give your ears some sort of aural ectasy - this cd, my punkster friend, is for you. First you have David Barbe, ues, _the_ David Barbe of Sugar. He is cofounder of this high octane group as well as the songwriter, singer and bassist for the group. That's _not_ enough? Try listening to "Eula Geary Is Dead" and tell me that's not enough! You also have Andrew Donaldson on guitar and Harry Joiner and Joel Suttles on drums. That this group isn't more widely appreciated is one of the great mysteries of life to me. If you're in to punk, you owe it to yourself to listen to this cd. You will find out what punk really means and how it sounds when it's played by musicians who know what they are doing and not just playing punk for the publicity. This cd wraps up Mercyland's music neatly in a well produced ear enjoyment of music.  Buy it and listen to it faithfully!
