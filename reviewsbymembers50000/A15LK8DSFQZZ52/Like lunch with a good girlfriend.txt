 This funny book is like a lunch with a good girlfriend. M's Simpson writes about her family and life back when tvs were black and white and don't even _think_ about cable. I especially liked her discussion of sex ed during that time period. Apparently, her father was from the same school of philosophy regarding unwed pregnancy - "Get in trouble" (and we knew that "trouble" meant being pregnant) "and you will die." That was a _very_ effective birth control device at the time. The other part I especially liked was her story about having 2 sons. She talks about getting to know the emergency room folks on a first name basis and I definitely understand that experience. I recommend this book highly - it's like a visit from your funny girlfriend, the one who went to school with you, knew your parents, that one that you only hear from once in a while. It's good to catch up with an old friend and have some laughs.
