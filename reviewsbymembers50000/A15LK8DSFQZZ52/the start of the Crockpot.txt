 This book was published in 1975, old and outdated - WRONG! This book helped start the Crockpot revolution - from recipes sweet (cheesecake) to savory (pepper steak), this book helps the cook use a crockpot without the "Crockpot helpers" or the frozen dinners currently advertised.You can make the "Honey Ribs and Rice" or the "Wild Rice Casserole" or any number of good things they have in the book.   So if the current craze for Crockpot cooking has you wanting to experiment, try this book first. Once you start using your Crockpot, you won't know how you managed to get supper together without it.
