 Why would I want to do that? I had thought about and even dreamt about buying a bread machine for quite some time. I had done some research - consumer report kind of thing but mostly word of mouth. Almost everybody kept saying this is the machine to buy if you were serious about making bread. And everybody that told me that was _right_. I make bread probably 2-3 times a week in it and it never fails unless _I_ mess up (which occasionally I have done). Even if you don't want to finish baking your bread in it, it is absolutely wonderful for making bread doughs. It is bizarre to believe, but the dough rises higher if made by the bread machine than made by a standard mixer. I know, I didn't believe it either, but I did a few tests of the same recipe at the same time using the same ingredients (flour and yeast from same package, for example).  I've never had a problem with the bread sticking, once in a while the bread paddle is hard to get out, but it's not a big deal.  So even if you think you wouldn't use a bread machine becuase you got a heavy duty mixer or whatever, give this a try. I'd advise purchasing a bread machine book with it - perhaps "The Ultimate Bread Machine Cookbook" by Tom Lacalmita - to help you get started but it's very easy to adapt your current recipes to this bread machine. The smell of freshly baked bread is intoxicating and with this fantastic machine, you can wake up to it every day.
