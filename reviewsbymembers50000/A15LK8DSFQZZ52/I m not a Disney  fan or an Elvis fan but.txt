 I thought this was a great film. Lilo is a lonely Hawaian girl, who feeds peanut butter sandwiches to fish, bites and fights another girl and makes friends with experiment 626, a being that is made only for destruction by a "mad genius" on another planet. Experiment 626, of course, is Stitch, who manages to pass himself off as a dog so Lilo and her sister/caretaker Nani, can adopt him. As if adopting an alien destructive force isn't bad enough, Nani must also deal with the social worker that is trying to assure that Lilo is being well take care of by Nani. (The parents have died before the movie starts, so kids are spared that part of the film.) Aliens are dispatched from Turo to get Stitch back. Mr Bubbles, the social worker, is closing in on Nani, determined to remove Lilo from the home - if the aliens don't get her first. How this plays out and how it is all resolved is a lot of fun to watch, with very little of the terror that sometimes comes along with a Disney movie. (Remember Bambi's mom? I _still_do.) The dvd has some nice extra features, some deleted scenes, some talks with the creator of the characters (Chris Sanders), how to hula and Wynonna doing an amazing job of singing Elvis (among other things).  This, in my opinion, is one of the best Disney films of all time. I'd advise buying this movie especially if you have a little one at home or you like animation.
