 This is a wonderful addition to your dvd library if you love "The Lord of The Rings" - you've read the books and yes the movie doesn't follow it _exactly_ it's still the best adaptation so far and most likely will ever be. There are some great features this has and the special effects are impressive. It's absolutely fascinating to see how Elijah Woods plays his part so well. And Liv Tyler is great. It seems this cast is perfectly suited for this movie. Frodo lives.
