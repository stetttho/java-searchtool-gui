 This strange little cd has many different kinds of music on it - there's a full orchestral verion with, of course Pachelbel's "Canon" providing the motif throught out the whole cd. There's ambient trance-dance to Pachelbel's "Canon". The "Waikiki Pachelbel" is worth the price of admission alone.  You don't even have to like surf music to enjoy this cd - it's doesn't sound anything like surf music you've ever heard. Get this cd and hang ten with Pachelbel!
