 I happen to like the "Deep Thoughts" seiries, so of course I like this one. Jack's way of turning a situation into a psychobabble feel good statement is hilarious and the pairing of the nature photographs reminds me of those dumb motivational posters at work - you know, the one where it's a photograph of an eagle flying over a canyon and it says something such as "Strive with all your being to fly as the eagle does fly and makes more widgets for our company to make huge profits from" or some nonsense like that. (Okay, the signs _don't_ say the widget thing.)  It's vaguely comforting to read this book, to know that Jack's still out there (in more ways than one!) pondering his "deep thoughts" and sharing them with us. If you enjoyed the other books, you'll want this book.
