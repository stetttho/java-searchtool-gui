 This guide ot snowmobiling is geared for the younger crowd, but it's still a good introduction to using a snowmobile responsibly. As you can probably guess, the man who made the first commercially available snowmobile, Carl Eliason, lived in Wisconsin. It took a Canadian, Joseph-Armand Bombardier. to make the first snowmobile for recreational use.  This book gives information how the various parts of the snowmobile work and the skills you need to drive it responsibly.  There are many safety tips, such as preventing frostbite, as well as a granola recipe for you to make and take with you. If you are planning to purchase a snowmobile and will be having a young person using it, I recommend this book highly.
