 This is _not_ the usual type of Christmas music you will hear over the radio as the holiday approaches. Speaking strictly for me, if I never heard "Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer" again in my life, it would be too soon. So I thought I'd try out "The Three Tenors" and see what their Christmas album had to offer. There are some problems with the music - Pavorotti seems to have some difficulty with English, but on the whole I did enjoy this album - and I'm not a fan of "The Three Tenors". I would have picked some other music for them to do - the  John Lennon composition "Happy Christmas / War is Over" doesn't seem to work wel in this particular format, but it's entirely possible that I am too used to the Lennon/Ono performance. So try something new for the Christmas season and listen to this cd. It has some very good cuts, especially "Felice Navidad".
