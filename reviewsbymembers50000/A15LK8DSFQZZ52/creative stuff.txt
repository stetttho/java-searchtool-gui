 M's Crane is best known for her amazing one of a kind teddy bears and she brings that expertise into this book. Some projects you've seen many times before, such as the heart shaped pillows. Others, such as the button cards, are fresh and inspiring.  There are many innovative purses to be made, just to match a special outfit or just for the fun of it, The lovely pin cushion jewelry box would make a wonderful gift for anybody, but I think a young woman would especially appreciate it - maybe with a special piece of jewelry in it?  This book is good for using up your scraps of stash or for turning that small treasure of fabric you just _had_ to have, (knowing full well it was too small to do anything with) into a wonderful display piece. I recommend the book highly.
