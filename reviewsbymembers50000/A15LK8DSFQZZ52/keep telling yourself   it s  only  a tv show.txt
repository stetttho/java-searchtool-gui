 Office politics seem to be the same on either side of the pond. There's always somebody pining for somebody else, always a brown noser, always a boss that seems not to know what the boundaries are with his/her employees. And it's not so funny to watch your own company go thru a downsizing, but it is enjoyable here. This is done in the style of a reality type show. You get to see Tim pining after Dawn, who seems on some level to be encouraging him. You see Tim play practical jokes on Gareth, who seems to _need_ practical jokes played on him. And David Brent, ah, what a piece of work he is.  Whatever you have done, he has done better and been more successive. He is the "buddy boss" - the kind who pretends to be concerned about you but is really just looking for an audience. And the kind that would pat you on the back looking for a soft place to stick the knife. Be aware this show is similiar to spending the day in a dysfunctional office. It's funny in the way "Dilbert" is funny until you recognize pieces of your worklife on the screen or in the funny pages. As my family watched, we would point out  situations and say "hey remember Ron at the UltraMegaOmniGlobal* place..." and we'd laugh - partially because we don't work there anymore. I recommend this seiries highly - but remember, it's _just- a tv show - it's not you who are stuck in that particular realm of Hell. Or if you are, maybe you can laugh about it. *Name changed to protect the guilty because the innocent do not need that sort of protection;)
