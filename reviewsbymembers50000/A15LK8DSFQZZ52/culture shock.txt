 This very funny bookis about an American family lving in Japan and trying to accustom themselves to the differences in cultures. M's Cleveland uses black and white drawings to show the family, the Wests, in various situations.  One particularly funny one is Mr West goesto a geisha party. Mrs West's imagination runs overtime, imagining her husband enjoying himself more than she think he should. The reality of it is quite an eye opener. All the cartoons are funny but also educational. I recommend this book highly for those of you how Japan appeared to Americans living there in the 1950s.
