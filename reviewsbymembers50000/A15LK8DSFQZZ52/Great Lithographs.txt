 This book contains the prints of lithographs made by Miro' first produced in 1944, at the time of World War II. The illustrations are all black and white - some forms are quite whimsical, others reflect the influence of Picasso and surrealism. Though Miro's works usually contained bold colors, these works are all the more pwerful for the tonal values of black and white. If you are interested in art, especially of the Surrealist Movement, this is a great place to start.
