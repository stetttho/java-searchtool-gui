 My weight is always perfect for my height, too - it's the height that varies, too;) This is another great Nicole Hollander book, with plenty of Sylvia (among other characters) guaranteed to make you laugh out loud. The thoughtful funny cartoons reflect an aspect of being a woman that most comic strips never acknowledge. Buy it, read it, maybe with a Margarita and enjoy yourself.
