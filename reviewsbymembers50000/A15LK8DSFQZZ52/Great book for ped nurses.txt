 This is one of the better textbooks for nursing - but fter all, it is a Mosby and wht else would you expect from Mosby? The brook is broken down into various sections, telling you what skills you need to successfully complete the material. It's not just about the physical care, it's also about the mental health aspects. There's a list of suggested words to use instead of words like "shot" and also a section on facilitating a divorce. If you're a ped nurse, you could use this book as a good reference tool. If you're a nursing student, it could give you a bit of help on that pediatric rotation. It is well written and clear and I recommend it highly for all nurses or nursing students
