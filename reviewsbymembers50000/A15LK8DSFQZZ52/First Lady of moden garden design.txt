 This book is a collection of M's Jekyll's garden writings, edited by Penelope Hobhouse. Some of her garden plans would just be impoosible to replicate unless you have a large estate and lots of cash to spend on landscaping, but that shouldn't stop you from reading this book. M's Jekyll's knowledge of plants and gardening is just as relevant as when she originally wrote the articles. The book is in chronological order, so if you're looking for what you should be doing garden wise in February, it's there. There are lots pf plans for various gardens, by color as well as what position the plants will face in the garden. There are also some lovely photos of various plants. But the best part of the book is M's Jekyll explaining, precisely, what various plants should be used in what garden spots. It's like having a good friend who loves nothing more than to guide you through making plans for your own garden. I recommend this book highly for all gardeners.
