 Since I'm of the age group that actually remembers Mr Kennedy's campaign and assasination by seeing it on television, this was a strange book to read. I remember all too well learning of his assasination - I had been assigned as part of homework to report on his campaign. I woke up to be sure I caught the news before I went to school - and there, another horrible scene was being played out. It seems unreal to me even now, after all these years. This book is basically an oral history that tells two stories - the one is the thoughts and feelings of the folks on the train and gathered to see it, the other story is of Mr Kennedy's life and the impact his life had on the world. It's broken down into various sections - his career as attorney general, working with Senator McCarthy, friends and family memories, the Cuban missile crisis - so you get a fuller picture of what Robert Kennedy was like in real life. It makes the tragedy of his death all the more poignant to learn about these things. If you want to learn more about Robert Kennedy and how he was viewed in the time period he lived and dies in, this book is a very good place to start and I recommend it highly.
