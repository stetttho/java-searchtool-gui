 I like this book and the way M's Righetti writes about crochet and her love of the craft. The instructions are generally good but the diagrams leave a lot to be desired. They are difficult (to me) to understand and I wouldn't choose this as a first crochet book for anyone wanting to learn to crochet. Part of the reason for my opinion is that M's Righetti has a very strict view on how a crochet hook is supposed to be held. There is more than one way to hold a crochet hook and a person should be able to hold the hook comfortably in her/his hand. M's Righetti's recommendation of how to hold the hook makes my wrist sore and I have a great deal of difficulty crocheting in that position. I have been crocheting now for over 30 years and I get good results by holding the hook the way it comfortably fits my hand. Outside of her reprimands/criticisms of the "proper" way to hold the hook and the difficult to understand diagrams, this is a good book and I recommend it highly for folks who already know a little about crocheting and want to learn more. Stitches are explained well and her instructions on cutting a piece of crocheted work is definitely liberating. So buy the book and expand your knowledge of one of the greatest needle arts, crochet.
