 It didn't seem possible to me that KitchenAid could improve on its line of mixers. After all, they are well built, last for years and are powerful tools. But I was wrong. This mixer has a 350 watt motor with 5 speeds - it seems much more powerful than the other KitchenAids. It comes with the standard dough hook, whish and beater. It has a 6 foot heavy duty cord. And it also has a thermal overload reset - this is particularly good when you're in your fourth batch of a 9 cup bread dough recipe and it starts to overheat. And the others will overheat - this reset solves this problem. This is a serious mixer for those who do a lot of cooking, especially baking. It can handle heavy bread doughs as well as make wonderful meringue. And it keeps working and working and working...so if you're tired of replacing your mixer every year or so or youre ready to move on to the more powerful toys, this is the mixer for you. You won't be sorry you bought a KitchenAid.
