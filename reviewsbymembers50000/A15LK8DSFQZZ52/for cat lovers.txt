 This short book tackles many things cat lovers want to know - why _do_ cats have 3 eyelids? And so they get along with birds?  Arlene Bleecker, a cat lover herself, answers many questions about cats. Some you probably won't like the answer to ("Will my kitty miss me if I'm gone?"). It's an entertaining educatonal book about various cat behaviors. I recommend this book highly for cat lovers.
