 Baboushka is busy cleaning her house when the three men arrive to ask her to help them find the way to the baby - the one the bright star shines in the sky, leading them in the right direction. Baboushka refuses, saying she has to catch up on her chores, plus it's night - why not wait until morning? The three men can't wait and they leave Baboushka to finish tidying her house. Baboushka realizes she should have gone with them to give gifts to this baby, but she has no idea where they are going. Baboushka gathers up some small gifts and goes door to door, leaving small gifts for the children while searching for the baby. This clever little story, wonderfully illusrated by Nicolas Sidjakov and written by Ruth Robbins, was adapted from a Russian folk tale. I recommend it highly for those who love folk tales as well as charming illustrations.
