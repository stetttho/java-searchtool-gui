 I bought this cd mostly for "The Nickel Song" which I happen to think is a terrific view of life in any sort of business. I really didn't expect to like the other cuts, having stated I'm not a Melanie fan. But guess what - I did. I had forgotten how amazing "(Lay Down) Candles in The Rain" sounded, how the gospel singers and Melanies voice worked so well together. And I even sort of like "Brand New Key" now that they don't play it on the radio station every 20 minutes. My only complaint was "Lover's Cross" - I much prefer that by Jim Croce, but considering I didn't expect to like the rest of the cd except for "The Nickel Song", I was quite surprised. If you're a fan, buy this cd - the sound is wonderul and her voice is clear and pure on it. If you're a wishy washy fan as I was, buy it anyway and enjoy it - you'll probably be surprised how much you like Melanie's music. I know I was.
