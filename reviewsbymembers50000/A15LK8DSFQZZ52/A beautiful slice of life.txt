 I _love _ this movie. There is no evil monster trying to ruin the children's lives, the father is not abusive, the mother doesn't die....so _what_ is it about, you ask? It's about 2 little girls, sisters, making a new friend and living their lives - going to school, playing, visiting their mom in the hospital. It's about their wild and wonderful friend Totoro and the games they play. This is a wonderful movie for the whole family, from the tiniest tykes to the old grumpy folks - it will bring a smile to your face. It is beautifully animated, warm and thoughtful and would make a great addition to your animation collection or as a gift for some one who likes animation.
