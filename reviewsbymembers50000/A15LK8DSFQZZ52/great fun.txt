 This movie is more of a continuation of the first movie than a sequel. Agent J (Will Smith) finds he needs Agent K's (Tommy Lee Jones) expertise on a certain case. But if you seen the first MIB, than you know that K was deactivated and went back to live a "normal" life. The first part of the movie is spent tracking K down and reloading the MIB info into him. One of the funniest scenes in the movie occur when J finds K running a small post office. You get to see the inside workings of the post office and it just made me laugh out loud.  Laura Flynn Boyle is the "bad guy" in this flick and she finds out something I've always suspected - you _could_ rule the world if you look like a "Victoria's Secret" model. The extras on the dvd show how various creatures were made, deleted scenes and of course, various bloopers. This movie is not going to make you think harder about life but it is an enjoyable way to spend an evening. If you looking for great fun and you enjoyed the first "Men in Black", this is an excellent choice for you. Watch and laugh - laughter is supposed to be the best medicine.
