 Both groups will find much to enjoy about this book. Mr Elkort translates his considerable knowledge and experience to an intriguing view of food. If you wondered how pretzels came to be made or what Raytheon (yes, the company that makes radio frequency equipment for the Army) had to do with conveinence foods, this is the book for you. Mr Elkort starts off with a brief history of food - beginning with 3000 B.C. ("Beer and Chickens") to the 1990's ("Conveinence and COnsumerism"). This part explains when various foods came to be consumed by people. I didn't realize the Sumerians were responsible for baking bread as well as brewing beer.  THe next part has to do with various cultures of the world and what is eaten there. There is a list of the "usual" breakfasts - I think Portugal has the most appetizing sounding one to me. Another part is a list of different foods and a bit of history of that food.  Other cultures eat eels, rats and mice as well as lungs and other parts that to an American does not sound very good. Mr Elkort tells you who eats it and gives the background of how it came to be the usual dish in that country. I recommend this book high for all who cook or for those of you who eat - it's entertaining, well writeen and just plain fun.
