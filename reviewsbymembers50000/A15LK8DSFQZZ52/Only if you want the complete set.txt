 If you're expecting the warm and funny Johnathan Winters from,say, "Mork and Mindy" or even earlier, don't buy this cd. You will be terribly disappointed. There is allegedly funny stuff on this cd I wouldn't repeat here or in polite company. It has nothing to do with it not being politically correct, it's just disturbing. If you feel the need to have a complete set of Johnathan Winters work, by all means, buy it. But I wouldn't expect you to enjoy it very much.
