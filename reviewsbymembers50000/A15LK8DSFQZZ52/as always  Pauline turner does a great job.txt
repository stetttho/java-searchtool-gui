 M's Turner always does a great job in her books, so it's no big surprise that she does with this book. If you want to learn how to crochet or if you want to teach crochet, this is an excellent book to start your journey. The instructions are clear and concise and help make the learning process much easier.  I recommend this book highly for beginners.
