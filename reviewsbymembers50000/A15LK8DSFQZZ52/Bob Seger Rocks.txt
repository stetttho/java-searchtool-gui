 I recommend this cd highly for those of you who think you don't know who Bob Seger is or what the music sounds like. You'll hear all the hits you've heard on the radio - and then a few more perhaps future hits. You'll aslo get little tidbits behind various songs. You'll be quite surprised to learn about "Old Time Rock and Roll" - I know I was. So buy it, play it loud and often and enjoy.
