 Mr Dittrick has written a book on how to make "hard" crochet. THis isn't crochet you need a special hook for or special yarn - this is crochet for such things as Stetson hats, baskets and hard brimmed hats. Mr Dittrick shows how to modify an already existing hook to help you to create hard crochet. The instructions are clear and helpful.  If you're looking for a new afghan or poncho to make, this is not the book for you. But if you're interested in turning out something unexpected with crochet, this is definitely the book for you.
