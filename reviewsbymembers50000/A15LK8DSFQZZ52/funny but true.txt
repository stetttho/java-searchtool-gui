 M's Banks and M's Barber show us how life can be more fun f we would only "break the rules" of dating. You remember that book, right? Let him make the first move, wait for him to call _you_, don't act too eager to see him -  you know, all that stuff your mom or girlfriends told you to do that seemed so stupid at the time.  The lovely ladies suggest that "if he has a pulse, you have a date" and instructs the available females on how and where to meet these men. It's a funny book but has a lot of truth in it, especially one of my favorite passages: "...stop waiting for some nonexistent guy to come along and save you. Get over it. This is it. Get a job and buy your own stuff." If you find yourself laughing at that quote or at the least agreeing with it, you will really enjoy this book. However, if you're still waiting for Prince Charming to show up, you probably won't like this book - you definitely need it, but you won't like it. I recommend this book highly for all those who can laugh at the dating game.
