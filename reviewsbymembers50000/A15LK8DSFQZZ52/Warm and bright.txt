 This is a wonderful cd, warm and bright as Brazil on a sunny day. M's Brackeen's piano playing is perfectly matched by her accompanists (Eddie Gomez, Duduka Da Foneseca and Waltinho Anastacio) and is the perfect anidote for dreary winter days. Put this on, brew yourself a good cup of coffee (or tea if you prefer) and enjoy this wonderful music. You will not be disappointed.
