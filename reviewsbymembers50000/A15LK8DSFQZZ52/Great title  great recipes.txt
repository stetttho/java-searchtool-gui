 This seemingly small book packs a lot of recipes in it. Laurel "Bru" Wicks owned her own bakery in Jackson, Wyoming and these recipes are some of her favorites. All of us can't travel to Jackson, Wyoming but we can bring M's Wicks great recipes to our own kitches. Of course, there are the standard recipes - hot cross buns, carrot cake but then there are some totally different ones, such as coconut bread (_yummy_) and sweet potatoe muffins. All the recipes are clear and consise, no bizarre ingredients that makes you spend time you'd rather be baking hunting down the single acting baking powder or things like that.  There's also pie, tarts and even a divinity recipe in here. So if you like to bake, get this book - it's great!
