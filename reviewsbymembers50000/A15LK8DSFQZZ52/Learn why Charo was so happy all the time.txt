 You might only know Xavier Cugat for marrying Charro - you may not realize he was a big band leader famous for his Latin take on music. This cd gives you a chance to experience Mr Cugat's orchestra in some of the finest songs from that time period. The "Chopin's Nocture/Autumn Leaves" medley is a wonderful fusion of Latin music, jazz and classical and worth the price of admission alone, And of course, my favorite on the cd (no it's not "Patricia, It's Patricia" though that's a close second) is the "Rum and Coca-Cola/Compadre Pedro Jaun" medley.  I recommend this cd highly for those of you who want to really experience Latin music.
