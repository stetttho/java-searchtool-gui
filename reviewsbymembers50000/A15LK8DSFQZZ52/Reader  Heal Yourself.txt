 This book is a marvelous collection of exercises from China that can improve your health. The book starts off with an overview of the history of Chines healing exercises, than goes into who should use these exercises. (Of course, with any exercise program, you should check with your doctor first - that's common sense.)  It covers all sorts of health problems, from heart disease to hepatitis as well as hemmorhoids, constipation and colds - they have a massage to prevent the common cold I intend to use this year and see if it works. Most of the exercises have some stretching, massages and breathing exercises which most folks could probably do without overly exerting themselves. That helps make the exercise part much easier. There are also various illustrations thru out the book that help explain the process of the exercise. There are  a few exercises to "cure" insomnia that are extremely helpful to me - cheaper and easier than taking a drug to help bring sleep and you don't have that nasty foggy feeling the next morning. I recommend this book highly, if for nothing else, the insomnia prevention exercises tho the other exercises are good, too. So instead of watching QVC all night or tossing and turning, try this book - I think you will be quite happy you did.
