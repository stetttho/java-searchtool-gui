 I know this is required reading in high school. I know it's supposed to be hip and cool. I also know it's supposed to be based on a classic piece of literature. But it is one of the most overrated books of all time in my opinion. Perhaps it seemed new and innovative when it first came out, but now it's so overhyped it's disgusting.  One of my biggest problems with the book is there is no background story - Holden was shipped off to a private school and asked not to return, apparently not the first school he was eased out of - but there's no reason given. Was he destructive? Did he threaten the other students? Or was he merely bored and didn't do schoolwork? Apparently he wasn't that troubled that they booted him out, the school intended to allow him to stay until the end of the semester. I get the impression the reason's a bit more than slacking off of the schoolwork, but it's never given. And in this age after Columbine, it's difficult to figure out what he could have done to be booted from school. The other problem I have is it's all from Holden's point of view - you don't know if he is behaving as crazy as he sounds or he's terribly self-conscious or exactly what is going on within him and around him. There's no description of how the outside world views him, really, just brief spots where others interact with him. He seems utterly miserable and depressed, but I'm never sure if it's the fact he's been booted from another school or he's clinically depressed and needs some sort of intervention. Read the book - if that's your choice or assignment - but know that if you don't think it's a wonderful piece of literature, you're not alone. And if you do think it's a wonderful piece of literature, you're not alone, either.
