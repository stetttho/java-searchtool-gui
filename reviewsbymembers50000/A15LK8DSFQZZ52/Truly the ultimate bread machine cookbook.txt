 This book is wonderful for all you bread machine fanatics - the photographs are stunning, the directions are simple and complete and the cinnamon coffee bread is to die for - and if that's all the book had, that would be good. But there's a lot more - there's the rye bread recipe and pf course, the famous "Anadama Bread" recipe, chocolate chip bread, and challah as well as pretzel and pizza recipes.  There's also a lot of technical information, telling you what the ingredients do in the process of making the bread, gluten levels of various flours and what you can expect when you substitute one for another - or even if you can substitute. There are directions given for different capacity machines, which makes it very helpful to use this book. I recommend this book very highly for those who wish to find out more and bake more with their bread machines.
