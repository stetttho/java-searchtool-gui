 This is an amazing book of poetry as it encompasses such thoughts as "Why Nobody Pets The Lion At The Zoo" as well as "Oregon Winter" and all points inbetween. A great book to start out with if you're just getting to know poetry, it features many "name" poets such as Robert Frost, Dorothy Parker and Wiliam Carlos Williams as well as some not so famous names such as Paul Dehn, Jeanne McGahey and John Ciardi. If you are a long time poetry fan, this book will add small gems to your collection that would be exceedingly difficult to track down. All the poems have something of value to offer to the reader and th ebook is organized in a stream of consciousnees flow - one section starts off with "Steam Shovel" (Charles Malam), wanders thru"The Toaster", "On Watching The Construction Of A Skyscraper", meaders throught "Apartment House" and settles on "The Builders". It's not a linear voyage but rather a romp through these well chosen poems. It's a great book and I recommend it highly. I will end with a quote from the poem that gives this book its unusual title, just to whet your appetite for more poetry. "Reflections on a gft of Watermelon Pickle Received from a Friend Called Felicity" by John Tobias During that summer When unicorns were still possible; When the purpose of knees Was to be skinned; ... For the rest of this lovely poem, I suggest you track down this book.
