 This is an absolutely gorgeous film and it's easy to understand why it's so popular in Japan. But it's important to remember that it's _not_ a Disney film and therefore will not have a neatly resolved tidy ending. There are scenes that may make kids a bit squeamish, so be forewarned. But it's a lovely film, well crafted and tells an amazing story. If you like animation, you definitely have to see this film. The story is compelling, the animation is great and the voice actors do a terrific job. Watch it for yourself and find out how good animation can be.
