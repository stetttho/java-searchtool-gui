 Pairing Bil Keane (Of "Family Circus" fame) and Erma Bombeck was a stroke of genius. These two work very well together - it's a shame they didn't do more work together. Of course, the title is the "mother's curse" - if you had a mom, you may remember her using that line on you. I often wonder if that's why some people don't have children. This book takes you thru "expert" advice - and than shows you how the situation plays out in the real world. If you are a parent of a teen, you may want this book just so you can remember they don't stay teenagers forever (they _don't_ , really - tho sometimes it's hard to believe). So get this book, find a quiet spot (HA! what's that, the bathroom?) and enjoy - it's cheaper and more fun that psychotherapy.
