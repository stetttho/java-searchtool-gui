 I thought I'd get that out of the way, just so you know where my bias is. Jimmy Buffett puts out about an album a year, tours and makes tons of money, but hasn't had a Top 10 hit since "Margaritaville". No matter, he always produces a listenable album, one that grows on you the more you play it.  Not all of the songs are my all time favorites, but they are alway enjoyable to listen to and he doesn't beat you over the head with his beliefs or about how he's a tortured artist. He seems like he's having fun and that makes it so much more pleasurable to listen to.
