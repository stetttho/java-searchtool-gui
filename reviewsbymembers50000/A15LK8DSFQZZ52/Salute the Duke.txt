 This cd is made from the old 16 inch electrical transcriptions made for radio stations, so what you're hearing is_really_ Duke Ellington and his orchestra in 1946 and 1947.  Because this music was made for radio airplay, the takes you hear on this cd are not the same as you would hear on cds made from the records at the time. The music, of course, is rich and full, but what else would you expect from Duke Ellington? Taft Jordan is the trupet soloist on the opening track, "Take the A Train" which was Duke Elligton's them song. It sounds different from other recordings of this song, but it's still wonderful to hear. Kay Davis does the vocals on "Come Rain or Come Shine" and Ray Nance handles the vocals on "Just Squeeze Me".  This is a exciting cd to add to your Duke Ellington collection because the performances are just a little different than what was used for the recordings. Buy this cd and you, too, will salute the Duke.
