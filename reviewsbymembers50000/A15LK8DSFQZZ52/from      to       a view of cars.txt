 This is a great book if you're a car buff or just want to enjoy the photos of old cars. Did you know America's first workable gasoline engine car was built in 1893? I didn't. The Automobile Manufaturers of America do a great job explaining what innovations were brought to car manaufacturing in a time line format. You can look up 1946 and see that Kaiser and Frazer joined in the companies manufacturing passenger cars with their names on the cars. There's also an index of many pioneers that started or worked with cars. Everybody has heard of Henry Ford, but did you know there was a Walter Chrysler or a Louis Chevrolet? There's also an alphabetical list of when various cars were manufactured. That's what makes the book so interesting - there are some cars you may have heard of, and some cars, unless you've really involved with cars, you wouldn't know.  For you or the car buff in your life, this is the book for you.
