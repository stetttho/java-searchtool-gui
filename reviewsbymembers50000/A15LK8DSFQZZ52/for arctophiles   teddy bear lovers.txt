 "A Teddy Bear is the one possession that is never given away or discarded - it only wears out with love."   THis book was originally published in 1980 under the title "In Praise of Teddy Bears". But this book is more that a lve letter to teddy bears. It gives all sorts of info about the history of the teddy bear. Sure, you know the basic history of how a man arranged a "canned hunt" for Theodore Rossevelt, in which a bear cub or a restrained full grown bear (depending on what version you believe) was made available for President Roosevelt to shoot. He refused and the "teddy bear" was born. There were even children's books about the "Roosevelt Bears Teddy B and Teddy G".  But there's a lot more to teddy bears than that story. THere's the manufacturers, the books. THis book even includes the animated bears such as Yogi Bear and Baloo.   One of my favorite parts of the books has information about an organization near and dear to my heart - the "Good Bears of the World" group. This group provides free bears to hospitals, police departments and any other place that the comfort of a teddy is needed - which is almost anywhere in the world.   If you love teddies like I love teddies, this is the book for you.
