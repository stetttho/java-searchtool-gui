 At one time african violets were the most popular blooming houseplant.* This book details the many different violets and how to take care of them.  The book is a little outdated - there are _lots_ more african violets, even in yellow, than when this book came out. There are many more options in how to outfit an area for the plants to grow in - mostly due to nore technology and the huge chain hardware stores available. But the basics of plant care does not change, whether it's 1958 or 2003 and this book delivers the basic in a clear concise manner so that it makes it very hard to fail with these beautiful plants. I willwarn you, once you acquire one african violet, you will want more - it's like popcorn, one is not enough. But if you desire to travel down that path, this book is a good companion to help you take care of your plants well. I recommend it highly. *The current most popular blooming houseplant is orchids, but really, the are a _ton_ of trouble and have a relatively short blooming period compared to african violets, which bloom almost continuously. Just "dipping my spoon in."
