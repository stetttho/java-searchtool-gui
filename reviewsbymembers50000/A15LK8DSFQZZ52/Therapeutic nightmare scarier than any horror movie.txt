 This book (originally "The Therapeutic Nightmare") will cause you great distress. Not because Morton Mintz has not thoroughly researched and documented all his information. And not because the book is difficult to read or poorly written. This book is frightening because it concerns prescribed drugs many of us take on a daily basis. Mr Mintz was the reporter who won the Raymond Clapper Award for breaking the story about the sedative thalidomide. This drug caused phocemelia (literally, seal flippers)in babies* whose mothers took it while pregnant with them. Because of thalidomide, a law was passed that gave the FDA the power to require specific procedures be followed in test new drugs for safety and effectiveness. Mr Mintz discusses many classes of drugs - oral contraceptives, diuretics, antidepressants and antibiotics being just a few of the many discussed. Some are drugs that not currently used, but much more are still in routine usage. Mr Mintz gives frightening statistics of how these drugs do not work and what the side effects are for the various classes of drugs. It is especially scary to read the side effect of a drug that you took and realize all the things that could have go horribly wrong with the body's reaction to the drug. Though this book is not an easy read nor is it the "feel good" book of the year, I recommend this book to anyone in the health care field to learn more about the drugs being administered. I also recommend this to the layperson who wonders why the FDA system is slower now to approve new drugs. It is an incredible read.  Thalidomide was _never_ prescribed in the U.S, at that time period, though 17 babies were born with phocemelia because free samples from Merrell were distributed by physicians, as was allowed at the time when Merrell filed to sell thalidomide in the United States.
