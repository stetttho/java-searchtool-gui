 So your company is being "right sized" and it's a good chance you won't have a job after this particular round. Even if you do, you'll have to commute 100 miles round trip to your job. And you never liked going through those mountains in the winter weather. And the feds' raids on the various locations are making you just a little unsettled. You only took this job for "a short time" and now a few years have gone by. Maybe it's time for you to pack up your desk and start that book selling online you've heard about. After all, you got all those L. Ron Hubbard books you found at the thrift shop. And those microwave cookbooks, everybody has a microwave, so somebody must need them.  Before you turn in your two week notice, take the time to read this book. You'll find that online book selling is a little more complex than just taking the books off your shelf and reselling them. (Just check the prices for the types of books I named and you'll see they really aren't selling for much money.)  Mr Weber takes you through the process of finding the books and actually deciding what books will sell. Just because a book is old doesn't mean it will be worth a lot of money. Even a book marked "first edition" or an autographed copy might not be worth  trying to sell. But you will be able to find the books that will sell well using Mr Weber's methods.  You will learn how to fulfill orders (some folks on Amazon should read this part) in a timely manner. You'll learn about the legal requirements and the taxes involved in your home based business. There's even a list of wholesale book distributors, depending on how far you want to take your business.  If you only have a few books to sell, you won't need this book. But this a great book if you are considering a career change to online book selling. It's clear, concise and takes a lot of the worries out of starting an online bookstore. So if that's where your interest lies, buy this book.
