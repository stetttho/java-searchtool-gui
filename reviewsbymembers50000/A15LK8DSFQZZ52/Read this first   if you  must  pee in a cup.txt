 As a supervisor at one time or another in my working career, I have wondered about drug tests. People who swear to me they are "clean" (and I have believed them) have failed. People I'd swear to you weren't clean, passed. I myself had to take repeated urine tests because there was something "a little wrong" with the results.  This book gives you the info about why non-users fail and users pass. For instance, the book statesthe usage of the over the counter eyedrop "Visine" will produce a false positive for marijuana.  This seems amazing, but Dr Holtorf explains the reactions in clear language so you understand how that situation gives that particular result. This is _NOT_ a "how to pass the drug test" book, so if that's what you're looking for, you have to look someplace else. But if you are wondering how do the tests determine who's sing and who is not, this is the book for you. I recommend it highly.
