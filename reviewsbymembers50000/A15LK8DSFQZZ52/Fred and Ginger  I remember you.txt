 This book is the screenplay for Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire's final Irving Berlin film musical. The premise is that Ginger Rogers is engaged to Ralph Bellamy but she keeps postponing the marriage. Mr Bellamy sends her to his good friend, Fred Astaire, who happens to be a psychiatrist. True to screwball comedies of the time, M's Rogers falls madly in love with Mr Astaire. Mr Astaire plants a post hypnotic suggestion so M's Rogers will hate him and lover her fiance, Mr Bellamy. But, of course, Mr Astaire has fallen for M's Rogers and wants to reverse the suggestion.  Besides the complete screenplay, there are also many black and white photographs of the film. This is quite a good book for any Fred Astaire or Ginger Rogers fans and I recommend it highly.
