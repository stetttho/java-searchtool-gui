 This is a great crochet book for many reasons. One reason is the wonderful photographs and the clear consise instructions that come with the projects. Another reason is because it shows crochet being fashionable and easy to make as opposed to being something "old fashioned" looking. When my youngest neice asked for a crochet book as a gift, this is the book I picked to give her. It has good instructions for beginning crocheters (which she is) and has enough innovative patterns to keep her interested past the initial frustration of learning a new craft. This is a high compliment from me because I've been crocheting over 30 years and have seen many crochet books and I thought this one was the best for a young woman just starting to crochet. (I may have chosen the Lily Chin one, but it wasn't out at that time.)  I recommend this book highly to anybody who wants to expand their crochet skills. The projects are beautiful and instructions are clear. (No, I _didn't_ see the "mistake" on page 156. I'm wondering if the other reviewer may have misread the instructions.) If you know a crocheter and he or she doesn't have this book, give them this book at the next gift giving opportunity. If you crochet, you should get this book and enjoy it.
