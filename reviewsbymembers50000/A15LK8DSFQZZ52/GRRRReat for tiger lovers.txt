 This book is wonderful for the tiger lover in your life. Tom  Brakefield's photographs are beautiful, capturing the awesome beauty of various tigers. One especially nice thing about the book is the photos are back-to-back and the calendar pages are back-to-back so you can write in your appointments, dates, etc without damaging the picture. I'd recommend this highly for those folks out there that like tigers and want a great desk calendar.
