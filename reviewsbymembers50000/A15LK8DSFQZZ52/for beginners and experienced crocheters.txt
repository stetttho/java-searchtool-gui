 THis is a great book just to browse thru, while you're trying to think of your next project. The photos of the stitches will entice you and invite you to try all of them. And of course, if you run across a reference to a stitch you're not familiar with, you can check it out.  I recimmend this book for beginners and experienced crocheters.
