 The debate regarding same-sex marriages appears as if it will be a huge issue in 2004. For example,at the courthouse in San Francisco performed over 400 marriages (same sex) on February 14, 2004. They normally only perform a little over 400 weddings (opposite sex) a month. This means that many gay couples are committed to each other and want to make it legal in the eyes of the law. This book takes many point of views - some extremists that feel same-sex marriage will ruin their own heterosexual marriages. Lesbians who feel that the idea of marriage is outdated and repressive to the females involved in it. And some folks who seem to have given this issue a bit more thought and express their viewpoints well. No matter where you stand on this important issue, you will find an essay that will reflect your view. I would suggest you also read the other essays to find out how other people feel about the issue so when it comes down to debating this hot topic, you will know the various opinions of your supporters as well as your opponents. You'll be able to state your case in a way that should be able to get your point across. I recommend this book highly.
