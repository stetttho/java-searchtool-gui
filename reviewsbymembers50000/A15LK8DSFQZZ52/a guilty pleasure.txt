 I know, it's impossible to think that a small town in Colorado could have _that_ many murders and that the same person would be so involved with each murder.  But Goldy, of Goldilocks Catering, always seems to end up right in the thick of things in this story and the others in this seiries. The story is pretty good  - a guilty pleasure after reading med records all day. And I love the way she talks about preparing food. Lots of folks don't seem to understand that being able to go into the kitchen and produce a great chocolate cake after a frustrating day can really feel productive.  If you like murder mysteries and cooking, you have to try out this book - it's a great combination of both and the recipes are truly wonderful.
