 If you want to get a feel for the late 1960s, this book can help you get in touch with the political scene at that time. Some of the famous, such as Bobby Seale, as well as the not so famous, Captain Levy, trials are explored in this book. The writers, also, vary from the now famous to the not currently famous. These essays explore what was at stake in the various trials and what it meant for the future of America.  The essay about Bobby Seale is probably the best known trial out of the group selected. It is also illustrated with drawings by Jules Feiffer. But it doesn't make the other essays less compelling, I found the essay on Captain Levy quite toucing, sort of an American Dr Zhivago - but not as wonderful as portrayed on the screen. Take a dip into the late 60's when ploitical activism bloomed. You may be surprised to find out what was going on and what was predicted to happen.
