 Take Otto Preminger, a well known director, mix in Peter O'Toole, Peter Lawford, Richard Attenborough and Robert Mitchum, add some exotic locations and what do you get? A multimillion dollar bad movie. How could this happen, with all this talent, energy and money to toss around? This book gives you the inside scoop on "Rosebud". The script was written and rewritten (by Otto Preminger's son). There were bomb threats, courtesy of the IRA. And more money thrown around and wasted than I'm likely to see in my lifetime. But tho the movie wasn't so great, the book brings you inside of making a movie, how decisions are made, budgets developed and of course, the workings of Otto Preminger's mind. If you're interested in how movie are made, this is a great book for you.
