 Dr Jean Piaget studied hundreds of children from birth to 18 months old and made detailed observations of his observances. Dr Piaget shows how children get a concept of what is real and what is not real and how it develops over the time period specified. A must for any early childhood educator, the book is well written (and translated well, also). Children at that age change so rapidly, it's amazing to see how they can put their world together based on their experiences. I highly recommend this book for early childhood educators and parents, also.
