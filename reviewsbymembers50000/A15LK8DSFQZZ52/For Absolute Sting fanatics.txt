 This is purported to be an "interview cd". Unless the definition of "interview" has drastically changed (my Webster's states "a meeting in which a person is asked about personal views, etc, as by a reporter"), this cd doesn't fit the bill. There are lots of snippets of interviews - you may have heard most before - with no idea as to the context the statement is given. Some I recognized simply because I had just recently seen him on VH1. Some I know I heard before but don't know when or where I had heard it. WIthout the proper context of the statements, it's very difficult to discern what Sting is discussing at any given time. And because it is just snippets and has no chronology or reason, it becomes frustrating when you're trying to figure out "Is he talking about the rainforest? His first wife? His pet goldfish?"  If you are an absolute Sting fanatic and must simply have everything he has recorded, by all means buy it and enjoy it. If you're not, you will not be happy with this cd.
