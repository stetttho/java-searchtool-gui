 This is an amazing story, one you don't know - this is the story of the husband of Joy Adamson, the Joy Adamson portrayed in the movies "Born Free", "Living Free" and "Forever Free". Mr Adamson gives his accounts of life with Elsa, which was totally ignored in the Joy Adamson accounts. He worked hard for the rehabilitation of lions into their natural habitat and worked hard to bring poachers to justice. Besides the story of a real lion lover, there are also some great black and white phoyographs of lions - lions lounging in the fields of Africa, lions nuzzling humans, lions loungng on Land Rovers.  If you ever watched "Born Free" and wondered about how life really was, or contemplated what it would be like to live with the lions, this is an excellent book for you. I recommend it highly for the lion lovers in your life.
