 I _love_ this roaster. Initially, I was a bit apprehensive about buying it - after all I have a stove with an oven, how would this make my life better? Here's how - it has an adjustable temperature control on the outside, it's easy to clean up after, it takes up very little room and most important in hot humid places such as Baltimore, it doesn't heat up your kitchen in the summer. So you can roast a chicken for chicken sandwiches or even chicken Ceasar salad without heating up the whole house. You can roast your beef with some potatoes, carrots and celery. You can even make a family favorite, meatloaf, and the rack ensures the meatloaf isn't sitting in it's own fat. Because you can put this roaster on your counter, you don't hurt your back by trying to put a roaster in the oven.  Of course, I use this pan frequently - I used it Thanksgiving to roast the ham, freeing the oven for the turkey and the other fixings, for Christmas for the turkey breast and right now I have a whole chicken in it for tonight's dinner. That leaves my oven free for rolls and dressing and maybe a cake - no staggering the cooking/baking with this handy tool.  I did detect a slight odor upon first use, but you are warned about it in the instruction manual. It was _not_ overpowering and did not cause any distress because I was expecting it. I'm only addressing this issue because somebody else mentioned it. Easy to clean up, easy to use - I recommend this product highly, especially if you're cooking for a family or if you entertain a lot - it makes cooking so much easier.
