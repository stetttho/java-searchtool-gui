 If you're wondering if your favorite author ever penned under another name, this book is for you. The book is divided in two sections - real names with their pseudonyms, than the pseudonyms with the real names.  Some history is given as to how certain writers chose their names, but it's mostly "Did Sylvia Plath have a pen name? What the heck was it?"  and you can find it.  Pretty cool to have around to settle arguments, if you hang with the type of folks that argue over authors' names or if you're wondering if Jane Somers writes as well as Doris Lessing. I recommend this book highly.
