 This small book will change the way you plan a project. There are very clear instructions on how to measure the body to get the fit and style for your particular garment.   Theses aren't patterns in the sense that you are directed to purchase a certain yarn and use specific needles. THis book will help you creat your own patterns and make sure they turn out right. SO you won't be fretting over how it's shaping up or become frustrated, ripping out rows of work just to obtain the desired result. It's similiar to having a gifted knitting instructor talk you thru the process of making a garment. I recommend this book very highly for those of you who want to create your own styles.
