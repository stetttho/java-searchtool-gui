 If you like Patrick Stewart, you'll probably love this version of "A Christmas Carol" and you won't be happy with this review. If you don't care for Patrick Stewart, you probably wont' like this movie (but you might like the review;)). It is probably unfair for me to review this movie simply because I'm not a Patrick Stewart fan, But I feel that Mr Stewart did not make Ebeneezer Scrooge a real person to me. I didn't feel the emotions that Alistair Sims or George C. Scott brought to the surface with this role.  I expected to see Data or Worf show up as one of the Christmas ghosts. Some went on about the special effects, but I didn't feel they were that impressive. The ghosts weren't weren't shadowy enough or perhaps I was put off by Joel Grey being a ghost. It just didn't work for me. I'd advise the George C. Scott version or the Alistair Sims version over this particular version.
