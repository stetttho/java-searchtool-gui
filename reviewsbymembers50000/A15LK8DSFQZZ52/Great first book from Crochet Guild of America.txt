 This book is in the newer vein of crochet books - cool, easy to make wearables that do't look like you flung an afghan on your back. Yes, that is a style, but not one everybody would like to emulate.  This book is terrific - the patterns are lear and concise. When a stitch is referenced, the page that explains how to do the stitch is given. The book is a way of advertising Crochet Guild of America's new yarn line, _BUT_ they also give the description of the yarn and offer other suggestions of brands to use. There is also photos of the featured yarn in the back just in case you have yarn in your stash and you are not sure if it is suitable for the project you picked.  I especially liked the section on the crochet hooks. This isn't "oh, here's a size H hook, this shows you various hooks, old as well as new. And there is a conversion chart giving you the European sizes that correspond to the American sizes, a handy reference in and of itself. There's also information on joining the Crochet Guild of America*, which does its best to promote the art of crochet. The benefits and costs are explained completely.  I recommend this book highly for all crocheters who would like to make memorable wearables. With the combinations of illustrations and instructions , a relatively new crocheter could still create an eye- catching sweater.  *Yes, I am a member, too - but I do not receive any special considerations or kickback for this review - just so you know where I stand on the CGOA.
