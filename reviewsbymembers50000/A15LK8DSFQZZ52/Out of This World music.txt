 This great cd provides an introduction to "alternative" bands such as "They Might Be Giants" with the excellent "Why Does The Sun Shine?" and Greg Lee with his "Brief Disclaimer" - that's worth the price of admission alone. But there's more - more Greg Lee, XTC (with "Cherry in Your Tree") Johnny Nexdoor and His Neighbors, and of course, Rockapella. (How could you have a "Carmen Sandiego" cd without Rockapella?"  So buy this cd and enjoy the great music.
