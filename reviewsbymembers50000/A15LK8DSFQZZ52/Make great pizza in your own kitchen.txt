 My sons would eat pizza evey day, probably all day if they could get away with it. Delivery pizza, depending upon your area, can be expensive and some aren't very good. Or suppose you'd rather have deep dish pizza? This is the book for you! Mr Food (Art Ginsburg) has over a hundred recipes for various pizzas - some you don't even have to use yeast for the recipe. And all the recipes have instructions that are clear and concise, making sure you know every step of the way what you are doing.  My all time favorite recipe in this book is the deep dish pizza recipe. I toss the stuff in the bread machine and let the machine do the work up to the baking part. Sometimes I add extra garlic or Parmesan cheese or even Italian sausage. Sometimes I use the recipe to actually make deep dish pizza. Often I use it to make our favorite breadsticks and it is just wonderful to use either way. And if you're not a deep dish fan? Don't worry, there's lots of other recipes for you to try and enjoy. And it sure is a lot less expensive that calling out for pizza - in the time it takes you to whip up one of these recipes, the pizza guy will just be getting lost on his way to your place. So buy this book to save a few bucks and eat better pizza - it's definitely worth it.
