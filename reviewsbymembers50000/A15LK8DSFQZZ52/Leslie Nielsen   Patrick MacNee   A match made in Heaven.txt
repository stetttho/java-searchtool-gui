 This is a silly little film, funnier than most stuff they show on tv. Leslie Nielsen is sort of Captain Kirk and Captain Picard rolled into one, if you scooped out their brains first. Patrick MacNee, always great to see, is the evil scientist who is willing to risk anything to have something named in his honor. And if you've been wondering what Cindy Williams has been up to these days, here's your answer - she's the morale officer on this ship of fools. Try it, you'll like it.
