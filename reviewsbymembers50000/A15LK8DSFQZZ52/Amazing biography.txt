 Nancy Mitford had the "inside scoop" as it were - she had access to Millay's papers, as well as access to Millay's only surviving sister, Norma. These two items make for a book that is a fascinating view of the great poet, Edna St Vincent Millay. Edna lived a life most of us can barely believe - lovers, prizes, fame, fortune  - at a time when females weren't supposed to "want it all". M's Mitford focuses on M's Millay's relationship with her mother and feels this was the determining factor in M's Millay's life. M's Millay was, to a large extent, abandoned by her mother as her mother tried to provide for three girls. M's Millay, being the oldest, took on the mother role for herself.   Her book is punctuated with interviews with Norma, pictures and musings about M's Millay. There can be a bit distracting, especially when you're interested in the events being described at the time. M's Mitford asserts that M's Millay was pregnant and her mother helped her to abort. Outside of a photograph, there doesn't seem to be a lot to support that assertion. I'd advise reading this book with Daniel Mark Epstein's "What My Lips Have Kissed". His viewpoint is that M's Millay's biggest influence onher life was her many loves. M's Mitford seems right in many respects, but Mr Epstein's poet background seems to work well for him in his view of M's Millay. Buy both books and read them consecutively - it will give you a more accurate picture of Edna St Vincent Millay.
