 If you own the Donvier Ice Cream Maker, you _need_ this book. It has a lot of wonderful recipes for various ice creams, sorbets, parfaits as well as suggestions for using your ice cream maker to chill Margaritias(!). There are "light" versions of lots of the recipes, including a light verson of one of James Beard's favorite ice cream recipes.  The book also has a lot of old sepia photographs of old fashioned ice cream makers and ice cream socials, so it is a cultural shift from just going to the 7-11 and buying a pint of Ben and Jerry's "Chubby Hubby".  And don't you _really_ want to know how to make fried ice cream balls? You _know_ you do - buy this book and learn how to make this impressive dessert.
