 This is the only self help book that I have ever read and actually kept - and reread. Most I read and think "Oh, I can't believe that...or I can't do that". Most self books trot out a few well worn stories, tie them up neatly and tell you how to get with their system. But M's Coudert shows you, warts and all, about her life and how she managed to change it for the better. This book will make you feel better about yourself and your life and is definitely worth the effort of finding it.
