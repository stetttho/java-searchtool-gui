 This movie has been unfairly considered a bad movie. It isn't - it's funny and almost everyone is perfectly cast. The exception is the actor who does the Bluto role, but to be fair he doesn't have a lot to do - he sort of just growls and scowls through out the whole movie. I like this movie a lot. Robin Williams was great, as was Shelly Duvall and Ray Walston. I can't imagine anyone else playing these roles. M'S Duvall is the perfect Olive Oyl, conflicted between the brutish Bluto and the one eyed Popeye. Ray Walston is always terrific in any movie, here he shines as Popeye's pappy.  The dvd has a good transfer, but as the movie involves a lot of people talking at the same time, you may want to try using the subtitles to see what is being said. There's so much humor in Popeye's mutterings, you want to be ble to hear every word. I recommend this film highly.
