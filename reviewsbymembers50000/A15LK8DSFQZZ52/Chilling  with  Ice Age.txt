 This is a great dvd to own if you like computer animation or if you have kids. My "kids" are all grown up, so I happen to like the animation. The story is of an unlikely group brought together by the impending ice age and the charge they were given to deliver a human baby back to the human tribe. This is a little strange, considering one of the guards of the baby is a sabre toothed tiger, Diego,  (Denis Leary)but it works very well. the other two guards are Manny the wooly mammoth (Ray Romano) and  Sid the sloth (John Leguizamo). The characters work well together and make this a great film. I especially like Scrat (the squirrel). The computer animation is not the same as say "Shrek" or either of the "Toy Story" movies - it's more angular looking. But it works very well for the purpose of telling this story. After all, ice is not particularly rounded or friendly looking, is it? So buy the dvd (before we have our own "ice age" - 3 feet of snow indeed!), fix yourself something warm to drink - make some hot chocolate - and prepare to enjoy the adventures of this strangely tossed together band of heroes.
