 If you work in the healthcare profession, you should immediately buy this book - unless you're holding out for the new book (2003). I use this book at least once a week at work (I work in a long term care pharmacy) and it never disappoints. The old drugs as well as the new drugs are in there, when the drug has been discontinued as well as the therapeutic classes. And if you're trying to figure out what Paxipam is or whether there's a new formulation for Dimetapp, this book can help you out.  If you're involved in any way with drugs (pharmacy, nursing, medical records/transcriptionist, etc) you'll find this book to be a goldmine of information. Buy it, it will save you so much time, for example, when you're wondering if Percodan or Percocet has Tylenol in it and is Robitussin really guafensin.
