 This music is thick and dense with harp and hammer dulcimer and so much more - and relaxing. The mixture of the Celtic with the Persian sounds as if it wouldn't work but it does, swirling around your ears and painting images in your brain. The pieces almost sound as if they were from some wonderfully exotic music box. The music is as gentle as a light spring rain, awakening your senses to the world around you.  If you like Enya, give this cd a try. You will really enjoy Lisa Lynne's music and arrangements.
