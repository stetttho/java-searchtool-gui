 I love, love, love these glasses!!!!!  I purchased these approximately 4 years ago and have been thrilled with them since I got them.  The eye surgeon that performed by Lasik procedure also approved of the lenses in these glasses.  I guess we can have form and function together in some items! Who knew?  I am rather hard on things and usually scratch sunglass lenses in a year or two.  So far, these have held up extremely well.  I don't think that I have gotten any more delicate in my handling of items. I believe these lenses must be made of a harder carbonate material.  I highly recommend this product.  I would gladly purchase another pair.  My husband also has Maui Jim glasses and is equally happy with his purchase.
