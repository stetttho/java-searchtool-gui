 A serious foodie that has been perfecting her cooking skills for the last 25 years in her home kitchen writes this review. My favorite cookbooks are "The Professional Chef" by the Culinary Institute of America and "Culinary Artistry".  If you love to make your food as beautiful as it is tasty, you will enjoy this product.  I find these molds most useful for making risotto cakes, making short vegetable stacks, small frozen mousses or cutting rounds from cakes to serve as a bed.  For items like stacks you can pack the mold and then slide the ring up to make a taller stack.  However, this "stretching method" will not work for a taller frozen mousse.  I imagine you could secure two molds together for a taller frozen mousse.  But since I have not tried that I am uncertain as to how well it would work.  The height restriction of 2 inches makes these molds a little less useful than my set of molds that are 5 inches tall.  This product is well made and should stand the test of time.  If you don't already own a taller set of molds I would suggest that you consider that purchase first, I find them to be much more useful in my kitchen.
