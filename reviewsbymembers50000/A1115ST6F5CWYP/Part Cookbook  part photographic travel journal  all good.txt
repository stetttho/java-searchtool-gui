 A serious student of cooking that has been perfecting her skills over the last 25 years writes this review.  I have traveled to Italy multiple times, and have spent the last 10 years perfecting my Italian cooking skills.  This book is part of my collection of cookbooks that now exceed 500.  I am a tough critic on Italian cookbooks. However, this book is worthy is a good review.  This book is part photographic essay of Italian food and travel and part cookbook.  The author writes a brief history of each region's food history in the chapters about the various regions.  In the regional descriptions she tells you about the terrain of the area, the basic diet, and the various dishes that are classic to the regions.  The book is subdivided as follows: 1.	Nord-Ovest:  Lombardi, Piemonte, Val d'Aosta, Liguria (Region 1) 2.	Antipasti:  Appetizers 3.	Nord-Est:  Veneto, Fruili-Venezia Guilia, Trentino-Alto Adige (Region 2) 4.	Primi:  First courses 5.	Centro:  Toscana, Lazio, Umbria, Marche, Emilia-Romagna (Region 3) 6.	Secondi:  Main Courses 7.	Sud:  Campania, Abruzzi, Molise, Basilicata, Puglia, Calabria (Region 4) 8.	Verdure:  Vegetables  9.	Grandi Isole:  Sicilia and Sardegna (Region 5) 10.	Dolci:  Desserts  The recipes are all authentic, and very succinctly written.  The directions are easy to follow.  Some of the recipes (stuffed pastas) are a little advanced for the average cook.  However, with patience and practice all of them are possible.  Most (approx. 90%) of the recipes have photographs of the finished dishes included in the book.   The book is well constructed, the spine is stiff and heavy, and the paper stock is thick and glossy.  If you love Italy, or Italy food and/or cooking this is a beautiful book to add to your library.
