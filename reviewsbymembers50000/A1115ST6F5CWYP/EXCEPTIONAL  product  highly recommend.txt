 If you dislike cleaning, but you hate dirt more this is the machine for you.  Since purchasing this machine last summer my house has never been cleaner.  I delayed this purchase for almost six months due to the price of this product alone.  I did research on vacuums for almost a year before purchasing this product.  I am now a big fan of Miele.    This machine is absolutely amazing.  It really is a completely sealed system.  I no longer sneeze when I vacuum.  On the highest suction level this machine will pick up anything.  We have three long hair cats (Turkish Angoras) that have baby fine hair that comes off the cats and flies straight up.  Cat hair was the primary reason that we purchased this machine.  If you have animals I highly recommend purchasing the separate Turbo Brush (it comes as part of the car care set, or on its own).  I use this to remove the cat hair from upholstery, and the drapes.  One pass with this machine and the cat hair releases from the fabric.  Gone are the days of repeated going over an area to get the cat hair off the furniture (this assumes the Turbo Brush, I have not tried to remove cat hair without it).  I primarily have hard wood floors and Oriental rugs and this machine cleans both with ease.  The suction control on the handle allows you to quickly change suction so that you don't suck up any of the carpet fringe.  This machine also picks up cat little easily which my older machine had difficulty with.  This machine is remarkably quiet.  I can hear the phone ring, and the doorbell, and even talk on the phone (on all but the highest suction setting) while vacuuming.  If you are looking for a top quality vacuum cleaner that you will probably own for 20 years or more this is the machine for you.   I highly recommend this problem once you get over the sticker shock, so will you.
