 If you are serious about Italian wine and/or food this is great book to have in your library.  The book does a nice job of explaining the wine varietals from particular regions of Italy.  They also tell you which years are outstanding, very good, fairly good and unsatisfactory by wine.  This book is very helpful for a trip to your favorite wine store.  If you are interested in wine tours while in Italy the book gives descriptions of wineries and which one offer tours and whether you need to make reservations or not.  I also appreciated the wine store names, addresses and phone numbers that are listed by region.  My husband appreciated the similar listings of golf courses.  Their listings of antique fairs were also useful.  When I was booking our last vacation, I compared the hotel and restaurant suggestions with other guides and found that they were similar.  It is always nice to have multiple sources for information.  I think that this book has something for everyone.  If you never plan to visit Italy this book is very useful with its general information about Italian varietals and which years to purchase.
