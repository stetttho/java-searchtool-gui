 First, if you are handy with wood this is a very simple product.  Just a wooden box with holes drilled in and toys stuffed inside for the cats to remove.  So, if you have a handy husband consider that route.  If however, your husband is not handy, or doesn't have the time to spare ..... this is a nice product.  The finish is very smooth, no rough edges.  And the cats really do seem to enjoy taking the toys out of the holes.  Plus I get exercise going through the house to find the toys and stuff them back into the holes.    In conclusion, the cats enjoy it, and the humans get more exercise.  It is a win win situation.  I recommend this product to all over the top cat parents.  I removed one star because I feel as though the price is a little high for what the product cost to manufacture.
