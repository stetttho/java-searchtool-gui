 This review is written from the perspective of someone that has been studying cooking for 25 years, and concentrating on Italian cooking for the last 10 years.  As such, I am tougher on Italian cookbooks than other cookbooks.    First, this book is a paperback.  It is a small paperback at that, being on 132 pages in length.  But don't let that deter you if you are interested in the cooking of Rome.  This book is the authentic article.  When the author does deviate from tradition, like with her affection for ginger, she does that this is not a traditional Italian ingredient later in the book.  I like that this book concentrated on one region of Italy.  Rome is one my favorite places, and a great food city that I would put on the order of New York or San Francisco.  The author had me right from the first few recipes in the book.  Linguine with Tuna, Lemon and Arugula is one of my favorites (it works just as well with Shrimp).  This is one of my favorite go to meals when I need dinner in a hurry and her recipe is good.  The author's recipe for Ravioli with an Artichoke filling (that does not include Ricotta) is another one of my family favorites.  This book makes some assumptions about the reader's competency in the kitchen.  This book would not function well as someone's first Italian cookbook.  However, if you are already familiar with Italian cooking and want to be come more competent in Roman cooking this a nice addition to a cooking library.
