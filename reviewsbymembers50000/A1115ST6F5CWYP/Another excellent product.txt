 It is important to note that this is not a stand-alone phone.  It requires another Siemen's base phone in order to be operational.  The phone is extremely small, think small cell phone small.  I do not find the buttons too tight to use.  However, my husband (and his larger fingers) does have a little difficulty with the size of the buttons.  The voice quality is very clear and the headset is very useful.  I also appreciate how lightweight the phone is when I am using the headset and have the phone in my pocket or clipped to my belt.  The phone seems to be well made as it has been dropped on the floor from a table several times and suffered no damage.  If you are like me and use only cordless phones in your home get an UPS (uninterruptible power supply) to hook up to the base system. I was surprised when my power went out and I didn't have a working phone system a few years back.  The UPS system took care of the problem with the next power outage.  I strongly recommend this product.  It functions as advertised.  Be certain to look at the dimensions before you purchase.  It is a very small phone, probably smaller than you expect it to be.
