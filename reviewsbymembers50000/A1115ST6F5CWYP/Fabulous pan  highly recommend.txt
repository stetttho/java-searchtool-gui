 If you love to bake, you will love this pan.   I have two different Baguette pans, this one and a non-stick non-perforated pan.  This pan seems to make bread that is a little bit crisper on the exterior.  This pan is very easy to clean by hand I do not bother to use the dishwasher.  The bread is perfectly formed in this pan.  No more flat looking loaves that you get when you form the baton on the baking stone.  Suggestions for perfect French bread: 1.	Use a French bread pan, instead of placing the bread directly on the baking stone 2.	Use a serrated knife sprayed with oil to cut the slashes in the bread 3.	Place this pan on top of screaming hot (500 degree) baking stone 4.	Mist the dough with water as soon as it is placed in the oven to get the oven spring 5.	Turn the bread half way through baking 6.	Don't cut the bread for at least 20 minutes after it comes out of the oven  If you love to bake you will really enjoy this pan.  I highly recommend this product.
