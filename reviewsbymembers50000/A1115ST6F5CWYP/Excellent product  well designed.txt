 I purchased this pasta fork because I was having difficulty with the pasta staying on a nylon server that I own.  The slightly rough texture of this fork gives the pasta something to grip when you are serving pasta.  I believe the texture is the primary reason that this product is superior to the nylon models.  The server feels nice in the hand; the indentations on the handle make it easy to hold onto.  Because this product is wood, and does not get hot, I find myself using this fork to pull pasta out of the hot water.  I find that this fork works as well as tongs for removing the pasta from the pot, and has the added benefit of not heating up.  The down side is that because this product is wood it should not be placed in the dishwasher.  If you don't mind hand washing, which I don't, consider purchasing this product.  This is a very well designed product.
