 I picked up a bag of these treats at our neighborhood market.  My cats think this is the best stuff on earth.  My little darlings have not enjoyed anything as much as they appear to love these.  The only problem with these treats is that the cats love them so much they sometimes get in little squabbles as each one tries to reach my hand before anyone else can get to the treat.  If you want to feed you felines an organic diet, and you want them to eat what you give them this is a great product.  My husband continues to threaten to try one since they are all organic, and a nice mix of food that people would eat.  I highly recommend this for anyone with pampered felines.  Mine give these three paws up.
