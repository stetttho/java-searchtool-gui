 The first edition of this book has been around since 1996.  It is essentially the same book only this one has been expanded.  One of the best examples the author gives in the book of why we should be concerned about toxins is when she shows the exposures of an average female office worker on the typical day.  The exposures are as follows:  Showering:  chlorine in the water used to bathe Clothing worn:  fabric softener used, or maybe dry cleaned clothing that wasn't aired out Toiletries used:  deodorant, makeup, hair spray, or perfume Food consumed:  pesticide or fertilizer residue Traveling to work:  air pollution in the form of car exhaust, or pollen At work:  cleaning supplies, office furnishing or building materials outgasing, other indoor air pollution Home:  chemicals in cleaning supplies, tobacco smoke, animal hair or dander, dust mites, plant pollen, mold present in improperly ventilated kitchens and baths.  Who wouldn't be depressed reading that list?  I think the items on that list touch everyone's life every day.  When you add in the fumes from carpeting and the link to Kawasaki syndrome in kids, what are we suppose to do?    The author gives you lots of suggestions for reducing the level of exposure to toxins.  I am particularly fond of the detoxification baths.  I don't know if they are working, but it is a great excuse for a nice long uninterrupted soak in the bathtub.  If you are looking for an excuse to have a sauna installed in your house that is included in this book as well.  This book is great for opening your eyes to potential toxins and outlining ways that you can reduce your family's exposure without having to move to Montana.  I highly recommend this book and "Toxic Overload" by Dr. Paula Baille-Hamilton if you are interested in reducing your toxic exposure.
