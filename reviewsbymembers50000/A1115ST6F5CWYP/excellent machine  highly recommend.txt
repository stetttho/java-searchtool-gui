 I purchased this machine as a replacement for a Eureka hand held machine that was approximately [...] years old.  This machine is easily twice as powerful as the one it replaced.  I use the machine to clean the refrigerator interior, sealed hardwood floors, kitchen cabinetry, and stainless steel range top and to remove soap scum from the bathroom.  I feel good about cleaning without toxic chemicals.  This machine makes green cleaning possible without having to resort to more aggressive scrubbing or substandard results.  I highly recommend Saeco products in general as the proud owner of one of their super-automatic coffee makers.  I assume this steam cleaner uses the same technology that makes 15 bars of pressure in their espresso makers.  For those of you that are not familiar with Saeco it is not some little fly-by-night company.  Saeco is the largest seller of espresso makers in Italy.  I feel as confident about purchasing their products as I do Miele, Gaggenau or KitchenAid.  If you want to reduce or eliminate the use of toxic cleaners in your home this is the machine for you.
