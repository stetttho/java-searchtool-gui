 A serious foodie that has been perfecting her cooking skills for the last 25 years in her home kitchen writes this review. My favorite cookbooks are "The Professional Chef" by the Culinary Institute of America and "Culinary Artistry".   I received this product for Christmas and I love it. My husband purchased this in a set of both salt and pepper grinders for me. One has a ceramic grinding mechanism and the one has a stainless grinding mechanism. We liked the first set so much that we purchased a second set within a week. Now we have one with black peppercorn, another with white peppercorns. The salt grinders are filled with Trapani (Sicilian) Sea Salt, and Grey Salt.   I love that these can be used with one hand. I also love that they are so easy to clean with a damp cloth. If you will be handling meat you can cover the button mechanism with a piece of plastic wrap prior to handling the meat and then just remove the plastic film when you are finished.   I find the adjustment mechanism to be more than adequate. We had to fiddle with it a little to get a coarse enough grind, but it took less than 5 minutes. We prefer to see the salt and pepper on the top of our food.   If you use these are often as we do, you might want to consider purchasing rechargeable batteries for this product. These grinders get enough of a workout in our home that each of the four grinders has already been through 2 sets of batteries since this past Christmas.   This is one of those products that I would give to any of my foodie friends. It is just so much nicer to be able to grind spices with one hand. This product is well weighted and feels nice in the hand. I highly recommend this product; you will not be disappointed with this purchase.
