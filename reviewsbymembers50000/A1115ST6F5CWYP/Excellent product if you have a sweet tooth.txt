 If you haven't tried this product you really should buy a bottle and experience it for yourself.  I think that it is good enough that you won't miss the sugar.  Water is so good for us, but so boring.  If you are trying to increase your consumption of water, try a little of this in the water.    This product can also be used to make an Italian soda (a little syrup, a little cream, and some sparkling water).  Another yummy treat, if only they made a fat free cream it would be perfect.  My husband and I have been buying this brand of sugar free syrup for years.  A pump of this syrup into your coffee changes it from a standard morning beverage into a liquid candy bar in a mug.  I recently switched from half and half to soy milk in my coffee.  With this syrup in my coffee the switch to soy milk was very easy.  This product can also be used to drizzle on fruit if you need a little extract sweetener.  The ingredients in this product (listed in order) are as follows: Purified water Vanilla extract with other natural flavors Potassium sorbate and sodium benzoate (to preserve freshness) Citric acid Xantham gum Sucralose (splenda brand) Acesulfame potassium  Nutrition Facts label reads as follows: Serving Size:  1 oz.

It allows you to dispense the same amount into your coffee without having to tediously measure.
