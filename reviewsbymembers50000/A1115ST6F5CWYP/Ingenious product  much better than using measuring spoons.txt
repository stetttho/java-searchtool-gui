 This is a great product.  My measuring spoons don't get nearly as much use any more.  These little measuring devices have markings for the following: Tablespoons (1/2, 1, 2, 3, 4) Ounces (1/4, 1/2, 1, 1 1/2, 2) Milliliters (5 thru 60, in 5 ml increments) Cups (1/16, 1/8, 1/4)  These cups stack together and don't take up much room.  I store them inside my 1 cup measuring cup.  They are easy to read from the top for the two most used measures (tablespoons and ounces).  They are also easy to clean.  I find them to be very useful for measuring the oil that you are going to saute in, avoiding the problem of a tablespoon becoming a quarter cup.  They are also great for measuring single servings of salad dressing, and small amounts of Parmesan cheese.  I highly recommend this product.
