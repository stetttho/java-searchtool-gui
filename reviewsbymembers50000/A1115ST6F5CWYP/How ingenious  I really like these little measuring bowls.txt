 What a brilliant idea!  Measuring bowls that can be used for two different measurements each.  Why didn't someone think of this sooner?  These work easily with an obvious line in the bowls interior that is the 50% measure.  If you love to bake, which requires a lot of measuring.  You will love these bowls.  There is nothing worse than being in the middle of measuring ingredients for baking and being interrupted.  If you use these bowls to measure the incremental ingredients you will never have to remeasure again.  These bowls are dishwasher safe and also clean up easily if you hand wash them.  I have two sets of these because they are so useful, and because I do so much baking.  The sizes of these bowls are as follows: 1/8 and 1/4 cup 1/4 and 1/2 cup 1/2 and 1 cup 3/4 and 1 1/2 cups 1 and 2 cups.  If you love to bake, or you like to measure prior to cooking (mise en place) you will love these bowls.  I highly recommend this product.
