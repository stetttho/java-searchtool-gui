 If you prep a lot of fruits and vegetables in your kitchen, this is the set for you.  The Santoku knife is lighter than a standard chef's knife.  But this is what makes it so wonderful on fruits and vegetables.  I have used it to carve prime rib (just to see how if worked) and it performed just as well as my chef's knife, except that it is a little smaller.  I find that I use the Santoku 90% of the time in my kitchen.  If you are diminutive female, this knife feels right in the hand since it is a little smaller than a standard chef's knife.  I love the blade on this knife.  It holds an edge much longer than my non-Wustof knives.  The paring knife is nothing special.  But it does have the same nice hard blade that is on the Santoku.  You will not be disappointed in this purchase if you love to cook.
