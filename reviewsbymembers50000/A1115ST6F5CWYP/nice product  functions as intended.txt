 I use this brush to clean my super automatic espresso machine (see my Saeco review).  The thin design of this brush makes it much easier to clear out the area of machine around the internal grinding mechanism.  Also the short design of the brush allows it to fit into very tight places.  The brush fibers grip the grounds very well.  While this makes it easier to clean the machine, it is a little more difficult to clean the brush when you are finished.  I find it works best if you swish the brush in warm water to remove most of the grinds and then soak the brush in soapy water to dislodge the remaining debris.  The brush will take hours to dry if you do blot most of the excess water from the bristles.  I would purchase this product again.
