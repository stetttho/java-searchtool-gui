 This is just one of those books that regularly gets pulled off the shelf at my house.  It is definitely retro (1978) but still very useful.  I learned how to make yogurt from this book back when I was in college.  This book gives a really nice description (and pictures) for making yogurt without a yogurt maker.  There are 8 different recipes for plain yogurt in this book depending on how much fat you want in your finished product.  All the variations are excellent.  However at my house we usually make the non-fat for health reasons.  If you have never made yogurt before you will be surprised by how it tastes when you make it fresh.  The finished product is much less tart than commercial yogurt.   The book also covers yogurt cheese, which is another staple in our home.  We use this stuff for everything (and yes, we do make it with the same non-fat yogurt and it is great).  This is another product that is so much better when you make it at home.  The recipe section of this book is subdivided as follows:  Flavored Yogurt Appetizers and Beverages Salads and Salad Dressings Soups and Sandwiches Main Dishes Casseroles and Vegetables Fish and Seafood Breads Cakes and Cookies Elegant Dishes Frozen Yogurt Yogo-Cheese (Yogurt Cheese)  There is a recipe in this book for Grand Marnier Souffl? (this is a cold dish) this turns out surprisingly well using the non-fat yogurt cheese.  I would buy this book again for that recipe alone.  If you want to learn out to make yogurt, or just like the retro aspect, this is a good book to have in your library.
