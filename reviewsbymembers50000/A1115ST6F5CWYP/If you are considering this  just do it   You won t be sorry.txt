 I purchased this a while back to replace a different model that was almost 25 years old .  I am so pleased with this purchase.  It is everything that I expected it to be and more.  Even though I primarily cook for a two-person household I purchased the 14-cup model.   I have not had any problem with the machine being too large to perform the tasks I needed it to handle.  The machine is large enough to make white bean dip from one pound of dry white beans without exceeding its capacity.  I have also used the machine to make 2 pounds of whole-wheat pasta dough with room to spare.  It is also nice to make large batches of base for gazpacho.  I love the size and heft of this machine.  It is nice to not be concerned about exceeding the machines capacity or mechanical limit.  I highly recommend this machine to anyone that loves to cook.  Once you have it, you will find so many uses for it that you had not anticipated.  This machine is used at least 5 days a week in my home.
