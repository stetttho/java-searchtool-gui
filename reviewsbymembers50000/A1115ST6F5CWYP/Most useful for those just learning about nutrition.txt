 If you are not currently practicing a whole foods diet and want more information on why you should, this could be a good resource.   If you already practice a whole foods diet this book is probably not for you.  The book covers a lot of topics (pesticides, hormones, bacterial contamination, food irradiation, and chemical additives to name a few) some of them in more detail than others.  This book did not present any new information for me, but I have been studying nutrition for about 9 years.  If I had found this book at the beginning of my journey for nutritional knowledge it would have been helpful to point me in the right direction.  On the positive side, this book is approximately twenty five percent recipes.  The Oat Nut Crust in the dessert section of the book is actually quite good.  I prepared the crust with 100% whole-wheat flour and it came out fine.  Overall, if you are new to nutrition and/or whole foods this might be worth a read.  If you have other books on whole foods or nutrition I would recommend passing on this book.
