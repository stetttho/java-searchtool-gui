 To put this review into perspective for you it is written by someone that has been cooking for 25 years, and concentrating on Italian cooking for the last 10 years.  My favorite cookbook is "The Professional Chef" from the Culinary Institute of America.  I would definitely consider myself a foodie.  This book is part travel journal and part cookbook.  This book doesn't concentrate on one county or one type of cuisine.  This book has more Italian recipes than any other.  But it also includes Asian, Indian, Hawaiian, Moroccan and Middle Eastern offerings as well.   Before each recipe Nigella tells you a little about the inspiration for the recipe, where she first ate it and for which meal she would serve the recipe.  Nigella is clearly a lover of food, and that comes through in her writing.  The directions for her recipes are very complete.  The ingredients that she uses are available in most major metropolitan mega marts, or thorough the gourmet section of Amazon.  The recipe that I find the most versatile in this book is the one for Lemon Rice with mint, mustard seed and turmeric that is much more flavorful than regular rice, but not too assertive.  Many of the recipes have less than 10 ingredients and come together in under 30 minutes.  The Chicken, Almond and Parsley salad is quick, and very good.  I know it sounds crazy but the Watermelon, Feta and Black Olive salad is also a winner.  In most cases Nigella uses more oil and cheese than is necessary.  If you cut back on the oil and cheese that she calls for, most of the recipes (dessert section excluded) are reasonably healthy.  If you love to cook, and you don't stick to one type of cuisine, this is a good book to have in your library.  Approximately half of the recipes have a beautiful full color photo.  The book has a sturdy spine and is printed on glossy paper.
