 I am a pretty serious home cook, so I might get more use out of this device than most, but I love my meat grinder attachment.   If you hate reading the labels on ground meat or prepared sausage to determine which brands are the lowest in fat and/or preservatives this product is for you.  I love being able to control the amount of saturated fat that my family eats.  I have used this to make ground salmon and ground shrimp as well as for poultry, beef and pork.  My new favorite application for the grinder is to use it to make "whole wheat bigoli".  It is a type of fat Italian pasta.  If you need a recipe go to the foodnetwork website and search for "Bigoli".  I know at least one will come up under Mario's name.  If you learn to love this machine and want to get more into the sausage making realm there is an excellent book "charcuterie" that you might want to check out.  I have also reviewed that book on Amazon if you are interested.  The grinder attachment comes apart easily for cleaning.  I normally take it completely apart and put it in a sink with hot soapy water for a few minutes before hand washing it.  The directions tell you to run a slice or two of bread through the device to make it easier to clean but I don't find that necessary.  I have had this device for approximately 15 years and use it on a regular basis.  I have not had anything break, crack or become dull.  If you want to improve the health of your family by reducing fat and/or preservatives this is a great product to have in your arsenal.  I highly recommend this attachment for any family that is serious about food and/or their health.  I love my meat grinder.
