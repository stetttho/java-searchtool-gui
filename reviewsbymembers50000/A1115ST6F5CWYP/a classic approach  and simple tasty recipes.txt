 I initially purchased this book to give to a family member that has deplorable dietary habits.  Since I am an avid reader I decided to look through it before giving it away, and it is still on my bookshelf today 4 years later.  This author has a nice common sense approach to improving your health.  The first third of this book gives you the nutrition basics.  The second third details the 8-week approach to the plan. The last third is all recipes.  I like the gradual introduction of lifestyle changes.  It is always easier to make a few changes at a time than to make a lot of changes all at once.  The author is very good at encouraging those with a standard American diet and lifestyle to make little changes that will result in big health improvement payoffs.  The recipes in this book are very nice.  Being a numbers geek I appreciate nutritional information that is provided for each recipe.  I use many of these recipes in my everyday cooking not only because they are healthy, but because they taste good too.  If you need to make some healthy changes to your diet and lifestyle, this book is an excellent starting point.  If you are experiencing elevated cholesterol and/or other inflammatory problems that require more drastic changes I suggest you check out books by Dr. Joel Fuhrman and Dr. Richard Fleming.
