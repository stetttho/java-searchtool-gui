 I have a sort of spatula addiction.  I own far too many spatulas and always buy more looking for the "perfect spatula".  This one is a solidly good spatula.    I like that it is wide enough to turn any food that I cook.  It is excellent with delicate food like fish, crab cakes or risotto cakes.   The width of this spatula would make it difficult to use in a tiny pan.  I haven't had any problem with pan size, because I use mostly 10 inch pans and wider.  The bottom inch of the spatula is flexible, and after that it is rigid.  This spatula is a little thicker than I would like it to be.  But, if it were thinner it might be too flexible. I would like this spatula to be just a little more flexible.  This spatula has been used most days in my kitchen for the last 6 months and so far is showing not signs of wear.  It is holding up better than most of the other nylon spatulas that I have purchased in the past.  Overall this is good spatula that I would recommend.
