 My three Turkish Angoras love to play with mice and love catnip.  These mice were a natural for my gang.  They practically knock each other over to get to these mice when the little tin is opened.  I also find that if I put the mice back in the tin when they finally put them down, they are just as thrilled the next time the tin is opened.  I highly recommend this product.
