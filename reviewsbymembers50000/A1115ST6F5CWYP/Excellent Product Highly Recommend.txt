 My husband and I replaced our older Sonicare toothbrushes with this model about 6 months ago.    This model has a number of advantages over the prior model.  1.	You can change the timing from 2 minutes to 2 1/2 minutes for the brushing cycle. 2.	This toothbrush vibrates more aggressively, and does seem to do a better job of cleaning. 3.	The angled head on the toothbrush makes it much easier to reach behind your back teeth.  As with the prior Sonicare model this product holds a charge for a long time (approximately 2 weeks) before needing a charge.  We have not had any problem with it losing its charge while my husband is away on business, and I am at home with the charging base.    The carrying case that is included for the toothbrush is also handy.  My one complaint would be that it would be nice if this set came with two carrying cases.  We all know that we should floss everyday, but who really does?  With this toothbrush I have found that I do not need to be so diligent with flossing, because using the Sonicare seems to make up for the infrequent flossing on some level.  We purchased our first Sonicare toothbrushes on the recommendation of our dentist.  I thought that it was silly and that no one needed a powered toothbrush.  I was absolutely wrong on that.  I highly recommend this product to anyone that has had their dentist say gingivitis or scaling to them.  Our gums and teeth have been much healthier since we started using the Sonicare toothbrushes.
