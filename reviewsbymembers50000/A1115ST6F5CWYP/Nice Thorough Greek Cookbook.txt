 If you love Mediterranean food this is a great cookbook to add to your library.  The author does a nice job with her overview of Greek cooking ingredients.  The glossary of Greek terms is also very useful.  The author has included a nice recipe for a fresh cheese that is lovely.  Just be warned it is made with half and half so your cardiologist will not approve.  I would describe it as Greek Mascarpone.  The book is organized as follows: The Greek Kitchen Appetizers Soups Light Meals Fish and Seafood Chicken and Game Meats Vegetables and Salads Pilafs and Pasta Bread Pies, Pastries, Cakes and Cookies Fruit Desserts, Puddings and Creams, and Candy Sauces  This book is full of wonderful recipes.  I have not made one yet that wasn't a winner and I have made approximately 1/3 of the recipes in the book.  If you are looking for a good Greek cookbook that is fairly comprehensive this is a nice choice.
