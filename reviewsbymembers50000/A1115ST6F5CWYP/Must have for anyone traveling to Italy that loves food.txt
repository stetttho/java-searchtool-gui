 I have used this book extensively during two trips to Italy, which covered approximately 45 days.  This book is invaluable if you want to experience Italy like a "real" Italian.  The author does a nice job explaining the various types of eating establishments (ristoranti, trattoria, osteria, enoteca, tavola calda, etc.) and how what you can expect in those establishments is different.  The author also does a fabulous job of listing the various names for food stores and what they sell.  This is extremely helpful if your Italian is weak or nonexistent.  Also helpful for the first time visitor to Italy is the discussion of how to purchase something in a food shop.  Most Americans are unfamiliar with the concept of paying first at the cashier, and then taking the ticket to the person who will prep your food.  But in a gelateria or pizza shop this is just how it is done.  Also nice, is how the author explains the table charge (or cover charge), what it is for, and that is optional since many locals will stand at the bar to eat.  Regional specialties are covered in this book in reasonable detail.  This is very helpful for getting into the spirit of a place and enjoying what is native to their geography. The Italians are very big on this notion and are fiercely loyal to their own products.  If you want to fit in like an Italian, it is helpful to know how what you order in Firenze is different from Roma, or Venezia.  I have found the authors recommendations on restaurants to be right on target.  Many of the restaurants he recommends I had been in prior to purchasing this book and found that I agreed with his selections.  I highly recommend this book for anyone that loves food, and wants to enjoy the best that Italy has to offer.
