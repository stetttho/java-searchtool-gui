 I initially purchased these because I thought they would fit better in the refrigerator since they were not round, which they do.   I also appreciate the fact that you have to turn a dial to release the vacuum so that it cannot happen by accident.  However, because the dial is not recessed, the containers do not stack well on top of each other without using something as a shim between them.  I wad up a clean kitchen towel into a snake and place it on the top of the lid before placing another container on top of it.  This method seems to work fine for holding things in place.  I do not put these in the dishwasher, so I can't tell you how that would impact their life.  I have had three of these for a couple of years now, and all of them still function as designed.  Overall, I like this product a lot.  They work great for quick marinating of vegetables, something that I do a lot.  I took off one star because they don't stack as well as they should.
