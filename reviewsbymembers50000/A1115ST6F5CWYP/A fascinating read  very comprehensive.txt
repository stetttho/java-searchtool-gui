 This review is written from the perspective of a very serious home cook that has been studying food and cooking for 25 years.  If food is your hobby you will love this book.  The book is laid out in the following chapters: 1.	Introduction 2.	Recipes for Salt-Cured Food 3.	Recipes for Smoked Food 4.	Sausages 5.	Recipes for Dry-Cured Food 6.	Pates and Terrines 7.	The Confit Technique 8.	Recipes to accompany Charcuterie:  sauces and condiments  Why does anyone need this book?  No one does need it.  But in my world there is a distinction between need and want. You will want this book once you see what is inside.   Mario Batali's "Molto Italiano" peaked my interest in curing meat with his recipe for Pancetta.  This book covers any kind or cured meat that you can think of.  It includes recipes for Pancetta, Salt Cod, Prosciutto, Corned Beef, Pastrami, Tasso Ham, Smoked Salmon and Mortadella just to name a few.  With each turn of the page there is a new recipe to drool over.   This book is almost addicting just to read.  The book covers the history of curing, gives many warnings about cleanliness and keeping foods cold.  It even gives you sources for supplies, some of which might be difficult to find on your own.  My only complaint of this book is the lack of glossy photos that I have become so accustomed to in other books.  This minor complaint is not enough to reduce the rating of this otherwise stellar effort.  In short I think this is a fabulous book.  I read this book like most read a novel, only I think I enjoyed it more than that.  If you ever wanted to know how to cure your own meat, this is the book for you.  HIGHLY recommend.
