 This pan holds a perfect frittata for two.  It also holds two salmon or tuna steaks without a problem.  In the 14 months that I have had this pan I have had no difficulty with anything sticking.  If you have more than two people in your family this pan will probably be too small to be useful. However, if you are a one or two person family this pan is just the right size.
