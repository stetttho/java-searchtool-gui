 My family loves warm popovers right out of the oven.  This pan is fabulous for keeping the popovers warm during dinner.   If you are interested in making popovers check out the Chicago Metallic popover pans.  Those pans make popovers foolproof.  I have found that it is sufficient to place this pan on the top of the stove (near the oven vent) while the bread is baking.  Then when the bread comes out of the oven the basket is hot and the bread stays warm throughout dinner.  As long as you place a napkin in the basket before the bread there is really nothing to clean on this basket when you are finished.  A quick swish in a sink of hot soapy water and it is clean.  The tag that comes with this basket says that it is dishwasher safe.  I always hand wash mine so I can't speak to how well this will hold up in the dishwasher.  If you love baking give this product a try, it really does keep the hot bread warm all thru dinner.  If the product does not become available again on Amazon check your local cooking supply stores, I have seen this product at many establishments.
