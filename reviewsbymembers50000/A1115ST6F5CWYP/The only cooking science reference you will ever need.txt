 This review is written from the perspective of a very serious home cook that has been studying food and cooking for 25 years. If food is your hobby you will love this book.    In addition to this book I also own Shirley Corriher's "Cookwise" and Alton Brown's "I'm Only Here For The Food".   If you are just interested in science this is the book to purchase.  This book answers any question that you can image, and it does so in excruciating detail.  If you can think of a food science question this book has answered it.  This book is definitely a technical reference and not a cookbook.  Please do not purchase this book expecting recipes you will be disappointed.  If you are looking for a combination of science and recipes than check out one of the two books referenced above by Shirley Corriher and Alton Brown.  This book is a highly recommend for anyone that wants to know why a particular method is recommended, or what chemical reaction is taking place.   Just be warned this is a dry read.  I use if only for reference, it is far too dry to read cover to cover.  I am very happy to have this book in my cooking reference library.
