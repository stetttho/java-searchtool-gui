 If you have "Southern Roots" you will love this book.  Every time I make a dish from this book I remember my grandmother.  This book is a treasure.  There are a few recipes in this book that won't make a cardiologist faint, but not too many.  But then again that really isn't what true southern food is about is it?  This book contains a nice recipe for homemade English Muffins, and Hush puppies.  If want to make something that is very southern try to Carolina Grits Souffl?.  This recipe turns out very light and delicate and extremely flavorful from the sharp cheddar.  The recipe for Crabmeat Imperial will blow your socks off.  If you aren't a southerner you may not realize that this recipe alone is worth the price of the book.  I highly recommend this book for those that enjoy real Southern Cooking.
