 If you are interested in nutrition this book is an excellent reference.  I refer to this book at least weekly for guidance.  The book is written in a very easy to read style.  The tone of the writing is conversational, as though the author is reading the information to you.  When I first got the book I was a bit skeptical of the information, since it seemed "too good to be true" and I discounted a lot of what I read.  I have found that many recent medical studies appear to confirm the information that I originally questioned.  The book is divided into sections by body system (cardiovascular, digestive, cancer, mood, joint, reproduction).  There is also a section by food that gives you the benefits of specific foods (listed by food) that is very handy.  Another useful section lists needs or concerns (antibiotic, anticancer, anticoagulant, etc.) and then tells you which foods to consume if you have that specific need.  There is an appendix in the back that outlines various vitamins and minerals and the foods that contain them (listed highest to lowest).  If you have an interest in nutrition I highly recommend this book.  UPDATE:  MAY 20, 2006 This book is recommended on page 74 of Andrew Weil, MD's book "Natural Health, Natural Medicine".
