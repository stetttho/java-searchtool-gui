 This book covers everything that a boater needs to know to prepare meals when the entire family will be on board a boat for a week or two at a time.  As soon as you get over the shock and fear of no grocery store for a couple of weeks, run out and immediately buy this book.  The author covers all the aspects of cooking on a boat that you don't initially give any thought to if you are a weekend sailor.  It is just not that easy to store everything that you need, cook while the boat tacks and jibes, and make certain that everyone's nutritional requirements are met.  These things are important and the author covers them all.  The author provides fruit and vegetable storage timelines under various types of storage.  There are tips for cleaning the boats galley that only require 4 substances be contained on board.  The author also provides blank inventory sheets so that you can keep track of what you have on hand so that you are ready to restock at port.  The author also gives you advice of what to buy and where to buy it at most common sailing ports outside the US.  The Caribbean ports are covered in the most detail but the author does address other areas as well.  It never occurred to me that you could make rice, pasta or yogurt in a thermos, but darned if it doesn't work.  And once you boil the water and close the lid you are back on deck.  Would you have thought of gardening on a boat?  Me neither, but this book covers sprouting and tells you how to do it.  If you are planning an extended cruise, this book is very complete, and will be much more useful than you think.
