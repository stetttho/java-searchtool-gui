 I purchased this product to combat "tuna breath" for my felines.  The cats gave it one try and decided they did not like it.  However, I find the flavor to be very mild and nice.  I have placed this in my purse for those times when I am out and away from a toothbrush.  I had been a user of the Listerine strips.  The flavor on this product is vastly superior to the Listerine strips if you prefer a milder taste.  I would highly recommend this product for people.   However, the cats in my home give this product a rating of three paws down.
