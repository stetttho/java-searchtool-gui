 If you have ever had to give a feline a pill that did not want the pill you know what an ordeal it can be.  This device makes it much easier to pill an uncooperative cat.   I highly recommend this product for all parents of headstrong and uncooperative animals.  Additionally, I have been a Revival Animal customer for more than 4 years and have been very happy with both the service and the products.
