 If you are new to cooking with steam this is an excellent resource to add to your library.  When I purchased this book I was not as familiar with steaming, as I should have been.  I find that I use steam more often in my kitchen than I used to since I found out that steaming preserves more the vitamins and minerals that are contained in the food than does other cooking methods.  This book covers the basics of steaming including equipment required and flavoring the steam all in the first chapter.  There are many techniques included in this book that I find myself using every few days or so, even with recipes from other books.  After the basics of steaming the book precedes directly to the recipes.  There is much more included in this book than just vegetables and fish.  I think the best dish I have had from this book is the Gratin of Endive with Ham and Gruyere Cheese.  My only complaint of this book is that it does not contain any photos.  I have become accustomed to glossy photographs of food and find that I really miss them when they are not included.  If you are interested in learning more about cooking with steam I think this is a very good resource to have in your cooking arsenal.
