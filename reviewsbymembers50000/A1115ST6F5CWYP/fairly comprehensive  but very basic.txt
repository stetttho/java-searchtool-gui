 My comments are applicable to the instructor's edition of this book, 10th edition.  I have been studying nutrition and health on my own for years.  I picked up this book so that I could have one comprehensive resource.  Apparently I would have been better to find a book written for a higher-level course or for graduate school.  This book contained no new information from my perspective.  For example, I was disappointed that the book only devoted 4 pages to vegetarian diets.  Obviously, it is impossible to cover all aspects of the various types of vegetarian diets in 4 pages.  If you are looking for a book that covers the basics of nutrition this is a decent resource.  If you have a resonable understanding of nutrition I would recommend passing on this book.  When I locate a more comprehensive and detailed nutrition reference guide I will post an update to this review.
