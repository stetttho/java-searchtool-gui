 This product is excellent to have around if you lose power and still need a good cup of coffee.  Please note this assumes that you have pre-ground beans stashed in the freezer.  This pot is also good for making coffee on a sailboat when you aren't at the marina, or don't want to crank over a generator just to make a cup of coffee.  This pot requires you to have a coarser grind of coffee so that you don't end up with too many grinds in the bottom of your cup.  I recommend a burr grinder that allows you to adjust the coarseness of the grind for this purpose.  Also, I try to never drink the last sip of the coffee just to be certain that I don't end up with a mouth of coffee grounds.  Coffee from this pot tastes best if you bloom the coffee first (moisten with very hot water) for a few minutes before filling the pot with hot water.  Allow the water to stand for a few minutes and then plunge slowly to trap the grounds.  When cleaning this pot it is best to remove the glass from the handle before washing.  I lost one of the glass carafes by not disassembling the pot first.  Apparently everyone does this because replacement carafes are very easy to find.  This is a highly recommend item if you need coffee and don't have power, or if you just don't want to spend a lot of money on a fancy Italian coffee maker.
