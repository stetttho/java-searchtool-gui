 To put this review into perspective for you, it is written by an amateur cook that has been seriously studying cooking on her own for 25 years with the last 10 years spent mostly on Italian cuisine.  My favorite cookbook is "The Professional Chef" by the Culinary Institute of America.  I fell in love with Italian cooking on my first trip to Italy back in 1995.  My love of Italian food continues to grow, and I enjoy adding new Italian cookbooks to my collection.  Italians do not eat as much meat as we do in America.  That makes an Italian Vegetarian Cookbook a natural.  This book is not a vegan cookbook.  There are plenty of dairy and eggs in this book.  But don't let that stop you if you are a vegan.  There are many recipes in this book that are vegan or that can easily be adapted to a vegan lifestyle.  My usual complaint of Italian cookbooks is that they are not truly Italian, but usually more Italian American in origin.  This book is actually Italian which I appreciate.  I love the recipe for Mashed Fava Beans and Potatoes with Arugula.  The Fresh Tomato Tart with Basil-Garlic Crust is also a winner, with or without the mozzarella cheese.  This is a highly recommend for anyone that misses the food they had in Italy, or just wants to cook a little more healthy at home.
