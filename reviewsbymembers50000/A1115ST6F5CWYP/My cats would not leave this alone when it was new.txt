 When this toy first came home the cats loved it.  My husband and I would swing it by its tail and then let it go and the cats would run after it.  Sometimes they would bring it back to be thrown again, and sometimes they would bite, kick and lick the toy as they rolled on the floor with the toy in their paws.  Once the catnip smell wore off (approximately 60 days) the cats were not as enthralled with this product.  I found that if you make catnip tea from fresh or dried catnip and soak this toy in the tea overnight the cats love it again like it is new.  This same trick works for all catnip filled or sprayed toys when their appeal wears off.  I have not tried it with the furry toys, only the fabric toys.
