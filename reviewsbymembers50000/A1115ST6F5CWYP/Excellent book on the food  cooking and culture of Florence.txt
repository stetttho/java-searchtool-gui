 This review is written from the perspective of someone that has been studying cooking for 25 years, and concentrating on Italian cooking for the last 10 years.  I have more than 100 cookbooks on Italian cooking and have traveled to Italy many times.  I am a tough critic on Italian cookbooks.  This book begins with a little history of Italian cooking, the outdoor markets and specialty shops in Florence.  Then the book discusses the following topics from a Florentine perspective: Salumi and Affettati (cured meat) Tuscan Olive Oil Cafes Tuscan Wine Artisan Bread Artisan Cheese Gelato  The recipe section is subdivided as follows: Antipasti Primi (first course: soup, pasta, pizza) Secondi (second course: meat and fish Contorni (side dishes:  vegetables) Dolci (sweets)  The photography of this book is fabulous.  They did a wonderful job of capturing what it is like to walk down the streets in Florence.  As you turn the pages each new photo is another little peak into Florentine life and food.  The recipes are very authentic.  I am especially fond of the recipe for Grilled Florentine Steak with Arugula and Parmesan.  Of the recipes that I have prepared (approximately 80% of the book) all have turned out exactly as I expected them.  A few of the recipes are time consuming.  It is not reasonable to expect to make homemade pizza in a hurry, not if you want it to be excellent.  The recipe for pizza makes individual pies for each diner, as is the custom in Italy.  If you are looking for a nice authentic cookbook on the cooking of Florence, written for Americans you will love this book.  My only complaint is that the book left me wanting more photographs and more recipes.  Overall, this is an excellent book for those that love Italian cooking or love Florence.  A well executed book on the food, cooking and culture of Firenze.
