 I had always been very organized at work.  As a accountant I had no choice.  I had to be able to respond to federal inquiries or IRS audits quickly.  My home was another story completely.  To be honest, my home was a disaster.  I just didn't treat my home like my career.  This book taught me to use the same strategies I employed at work to my home.  Darned if they didn't work like a charm.  Why didn't I think of using a PDA or daytimer at home?  Heck if I know, but now that I do I can't imagine how I functioned without one.  Having a running list of items that I need from the grocery store, hardware store, pet store, warehouse club is indispensable.  Yet for some reason I used to expect myself to remember what I needed when I happened to be near a store.  No wonder my life was in chaos.  I have read this book at least 3 times now and I pick up more tips each time I use it.  If your home is in chaos, or you waste time looking for things because you can't remember where you put them consider purchasing this book.  I highly recommend this book.  It really helped me to change 15 years of bad habits almost overnight.
