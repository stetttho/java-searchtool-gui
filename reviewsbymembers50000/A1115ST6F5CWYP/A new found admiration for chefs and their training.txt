 If you have a cooking question the answer if probably found somewhere in this voluminous tome.  They have even included directions and photos on how to clean a whole squid.  Curious about how to make your own sauerkraut, it's in there.  The directions in this book are extremely well written.  The photos of the products in the all the various stages of preparation are also very helpful.  I had considered myself to be a fairly well versed home chef until I purchased this book.  I have learned more reading this book than I have from the other 500+ cookbooks in my collection added together.  The one warning I would give to purchasers is that most of recipes are given in quantities that are generally too large for one family (unless you have a large freezer for leftovers).   I have not found it to be a problem to reduce the quantities.  For anyone that wants to improve their cooking skills this is an invaluable resource.
