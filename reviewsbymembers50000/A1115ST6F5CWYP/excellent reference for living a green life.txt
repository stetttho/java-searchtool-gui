 I purchased this book because of the positive reviews at this site, and have not been disappointed.  If you want to remove most of the "dangerous" chemicals from your home this is an excellent resource for how to prepare your own cleaning products at home.  The book does cover some of the dangerous chemicals that are normally in the products that most of us buy everyday.  However if you want a more thorough discussion of potential toxins in and around the home check out either "The Healthy Living Space" or "Toxic Overload".  Both of these cover the topic of potential toxins in the home in more depth.  This book does a nice job of covering the basic products that you can use to clean and disinfect your home.  The author gives many recipes in this book for a variety of products.      The book is organized as follows: 1.  The Basics 2.  Housekeeping 3.  Skin Care 4.  Whole Body Care 5.  Gardening, Pets, and Pest Control 6.	House Care and Hobbies.  I was surprised, but pleased, to see that the author included formulas for lip balms, cuticle cream and mouthwash.  If you are really interested in keeping a green home I would suggest a steam cleaner in addition to this book.  I have written a review of the SAECO Piccolo, also on this site, if you are interested.  Overall, I highly recommend this book for those that just beginning to embark on a green home program.
