 If you love to cook and eat Italian food this is the book for you!   To put this review into perspective for you, it is written by a serious student of cooking that has been actively studying food on their own for 25 years.  I have been focusing on Italian food for the last 10 years.  My favorite cookbook is "The Professional Chef" by the Culinary Institute of America.   Each trip my husband and I take to Italy we find new dishes to love that we want to recreate at home.  With Mario's book you can bring your vacation home to your own kitchen.  His directions are extremely easy to follow, dare I say they appear to be foolproof.  My husband loves to look at the glossy pictures in the book and pick out dinner.  If you like to see pictures of the finished dishes this book has plenty of pictures to satisfy that desire.  I use this cookbook on a weekly basis and have been pleased with every recipe that I have tried.  Mario's recipe for Osso Buco (page 363) is worth the price of the book alone.  My husband loves the Chocolate Hazelnut fritters (page 477).   I believe that there is something for everyone in this book.  If you are looking to expand your Italian cookbook library, take a look at the "Harry's Bar Cookbook".  It is written by the owner of the famous bar in Venice, and is a fabulous addition to any cookbook library for those that love authentic Italian food.  You cannot go wrong with this book if you love serious Italian food.
