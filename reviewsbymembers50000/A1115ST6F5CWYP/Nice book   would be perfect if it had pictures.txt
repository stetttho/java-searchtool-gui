 This is a nice cookbook.  All the recipes that I have tried have turned out exactly as I expected (not common for all cookbooks offered for sale).  It is very handy that the author gives recipes for 4 different types of curry paste.  I also appreciate the glossary of Thai terms.  The Fried Cashews with Chilies and Green Onions is a particularly good recipe.  If you like Thai food this is a nice cookbook to have in your library.  Also, if you like spicy food or Chinese food, I suggest that you give this book a try.
