 A serious foodie that has been perfecting her cooking skills for the last 25 years in her home kitchen writes this review. My favorite cookbooks are "The Professional Chef" by the Culinary Institute of America and "Culinary Artistry".  If you love to cook and entertain, this is a great item to have in your arsenal, I love mine.  They can be used for anything that has a crust or a structure, not just a quiche.  They make beautiful fruit tarts, cheesecake, chocolate pecan squares, bar cookies, brownies, etc.  I think they would make beautiful pizzas for a buffet, but I have not tried that yet.  They are very versatile if you love to entertain. These pans are large enough to get 12 generous servings for a buffet.  I cut the item down the middle lengthwise and then make five cuts along the narrow end.  These pans are well made.  They are thicker and more durable than I anticipated. They hold up fine with hand washing.  I do make certain to dry them thoroughly before I store them in the cabinet.  If you love to entertain, I would recommend purchasing more than one of these.  I have two, and now am contemplating purchasing two more.
