 This review is written from the perspective of someone that has been studying cooking for 25 years, and concentrating on Italian cooking for the last 10 years.  As such, I am tougher on Italian cookbooks than other cookbooks.  If something claims to be "The Ultimate Italian Cookbook" it is probably setting itself up for failure in my opinion.  I like the glossy paper and the sturdy construction of the book. I also thought the author did a nice job with their Pasta summary.  The author also did a good job with the detailed directions and photos both during cooking preparation and of the finished products.  The level of detail in this book seems to be designed for beginning cooks.  Most of the recipes are reasonably approximations of Italian recipes.  This book covers the classic recipes that you expect to see.  Right at the beginning of the book I found non-Italian ingredients creeping into recipes.  Cream Cheese is not an Italian product yet it shows up in Celery Stuffed with Gorgonzola.  Clearly this is not an authentic Italian recipe.  Crostini made with standard white sandwich bread!  Again, this can hardly be passed off as Italian.  Then, turkey recipes show up in the book.  I love turkey, however this is not something that shows up in an Italian kitchen.  I never saw turkey in the grocery store in Florence, Italy.  I understand from talking to real Italians in Florence that turkeys are rare, and arrive only in the fall (for the expats) at exorbitant prices.  If you don't have any other Italian cookbooks this one might make sense.  However, if you want authentic Italian recipes this is not the book for you.
