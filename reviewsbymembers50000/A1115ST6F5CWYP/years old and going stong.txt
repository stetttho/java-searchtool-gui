 We purchased two of these for making tea and instant coffee at the office.  They have been working fine for more than 5 years.  I have had no problem with the filter falling out (not a single time).  I have not had any problem with either machine failing to work.  They work quickly every time they are turned on.  I now use one at home to heat chicken or vegetable stock when making risotto or couscous because it is faster than using the stove.  I also like that it is safer than using a teakettle or pan protecting curious little fingers.  I do have one caveat for others.   If you fill the pot right to the top (beyond capacity), when you press the button to retract the lip to pour the water, the steam that escapes is very hot on your thumb.  However, I think this is more an operator error than a design flaw.    Overall, I highly recommend this product for its speed, usefulness and for lasting 5 years with regular use.
