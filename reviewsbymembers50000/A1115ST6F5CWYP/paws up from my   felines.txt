 My cats love to chase anything, including little red dots on the floor, or up the wall.   We usually starting moving the red dot on the floor and letting the felines chase it.  Then we run it up the wall and they jump for it.  At our house we have to put the toy away before the cats tire themselves out.  They will chase the red dot until they see it coming from our hand, or we shut it off.  My felines have chased the red dot for more than thirty minutes at a time  If you need to get more exercise into your cat's lives, this is a good product.  Just be certain to keep one hand around the device, while holding it in your other hand, so the cats can't see that you are creating the spot.  This has been a very loved product in our home for almost 4 years.
