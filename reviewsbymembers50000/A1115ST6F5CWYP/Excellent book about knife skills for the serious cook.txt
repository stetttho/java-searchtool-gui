 A serious home cook that has spent the last 25 years polishing her cooking skills writes this review.  I purchased this book as a supplement to "The Professional Chef:  7th edition" and I very glad that I did not listen to the spotlight review that said it was a duplicate.  This book is clearly NOT a duplicate of the information in "The Professional Chef".  This book gives an extraordinary amount of detail about all things related to and involving knifes and knife work.  With the knowledge in this book it will be much easier to purchase knifes that are right for you, not someone else.  The book discusses knife balance and the feel of the knife in the hand and well as knife construction.  The section on fruits and vegetables was extremely thorough.  The book even managed to discuss a couple of cuts that I was unfamiliar with, which in my mind is quite impressive since I am one of those people that eats 10 fruits and vegetables a day.  I thought I knew everything about prepping fruits and vegetables, but I was wrong. I particularly liked the spiral cut on the whole pineapple.  The section dedicated to meat and poultry is fabulous.  I thought the cartoon drawings of the specific animals underlying skeletal structure were particularly helpful.  The book was worth buying for those very drawings alone.  I might just have to buy a leg of veal this weekend just to practice boning.  If you are a serious cook, and want to improve your knife work this is an excellent book to buy.  I highly recommend this book.
