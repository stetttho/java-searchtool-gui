 This microplane is used primarily for Parmesan and Chocolate in my kitchen.    If you are making a salad, or finishing a cold vegetable dish the standard microplane makes cheese shreds that are very fine, in my opinion too fine.  I prefer to have a larger size shred on my cold dishes.  This grater is perfect for that application.  For cold chocolate desserts this tool is also very handy.  I like to have larger pieces of chocolate shavings on the top of my cold chocolate desserts (tiramisu and chocolate mousse).   When you warm the edge of the large chocolate bar with the palm of your hand for 10 to 15 seconds this tool gives a nice size curl of chocolate.  If you find the fine shreds from a standard microplane too small for some applications give this tool a try.  It doesn't get used every day in my kitchen, but when I need it, I am glad it is available.  I highly recommend this tool to people that are concerned about presentation.
