 First, I am NOT a physician; my graduate degrees are in Business and Finance.    I struggled to some extent to understand this book.   However, it makes more sense everyday.  There is much information in this book that you glean without any background in the sciences.    In the year that I have been using this book it has covered every drug that I researched.  From my perspective that book appears to be exhaustive in its content.  This book is subdivided as follows:  BASIC PRINCIPLES 1.  Introduction 2.  Drug Receptors & Pharmacodynamics 3.

Rational Prescribing & Prescription Writing  Appendix I:  Vaccine, Immune Globulins & Other Complex Biologic Products Appendix II:  Important Drug Interactions & Their Mechanisms  I purchased this book so that I would know what medications were doing within the body.  I am not one of those people that want to rely on others to give me accurate information regarding the health of people that are important to me.  I do not believe that this book is for everyone.  But, if you want to understand what specific medications do, what they interact with, and to some extent what lifestyle changes you can make to reduce the problems the medications are treating, this is a excellent reference.  I highly recommend this book for people that are very serious about understanding the medications that are being prescribed for them and their loved ones.
