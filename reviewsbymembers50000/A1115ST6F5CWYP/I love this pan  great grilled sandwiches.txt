 I received this pan today and I love it.  It made two fantastic sandwiches in less than 5 minutes.  The bread was crispy and had nice dark grill marks without being burn.  The lid is heavy enough to compress the sandwich without any pressing.   If you have a large family this pan might be a little small.  I made two large sandwiches (approx 4 by 8 inches) with focaccia bread and had room for maybe one more sandwich.  This pan was very simple to clean as well.  Cheese that melted in the interior of the pan easily released after soaking in warm water for 5 minutes.  The exterior of the pan is enameled, as the description states.  However, the interior of the pan appears to be seasoned cast iron, not enamel as is reflected in the description.  This in no way detracts from the functionality of the pan.  I prefer the cast iron to the enamel. Properly seasoned cast iron is more non-stick than enamel.  I would highly recommend this pan to anyone that wants to make panini but doesn't want another appliance to sit on the counter.
