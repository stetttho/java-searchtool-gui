 This review is written from the perspective of a serious home cook that has been studying cooking for 25 years, and concentrating on Italian cooking for the last ten.  This book is a wonderful addition to any Italian cookbook library.  If you were looking for a good basic Italian cookbook to begin you Italian cooking library this would make a wonderful start.  This cookbook is simple Italian cooking at its best.  Most of the recipes in this book are quick (Panettone excluded).  I always use the cannoli recipe from this book it just works.  The author also does a nice job of highlighting the regional differences in preparing dishes.  I highly recommend this book for anyone that is interested in Italian cooking.
