 This review is written from the perspective of a foodie, and former hospital administrator that is very concerned about health and nutrition.  If you are trying to switch from dairy to soy milk this product tastes great.  Both my husband and I have switched from Land-O-Lakes half and half in our cappuccino to this Silk Organic Vanilla Soy Milk and we are satisfied that it is a reasonable substitution.  If you are concerned about pesticides and other "unnatural additives" this product is organic (yeah!).  The Nutrition Facts from the side of the box are as follows:  Serving Size:  1 cup Calories:  100 Calories from fat:  30 Total Fat:  3.5 g Sat Fat:  0.5 g Cholesterol:  0 mg Sodium:  95 mg Potassium:  300mg Total Carbohydrates:  10 g Dietary Fiber:  1 g Sugars:  7 g Protein:  6 g  I was concerned about the added sugars in this product.  I checked my copy of "The Nutribase Nutrition Facts" to see how this product compares.  Low and behold the powdered soy milk by Soyamel also has 10 total carbohydrates.   Then I checked to see what the Vegetarian Resource Group (VRG) had to say about soy milk. According to VRG's website soymilk "Products have between 0 and 27 grams of sugar in an 8-ounce serving."  I don't know if any of you have tried unsweetened soy milk, but all I can so is that it isn't something that I would voluntarily consume.  I am satisfied that this product is in the lowest 1/3 of the available products on the market in terms of added sugar.  I would certainly prefer organic sugar to artificial sweeteners in my soy milk since unsweetened soy milk is not an acceptable answer.  In summation, Silk's Organic Vanilla Soy Milk tastes great.  From a nutritional perspective it isn't as healthy as unsweetened soy milk, but it is much better than dairy milk and also better than not drinking soy milk at all.  And the best part is that my family will drink it without complaint.
