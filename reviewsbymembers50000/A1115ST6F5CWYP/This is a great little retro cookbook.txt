 I got this book from a girlfriend of mine after her mother passed away.  I have been using this book for more than a decade.  It is definitely a little retro, but I still find it to be a very useful book.    The first part of this book covers crepe pans, crepe batter, troubleshooting problems with your crepes, and menu ideas.   There are 26 different recipes for crepe batters included in this book.  The other recipes are divided as follows:  Poultry Seafood Meats Foreign Intrigue (this is a particularly cute retro section) Cheese and Egg crepes Crepewiches Vegetable crepes Appetizers Desserts Sauces  The recipes are very easy to follow and don't rely on hard to find ingredients.  All the recipes that I have tried from this book (which would be most of them by now) have been very good.  I think my favorite is the one the author calls "Polynesian Crepes" that is filled with onions, pineapple, green peppers, ham and a sweet and sour sauce and then topped with chopped macadamia nuts.  I think this book is much better than most people would expect it to be.  If you are into the retro thing, or just want to make better crepes give this book a try.  I don't think that you will be disappointed.
