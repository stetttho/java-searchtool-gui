 I purchased this product because it was recommend on America's Test Kitchen.  I didn't expect much, but I was wrong.  The serrations do seem to improve the cutting ability of this blade.  I find that I reach for this peeler more frequently than I do my non-serrated peeler.  It not only works well on tomatoes, but also on lemons, asparagus, sweet potatoes and butternut squash.  I believe that this peeler could function well as the only peeler in a kitchen.  If you need a new peeler, try buying one of these before purchasing a standard peeler.  I have been pleasantly surprised at how well this peeler works on both delicate and hard vegetables.
