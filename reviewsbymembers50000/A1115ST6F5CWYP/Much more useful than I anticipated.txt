 Since I am one of those people that has every kitchen gadget known to mankind I wasn't certain this would get much use in my kitchen.  I was wrong.  With this mixer and its balloon whisk attachment, which is included, I am able to do anything that I previously used a non-powered whisk to perform.  There is an optional attachment to turn this into an immersion blender, for those that don't already have one.  I expected this mixer to be heavy, like all the other kitchen aid appliances.  It is much lighter than I expected, which is a good thing.  My arm did not tire using this mixer as much as it would with a regular balloon whisk.  Having the power buttons integrated into the face of the machine makes this appliance much easier to clean than the older machines with the buttons.  No little crevices for "crud" to accumulate.  America's test kitchen rated the Kitchen Aid mixer (7 speed) very highly which is why I purchased this one.  This is a highly recommend item, in my opinion.
