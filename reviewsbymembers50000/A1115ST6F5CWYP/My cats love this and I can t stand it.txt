 This is the feline equivalent of the Macarena.  It is cute at first, but after about 15 minutes it is really annoying.  I only bring this out occasionally because it is so irritating.  The problem is that as much I as dislike it, that is how much the cats love it.  I find this toy to be a great distraction for the cats when I need to get something done in another part of the house.  Always hide this thing, or turn it off, before you go to bed.  It is so loud that it woke both my husband and myself up the first night we had it when the furry babies decided to play with it after midnight.  If the cats run your house, buy this product they will love it.  If you are the ruler of your house (congratulations, please tell me your secret!) then leave this product at the pet store, it is darned irritating.
