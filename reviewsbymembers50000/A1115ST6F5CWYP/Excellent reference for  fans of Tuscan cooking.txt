 If you have been to Toscano and loved the food, then buy this book.  Reading this book and looking at the pictures is just like being transported back to Tuscany.  If you are looking to expand your collection of authentic Italian cookbooks this book will make an excellent addition to your collection.  The directions are well written and easy to follow.  Each of the recipes that I have tried has been fabulous.  The Mushroom Carpaccio is a knock out of a recipe.  The recipe for Pureed Vegetable Soup with Parmesan Foam is also a winner.  If you are fan of potatoes, the Mashed Potatoes baked with eggs and cheese is also fabulous.    There is a recipe in the back of the book for making your own wine vinegar that I am dying to try.  Who knew that you could make a mother from broken spaghetti?  That recipe has me really intrigued; I just haven't tried it yet.  I love the stories of growing up in Tuscany, and the beautiful pictures of the Tuscan countryside.  This book is a winner for anyone that has traveled to Tuscany and fallen in love with the food and the people.  I highly recommend this book to anyone that loves Tuscany, or wants to.
