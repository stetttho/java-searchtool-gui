 This review is written from the perspective of a former hospital adminstrator, with just under 2 decades of experience in the healthcare system.  Too often by the time a patient gets to the hospital, the cumulative damage of years of uninformed choices has taken its toll.  If you follow the recommendations in this book, you can reverse the effect of many of your prior bad choices.  If you have been studying nutrition and health for a while this book probably doesn't have anything new to offer. Much of the information contained in this book is also covered in "You the Owner's Manual" by the same author, and Dr. Oz.  If you are just beginning to investigate lifestyle changes this book is solidly sourced, and easy to read.  The chapters are titled as follows: 1.	Look Younger, Live Longer 2.	What's Your Real Age? 3.	Get Younger Every Day 4.	Keep the Blood Pumping 5.	The Immune System 6.	Live Smart in the Aging Environment Around You 7.	Stress Less 8.	Eat Real Chocolate 9.	Three Workout Choices to Age Less 10.	Vitamin Power 11.	Daily Dose of Goodness 12.	A Doctor's Note 13.	Be Eighty, Feel Fifty-Two  The author includes an easy to use table that allows you to calculate your "real age".  The benefit of this table is that it allows the reader to easily pinpoint what specific behaviors they partake of that are the most detrimental to their health.  For example lets assume that you consume a particular number of 4 oz cups of brewed tea every day.  If you drink 6 cups everyday you get to deduct 1.5 years, for 3 to 5 cups deduct 1 year, and for 1 to 3 cups deduct 1/2 of a year.  The doctor also gives the reader 78 quick fixes to reduce their real age and gives them the "real age" benefit of making those changes.   For example if you start to both floss and brush everyday you get a real age benefit of 6.4 years.                               The doctor explains that the three most important factors that affect aging are: 1.	Aging of the Arteries 2.	Aging of the Immune System 3.	Social and Environmental Factors The book also tells you what to do about the factors above that affect our aging.  The doctor does a nice job of explaining why he makes the suggestions that he does for improving your arteries and immune system.  The book is full of "Real Age Makeover Success Stories" that are very motivational.  Overall, I think this is a very solid book. The author has developed an original methodology for putting health and nutrition science into a measurable system.  If you are new to the study of health and/or nutrition this is an excellent addition to your library.
