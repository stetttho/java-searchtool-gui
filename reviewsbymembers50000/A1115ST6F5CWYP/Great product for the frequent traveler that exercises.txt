 If you travel for work and never know whether you will have a gym nearby this little band fits nicely in a suitcase (it takes up about as much room as two pair of socks).  As a woman, I find this to be enough of a workout when I add pushups, sit-ups, dips, lunges and squats to the band workout.  However, men may find one of these is not adequate tension for a good workout.  The handles are small, and I would suggest buying two to provide extra tension for those more serious exercisers.  The manufacturer printed a diagram of the exercises on the face of the band, which is quite helpful.  The exercise name and muscles worked listed on the band are as follows:  Lower Body workout 1.	Leg Lift (buttocks) 2.	Leg Extension (quadriceps) 3.	Outer Thigh Lift (abductors) 4.	Inner Thigh Life (abductors) 5.	Lower Back and Leg Stretch (calf/hamstring) 6.	Leg Curl (hamstring)  Upper Body workout 1.	Arm Raises (deltoids) 2.	Arm Curl (biceps) 3.	Stretch Out (shoulders/back) 4.	Arm Extension (triceps) 5.	Back Row (Lats) 6.	Chest Fly (pectorals)  Once you get used to this band you will find that you can use it for exercises that aren't on the band.  One example of this is a tricep exercise that I do where I grip the band with one hand that is placed in the middle of my back.  The other hand is behind my neck holding onto the handle.  I pull the top hand toward the ceiling.  If you have enough tension on the band this makes a nice tricep workout.  The exercises that you can do with this band are only limited by your imagination.  If you want a product that takes up very little space in a suitcase but is still an effective exercise device I would recommend that you give this product a try.
