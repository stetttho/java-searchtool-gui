 My husband and I received two of these last week (one silver and one black). So far, we have had no problems with the phones or the service from Cingular (we switched from Nextel). Cingular was able to transfer our old phones numbers over to these phones without an interruption in service.   I have not had any problems with the volume on this phone, as others have indicated in their reviews.   I have also not had any problems with dropped calls, as others have experienced.   The phone itself is very intuitive to use. I have not opened the book that came with the phone and have been able to do everything that I needed the phone to do. It is simple to input numbers into the phone book. I also like the alarm function, which is also easy to use. The camera function was very intuitive, as was changing the placement of the fuctions on the screen.   The phone is very slim and lightweight. You can hardly tell that you have it in your pocket.   The speaker phone is very clear when you are in the car, or the office. Much clearer than our previous Motorola phone that we had with Nextel.   The screen is very bright, making it easier for old tired eyes to read it without their reading glasses. Not that we are telling ages here.   At this point I am very satisfied with my purchase of this phone from Amazon. If my opinion changes for any reason I will update my review.
