 I have had a few of these in my kitchen for years now. I can't imagine cooking without them.  I use them for everything that goes into my oven when I don't want fond (browned bits in the bottom of the pan).    I roast chicken breasts with a honey and garlic glaze on them.  I also use them on my counter to knead bread dough and pasta on.  They are fabulous for cookies.  They work well when I make whole-wheat biscuits on them as well.  They are also nice to roast vegetables on in the oven.  I use mine most frequently with high heat (500 degree) oven roasting of vegetables (onions, asparagus, sweet potatoes).  The vegetables always turn out great and the pan is easy to clean.  I only wash these by hand, due to their size.  So I can't tell you if they will hold up in the dishwasher.  I know another reviewer recommended two (one for savory and one for sweet) but I have not had any problem with mine absorbing flavors even though they are hand washed.    I find that they store best flat.  I keep in mine in the bottom of my half sheet pans.  That way they are ready to go, and don't try to curl up on the edges.  If you use your oven often, or bake a lot of cookies I highly recommend this product.
