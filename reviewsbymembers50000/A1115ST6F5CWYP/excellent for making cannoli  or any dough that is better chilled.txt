 I purchased this product on a whim and I love it.  This chilled rolling pin made it so much easier to roll out very thin cannoli dough.  Using this rolling pin I was also able to turn out a very tender and flaky tart crust.  It works well with sugar cookie dough too.  I use this rolling pin when I have a pastry product that calls for ice water or cold butter in the recipe.  I place my rolling pin in the freezer while I mix the dough, sooner if I plan my baking in advance.  If you have any difficulty with the pin being too cold to comfortably work with I found that by using just my palms and keeping a warm towel nearby really helped.  This product is very easy to clean.  A little soapy water and quick swipe and it is ready for use again.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone that regularly works with pastry dough.
