 First, this thing really makes a lot of noise on a hard word floor.  More noise than I expected from a reasonably small toy.  Second, my cats did not interact with this toy.  They did watch it shake and rattle for a few minutes, but made no attempt to play with this toy.  This toy got their attention (which is why it got 2 starts) but they showed no signs of interacting with this toy like they do with their other toys.  There are many others toys on the market that are superior to this one.  Overall, I do not recommend this toy.
