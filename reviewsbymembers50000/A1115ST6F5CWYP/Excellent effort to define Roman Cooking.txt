 This review is written from the perspective of someone that has been studying cooking for 25 years, and concentrating on Italian cooking for the last 10 years.  I have more than 100 cookbooks on Italian cooking and have traveled to Italy many times.  I am a tough critic on Italian cookbooks.  This book begins with a little history of Italian cooking, the outdoor markets in Rome, and the distinct differences in the neighborhoods.  Then the book discusses the following topics from a Roman perspective: Coffee Pasta Greens Pizza  Cucina Ebraica (Jewish Cooking) Wine Dolci (dessert)  The recipe section is subdivided as follows: Antipasti Primi (first course: soup, pasta, pizza) Secondi (second course: meat and fish Contorni (side dishes:  vegetables) Dolci (sweets)  The photography of this book is fabulous.  They did a wonderful job of capturing what it is like to walk down the streets in Rome.  As you turn the pages each new photo is another little peak into Roman life and food.  The recipes are very authentic.  I was pleased to see that the recipe for Carbonara did not include the Americanized version which adds cream.  This recipe is for the Carbonara that you would find in Rome.  Of the recipes that I have prepared (approximately 50% of the book) all have turned out exactly as I expected them.  A few of the recipes are time consuming.  But, making homemade stuffed pasta is not something that happens in a flash.  If you are looking for a nice authentic cookbook on the cooking of Rome, written for Americans, you will love this book.  My only complaint is that the book left me wanting more photographs and more recipes.  Overall, this is an excellent book for those that love Italian cooking.
