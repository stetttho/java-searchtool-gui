 To put this review into perspective for you, it is written by a serious student of cooking that has been actively studying food on their own for 25 years.  I have been focusing on Italian food for the last 10 years.  My favorite cookbook is "The Professional Chef" by the Culinary Institute of America.   Giada is such an engaging personality on the Food Network that she is hard not to watch if you love Italian food.  I bought this book and wanted to love it.    However, the recipes are not written for someone that knows Italian cooking.  Her book is marketed to the crowd that wants to cook Italian American not authentic Italian.  Giada avoids Italian ingredients that are only readily available in the major metropolitan areas.   Her recipes are extremely simple, with few ingredients and take no time to prepare.  Given her target audience for the book I feel the book is good.   With Giada's cooking education and family background I expected the book to go into more depth than her television show, it does not.  If you are looking for a book that is a compendium of her show, you will love this book.   However, if you are serious about Italian food buy "Molto Italiano" by Mario Batali instead.  He isn't as stunning to look at, but his recipes are vastly superior.  You might also consider "The Silver Spoon" it contains a vast number of Italian recipes but is lacking glossy photos that are present in Mario's book.  You should also consider "Harry's Bar Cookbook" written by the owner of Harry's Bar in Venice.  It is a fantastic authentic Italian Cookbook.
