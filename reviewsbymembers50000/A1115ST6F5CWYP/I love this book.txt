 I love vacation souvenirs, and this is one of them.  The recipes that I have prepared from this book (probably a third or more of the total) have all turned out very well.  Yes, the book gives measurements in kilos, and liters, and grams.  However, unless the recipe is for baking I just wing it.  There are many sites on the web that will translate the measurements into those that Americans are more familiar with.  I just don't find that necessary.  The only ingredient that turned up in this book that I was unfamiliar with was rusk.  With a quick Internet search I was able to determine that rusk is like a breadcrumb or a Melba toast crumb (both worked fine when I tried them).  I assume that if you run into any other ingredients that you are unfamiliar with you can find out what they are with a similar Internet search.  The photos in the book are very helpful so that you know what the dish should look like when you are finished.  The recipe for garides youvetsaki (shrimp in the pot) is amazing.  The recipe has shrimp, feta, tomatoes, onions, parsley and oregano.  I added white wine and orzo, and this dish is fabulous.  You will find some unusual ingredients (mostly cheeses) in this book.  I have been able to find all of them at my local Whole Food's or Wegman's.  I also imagine many of them are available at Amazon's gourmet food section.  I highly recommend this book to anyone that likes Greek food and wants to prepare it at home.  I have enjoyed this little vacation souvenir very much for the last 9 years or so.
