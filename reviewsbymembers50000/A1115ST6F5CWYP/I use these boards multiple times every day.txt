 These flexible cutting boards do exactly what I purchased them to do.   1. eliminate cross contamination by making it easier to keep the meat off the vegetable board.   2. keep me from scarring my counter or wooden board.   3. make it easy to transfer cut food directly into the pan without getting my dough blade dirty (I used to use this to move chopped items from the cutting board into the pan or bowl).  These boards are reasonably thin, which is why they are flexible.  I have had two sets for approximately 5 months and will be replacing them soon because they are starting to show significant scarring which I am concerned is accumulating dirt.  For those that aren't as obsessive compulsive the boards would probably last twice as long.  My wear patterns are from extreme use.  I cook everyday and usually for all meals for my family.  Since we began concentrating on eating more fruits and vegetables, these boards have gotten a serious workout and have held up better than the other flexible boards that I have tried.  I use these so often that they never make it into the dishwasher.  They are easy to wash by hand, and I like to soak them in a weak bleach solution (10%) every day just to be certain they are clean.  I wasn't certain these would hold up to the daily bleaching, but they have.   My only complaint is that these slide around a little on the counter.  I have found that if you place them on top of a wooden cutting board they do not move around so much.  It also works if you place a silicone pastry mat (Silpat) or a couple of silicone potholders under the mat.  I highly recommend these to anyone that is concerned with cross contamination.
