 If you are a trying to increase your consumption of tea in general, and green tea specifically to increase your antioxidants this is a good place to start.  In the past I have found green tea to be a little bland.  This tea has a little more flavor than most teas, and therefore is more like the standard black tea that most of us of accustomed to.    I would also suggest the Earl Grey and Irish Breakfast green teas for the same reason, more flavor.  Try making a pitcher of tea with half green tea and half black tea.  My husband (a green tea hater) will even drink tea prepared in that half and half manner without complaint.  I highly recommend this tea for those that are looking for a green tea with more flavor.
