 This book is enormous both in scope and size.  The authors attempt to cover a very large topic in one volume.  Even with more than 500 pages there would be no way that this book could possibly cover everything.  However, the authors do a great job of trying to address every possible region and nationality of cooking that is found in the US.  If you love to cook, or eat, and find yourself knowing more about another country's cuisine than your own, this is valuable asset.    The photography in this book is beautiful and the narrative regarding the topics is very well done.  There are many quirky topics covered in this book, for example the story of Tabasco.  These offbeat topics add to the understanding of the evolution of American cuisine in a way that would be difficult to comprehend as a foreigner.  The book is subdivided as follows: American Breakfast New England Pizza New York City Passover Mid-Atlantic The Classic Diner The Midwest Hamburgers and Hot Dogs Great Plains Soft Drinks The South Ice Cream New Orleans and Louisiana Halloween Texas Snacks The Southwest Easter The Mountains Supermarkets California Christmas The Pacific Northwest and Alaska The American Kitchen  The authors cover some topics in more detail than others.  For example pizza is addressed on 2 pages.  However, given the scope of this undertaking they had to cut off somewhere.  There are more recipes included in this book than most cooks will ever prepare in their kitchen.  As far as usefulness in the kitchen this book is a little too large to fit comfortably on the typical countertop.  I have found it easiest to copy the recipe and take one sheet of paper into the kitchen instead.  If you are looking for a reasonably comprehensive guide to American food this is a worthy investment.
