 I should explain that both my husband and myself practiced the dietary concepts put forth in the book and they resulted in an increase in both total (from 197 to 230) and bad (LDL) cholesterol.  Therefore, I do not advocate following the practices that the book advocates.    No harm, we were able to correct the problem by eliminating animal products and now have excellent cholesterol (total cholesterol in the 110-120 range).  I want to emphasize that the dietary practices that this author advocates (while seemingly common sense) don't work for everyone.  At least they did not work for my family, and we were very diligent.   If you just use this book as a cookbook it is fine.  There are many healthy recipes contained within this book.  I have tried many of the recipes and they were very good.  You just need to be selective about the recipes, because some of them are very high in animal fat.  There are obvious errors contained in this book.  For many years now the concept of food combining for vegetarians has been thought to be passe.  Yet this author still subscribes to this principle.  This is just one example of the problems I noted.  Overall, I give the book 1 star for nutrition advice, and 5 stars for recipes which is how I came up with the 3 stars.
