 My three feline children love their water fountains.  They have two fountains at my house.  PROS: 1.	The cats drink more water because they seem to be attracted to the flowing aspect of the water.  Additional water consumption is good for cats and people. 2.	Since the water is filtered it is fresher and cleaner than a bowl of water.  CONS: 1.	There are little crevices that are very difficult to clean.  I have resorted to using a steam cleaner to thoroughly clean the fountain once a week.  On a daily basis I use a small brush and mild dish soap.  Then I allow the fountain to thoroughly dry to eliminate any bacteria that were not removed with soap and water before refilling with water. 2.	Because the sides are low one of my felines manages to splash significant quantities of water out of the bowl as he drinks leaving a little river on the floor.  I have found that placing the fountain in a half sheet pan solves this problem but gives me something else to clean.  OTHER OBSERVATIONS: 1.	I have not had any difficulty with algae in the bowl or feline acne.  This may to due to my fastidious cleaning routine. 2.	I have also not had any problems with pumps malfunctioning.  But I do take the fountains apart completely every day and clean them, including the pump intakes. 3.	I change the filter every month, just as I do for our household water filter.  No sense in risking bacterial growth for a less than $2 a filter.  In summation I enjoy this product, because the felines enjoy it.  It is not maintenance free, but does result in kitty's that consume more fresh water.  If you don't mind 5 minutes of additional work a day I would recommend the product.
