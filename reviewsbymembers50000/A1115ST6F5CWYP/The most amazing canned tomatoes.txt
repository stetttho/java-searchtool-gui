 If you love tomatoes, you must try this product.  I purchased these a couple of years ago on a whim and they have become a pantry staple.  These are great anywhere that you would use regular diced tomatoes.  I think my favorite is a shrimp pizza with fire roasted tomatoes, basil and garlic.  It is difficult to describe the taste if you haven't had these yet.  The fire roasting does to tomatoes what roasting does to red peppers.  The tomatoes gain a sort of charcoal/grilled taste from the fire roasting.  I could eat these straight out of a can with a spoon and be happy.  These tomatoes have been fabulous in any dish that I have tried them in.  If you are unfamiliar with this product please give it a try.  It is just amazing!  I would give these more than 5 stars if I could.  I highly recommend this product.
