 This pan comes out of my cabinet for all national holidays and most parties.  In fact, since the first batch various members of the family have requested them at every holiday gathering.  I have found that the recipe and directions that comes with the pan works every time and is terrific.  Try adding Parmesan and Thyme as it suggests, the results are sensational.    The basic popovers are also great plain or with a little orange honey butter.  If you have not tried to make popovers, they are extremely simple, don't be deterred.   I believe that anyone, even the most basic beginner cook, will be thrilled with the results the first time.  If you can make muffins or a cake you can make popovers.  They are very, very simple but somehow still manage to be impressive.  The pan is very easy to clean, and I have not experienced any problem with sticking.  Please note that this pan is for the smaller size popovers.  They are wonderful for a cocktail party or as the bread in a multi-course meal.  If you want to stuff them with a chicken of shrimp salad for lunch I would suggest the six-popover pan for that application.  I find that even though I have both pans the smaller pan gets the most use because they cook so much quicker and I don't find it to be a problem to serve big eaters two small popovers allowing the more diminutive guests to choose a smaller serving more easily.  I highly recommend this product.
