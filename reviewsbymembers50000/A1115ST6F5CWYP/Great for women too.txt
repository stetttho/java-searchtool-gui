 I have had this razor for about 18 months and I love too!   I noticed that no women were commenting on the razor for themselves and thought I should mention that this razor does a great job on legs and underarms.  I purchased this one instead of a woman's razor because I liked the self-cleaning aspect of this machine.    This razor has enough battery charge to last for the 15 minutes or more that it sometimes takes us girls to cover all the required territory (unlike a man's face).  I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend that other women consider this product for themselves.  Why should guys get all the high tech things?
