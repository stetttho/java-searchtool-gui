 Using this disk and my Cuisinart is so much easier than grating hard Parmesan on a Microplane grater.  I use this whenever I need more than a couple of tablespoons of hard cheese.  Since I usually make Italian food this disc has been a great help in my kitchen.  If you hate grating your own Parmesan on a microplane give this a try, I think you will love it.  It is also nice for grating dark chocolate so that it melts more quickly in a double boiler.  I highly recommend this product.
