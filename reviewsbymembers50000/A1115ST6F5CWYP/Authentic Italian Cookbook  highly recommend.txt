 This book brings back memories of my wonderful experiences in Italy.   The food that one can prepare from this book rivals the food you get in Italy.  As Americans we seem to think that Italian American food is Italian food, which of course it is not.  But since it is what we grew up eating, it is what we expect.  This cookbook is the authentic article.  If you love authentic Italian food, or you want to, this is a great book to add to your library.  This book even gives you are recipe for homemade hand rolled pasta.  Don't be discouraged if your pasta does not get thin enough when you roll it.  I tried to make pasta once without the pasta rollers, big mistake on my part.  I think you need to be born in Italy to get this right.  But the recipe in the book does work fine with a pasta roller (either manual or KitchenAid attachment).   I can't recommend any specific recipes over another because they have all been good.  However, if you are looking for an excuse to bake something the Zaletti (Venetian Raisin and Polenta Cookies) are a nice little afternoon snack with a cup of coffee or tea.  The photographs of Venice and the food are amazing in this book.  The pictures of the Rialto vegetable market made me long to be back in Venice.  The book itself is well constructed of heavy paper and a stiff cover.   My one minor complaint would be that I would like to see more pictures of Italy and the recipes included in the book.  If you are interested in authentic Italian cooking this book is a winner.  I highly recommend this book to any serious student of Italian food.
