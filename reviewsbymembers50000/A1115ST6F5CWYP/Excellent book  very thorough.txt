 This book is very, very comprehensive.  If you have a question about Organic or Whole foods there is a strong probability that the topic has been covered in this book.  For those that are curious, this is NOT a vegetarian or vegan cookbook.  A full 20% of this book is dedicated to animals and/or animal products exclusively.  However, if you are a vegetarian there are many recipes for you in this book as well.  The authors cover everything from the definition of organic through recipes, and finally organic sources  One of favorite recipes in this book has to be the Eggplant balls.  They are like meatballs, only using eggplant instead.  These have even been consumed by devote carnivores without complaint.  My other favorite is a whole-wheat baked ravioli with sauerkraut in the Friulian (a region of Italy) style that is also very good.  Be warned, this book is huge.  The overall size is that of a coffee table book, and it is 460 pages.  It is a workout just to get this book off the bookshelf and carry it into the kitchen.  But your efforts will be rewarded.  The book is full of beautiful photography, and the recipes are delicious.  I highly recommend this book to anyone that makes to make more healthy food for themselves or their family.
