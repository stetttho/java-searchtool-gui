 Do you need these, no not really.  Are they fun to have, absolutely!  If you are a kitchen gadget person, like me, you will enjoy these.  They are much easier to use than standard kitchen twine because you aren't trying to tie and cut, they can almost be fastened with one hand.  They are extremely easy to open and close.  Additionally, they do not stick to the food because they are silicone.  Have you ever closed a stuffed pork chop with a toothpick and then couldn't find it to remove it?  That doesn't happen with the foodloop.  My set is a bright neon fuchsia; I could almost find them in the dark to remove them.  Surprisingly, they are easy to clean.  They come in a little mesh bag that can be used to contain them in the dishwasher.  Being silicone, nothing sticks to them so that they also hand wash with ease.  I have used them to make braciole (Italian stuffed roast).  They are also great for whole fish (to keep the lemon and herbs inside when baking).   I have used them to truss the legs on a Turkey.  They also worked great when I made an eggplant rollatini.  I highly recommend this product to anyone that has impaired dexterity (arthritis) or wants to remove the kitchen twine from the counter.  These are very useful to have around.
