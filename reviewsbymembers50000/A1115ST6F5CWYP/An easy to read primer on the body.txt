 This review is written from the perspective of a former hospital administrator (non-clinical).   I read this book from cover to cover in one sitting. I found the information very easy to digest. The doctors did a wonderful job of distilling information down to the pertinent facts. They also managed to keep the medical terminology to a minimum. If you want a good, but admittedly basic, primer on the body and health, this is the book for you.   This book now has a place in my living room library so that I can grab it for quick reference. Unless you are a clinician (doctor, pharmacist, nurse, etc.) I think that you can learn a lot from this book.   I thought the lifestyle and nutrition tips were very helpful. If you ever wondered which vitamins you should be supplementing, that is covered. How about fish, should you eat it, should you avoid the mercury? Fish consumption is covered as well. Does your husband need Lycopene to reduce his probability of prostate cancer? How much lycopene does he need? If any of these types of things are of interest to you, I recommend this book.   I have recommended this book to all my friends (not in the healthcare industry) that are looking for a good basic book about the body. It is also a excellent resource for those young adults in college, or recent graduates.
