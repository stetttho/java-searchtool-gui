 These containers really are leak proof and airtight.  They are used most frequently in my home to story dry goods (beans, rice, flour) and for lunches.    I make a lot of soups for lunch.  These absolutely do not leak in the lunch bag, even when they are not upright.  The seal on these containers is fabulous.  The seal will not leak.  Given the closing mechanism, it is impossible to not know whether the container is closed or not.  That might explain why they don't spill.    The products stack beautifully in the pantry.  If you like efficiency, and hate wasted space in the pantry or refrigerator, that is another reason to purchase these.  I highly recommend this product.
