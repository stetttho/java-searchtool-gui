 My cats think this toy is the best.  They have managed to rip open a couple of these they love them so much.  I think they love the catnip and the fact that it is the right length to grab with their front paws and kick with their back feet.  My cats tend to be a little assertive when they play.  Even though they were able to rip the toys opened it took them over six months to do so.  That is a fairly tough toy compared to what they are normally able to do with other toys.  At our house this toy is almost as loved as the little fur covered mice that most cats are attracted to.  I have found that if you store this toy in a zipper bag with catnip it seems to refresh the toy and they are more attracted to it again.  In general my cats seem to enjoy all the products from "Fat Cat".  However, this toy is particular seems to be a big winner.  Three paws up from the felines at my house.
