 I have had this immersion blender for more than six months.   It is wonderful for pureeing soups and sauces in the pot, eliminating the possibility of burning yourself when transferring hot items to the blender or food processor.  I have found that whipping cream is best done in a very cold bowl with a whisk or with a stand mixer.  If you want an easy appliance for whipping cream buy a whipped cream canister that you charge with gas, they work great.  Check out the ISI 2470 Thermo Whip - Polished Stainless canister at Amazon.  The product is also easy to clean if you put the blade end in a vessel of warm soapy water as the manufacturer recommends.  I highly recommend this product.
