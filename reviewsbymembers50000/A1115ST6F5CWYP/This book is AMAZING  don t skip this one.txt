 I love this book so much that I don't know where to start.  To put this review into perspective for you, it is written by an amateur cook that has been seriously studying cooking on her own for 25 years.  My favorite cookbook is "The Professional Chef", this book ties for second place with "Healthy Techniques by the CIA".  Anyone can make a dish taste better by adding cream, butter, eggs or sugar.  But when someone can take most of things away and still come up with food that you want to eat, all I can say is WOW.  If I could nominate this man for sainthood I would.  First, I love that the chef gives you nutritional information on every recipe.  If you are a numbers geek like me, you just need to know the calories, fat, saturated fat, etc. in each recipe.  Second, anyone that can come up with a Caesar salad dressing with 25 calories in 2 tablespoons, and make it take good, is a genius in my book.   There has not been a single recipe from this book that wasn't at least good.  And given the numbers (nutritional information) that is really saying something.  If you want to really be blown away there is a Chilled Chocolate Souffl? with a Berry Consomm? (230 calories) that is mind blowing.  On the down side, some of the recipes in this book are a little labor intensive.  If you don't get pleasure from cooking this might not be the book for you.  However, if you relax by cooking and love to learn new techniques I highly recommend this book.  I would have given it more than 5 stars if that were an option.  This book is definitely at least an 11 on a 10 scale.
