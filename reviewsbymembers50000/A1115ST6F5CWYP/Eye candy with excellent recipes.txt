 To put this review into perspective for you, it is written by a serious student of cooking that has been actively studying food on their own for 25 years.  I have been focusing on Italian food for the last 10 years.  My favorite cookbook is "The Professional Chef" by the Culinary Institute of America.   If you are a serious home cook you will love this book.  The photography in this book is nice and the food styling is beautiful. If you love to entertain and/or you want the meals you serve your family and friends to be gorgeous you will get so many ideas reading this book.  The directions for the recipes are very thorough and well written.  I believe that a serious beginner could follow these recipes without a problem.  I have tried many of the recipes in this book all to rave reviews.  I particularly enjoyed the chapter on foams. The "cream whippers" are expensive, but they are extremely fun to use.    This book does not need to be used just for small bites.  It is as simple as just making fewer portions from the same recipe.   This book is highly recommended for anyone that is serious about cooking.
