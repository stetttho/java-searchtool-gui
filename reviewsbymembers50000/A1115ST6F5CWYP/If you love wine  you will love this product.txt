 I received this about 5 years ago after it was recommended at a wine tasting and I really love it.  If you enjoy wine, you will really get a lot out of this product.  The purpose of this product is to teach in a non-intimidating way the primary, secondary and tertiary aromas and flaws in most common wines/varietals available today.  The kit contains, 21 primary aromas, 7 secondary aromas, 7 tertiary aromas and 5 smells indicative of common flaws found in wines.  The premise of this product is that in order to best appreciate the characteristics of good wine, you must be able to master basic olfactory (smell) and gustatory (taste) factors.  The kit also includes 4 samples of the common gustatory sensations (astringency, acidity, bitter and glycerol).    The wine tasting guide is an invaluable part of this product.  The guide outlines general bottle shape, and what that tells you about the wines origin.  It also shows how the wines fluidity is correlated to its alcohol content.  It also has a nice table that reflects the common aromas in particular grape varietals.  My one complaint about this product is that it ignores Italian wines to concentrate on French, American and Australian wines.   Since Italian wines are my particular favorite I have had to do considerable research to augment the guide.  But, even with the need for research I still highly recommend this product.
