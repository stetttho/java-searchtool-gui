 This is a well written, and beautifully photographed cookbook on healthy gourmet cooking  I love that the book gives the nutritional breakdown on each recipe.  So whether you are counting calories, total fat, saturated fat, carbohydrates, protein, cholesterol or sodium, this book gives all the numbers you could want to track.  I like the table that the author included in the front of the book that indicate which herbs and spices pare best with particular foods.  I also appreciate the table that shows the herbs and spices that are used by regional cuisine.  So if you don't know how to flavor North African food for example, the book tells you to use mint, garlic, sesame seeds, lemon zest or onion.  Most, of the recipes have full color photos in the book.  For each recipe the authors tell you which country the recipe is from.  This information is handy for planning an international dinner.  Specific recipes that I enjoyed were the Syrian Whole Wheat Pita Bread and the Braid of Salmon and Sea Bass with Red Pepper and Sorrel Sauces.  There are also nice Lavash and Whole-Wheat Chapti recipes included that I would recommend.  This book is a large coffee table sized book.  The paper is a heavy weight glossy stock.  The cover of this book is made from a heavy weight backing.  If you were looking for a healthy gourmet cookbook with an international flair I would recommend this book.
