 My husband and I have frozen fruit smoothies for breakfast 95% of the time.  We have gone through our share of blenders in the last 10 years.  We decided to give this blender a chance (because I love my Kitchen Aid stand mixer so much) before stepping up to a Vita Mix blender.  So far it has been a good purchase.  A positive feature of this machine is the ease of taking it apart to clean.  I also like the reasonably quiet operation.  Additionally, the blender does not have any difficulty chewing through frozen bananas or berries.  The machine also has some weight to it making it difficult to knock over accidentally.  I am a little surprised to report that this blender is still going strong after a year of almost daily service.  If you are looking for a serviceable blender at a reasonable price this appears to be a winner.  I will post an update of this machine if it ceases to function as advertised.
