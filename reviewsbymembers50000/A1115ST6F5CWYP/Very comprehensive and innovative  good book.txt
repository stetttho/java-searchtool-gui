 To put this review into perspective for you, it is written by a serious student of cooking that has been actively studying food on their own for 25 years.  I have been focusing on Italian food for the last 10 years.  My favorite cookbook is "The Professional Chef" by the Culinary Institute of America.   If you know someone that needs to know the basic recipes this is an excellent book.  Back when I was learning to cook everyone used "The New York Times Cookbook" and then later it was "The Silver Palate Basics".   This book is just as thorough and far reaching as the other two books that I referenced.  The difference is that the techniques have been streamlined and the directions are more comprehensive.  Of the recipes that I have tried, they have all been good.   If you are a beginner cook, their streamlined methods and techniques do work as well as the longer processes.  I have tried many of their short cuts and was surprised to get reasonable results.  If you are short on time for preparing meals, you might want to give this book a try just to learn their short cut methods.  This is a very nice comprehensive resource for someone looking for a general go to book for a time stretched home cook.  This book includes recipes for almost every recipe that a home cook will ever need.
