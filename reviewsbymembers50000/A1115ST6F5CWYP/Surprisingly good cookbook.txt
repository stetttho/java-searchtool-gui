 To put this review into perspective for you, it is written by a serious student of cooking that has been actively studying food on their own for 25 years.  I have been focusing on Italian food for the last 10 years.  My favorite cookbook is "The Professional Chef" by the Culinary Institute of America.   I purchased this book on a whim prior to embarking on a vegetarian lifestyle because I look to cook with alcohol and wanted to add more healthy meals into our family diet.  I was very surprised by how much I enjoyed this book from day one.   The author includes a nice wine chart in the front of the book for those of you that aren't familiar with all types of wine.  I found it handy since I tend to stick to the Italian wines.  Once I saw the recipe for Limoncello (a family staple in our home) I was hooked.  If you have never made this yourself give it a try.  The recipe is very simple and the end result is addicting.  The recipe for spaghetti with beets is amazing.  I never liked beets until I made this dish.  It now reappears monthly in my home.  Likewise, the chilled prosecco and melon soup is wonderful.  It is such a refreshing start to a meal on a hot day.  How about a Sangria fruit salad, that is included as well.  My only complaint about this book is that it doesn't have the pretty pictures that I love.  If you are vegan this is probably not the book for you.  Although I have been about to successfully adapt some of the non-vegan recipes with trial and error.  If you have been a vegan and a home cook for long time you can probably do the same thing with ease.
