 If you have been to Roma and loved the food, then buy this book.  Reading this book and looking at its pictures is just like being transported back to the Eternal City.  If you are looking to expand your collection of authentic Italian cookbooks this book will make an excellent addition to your collection.  The directions are well written and easy to follow.  The Tuna fish pate recipe reminded me of a dish I had in Trastevere (Jewish section of Roma) and was quick and easy to make in my home.  There is an entire section dedicated to Fritto Misto (Mixed Fry), which you know Romans love if you have been fortunate enough to spend time in Roma.  These recipes are always appreciated in my home.  If you want to try a dish that will blow your mind (and your cardiologist's), the pasta with Gorgonzola and Mascarpone is unbelievable.  How can 5 ingredients taste so sublime?  Leave it to the Italians.  I also love the little tidbits of information that the author passing along about shopping in Roma.  I highly recommend this book to anyone that loves Roma, or wants to.
