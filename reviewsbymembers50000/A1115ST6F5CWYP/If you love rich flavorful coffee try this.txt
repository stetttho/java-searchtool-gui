 If you love Italian dark roast coffee, this is a very enjoyable coffee.  I began drinking this coffee years ago in Italy.   I love the crema that forms on the top of the cup, just like being back in Italy.  I do use a super automatic espresso machine (see my Saeco Magic Comfort review).  So I don't know for certain that it will do the same thing in a drip coffee maker.   I do recommend this coffee to anyone that enjoys a very flavorful cup of coffee.    If you are concerned about caffeine and think you should avoid the espresso roast, think again.  Espresso roast coffee has less caffeine due to the longer roasting process.  If this is new information for you check the Internet, this is well documented.  I was surprised, and the thrilled, when I saw this information.  Just to be certain the information was valid, I did confirm this with a nutritionist friend.  If caffeine was the reason you avoided dark roast coffee, there is a new reason to enjoy it now.  If you normally drink a mild coffee this might not be the best choice for you.  However, if you like dark roast, I highly recommend this coffee.
