 Nice sharp clippers, excellent for cat toenails.  My husband and I can clip all 6 front paws in one sitting.  It took a while to find clippers that all 3 cats liked.  These clippers have been a winner since day one.  It is such a pleasure to be able to do all paws on all cats in one sitting.  We have had these clippers for three years and they are just a sharp and effective as the day we bought them.  I highly recommend this product.
