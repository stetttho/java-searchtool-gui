 Another product that I wanted to love because the idea seemed so good but the functionality did not live up to the design.  When an iced tea glass breaks the first time you put an ice cube in it, that is bad design.  We lost two more glasses later that first week even though we were being very careful.  Of the original four glasses there is only one left and that is because we do not use it.  Don't waste your money.  If you want to try the coffee mugs they seem to be much more sturdy.  We have had four of the 9 oz Pavina coffee mugs for more than 6 months and none of these has broken even with everyday use.  Bottom line, the 21oz glass is a beautiful product but is not serviceable.  I feel as though I wasted eighty dollars and I don't want to see anyone else make the same mistake.
