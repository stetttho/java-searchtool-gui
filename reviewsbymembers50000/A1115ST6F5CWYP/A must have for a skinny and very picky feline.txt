 One of my three current felines is extremely finicky.  When he is refusing to eat, the Nutri Cal gets his attention every time.  The only problem is that when he is getting this he prefers it to his Cat Lax and gives me a problem taking that to keep hairballs at bay.  If you have a feline that needs nourishment I highly recommend this product as a stopgap solution.  Every cat that I have had (now totaling 9) has liked this product enough to lick it from the tube.  Additionally, I have been purchasing from Revival Animal Health for over 4 years now and have been very happy with the service and products.
