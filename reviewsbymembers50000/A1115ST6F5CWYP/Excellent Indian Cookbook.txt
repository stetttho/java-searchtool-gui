 I love Indian food, like most people love Chinese food.  If you are a lover of Indian food, this is a great cookbook for you.  This is not my only Indian cookbook, but it is the most complete Indian cookbook that I have.  In the introduction this book covers the basics of Indian regional cooking (the difference between northern and southern cooking), the composition of a meal, preferred drinks with meals, and the most common ingredients used.  The recipe in the book for Paneer (which is extremely easy) turned out great the first time I tried it.  I was also pleased with all the other recipes that I have tried in this book.  There is a very easy to follow bread section in this book that is particularly useful.  The Mango Ice Cream is really good as well.  This book is well constructed of glossy paper and a sturdy cover.  There are many glossy photos in this book that make preparing unfamiliar dishes much easier.  If you love going out to Indian restaurants, this book will teach you how to make great tasting Indian food in your own home.
