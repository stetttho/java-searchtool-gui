 I use my pitcher as a toothpick holder.  It makes a lovely addition to a buffet table if you are serving Italian food.  It goes well with other pieces of Deruta ceramics or with plain white dinnerware.  Please look carefully at the description this item is very small.  If you like Italy, or Italian food, and like to entertain I would recommend that you pick up one of these.
