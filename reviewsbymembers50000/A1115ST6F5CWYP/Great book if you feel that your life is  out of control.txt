 A close friend of mine recommended this book approximately 5 years ago when I was going through a tough time.  When I first tried to read it, I just couldn't understand what the author was trying to say.  I wanted to remain stuck in the muck and mire, and the "why did this happen to me" state of mind.  I was clearly not ready to hear anything that contradicted my wallowing in self-pity.    The second time I picked up the book the light bulb went off and suddenly I got it.  The author points out that "we create our own pain."  He explains that pain is our own internal resistance to what is happening around us and to us.  He further explains that our resistance to what is happening is due to our judgment that it is not right, not fair, and/or not appropriate.  The intensity of our pain is directly related to how much we are resisting what is happening.   If any of this makes sense, please buy the book you will enjoy it.  If you think that what I just wrote is drivel, best to leave this book on the shelf it is not for you.  I have recommended this to others that were going through a rough time.  Some of them have embraced it and become much calmer people.  Others have thought I was crazy for recommending the read and continued to live their hectic out of control lives.    No, I am not some sandal wearing hippy type.  In fact I am a "reformed and recovering" executive with an MBA in Finance from a top ten school.    If you need to calm down and enjoy your life this might be the book for you.
