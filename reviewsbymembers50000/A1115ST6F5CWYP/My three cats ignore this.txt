 My three cats were curious about this for the first 15 minutes that it was in the house.  Subsequently they ignored it for approximately a year before I threw it away.    My cats are all 4 years old and normally love new toys.  This is one of the few toys that I have brought home that they did not enjoy.  Your cats might be different, but my three were not interested in this even a little.  I would not buy this product again.
