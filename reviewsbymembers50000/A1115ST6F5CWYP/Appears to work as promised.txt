 First, before you buy price compare.  I just picked them up for significantly less.  I bought one initially just for the temperature and humidity measurement not expecting the air quality portion of the device to be worth a darn.  I was a little surprised by how sensitive the device was.  I use the Clorox wipes to clean up some surfaces.  When I got one wipe within 4 feet of the device the monitor immediately raised to unhealthy and an alarm sounded to indicate that I should open a window.  I thought this was a fluke and moved the monitor to my kitchen where I use a gas range top.  Within 30 seconds of starting something on the stove the monitor was rising.    While I cannot say how sensitive the meter is, it is definitely reacting to things that happen in my home.  It has made me aware of the necessity to open windows and air out my house (always a good thing).  Not to mention I always know if the humidity is the healthy range and whether the heating and cooling system is keeping up with the outside temperature.
