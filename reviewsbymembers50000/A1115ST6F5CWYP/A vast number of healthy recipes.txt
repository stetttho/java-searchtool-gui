 I purchased this book after embarking on Dr. Fuhrman's "Eat to Live" plan because I desperately needed to change my cooking style.  This book is approximately 50% recipes and 50% lifestyle changes and the reasons for those changes.  The principles of this plan are also very similar to the book above, and to "Stop the Inflammation Now" by Dr. Fleming.  I have reviewed both of those books as well, if you are curious.  The gist of the plan is a vegan diet, adding exercise, eliminating stress and being grateful.  Common sense ideas that the author tries to tie together by referencing studies and specific client examples.  The book is full on tidbits of information regarding the health benefits of specific foods as they appear in recipes.  If you are well versed in nutrition this information is very basic.  However, if you could use a nutrition primer this is a reasonable one.  My biggest criticism of the book is the recurrent emphasis on religion and God.  I did not expect a religious tie in to a diet book.  Overall the book is full of information and recipes and serves the purpose that I purchased it for.  I give it 5 stars for the recipe content alone.  The remainder of the book I would give 4 stars.  Since I purchased the book specifically for the recipes the overall rating is a 5.
