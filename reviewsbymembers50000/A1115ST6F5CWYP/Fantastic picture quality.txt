 The picture quality of this machine is phenomenal.  My husband had it out of the box, hooked up to all its peripheral equipment, and running in less than 30 minutes.  It is difficult to enjoy our other HDTV sets after being spoiled by this one.  The colors are vibrant and intense and picture is very, very sharp.  I don't think you could be disappointed with this purchase.
