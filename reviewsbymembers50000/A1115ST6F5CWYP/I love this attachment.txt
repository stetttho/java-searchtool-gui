 I have had this attachment for more than a decade and I love how easy it is to use and clean. Unlike some of the other reviewers I never had any difficulty disassembling the attachment when I needed to remove it from the machine. I find this product very simple to take apart and clean.  I find that I use this more than my Cuisinart food processor for shredding because it is so easy to use.  It is very helpful that you don't have to stop and empty the bowl to continue shredding.  That is the single biggest advantage the KitchenAid attachment has over the food processor.  I do usually slice with my food processor instead of this machine.  I think that is just out of habit.  In my experience the attachment is just as efficient for slicing as it is for shredding.  I would recommend this to anyone that shreds a lot of vegetables for carrot cake, zucchini bread, or potato pancakes.  In most cases this attachment will eliminate the need for a food processor.  If you have a small kitchen you might want to give this attachment a try before buying a separate food processor.  This attachment takes up very little room when it is being stored.
