 This is the ultimate pan for making a deep-dish lasagna, stuffed crepes or enchiladas.  I appreciate the heft of this pan and the fact that it holds the heat so well.    If you have a high wall oven and/or are a diminutive female this pan can be a challenge to get into the oven fully loaded.  However, I wouldn't consider not using this product just for that reason.  This product is very easy to clean even if you burn cheese on the sides.  A thirty minute soak in a sink full of hot water and it came right off with a "scrubby" sponge.  I am glad that I ordered this product.  I purchased it on a "Friday Sale" and got a really good price.  If you are interested check the Friday listings I have a seen it on there a few others times since I received mine approximately a year ago.
