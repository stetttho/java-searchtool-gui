 To put this review into perspective for you, it is written by an amateur cook that has been seriously studying cooking on her own for 25 years with the last 10 years spent mostly on Italian cuisine.  My favorite cookbook is "The Professional Chef" by the Culinary Institue of America.  I fell in love with Italian cooking on my first trip to Italy back in 1995.  My love of Italian food continues to grow, and I enjoy adding new Italian cookbooks to my collection.  Italians do not eat as much meat as we do in America.  That makes an Italian Vegetarian Cookbook a natural.  This book is not a vegan cookbook.  There are plenty of dairy and eggs in this book.  But don't let that stop you if you are a vegan.  There are many recipes in this book that are vegan or that can easily be adapted to a vegan lifestyle.  This book is an authentic Italian Vegetarian Cookbook.  I purchased this book in Florence Italy some years back.  Since I cook mainly Italian I turn to this book weekly for recipes.  I love that this book is not only Italian but healthy.  Many of the recipes are whole grain or give a whole grain option.  The whole-wheat crespelle (crepes) are a family favorite at my house.  The Swiss Chard Pizza is also a winner as is the Onion Pie.  If you are serious about authentic Italian food, and you want it to be as healthy as possible, I highly recommend this book.  My only complaint is that it was only available in paperback when I bought it and is now starting to show a little wear.
