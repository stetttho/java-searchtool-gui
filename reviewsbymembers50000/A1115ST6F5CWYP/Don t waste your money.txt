 I purchased this product about 2 years ago.  It lasted less than a year before the blender jar blade came apart.  I still use the mini chopper occasionally for making small amounts of salad dressing or pesto.   This product is also rather lightweight compared to my most recent Kitchen Aid Blender.    I would recommend buying a heavy-duty blender and nice food processor instead if you can spare the funds.
