 If you are like me your mother didn't teach you how to maintain a home.  My family wanted me to have a career not be a wife.  The problem was that I went into the world with no skills in the home care arena.  Finding this book has been a godsend.  Ms. Mendelson covers every topic that you could possibly want to know anything about.  The chapter on hiring help and protecting yourself legally particularly impressed me.  This is a topic that more than a few Supreme Court nominees could have learned a lot by reading.  I have referred to the book many times since purchasing it a few years back.  It is a wonderful resource for stain removal.  I also learned a lot about cleaning to reduce allergens and on how to set up a cleaning system so that the house never gets out of control.    Ms. Mendelson has had a very positive impact on the quality of life at my house.  If you feel as though you are stumbling through the process of cleaning your home, this is the book for you.
