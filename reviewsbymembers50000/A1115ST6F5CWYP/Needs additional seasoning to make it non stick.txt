 I purchased this pan to grill vegetables in the house, not meat.  I quickly discovered that this pan needs a lot of extra seasoning when you receive it if you are going to use it with extremely low fat food.  I only gave it one application of oil and baked it in the oven, and my first batch of Portobello mushrooms stuck terribly to the surface.  Given that this is not my first cast iron pan, and that I have been cooking for 25 years, I expected one heavy application of oil should be adequate for a pre-seasoned pan.  One application of oil is no where near adequate.  If you choose to purchase this pan and cook mostly vegetables, expect to have to spend a couple of days seasoning the pan in order to have your vegetables not stick.  Now that I have spent a week of so seasoning the pan, it is fine, and reasonably non-stick.  But, the paperwork that comes with the pan is deceptive since it claims that the pre-seasoning avoids this process.  I would purchase this product again because I am a little concerned about the perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) that is used in the non-stick process.  But, I would have preferred to have the company be honest about the status of the pans interior when it is shipped.
