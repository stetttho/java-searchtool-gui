 As a woman that enjoys wine and doesn't want to wait for her husband to open the bottle I love this product.  It has been a fixture in our home for more than 5 years.    If you have difficultly opening a good bottle of wine without leaving some cork behind, I highly recommend this item.  It requires little strength or mechanical ability.  You place the bottle into the holder, grip the side handles together and pull the rear lever to the front of the machine.   You have a perfectly opened bottle of wine without cork every time.    As an added bonus the wine opener is attractive enough to leave it out in public view at all times.  I highly recommend this item.
