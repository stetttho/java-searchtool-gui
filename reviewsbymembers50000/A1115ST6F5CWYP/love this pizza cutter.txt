 We purchased this pizza cutter after seeing it recommended by Alton Brown (my husband is a huge fan).  We have not been disappointed with the functionality of this product.    This cutter is easy to store in a drawer (it comes with a plastic guard so that it is safe).  The easy open design also makes this cutter easy to clean.  Additionally, the size and shape of the cutter makes it comfortable in both large and small hands.  I highly recommend this pizza cutter.
