 I purchased this pan a few years ago and I still love it.    Prior to this purchase I only bought the Calphalon non-stick professional line.  Now, I love this copper and stainless line.  This pan is so easy to clean compared to the non-stick.  I clean the stainless with baking soda and a scotch bright sponge and it looks like new (inside and out).  This pan gets really hot (without releasing noxious fumes like the non-stick) and caramelizes things beautifully.  I love to make skinless chicken breasts or fish steaks in this pan.  You heat the pan up first, and then add the oil.  When the oil smokes, you add the meat.  In 3 or 4 minutes the meat releases from the pan and you flip it and caramelize the other side.  The beauty of this pan is the fond in the bottom (brown bits).  If you love pan sauces this pan is fabulous.  Whenever I want to make something with a pan sauce I use this pan and start on the stovetop and then finish in the oven.    This particular pan is huge.  You can make 6 chicken breast halfs at one time and have room to turn them.  I also use this pan to make pasta sauce, and them finish the pound of pasta in the sauce in this pan.  This pan is also great for boiling ravioli, and cooking lasagna noodles.  I can't rave enough about this line from Calphalon.  I think that it is so far superior to the Professional non-stick line that it isn't comparable.  The non-stick pans get very little use in my kitchen now.  With the exception of eggs, I can't think of a single application where the non-stick is superior to the stainless pans.  If you love to cook, purchase anything from this line you won't be disappointed
