 This book covers everything that you might ever want to know about sauce making.  I have given the chapter titles below to help you to understand what is covered in the book.    The chapters are as follows: 1.     History of Sauce Making 2.     Equipment 3.     Ingredient 4.     Stocks, Glaces, and Essences 5.     Liaisons 6.     White Sauces for Meats and Vegetables 7.

Hot-Emulsified Egg yolk Sauces 14.   Mayonnaise-based Sauces 15.   Butter Sauces 16.   Salad Sauces, Vinaigrettes, Salsas and Relishes 17.   Purees and Puree-thickened Sauces 18.   Pasta Sauces 19.   Asian Sauces 20.   Dessert Sauces  The author gives you not only recipes for sauces but he tells you want to do and not to do and how to fix broken sauces if that was not your intent.  The recipes are given in US and European increments.  The does more than just give sauce recipes.  There are many recipes included in this book that are much more than just sauce.  I will list just a few to give you an idea of content:       Coq Au Vin (Rooster Braised in Red Wine)      Lobster a la nage (Lobster in a Lobster Court Bouillon)      Steamed Bass Fillets with Yogurt Curry Sauce Salmon en Papillote with Julienned Vegetables.  My only compliant of the book is that there could be more pictures of the various stages like they included in "The Professional Chef" by the Culinary Institute of America.  All in all I think this is a wonderful book.
