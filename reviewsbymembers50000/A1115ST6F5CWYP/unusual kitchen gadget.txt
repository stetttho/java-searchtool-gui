 If you are one of those people that collect kitchen gadgets like me, the unusualness of this item will appeal to you.  These tweezers are supposed to be used for stir-fry.  However, I found that they were not especially useful for stir-fry.    I find these to be useful for the following: 1.	Presentation (placing individual items on the top of a stack where you need to control the angle of the food that you are "placing") 2.	Removing items from tall narrow jars 3.	Turning small foods that are being deep fried 4.	For serving on a buffet (gherkins, thin slices of prosciutto, etc.).  People seem to appreciate the oddity.  These function like very thin tongs.  The biggest differences from tongs are the narrowness and the attractiveness.  Overall, I could live without this item.  But, I do appreciate the "odd" factor.  I would purchase this product again.
