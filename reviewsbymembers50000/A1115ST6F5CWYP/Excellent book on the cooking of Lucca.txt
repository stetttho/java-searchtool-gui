 The author of this book is American, with parents from Lucca, Italy.  This book is clearly written for Americans but with the authenticity of someone that loves the place of their parents birth.  The book gives a little history of Lucca, which is a beautiful little walled city, if you have not had been fortunate enough to visit.  I loved the discussions of the festivals in Lucca.  Until I read this book I had realized that I visited there during the festival of the holy cross.  The book outlines menus to emphasis different ingredients, a very Italian concept.  The recipes are grouped as follows: Antipasti  Primi - soup, rice and pasta Types of Pasta Secondi - beef, pork, lamb, poultry, fish Verdure - vegetables Sughi - sauces Uova - eggs Insalate - salad Dolci - dessert Formaggio - cheese  Each recipe is rated by a difficulty factor that appears reasonable to me.  The author gives variations for some of the recipes.  The author also has a little wine guide in the back. She gives a description of the Italian wines, and then tells you which foods she thinks pair best with those wines.  There is also a little glossary of Italian terms included.  This book is a paperback, and does not include glossy pictures.  But, the recipes are so spot on that I had to give it 5 stars even without pictures.  Overall, I think the author has done a very nice job of bringing the food of Lucca to America.  If you know someone who has roots in Luca, or just someone that loves Italian cooking, this is a nice addition to a cooking library.
