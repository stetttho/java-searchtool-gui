 I purchased this product because we have a four-story house and I did not want to be stuck near the kitchen to hear the temperature gauge sound.  The range on this product is exceptional.  Being three floors away from the base unit was not too far for the receiving sensor; it still functioned as it was designed.    I have also been outside the house in the yard and the sensor still worked appropriately.  I use this product mostly in the oven.  If takes the guess work out of large cuts of meat. The beef temperature that is preset is too high for my taste.  But, I know this and just monitor the temperature and know that the alarm will not sound until the meat is overcooked, in my opinion.  As one of the other viewers indicated you do have to "synchronize" the base and receiving until by pressing the reset button on both items after installing the batteries and turning both products on.  Check the directions, they spell out the process.  The belt clip and/or table stand is a nice feature of the product.  Another highly recommend product.
