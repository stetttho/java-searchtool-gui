 I have had this bag for a number of years. I use it when I am just taking one cat out for a trip to the pet store or to visit friends.  I like the fact that it does not look like a pet bag.  It just looks as though I am carrying a tote bag.  I have had the bag, and a kitty with me an people have not noticed.  At least that is my assumption since we were in outdoor cafe and no one told me that it was against health code.    The cats love this bag.  I think they feel safe due to the small interior size.  My cats are 5, 7 and 9 pounds and all fit fine.  If your cat is larger than 12 pounds (the size of the largest cat that has been in the bag) I would try the bag out with the cat to make certain that it is a good fit.  This gets a high rating from both the cat mother, and the three cats.
