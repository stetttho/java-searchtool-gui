 This review is written from the perspective of someone that has been studying cooking for 25 years, and concentrating on Italian cooking for the last 10 years.  I have more than 100 cookbooks on Italian cooking and have traveled to Italy many times.  I am a tough critic on Italian cookbooks.  This book is subdivided as follows: Introduction Openers Side Dishes Pasta Main Dishes Finishes Basics Resources  The introduction is a history of the making of Balsamico.  It explains the guidelines under which the product must be produced to be labeled as Balsamico.  If you love Balsamic vinegar, you will love the recipes in this book.  I am always looking for new ways to use Balsamic, which is why I purchased this book.  The recipes in this book will be very familiar to those that know a lot about Italian cooking.  Some of them differ from the originals by the addition of the Balsamico.    My criticism of the book is that it is too short.  The recipes that are included are very good.  But, there are just not enough recipes included in this book.  I don't think that 47 recipes is an adequate number for a book.  I would give this book a rating of 5 stars for the complete picture of the production of Balsamic.  Due to the small number of recipes that section only warrants 3 stars.  The overall score for this book, in my opinion, is 4 stars.
