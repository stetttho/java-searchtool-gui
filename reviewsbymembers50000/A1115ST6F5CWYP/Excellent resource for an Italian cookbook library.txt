 This review is written from the perspective of a serious home cook that has been studying cooking for 25 years and concentrating on Italian cooking for the last 10 years.  This book is targeted to anyone that wants to learn the history of Italian cooking. This book is full of both information and recipes.  This was one of my first Italian cookbooks, and is still one of my favorites.  This book is an authentic Italian cookbook not the Italian-American type that we are accustomed to in the USA.  If you want a good comprehensive book on authentic Italian food this is one of the books that I would recommend.  However, if you are a beginner Italian cook, this is not the book for you.  The directions are written for someone that is familiar with the Italian kitchen.  The author assumes you have a basic knowledge of the Italian kitchen and typical recipes.  One complaint, and it is minor, is the lack of glossy photographs that I have become so accustomed to in cookbooks.  The recipes in this book more than make up for the lack of photographs.  Overall this book is highly recommended for those that are serious about Italian cooking.
