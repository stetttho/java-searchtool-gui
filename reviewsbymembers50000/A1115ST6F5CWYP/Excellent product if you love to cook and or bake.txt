 If you are a frequent baker or cook this is an excellent product to own.  I use this on my counter top for easy clean up.    This mat makes it much easier to make cannoli, cookies, or pie dough.  I also use it to keep my counter clean when I am kneading bread dough or making gnocchi.  The smooth side of this mat has inch marks to guide you in rolling or stretching dough to a specific size.  This mat is also nice to use as a counter top protector to place hot pots directly on without scratching or burning your counter.  It is great to place under your cutting boards to keep them from sliding around.  This product is a little difficult to clean due to its size.  The manufacturer states that you can put it in the dishwasher.  I have not tried this because it is so large that it would take up the majority of the top rack of the dishwasher.  It will clean up with hand washing.  However, it does have a tendency to pick up lint.  I find it best to allow it to air dry.  I store it in the tube it came in.  It immediately lays flat when removed from the tube.  This mat is much thicker than the standard Silpat which has a tendency to curl on the edges if stored in a roll.
