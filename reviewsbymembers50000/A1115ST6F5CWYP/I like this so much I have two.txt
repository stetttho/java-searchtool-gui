 I do a lot of baking from scratch and I liked this product so much that I have both a 2-cup and 1-cup version of this product.  I have not found this product to be difficult to use or to clean.  You do need to slide it completely apart to clean it, but that only takes a second.  I do wash mine by hand but that is only because they are used so frequently.  I am certain that they would clean fine in the dishwasher once the sleeve was disconnected from the cylinder.  I would recommend this product to anyone that is a frequent baker.
