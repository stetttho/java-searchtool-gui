 My three Turkish Angoras love to play with their mice.  We must have 200 of these little furry mice in the house (most of them usually behind the TV or under the furniture).  I have found that if you put the mice in a ziploc bag of catnip for a couple weeks before you give them to the cats they love them even more.  I highly recommend this product.
