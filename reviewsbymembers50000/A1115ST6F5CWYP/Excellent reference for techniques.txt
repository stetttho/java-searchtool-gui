 To put this review into perspective for you, it is written by an amateur cook that has been seriously studying cooking on her own for 25 years with the last 10 years spent mostly on Italian cuisine.  My favorite cookbook is "The Professional Chef" by the Culinary Institute of America.  This book covers the basics of cooking from the tools of the trade, to chopping vegetables, and making stocks.  If you need a good reference for the basics this is a nice and very thorough book.    The one oddity I did note in this book is the section on preparing a crab.  According to Le Cordon Bleu, live crabs should be frozen for one hour and tied up like a roast of beef prior to boiling.  That was a first for me.  I caulk this up to French overkill.  This book does a wonderful job of photographing the various stages of the process they are describing making it very easy to follow their directions.    They have also included a number of recipes (they count them as 200) to use your new found culinary skills.  All in all (crab directions aside) this is a nice reference book.  I purchased it prior to "The Professional Chef" which I referenced above.  If I could have only one book on the basics it would be "The Professional Chef".  However, this book is very nice, and doesn't take up nearly as much space on the bookshelf.
