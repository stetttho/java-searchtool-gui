 The three Turkish Angoras in my house think these tunnels are "the bomb".  We have hooked three of them together and the feline "children" love to run through the tunnels and pop out of the other end and pounce on unsuspecting siblings or human parents.  The felines also like to run across the top the tunnel, sort of trampoline style.  I don't know if all cats will do that though, my "kids" are little (5, 7 and 8 pounds). They also enjoy attacking the furry balls that are attached to the interior with string.  We frequently find the tunnel rolling along the floor as the play with the interior balls.  We have had this product for 4 years and the "kids" have not lost interest in their toy yet.  On the down side the tunnels are a problem to clean on the inside.  The only thing that I have found to get the cat hair out of the inside is the vacuum cleaner.  If you don't own a canister vac, I would try a damp sponge.  The exterior of the tunnel is nylon and can be wiped clean if it gets soiled.    Cleaning issue aside since cats rule in my home we give this product three paws up.    Feline recommended and mommy approved.
