 I have three of these for my three felines.  Everyone in our family (cats and human parents) likes these bags.  I can line up three of these bags in the second seat of my Suburban and seat belt everyone in for trips to the veterinarian.  I like that the cats feel secure in the bags.  Be warned if you have intelligent animals you might want to tie the zippers together.  One of my little Einstein's figured out how to use a claw to unzip the bag.  We now use twist ties to secure the zippers.  The zip ties work like a charm.  Now the cats are securely in the bag.  The removable fleece-like pad is also nice in case the animal get scared, it is washable.  For storage the bags fold flat and don't take up much room.  When you are juggling luggage and cats the shoulder strap is quite handy.  We liked our bags so much that we recommend them to our brother-in-law for his poodle.  He works for an airline and his dog flies in this bag with no problem.  Please note, this bag is only suitable for in the aircraft, not in cargo.  If you travel with your pets I highly recommend this product.  Out family has been very pleased with the purchases.
