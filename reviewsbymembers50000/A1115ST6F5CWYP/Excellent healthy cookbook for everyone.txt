 If you are just looking for ways to make healthier meals for your family this is a winner whether you are a vegetarian or not.  The premise of the book is to increase the whole grains, and decrease sweeteners and refined products.  These suggestions are good for everyone.  Being a numbers geek I appreciate that the book gives all the relevant nutritional information for each recipe.  No matter what numbers you are monitoring the data is here for each dish.  I particularly enjoyed the recipe for Chipotle Mashed Cauliflower.   The Creamy Cucumber Dijon Dressing is also a very nice recipe.  If you are looking for another way to get flax into your family I suggest the Apple and Oats Flaxjacks.  Overall I got a lot of ideas from this book regarding how to increase the "health factor" in many of my family favorites.  If you are interested in better health, this is a nice book to add to the cooking library.
