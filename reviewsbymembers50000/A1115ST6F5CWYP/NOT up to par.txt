 Yes, this is still an improvement over box graters.  However, it is not fabulous.  CONS: 1.	Flimsy plastic construction.  Hasn't broken yet, but it will. 2.	When grating hard cheese the blade tries to separate from the handle unless you put your index finger in the small hole on the plastic portion of the handle just above the handgrip.  I would pass on this product and opt instead of all metal construction.  I prefer book the Micro plane professional graters and the Cuisipro line.
