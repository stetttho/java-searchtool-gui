 This is a beautiful Italian Cookie Jar.  It is a lovely complement to the other items that I purchased in Italy and trudged home in my luggage.  The colors of the paint/glaze on the jar are very clean, not at all muddy like some of the Chinese knockoffs of the Deruta patterns.  I own many Italian ceramics from the town of Deruta.  All of them have been extremely well made, and beautifully painted.  I personally don't believe that you can go wrong with any purchase of "Deruta Ceramica".  If you love Italy, or you just love cookies, this is a great item to have in your home.
