 I use this as a hairball preventative for my longhair cats.  My cats enjoy the taste of the product and will lick it right from the tube.  One of my cats enjoys this so much that after she coughs she runs over to me to get the tube opened.  If that isn't an endorsement I don't know what is.  Our vet has recommended this product for a 19-year-old feline in the family to keep things moving.  So far, the geriatric cat is still responding to the product after 2 years of daily doses to keep his GI system moving.  We always have at least 3 tubes of this stuff in the house at all times.  Additionally, I have been a Revival Animal customer for more than 4 years and have been very happy with the service and the products.
