 I have been a serious student of cooking for the past 25 years.  I have focused on Italian cooking for 10 of the last 25 years after my first trip to Italy.  Harry's Bar in Venice is one of those places that everyone wants to visit at least once.  The restaurant does not disappoint and neither does the cookbook.  If I had to pair down my Italian cookbook collection (which is now well over 50 cookbooks) this book would be in my top 5.  Each recipe in the book that I have tried has been perfect.  Even if you normally tinker with recipes, as I usually do, try these just as they are written at least once.  I don't think that you will be disappointed.  I appreciate the fact that the book is authentic, as opposed to the Italian-American books that are normally available in America.  This book is packed full of fabulous recipes, each one better than the last.  The pictures of the recipes are beautiful as the photos of Venice.  This book will be a wonderful addition to anyone's cookbook collection.  This would also make a fabulous gift for a lover of either Italy or cooking.
