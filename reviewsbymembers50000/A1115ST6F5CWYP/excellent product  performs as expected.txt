 I have had this pan for over a year.  I purchased it to replace an electric crepe pan that was approximately 20 years old.  This pan is much easier to use and to clean than the electric crepe pan.  I have made whole wheat crepes in this pan without a problem.  I have also made whole egg and egg white crepes in this pan without any sticking problems.  However, I do always spray this pan with oil before making crepes.  The non-stick on this pan is still sound after a lot of use.  I do wash this pan by hand, and only use silicon or wood utensils to flip the crepes.  If you are a little careful not to abuse the pan it seems to hold up fine, actually better than I expected for the price.  If you are looking for crepe recipes there is an old cookbook "Crepe Cookery" by Mabel Hoffman that is 176 pages of nothing but crepe recipes.  If you can pick up a used copy of this old book (circa 1976), I have found it to be very useful.  I feel that this pan is worth more than its price tag suggests if you like crepes.
