 I purchased this cookbook long before embarking on a vegetarian lifestyle and have been cooking recipes from this book for years.  Please note this is a vegetarian book, NOT a vegan book.  The author uses a fair amount of dairy in her recipes.  There are many recipes in this book that are appropriate for a vegan, just not all of them.  I like the fact that the author does not stick to one type of cuisine, but gets her influences from around the globe.  I feel it makes for a much more useful vegetarian cookbook by offering recipes from many cultures.  There are recipes that are Italian, Moroccan, Middle Eastern, Indian, Mexican and Polish to name a few.  There is a recipe for Pierogies that my husband likes it a lot.  My favorite from this book is a Fruit and Nut Tabouli with Cucumber and Mint.  If you are looking for ways to get more fruits and vegetables into your family this book makes a very well rounded and versatile addition to any cooking library.
