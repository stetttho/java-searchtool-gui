 So that you can put my review in perspective you should know that I have a graduate degree in business with a concentration in Finance.  For much of the last 20 years I have been responsible for the finance and accounting divisions of various multi-million dollar organizations.   You could say that I know a few things about money.  I think this book is a timeless classic that everyone should be encouraged to read in high school.  Consumerism starts with our children.  If we don't stop it with them they will pass it along to their children.  I really believe that this book should be required reading for anyone that we love that hasn't made the best financial decisions in their past.  The lessons of this book are simple.  Live below your means and you will not get into financial trouble.   This is such a simple solution to most people's financial problems yet so difficult for most of America to put into practice.   I try to remember this lesson whenever I want a new gadget or gizmo.  My husband and I have a simple rule that saving always comes before discretional spending.   We would not consider buying a new car, just as they discuss in the book.  The bottom line is that once you realize that it doesn't matter how others judge you, your financial life will improve.  The principles of this book fly in the face of our American consumerism economy.  But the practices they outline are very simple to put into practice.  If you follow the ideas in this book you will find yourself in a much stronger financial position.  I highly recommend this book to anyone that has not read it yet.  I also think it makes a great read for children to help shape their financial views before they get out of financial control and/or into debt.
