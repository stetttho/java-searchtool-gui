 This is the second pair of Titanium Sports for my husband in the last 5 years.  His first pair mysteriously disappeared.  I guess someone else liked them too.  These glasses are surprisingly lightweight.  My husband claims that he cannot feel them on his face.  When his first pair disappeared he looked for them for about a month and then decided a replacement was in order.  After having the Maui Jim's for 4 years he felt as though he NEEDED another pair.  He had gotten too accustomed to having no glare when he drove.  Additionally, Maui Jim has great customer service.  With the first pair my husband needed a new screw in one of the arms.  He contacted Maui Jim and mailed the glasses to them.  They replaced the screw and mailed them back for less than ten dollars.  The cost probably didn't cover the shipping since they were insured in both directions.  The turnaround time for repair was also fast.  I don't remember exactly how long but I do remember my husband commenting on how pleased he was that it took no time at all, and didn't cost hardly anything.  Ladies, if you are looking for a present for your husband I would suggest that you consider these sunglasses.  I know they would make a nice present for a man that is hard to buy for.  If your husband is anything like mine he will be very happy to receive this item.
