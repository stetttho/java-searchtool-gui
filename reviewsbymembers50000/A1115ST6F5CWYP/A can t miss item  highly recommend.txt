 I am a long time user of Kitchen Aid stand mixers.  My original mixer was received as a wedding present 18 years ago and it is still going strong.  The original just found a new home with one of the "kids" at the office, when this beauty arrived.    The metallic pewter color works wonderfully with the other stainless in the kitchen.  This machine performs magnificently.  I regularly make whole-wheat pizza dough (with added bran, germ and vital wheat gluten) enough for 3 pizzas in this machine at one time.  The machine doesn't whine or skip a beat during the long kneading process.  I have also prepared enough dough for 3 whole-wheat baguettes at one time without a problem.  Additionally, the customer service at Kitchen Aid is very helpful.  When my machine originally arrived they had sent the wrong color.   When they were contacted they told us to repackage the machine and send it back their expense (they e-mailed a shipping label and scheduled pick up) and we received our replacement less than a week later.  Fast, friendly and courteous customer service was able to make a mistake a non-event.  If you are looking for a workhorse machine this is the one for you.  I am only sorry that it took me so long to retire my original machine.  This machine is used three or four times a week in my home.  I cannot imagine living a whole grain lifestyle without this little beauty.  If you are a serious home cook, you will get a lot of use out of this machine.
