 I love this gadget!  I would not have initially purchased this for myself, but now I absolutely love having this level of control over pan temperatures.  I use this product at least 6 days a week.  The only days this product is not used in my kitchen are the days that I don't cook.     I don't just use this product on the stove top I also use it to check the temperature of the pizza stone in my oven so that we get a crispy pizza crust every time.  I also use it to confirm that the food that I am "holding" in a low oven is out of the danger zone for the days when dinner is delayed waiting for someone to get home.  I also use this item to confirm that food has cooled down enough to go into the refrigerator without compromising the integrity of the food already in there.  Additionally, I use this item to check the temperature of food inside the refrigerator to be certain that it is keeping food at below 40 degrees.  If you are a serious cook I cannot recommend this product strongly enough.  Knowing the actual temperature of your pan, pizza stone and food translates into perfect results every time.
