 I did not expect this product to function as well as it does.  I knew that it would not lose any bristles and that it would be easy clean.  However, I expected those results to come at the price of efficiency.  I was wrong.   This product works as well as a standard basting brush.  It effectively applies the thickest glaze (Garlic, Honey and Balsamic) as well as my "standard" brushes.  I like this one so much that I intend to throw away my other brushes once I procure a second one of these.  I highly recommend this product.
