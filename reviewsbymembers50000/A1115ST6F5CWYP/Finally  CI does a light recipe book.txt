 To put this review into perspective for you, it is written by a serious student of cooking that has been actively studying food on their own for 25 years.  I have been focusing on Italian food for the last 10 years.  My favorite cookbook is "The Professional Chef" by the Culinary Institute of America.  As a loyal America's Test Kitchen fan I had to check out this book to see if Chris Kimball and the gang brought any new ideas to the table.  They did not disappoint.  The veggie burger that they developed is better than the ones I had be using previously.  I would not have tried Lentils without this book.  Their recipe is full of flavor.  Kudos to CI for the Guacamole recipe that really does taste like it's full fat cousin, only much better for you.  Peeled Lima beans were an inspired idea.  I had been using Edamame to reduce the fat but it did result in an unpleasant textural change from the original.   The Lima beans are a vast improvement.  The salad dressing section covering Fruit Juice Vinaigrettes is worth the cost of the book alone.  If you are trying to cut the fats from your salads try the Orange-Lime Vinaigrette and the Pomegranate and Honey Vinaigrette.  With 35 and 40 calories per tablespoon respectively and only 2 grams of fat, these recipes are both winners.  This book does not eliminate fat, but it does reduce it significantly.  By utilizing the "Makeover at a Glance" section you can see how many calories, total fat, saturated fat and cholesterol was trimmed from the original recipes.  Many of the original recipe numbers are frightening.  In general I like that CI has reduced the fat but saved the flavor.  This is a good book for those just starting out to trim the calories and saturated fat, or for those that have been doing this for a while.
