 This is an odd book for someone to buy that lives in a major metropolitan area.  However, if you are interested in how things used to be done, and/or are looking for more control on the products that affect your family this is an interesting read.  PROS: 1.	Nice collection of feline information.  From building a cat tree, to giving your cat pills, and teaching your cat tricks. 2.	Very detailed information on gardening.  3.	How to make homemade candy including salt-water taffy.  Who knew? 4.	Significant section on Preserving, pickling, canning and distilling. 5.	Natural Home Remedies for many common ailments.  CONS: 1.	The print is very, very, very small.  Expect to use reading glasses. 2.	I would have preferred a hardback, but that wasn't an option.  Overall, a highly recommend for those that are lacking in how to do things that our parents and grandparents took for granted.
