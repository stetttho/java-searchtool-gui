 If you are making your cappuccinos one or two at a time this picture is fine for those that drink their coffee Italian style.  If you prefer a more American style cappuccino (1/2 milk and 1/2 espresso) the capacity of this picture will hold enough milk for one good sized cappuccino.  The pitcher is very sturdy and attractively styled.  The handle stays cool when the milk is being steamed.  The pitcher is also easy to clean.  I highly recommend this item.
