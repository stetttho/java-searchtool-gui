 I purchased this product a week ago for very dry cuticles.  I expected that it would take a while to see results.  My cuticles showed noticeable improvement in moisture in 24 hours (after two applications).  In the week since I have been using this product faithfully twice a day, my cuticles have gone from very dry and snagging on clothing to smooth and well conditioned.    Additionally, the added moisture seems to be having a positive impact on the condition of my nails.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone that washes their hands frequently or spends a lot of time with their hands in water.
