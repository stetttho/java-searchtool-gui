 I find that I use these most often for cold desserts but there are many possible uses for these little pans.    They are great for the following single serving applications: Ice Cream Molds Sherbet Molds Sorbet Molds Panna Cotta Gelatin Molds Bundt Cakes Muffins Brownies for Sundaes Frozen Cheesecake, drizzled with hot chocolate and toasted walnuts  The use of these molds is only limited to your imagination.  My personal favorite application is the Panna Cotta (an Italian dessert which means cooked cream - similar to cr?me brulee but without the egg).  Cheesecake works surprisingly well in these.  I just make it crustless, but you could put the crust on the top.  These little molds hold up fine in a water bath while the cheesecake bakes.  When you are going to bake these they must be placed on another tray so that they are stable.  I find that I do the same thing in the freezer and refrigerator.    They are easy to clean. I have not had any problem getting items to release from these pans.  In the case of baked goods they need to be cooled completely, and then they will release in one piece.  For the cold or frozen item, dunk the mold in a little warm water, or cover with a warm towel and the dessert will fall out in one piece.  If you like to make individual desserts, these little pans are great to have.
