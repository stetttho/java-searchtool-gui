 To put this review into perspective for you, it is written by a serious student of cooking that has been actively studying food on their own for 25 years.  I have been focusing on Italian food for the last 10 years.  My favorite cookbook is "The Professional Chef" by the Culinary Institute of America.   If you are a frustrated baker who can't make your bread turn out right this is an excellent starting point for that purpose.  The book contains all the bakery standards that you would expect and some that might be a new experience for you.    The Lavender-Polenta Coffee Cake is a very nice recipe.  The Carrot Cake Recipe is also very good.  Try adding a little maple syrup to the cream cheese frosting on the carrot cake.   To quote my husband, Yum Yum.  The book does a nice job of outlining the various stages of the baking process in good detail with pictures.  I think it would be very easy for a beginner to follow and make a nice loaf of bread the first time out.  I have shared the French Baquette recipe with a few novice bakers and they claim to have had good results.  If you are looking for a decent baking primer this is a good place to begin.  The directions and the pictures are well done for those that need the guidance.
