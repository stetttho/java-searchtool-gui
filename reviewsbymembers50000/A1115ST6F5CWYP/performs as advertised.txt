 I purchased this in a whim, thinking I had nothing to lose.  This product improved the texture of my skin the first time I used it.  Within two weeks (after 5 applications) I saw a tremendous difference.  I now like my 43-year-old skin enough to leave my home without makeup.   Specifically, my skin in much smoother, a little tighter, and my "experience lines" have diminished by approximately 50%.  I feel as though I have taken at least 5 years off the age of my face.  Remarkable for under thirty dollars.  If you feel as though the texture of your skin has changed (for the worse) since you passed 40 give this product a try.  It has worked very well for me.
