 This book has been part of my library for almost 10 years.  The book was purchased long before my husband and I embarked on a vegetarian diet.  Until I bought "The Professional Chef" from the Culinary Institute of America, this was my go to cookbook for vegetable recipes.  There are many recipes in this book that are outstanding.  I particularly enjoy the layout of the book.  By grouping recipes of the same vegetable together it makes "surfing" for recipes easy when all you know is that you want to do something with artichokes.  I also enjoy the notes in the margin of book where Ms. Madison suggests changes or subtractions to make the recipes vegan, or to reduce the fat or calories.  Even with "The Professional Chef" in my library this book still gets a lot of use at my house.
