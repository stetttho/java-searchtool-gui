 This product is designed in 1899 for farmers to use on Dairy Cows to keep them from becoming chapped in the harsh Vermont environment.  There are only two ingredients in this product these are a petrolatum lanolin base and an ingredient call 8 - hydroxy quinoline sulfate that is 3% of the total.  I use this product on the soles of my feet in the winter when they are very dry and cracked.  My brother-in-law uses it on his German Shepherd stomach when she has contact dermatitis.  If you have dry skin anywhere on your body this is a nice product to have around.  Be certain to cover the area with socks or clothing after applying the product.  It is very thick and might leave a stain if not laundered properly.  I use a combination of Oxyclean and Spray and Wash to remove it from my socks when I treat my feet.
