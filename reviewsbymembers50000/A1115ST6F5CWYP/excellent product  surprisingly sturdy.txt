 I purchased these after seeing them on the Bodum.com website.   I admit the cool factor lured me in.  The cups maintain the temperature of a cappuccino for as long as it takes me to get to the bottom of the cup.  Additionally it is nice not to need coasters (especially if you have men or children in the home).  The 9 oz cup is less than 4 inches tall, making it fit perfectly under the fill spout of my super-automatic Saeco espresso machine (which I also love).  My husband and I have had 4 of these cups for more than 6 months and not one of them has broken.  I mention this because the 9 oz cups seem to be much more sturdy than the 21 oz Pavina ice tea glasses.   We broke one of the 21 oz cups with the first ice cube that went into the cup.  We broke 2 others in the first two weeks.    Bottom line, I cannot recommend the 21 oz Pavina.  However, the 9 oz Pavina cups are very tough, having survived 6 months of daily use with less than dainty owners.  I think you will be very pleased with your purchase of the 9 oz Pavina cups.
