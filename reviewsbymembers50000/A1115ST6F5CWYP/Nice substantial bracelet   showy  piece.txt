 This bracelet is a good width and a good weight.  This is not a piece that goes unnoticed on the wrist.  If you are a woman that likes "big" jewelry this is a nice piece.  I like this bracelet enough that I am planning on purchasing a necklace to wear with this and I am a picky consumer.  This piece is equally nice with jeans or a black suit.  I recommend both this product and this seller.
