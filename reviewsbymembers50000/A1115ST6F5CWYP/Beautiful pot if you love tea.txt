 This is a very pretty tea pot.  If you like the look of the Chambord coffee press pot you will like this.    The glass portion of this pot is very sturdy.  I am not a dainty or delicate person and this has held up for years in my home.  I use this pot to make loose as well as bagged tea.  I also use it make mint tea, and hot mint lemonade.  The pot is very easy to take apart to clean.  My one complaint is that the tea does not stay warm as long as I would like.  I always heat the pot with hot water before making tea.  I also made a cozy to put over the pot to keep the tea warm a little longer.  I really like the look of this pot, more so than the functionality.  I would give this pot 5 stars for design, but 4 stars for function (I deduct one star for the quick cool down factor).  Overall, this is a 4.5 star product which I rounded up to 5.
