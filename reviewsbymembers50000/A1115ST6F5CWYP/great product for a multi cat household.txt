 I was one of those people that stubbornly refused to buy the clumping litter because I did not know what was in it or how if worked.  I believed that untreated clay litter was healthier for my little angels.   After receiving approximately 25 recommendations from other cat owners I finally relented and gave this product a try.  I am a little embarrassed that I took so long to try this product.  There is less dust than with conventional cat litter.  The cat waste is so easy to scoop up and remove that the litter pan is much cleaner than ever before.  My cats seem to be much happier with this product.  We had a situation a few weeks back that required a fecal test and I was concerned that it wouldn't be possible due to this product.  The vet assured me that the lab would not have a problem analyzing the sample.  I do have two minor complaints that are the only reason that I did not give this product 5 stars.  First, the perfume is a little overwhelming.  When my longhaired little ones first exit the box the floral scent if very evident.  Second, if you don't get every speck of this stuff off the floor before you mop the result will be a streaky floor. I found this out the hard way and had to get down on my hands and knees and scrub the hardwood in the room where our litter box was located to remove the streaks.  Please note it took 5 changes of water to make the floor acceptable, but not perfect.  Make certain to remove the litter box, thoroughly vacuum and then mop.  Don't do what I did you will regret the mistake.  Overall this in an excellent product that I strongly recommend
