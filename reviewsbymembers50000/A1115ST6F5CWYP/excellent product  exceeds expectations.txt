 I had been a "collector" of micro planes prior to purchasing this product.   In our home Parmesan was used to "snow" on top of most dishes.  If you have tried to grate three year-old Parmesan you know what a work out that can be.  This grater cuts grating time approximately in half.  I also like the nonskid pad on the end of the device that you put on your cutting.  I highly recommend this product.
