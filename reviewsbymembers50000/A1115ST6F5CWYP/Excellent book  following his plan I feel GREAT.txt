 The author, a nuclear cardiologist, does nice job explaining difficult medical concepts for the rest of us.  His book is very similar to Dr. Fuhrman's "Eat to Live".  However, given his medical specialties he explains the same methodology in a very different manner.  I found this book to be a nice complement to "Eat of Live."    The plans that both books advocate are tough for a "foodie" to follow.  However, I have not felt better in 25 years.  I decided to try to vegan route to lose weight, fully expecting to return to fish and cheese in a few months.  I feel so good now I don't know if I will ever go back to my old eating habits.    If you don't feel like you did as a teenager or twenty something give this book a try.  You might just be surprised how good you can feel (even at 43).  Update: My husband got his blood tests back and the results were beyond what we could have expected. The blood was drawn 24 days after beginning a low fat vegan diet. His total cholesterol went from 177 to 113. His bad cholesterol (LDL) dropped from 100 to 53. There were no other changes to my husband's lifestyle beyond the 24 days with the dietary changes. If a 51 year old nonexercising male can get these results image what this book can do for you. I now recommend this program even more than I had previously. If you need to improve your health please give this program or "Eat to Live" a try. It appears to be working miracles at our home.
