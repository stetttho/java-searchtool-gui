 To put this review into perspective for you, it is written by a serious student of cooking that has been actively studying food on their own for 25 years.  I have been focusing on Italian food for the last 10 years.  My favorite cookbook is "The Professional Chef" by the Culinary Institute of America.   For thoroughness of recipes I would give this book 5 stars.  There are a few items that I did not like that lead me to give the book 4 stars.  I would have liked to see regional cooking covered in this book.  If you know anything about Italian cooking you realize that Italians are fiercely regional.  They love what comes from their area and cook with it.  For example, in Bologna you will find a lot of Parma Ham, Parmesan Cheese and Balsamic vinegar.  In Rome they are fond of Pecorino Romano, and in Campania they love Buffalo Mozzarella.  This information is all but absent in this book.   I would have liked the book better if it were organized regionally instead of by food type and/or category.  I appreciated that the recipes were easy to find.  I really liked that there are so many recipes included in this edition.  I also liked the equipment listing, and glossary of Italian cooking terms.  I did not like that the book seemed to lose the regional aspect of Italian cooking.  I also would have liked to see more photos included in this edition.  I would recommend this book if you are looking for a hard to find recipe or if your collection of Italian cookbooks is not large.
