 "America-History Greatest Hits" contains those '70's adult contemporary hits you know and love! America's presence was heard and felt on U.S. AM Top 40 radio stations throughout much of the above mentioned decade. All their biggest hits from the seventies are here, with the best of the bunch being "Ventura Highway", "Tin Man", "Lonely People", "Sister Golden Hair", "I Need You", " A Horse With No Name" , "Woman Tonight" and others, with the exception of "Muskrat Love", which, in my opinion, is too silly to be included in this collection. If "America-History Greatest Hits" isn't enough to satisfy your craving for this group's music, there's an anthology CD titled "Hourglass", which chronicles America's 25 years in the music business at the time, but I don't know if it's still in print. "History" is still a rather suitable collection for those who are looking for a body of this group's musical work. Since there aren't many titles available in America's catalog, you will be wise to add "History" to your CD/Cassette collection!
