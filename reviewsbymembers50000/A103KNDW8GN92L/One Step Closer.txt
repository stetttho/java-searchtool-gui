 Continuing on in the tried and true ELP fashion, Keith Emerson, Greg Lake & Carl Palmer create a stellar and unique masterpiece that is "Tarkus". The title suite has a lot to offer for the serious progressive-rock die-hard, complete with an Emerson/Palmer synthesizer/keyboard and drum clinic in the middle section [from the d) "Mass" to f) "Battlefield" sections, where both Keith and Carl play off one another beautifully without upstaging one another in the process]. The g) "Aquatarkus" section eases the listener out, courtesy of a Palmer military styled drum coda. "Jeremy Bender" is also done in a similar style of "Benny The Bouncer" (from "Brain Salad Surgery"), except "JB" is more evenly and smoothly constructed, with Lake's velvety vocals sung over the top. "Bitches Crystal" and the first half of "The Only Way (Hymn)" are spiced with some mellow pastoral flavorings, which feature religious lyrics sung by Lake (with the passion of a choirboy!) in both tracks. "Infinite Space" contains yet more down-home ELP jams, with the boys doing their craft, and doing it well. The dominant "now or never"-like tones of "A Time And A Place" are evident in Greg Lake's gruff powerful vocals - sung like a fury of hellfire! "Are You Ready Eddy?" (a "sort-of" ode to Eddy Offord, who engineered this album, and would later produce [and engineer] several albums for Yes as well) shows Emerson, Lake & Palmer's willingness to want to just rock out, and in grand 1950's fashion, too, although the Beatles-esque lyrics are a bit on the wild, nonsensical side (although one has to admit it is a bit keenly different!)!!!With a magical display of perks, quirks and a variety of musical styles present on this, ELP's 1971 sophomoric wonderwork, it shows just how far this dynamic trio would and could go to make "that one supersonic opus". Fast forward to "Brain Salad Surgery" - but not before you make "Tarkus" (and don't forget "Trilogy"!) an all-important choice for your CD library!
