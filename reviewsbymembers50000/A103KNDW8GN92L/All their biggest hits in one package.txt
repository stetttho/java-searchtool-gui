 When I bought "The Best Of Three Dog Night" on cassette back in  1989, it was a welcome relief compared to the music that played on radio  stations at that time. All of TDN's hits are contained here from A to Z.  But, if you'd rather have it all, you might want to shell out a little  extra for "Celebrate:The Three Dog Night Story 1965-1975. There you  will get all the hits contained in TBO3DN, plus some album tracks and a few  other surprises. But, if you're on a budget, this greatest hits package  will do. Enjoy!
