 "Have A Nice Day-Volume 15" features a variety of radio-friendly hits from the mid-'70's. Here you will find the country-to-pop crossover smash "I'm Not Lisa", by Jessi Colter (who used to be married to country crooner Waylon Jennings), Hamilton, Joe Frank And Reynolds' second and final Top-40 number one hit "Fallin' In Love", African-reggae vibes in "Black Superman-Muhammad Ali", by one-hit wonders Johnny Wakelin And The Kinshasa Band, and the Australian group Jigsaw with one of their few hits to enter the American charts, "Sky High", to name a few. Truckers will get a kick out of C.W. McCall's CB craze song "Convoy", which inspired a hit movie of the same name. This collection of '70's songs just wouldn't be complete without the sugar-coated disco vibes of Hot Chocolate's "You Sexy Thing". "At Seventeen" by Janis Ian is just average, and Austin Roberts' "Rocky" is just plain boring. Dwight Twilley's "I'm On Fire" rocks the house down, so you better not crank this number up too loud, or your house will look like a pile of rubble! I found David Geddes' "Run Joey Run" to be quite asinine (in laymen's terms, that means stupid). For those of you into '50's nostalgia, there's Pete Wingfield's "Eighteen With A Bullet". "Saturday Night", by the Bay City Rollers, is just OK. Some of the great songs on this CD more than make up for the mediocre ones. Still a good buy.
