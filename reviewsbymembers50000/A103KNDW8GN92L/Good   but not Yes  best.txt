 After the first listen of "Relayer", here is my assessment: the  opening track "The Gates Of Delirium" has the band attempting to  "fine-tune" their instruments, yet the track's hard-rock vibes  appeal to me.

The closing  track "To Be Over, is the best of the three, with its mellow,  melancholy feel and tranquil lyrics. "Relayer is just an average CD at  best, but still worthy of Yes fans to add to their collection.
