 What makes this CD such a joy to listen to is the musical arrangement of  the songs and the catchy lyrics. The instrumentals "Madrigal",  "Missa", and "African Suite", give this CD a  "progressive-rock" feel to it. Very creative!  "Childsong" and "I Am The Lion" are wonderful  arrangments as well. Let's not forget the hit "Cracklin' Rosie",  which Neil says the inspration of this song came from him visiting an  Indian Reservation in Canada, where the natives were lonely on Saturday  nights and drank "Cracklin' Rose" Wine (aka Muscatel). The song  "Free Life" can pertain to an existence with no worries, and just  feeling carefree, which is the way you'll feel when you listen to this CD.  Please enjoy!
