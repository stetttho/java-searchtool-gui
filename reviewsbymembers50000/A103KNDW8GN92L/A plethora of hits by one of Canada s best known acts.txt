 "The Best Of Lighthouse: Sunny Days Again" features 16 greatest hits from one of Canada's best known imports. "One Fine Morning", Lighthouse's best known song here in the States, reached an impressive Top 30 on the Billboard pop chart in 1971. Some mighty fine Canadian Content selections make appearances here as well. In an ode to good times and backyard barbeque fun, there's "Sunny Days". "Pretty Lady" is wonderful and has a unique warmth and charm all its own. Lighthouse also displays a funky and soulful side in the tracks "Hats Off To The Stranger" and "You Girl', although the latter track can be overly repetetive. Man, talk about horns!
