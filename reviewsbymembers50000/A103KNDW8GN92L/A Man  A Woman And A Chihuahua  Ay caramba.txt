 After seeing "Fools Rush In", I definitely feel the above caption would make for a better title. But, nonetheless, this is one of those romantic love stories with a touch of comedy and a whole lot of drama, like a soap opera, but only better. The plot centers around a consultant of an architectural firm, Alex (Matthew Perry), who, by fate, meets a single Mexican woman named Isabel (Salma Hayek). After spending the night together, Isabel becomes pregnant with Alex's child, but is quite shocked about the news at first, and isn't sure whether or not she wants to continue their relationship. As time progresses, the couple get to know each other better and Isabel introduces Alex to her family, the Fuenteses (including an angry chihuahua named Che, who, at first, displays an intense dislike for Alex, but softens up to him later), and, likewise, Isabel later meets Alex's parents. At first, their parents don't agree with the idea of Alex and Isabel going steady, because of the cultural differences of both families. But what the heck, it all makes for a very interesting, and rather potent, love story. In fact, it is a love story (as mentioned above)! Rather than saying anything further, I suggest you pick up a copy of "Fools Rush In". The chihuahua alone is worth the price of this movie!
