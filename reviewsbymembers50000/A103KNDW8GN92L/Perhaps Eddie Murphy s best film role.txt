 "Beverly Hills Cop" is possibly one of Eddie Murphy's best and funniest films to date. Here, Murphy plays a congenial, not exactly by-the-book Detroit cop who decides to go to Beverly Hills for a little R & R. But, he gets involved in a homicide case against his boss's wishes. Along the way, he teams up with Beverly Hills Detective Taggart and his assistant Rosewood (the latter played by Judge Reinhold), and the recipe calls for suspense, intrigue and a little comedy along the way. The stunt where Murphy gets thrown through a glass window by Victor Maitland's (Steven Berkoff) gang of thugs is just fabulous, and the "banana in the tailpipe" thing is hilarious! Bronson Pinchot is also featured here in an early role as Serge, the gay art shop owner. Let's not forget the film's soundtrack, with songs by Patti Labelle, The Pointer Sisters and Glenn Frey, which is an ecellent companion to "Beverly Hills Cop". All of the above mentioned are excellent reasons to include "Beverly Hills Cop" in your video library.
