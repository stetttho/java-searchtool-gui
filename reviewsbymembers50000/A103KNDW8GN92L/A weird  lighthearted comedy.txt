 When I first bought and viewed "O Lucky Man", I tried to piece the whole thing together and thought: "What in holy hell is this?" After the third viewing, I decided to stop trying to make sense of it all, and just take the contents at face value. This is a delightfully well scripted and funny masterpiece which stars Malcolm Mc Dowell as Mick Travis, a coffee salesman who finds himself going from one outlandish adventure to another. What makes this movie such a joy to watch is that the same actors play different roles throughout the movie, as well as the bizarre plot, characters and storyline. Get a load of that pigman! Lindsay Anderson directed and also has a cameo. If you like your movies with a degree of comical unpredictability and zany characters, may I suggest a purchase of "O Lucky Man". You will not be disappointed!
