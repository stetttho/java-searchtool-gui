 "Have A Nice Day-Volume 16" is one of my two favorite CD's in  this 25 volume series from Rhino Records. The majority of the tracks here  are good, with "Vehicle" and "Ride Captain Ride"  possibly being the best songs here. This collection also contains some fine  instrumentals as well. You get "Midnight Cowboy" and "Theme  From Tommy". Nonetheless, there are some sleepers, such as "Toast  And Marmalade For Tea", "The City Of New Orleans" and  "Daddy Don't You Walk So Fast", hich is perhaps the best one in  the sleeper category. The track that really turned me on to this CD is  "Small Beginnings" by Flash, a group formed by Yes alumni Peter  Banks and Tony Kaye. The beginnings of Flash were rather small indeed, for  they never had another hit single. "Small Beginnings" did make  the US Billboard top 30, and is the progressive-rock masterpiece of this  CD. This is the only place you can find this track, so fans of Yes and  oldies music should have this title in their collection.
