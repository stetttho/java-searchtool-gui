 This Four Tops Greatest Hits Collection chronicles the group's Dunhill/ABC  years. The standout tracks here are "Ain't No Woman", "One  Chain Don't Make No Prison" and "Keeper Of The Castle".  Let's not forget "Catfish", which contains the sexually explicit  lyric "makes my nature rise". "We All Gotta Stick  Together" somewhat explains the foursome's staying power, which has  lasted for more than three decades. The songs in this greatest hits  collection rivals the hits the group had in the Motown era. Levi Stubbs'  rough, powerful vocals are enough reason to add this Four Tops collection  to your CD library.
