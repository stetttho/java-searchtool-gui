 "The Jazz Singer (1980)" marks Neil Diamond's theatrical debut as an actor, that is, unless you count The Band's "The Last Waltz", in which ND makes a cameo appearance. His performance in "TJS" as an assistant cantor isn't half-bad. Complimenting Neil's role quite nicely is an Oscar-winning caliber performance by the late, great Sir Laurence Olivier, who is stupendous as a stern, yet stubborn Jewish senior cantor. I've viewed this movie quite a number of times, and what I was expecting from the first viewing was an exact remake of the original 1927 version, but that wasn't quite the case, although I've never seen the entire original version. The premise of this version is sort of like the original, in that the premise of the story tells of an assistant cantor, Jess Robinovich, aka Robin (Diamond), who'd rather write and record songs for pure enjoyment and  please his soon-to-be-fan base than remain in the synagogue and please his senior-cantor father (Olivier). Catlin Adams (Rivka Robinovich) and Lucie Arnaz (Molly Bell) offer fine supporting roles as ND's present, then future "significant other(s)". Molly is first Jess' manager, then his future wife. The scenes focusing on Jess and Molly's relationship will tug at your heart strings, so it's nice to have a box of Kleenex handy. Comedian/Actor Franklyn Ajaye has a role as one of Jess' backup singers. Neil Diamond also wrote the songs that also appear on the soundtrack, and they're good ones: "Love On The Rocks", 'America", "Hello Again", "You Baby", "Jerusalem", "Kol Nidre" and "Songs Of Life." It is also rumored that ND currently has a theatrical project in the works slated for release sometime in 2001. It's about time! Please don't wait another twenty years to release the next one, Neil! That's why all hard-core "Diamondheads" should include "The Jazz Singer (1980)" to their video collection, because a motion picture starring Neil Diamond is hard to come by.
