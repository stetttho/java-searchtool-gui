 Even though "A Single Man" doesn't quite equal the musical and creative output which Elton John displayed on previous albums, particularly with longtime lyrical partner Bernie Taupin, who's abscence isn't missed all that much here. Even a number of die-hard Elton fans would be inclined to agree with me after listening to this marvelous array of compositions. "Shine On Through" kicks off the album in fine fashion and continues smoothly into "Return To Paradise". Some good disco vibes are well represented with the tracks "I Don't Care", "Part-Time Love" (a minor AM radio hit in 1978) and the pyrotechnically-sound "Madness". "Big Dipper" has sort of a jazzy-swing feel to it, while the rather lengthy "It Ain't Gonna Be Easy" is a reverse-tempo, heart-breaky love song. EJ must have an undying love-affair with "The Peachtree State" when he croons, as well as nimblifies his countrified piano stylings in the gospel-like "Georgia". "Shooting Star" somewhat deadens the tone of the CD with its slow, quiet pace, while the final two musical pieces "Reverie" and "Song For Guy" close out "A Single Man" on a strong and positive note. Even though this version is somewhat outdated, the sound quality is very good, even if this disc is played on a smaller stereo CD system. For the Elton John fan who craves for a little more music, there's a recently remastered edition of "A Single Man", complete with bonus tracks, which is definitely worth spending more money for. But, if you'd rather not spend a lot of money, this original CD version of "ASM" will do at half the price. The remastered version has made this version obsolete, though. So, you better buy the original version today, before it's gone in a heartbeat!
