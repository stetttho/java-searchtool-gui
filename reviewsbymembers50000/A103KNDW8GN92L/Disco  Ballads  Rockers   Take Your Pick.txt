 Volume 22 in this "Have A Nice Day" CD series covers the major hits from the Fall of '78 on through to the fall of '79. There's something for every fan of late '70's music here. You have Disco (Every 1's a Winner-Hot Chocolate), Ballads (Lotta Love-Nicolette Larson, Dancin' Shoes-Nigel Olsson, Stumblin' In-Chris Norman and Suzi Quatro, Love Is In The Air-John Paul Young, Sad Eyes-Robert John and You Take My Breath Away-Rex Smith) as well as some good rockers (Hot Child In The City-Nick Gilder, Gold-John Stewart, Driver's Seat-Sniff 'N The Tears). The only bad song in this collection is Ian Gomm's "Hold On", otherwise, the many above listed songs make this d a must buy!
