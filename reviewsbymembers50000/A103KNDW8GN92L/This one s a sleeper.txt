 Overall, the songs on this CD are mediocre at best, with the exception of  "When She Was My Girl" and "Back To School Again", from  the motion picture "Grease 2". Frankly, the majority of the other  songs put me to sleep, which is why I prefer the 'Tops music from the  Motown and Dunhill/ABC eras. Pass on this one for the most part.
