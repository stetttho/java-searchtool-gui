 Although Genesis were already in their commercial phase by the time "Abacab" was released, this CD contains a nice variety of musical styles ranging from new wave to r & b. This CD also samples a taste of Phil Collns' solo career, which immediately began before the release of "Abacab". The highlight of this CD is the nonchalant "Dodo/Lurker", which features Tony Banks' haunting keyboard work. All the other songs are good as well, including the title track. All of the items montioned above are reason enough to add this title to your CD collection.
