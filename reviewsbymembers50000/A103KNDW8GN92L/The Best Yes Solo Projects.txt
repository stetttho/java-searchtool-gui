 I bought this CD some years ago while vacationing in England, and saw this  CD in a record shop. Am I glad I made this purchase! You'll find what is  perhaps Yes' best solo and side project recordings here, and there isn't a  lame duck in the entire bunch. The best works here are Rick Wakeman's  chilling keyboard work on "Catherine Howard" and "Merlin The  Magician", Chris Squire's "Hold Out Your Hand" from his only  solo CD titled "Fish Out Of Water", the instumental tracks  "Feels Good To Me" by Bill Bruford and "Dominating  Factor" by Peter Banks, plus several others. Songs from every past and  present member of Yes are featured here, including Jon Anderson and Steve  Howe. It would be nice to add "Affirmative:The Yes Solo Family  Album" to your collection before Connoisseur Collections takes this  one-of-a-kind masterpiece out of print, so, buy it! Now, if only this  company could put out a similar CD by Genesis that chronicles that band's  solo and side projects. Only time will tell.
