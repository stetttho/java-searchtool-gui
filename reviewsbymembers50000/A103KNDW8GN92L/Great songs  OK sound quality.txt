 I bought "Captured Live At The Forum" on CD a couple years ago,  and I must say the songs here are great. I have only one complaint about  it-the fair-to-poor sound quality. Since I consider myself to be an avid  fan of Three Dog Night, I felt it necessary to include this CD in my  collection. Since it's TDN's only live CD in print, you'll want to add it  to your collection, too.
