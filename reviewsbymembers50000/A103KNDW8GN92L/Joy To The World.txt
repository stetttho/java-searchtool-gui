 This has to be Three Dog Night's biggest and best album. This CD features  nothing but great songs like "Joy To The World (the number 1 pop song  of 1971, and Dunhill Records' biggest selling single), "The Family Of  Man", "I Can Hear You Calling", and "Liar".  "Heavy Church", "Sunlight", and the instrumental  "Fire Eater" are excellent, too. Do yourself a favor and purchase  this CD. You'll be glad you did!
