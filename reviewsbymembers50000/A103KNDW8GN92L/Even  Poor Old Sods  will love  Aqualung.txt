 The year 1971 was one which saw the progressive rock scene begin to come to life, which started to brim with a creative batch of verve and whimsical ideas. Jethro Tull was one such group that could be counted on to deliver the goods, carried out brilliantly both in the musical and lyrical department in linear 'progressive' fashion. Actually, "Aqualung" is a concept album, as noted on the first generation CD's back cover, with the listing being comprised of two mini-suites: "Aqualung" and "My God". Both suites have their artistic moments - with "Aqualung's" high points being well-stated and scoped out with the classic rock radio staples "Cross-Eyed Mary" and the title track, which sees overly-frequent airplay to this day. Other exceptional tracks on the "Aqualung" suite include the vaguely humorous "Cheap Day Return" and the thought-provoking "Wond'ring Aloud", among others. Other standout gems are featured in the "My God" suite as well, as our hero (Aqualung) is about to meet his fate. Ian Anderson's artistic wit and depth is displayed in full-force in this section, as is displayed in yet another classic rock anomaly, "Locomotive Breath". "Hymn 43", "Slipstream" and the closer "Wind-Up" are the ultra-rich fabric that holds the rest of this seamless, yet timeless masterwork together. With such a wondrous array of songs interwoven together in a smooth, concise fashion, combined with a neoclassical album cover, featuring our hero (resembling Christ, perhaps), "Aqualung" is truly a sumptuous feast to the ears, thus belonging in everyone's CD collection. Although "Aqualung" is an upstanding Tull masterpiece, Anderson & Co. would take their art-rock musical & lyrical skills to the next level with their next release "Thick As A Brick", as that release would beat out "Aqualung" by just a small margin. But, no Jethro Tull collection is complete without "Aqualung" AND "Thick..." in one's all-important CD library. Grab 'em both, while they're still hot!
