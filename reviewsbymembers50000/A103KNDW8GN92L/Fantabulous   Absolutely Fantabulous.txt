 "Pretzel Logic", Steely Dan's third album, contains yet more well-styled musical variances, most of which are neatly homogenized in a nice package. These unique stylings are well represented in the opening piano/bass scat-like riff of "Rikki Don't Lose That Number", the folky "Any Major Dude Will Tell You", including the country atmosphere of the breezy "With A Gun", among others. The cool, mellow voice-box guitar effect present in the co-Duke Ellington penned instrumental "East St. Louis Toodle-Oo" is sure to please even the most savvy Steely Dan fan, while "Parker's Band" is rather quick and catchy, so don't blink, or you'll miss it! The bluesy selections are worth a few listens as well, such as the title track, with its double-repetetive jazz-influenced verses. If there is a such thing as a "consolation" (mediocre) track on "Pretzel Logic", that honor would most likely go to the flighty "Night By Night", but it qualifies as an erstwhile composition, nonetheless. Since many of the compositions featured on "Pretzel Logic" are somewhat short time-wise, this is one CD where Donald Fagen and Walter Becker and crew really go out of their way to create a really one-of-a-kind scenic musical and lyrical landscape, which is simply nothing short of fantabulous, as well as in the area of musical talent, of which "The Dan" are well adept at! Add "Pretzel Logic" to your must-have Steely Dan collection today, or you'll be left "twisted"!
