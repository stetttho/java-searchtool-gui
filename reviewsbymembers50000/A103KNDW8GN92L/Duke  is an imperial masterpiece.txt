 With this CD, Genesis makes good use of its progressive roots for sadly, the last time. The majority of the tracks here use quite a bit of that hard-line progressivism, from the opening "Behind The Lines" and "Man Of Our Times" to the fantastic encore "Duke's Travels/Dukes End". "Duke" also contains a softer, easy-going side in tracks like "Misunderstanding","Heathaze" and "Please Don't Ask", which all makes for an interesting, well-balanced blend of music. Since this is Genesis' last stand of progressive rock, you'll want to add "Duke" to your "must-have" collection.
