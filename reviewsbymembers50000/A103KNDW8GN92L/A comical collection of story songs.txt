 This being the only Jimmy Buffett CD in my collection and judging from the  titles of some of the songs, I felt it necessary to purchase "Havana  Daydreamin'". Boy, was I taken aback! What a witty and talented  songwriter/musician Mr. Buffett is! This is evidenced in the track  "Cliches", where the song opens with "He's got a ballpark  figure, she's got a ballpoint pen." My favorite lyrics occur later in  the track:"He's always tuned into Star Trek, she's always tuned into  him. Hiding his cookies when he gets the munchies, tryin' hard just to keep  the boy slim". "My Head Hurts, My Feet Stink And I Don't Love  Jesus" is a laugh riot! This CD also has a melacholy side, featured in  the track "The Captain And The Kid", which is a reworking from  one of JB's earlier albums. "Big Rig" is an enjoyful, up-tempo  number that also contains a comical line: "I'd rather much be home  rollin' with you than watchin' Tom Snyder on TV." Nice easy-going  tunes can also be found here: the title track and "Defying  Gravity." The Steve Goodman penned "This Hotel Room" is also  good for laughs. Parrotheads young and old will have a blast out of this  CD. You'll "Kick It In Second Wind" upon the first listen. Please  do yourself a favor, and buy this CD. The witty lyrics alone are worth it!
