 The 1974 album "That Nigger's Crazy", recorded live in San Francisco, features Richard Pryor at his raunchy, down-and-dirty best. Who else but Richard could capture an audience with off-color subject matter such as the relationship between police officers and African-Americans, winos and junkies, White women & African-American men, etc., etc., etc.? The skit featuring Richard battling his father over curfew issues during Pryor's teenage years is sure to hit a home run as well. Although this is an excellent piece of stand-up comedy done to perfection during Pryor's earlier years, something's missing. What would be even more perfect, is if this comedy masterwork received the remaster treatment, and on CD (I believe this title and Richard's follow-up comedic masterpiece "Bicentennial Nigger" are the only two titles which haven't been released on compact disc - although I could be wrong)! Although Richard Pryor unanimously and rightfully deserves the title as "The King of Raunchy Comedy (!)", Eddie Murphy comes in an extremely close second (even though Murphy no longer performs in stand-up circles). As for Eddie's influence as a comedian, one amazon.com reviewer said it best, that Murphy "did not steal from, but lovingly borrowed" from (the great) Richard Pryor. How true! With those thoughts in mind, make sure you add "That Nigger's Crazy" to your comedy library before Warner/Reprise decides to take it out of print. With laughs this huge, you definitely don't want to be without a copy!
