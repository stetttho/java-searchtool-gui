 With excellent timing and precision, I might add. "Pulp Fiction" is one box office blockbuster that certainly doesn't compromise on principle, as it features four uniquely interwoven,  well-written and well-thought-out storylines, which will leave the average viewer baffled and bewildered by their outcomes. "PF" is unique in its' premise, in that this picture's scenes, in a way, were shot backwards, instead of in one continuing sequence, to leave the viewer free to come up with his or her own theory as to how each of these separate plots came to their respective introduction and conclusion. It is also funny and ironic that both opening and closing scenes were shot at the same locale, with the same exact sequence, too, creating a bunch of loose ends left for the viewer to tie together, as noted above, leaving the viewer to use his or her imagination here. Director Quentin Tarantino lets the audience participate in this upstanding masterpiece, and doesn't insult the viewer's intelligence in the process, which is only part of the beauty of watching a movie of this caliber. The other part, is watching "PF"'s all-star cast add their individual perspectives and talents to each of the characters they portray, with both John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson portraying savvy and suave hit men, Bruce Willis portraying a tough-guy boxer and Ving Rhames playing a near-accomplice who's out to get Willis, among other performers featured here, including a cameo by Tarantino himself. All in all, "Pulp Fiction" is Quentin Tarantino's absolute best directorial study in contrast, and is a real eye-opener, with not one boring moment, whatsoever. The VHS Special Edition also features some added trailer footage at the conclusion of the film, narrated by Tarantino himself - another outstanding reason why "Pulp Fiction" is a must-see, must own motion picture that belongs in every movie buff's video library!
