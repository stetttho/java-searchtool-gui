 "A Curious Feeling" is Tony Banks' first solo album. Even though  the singer (Kim Beacon) Tony uses is second-rate, the musicianship on this  CD, carried primarily by TB, more than makes up for the mediocre  singing.Tony's keyboard work is quite compelling on the opening track, an  instrumental titled "From The Undertow", which is most likely  inspired from "Undertow", from the Genesis album ...And Then  There Were Three... The other two instrumentals "Forever Morning"  and "The Waters Of Lethe", are outstanding as well. The tracks  featuring vocals are fine as well, but it is the intrumentals that make  "A Curious Feeling" a masterpiece. What else would you expect rom  the founding member of Genesis? Buy this rare gem before it goes out of  print!
