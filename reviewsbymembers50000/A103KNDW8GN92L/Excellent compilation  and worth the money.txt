 I bought this CD some time ago, and found that the money I spent was well  worth it. If you're an avid Three Dog Night fan like myself, you will not  be disappointed with this double-disc anthology! It contains all their hits  you remember from the 70's, plus album tracks. But, if you find the price  of this set to be too extravagant, you might want to purchase "The  Best Of Three Dog Night" instead. You'll get all their biggest hits  there, which is still worth it. But, if you really enjoy Three Dog Night  the way I do, you'll want to add Celebrate:1965-1975 to your collection,  since most of the TDN titles are now out of print. So, just sit back and  indulge yourself!
