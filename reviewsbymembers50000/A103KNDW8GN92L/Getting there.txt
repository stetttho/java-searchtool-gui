 "The Yes Album" is the band's first insight into the realm of progressive rock, and they make good use of the genre in the tracks "Yours Is No Disgrace" and "Starship Trooper", especially in the rousing, hard-line finish provided in the suite c "Wurm". Much sageful wisdom is found in "I've Seen All Good People", with the majority of those sageful lyrics contained in the suite a "Your Move", and an oft-repetitive nature contained in the suite b "All Good People". Just when the progressivism of "The Yes Album" is being jump-started, the rhythm of the CD is slowed down considerably with "A Venture", but is revived somewhat through the nonchalant embracings of "Perpetual Change". Although the band is learning its craft quite nicely, it would take their next effort for Yes to achieve their full potential in the world of progressive rock. "The Yes Album" would be Tony Kaye's last album with the group (although he would rejoin several years later). His place would be taken by the equally talented Rick Wakeman. For the avid listener looking to get an insight into the band's progressive-rock roots, or if you just need an art-rock fixation, look no further than "The Yes Album", a CD that's sure to please even the most discriminate music fan and Yes fan alike.
