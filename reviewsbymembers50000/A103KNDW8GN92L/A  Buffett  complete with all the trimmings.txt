 "A1A" features some mighty fine classic Jimmy Buffett-styled songwriting with a little bit of that ol' Buffett humor interspersed throughout each and every track. A prime example is "Door Number Three" - a song about the long lost game show "Let's Make A Deal". Gee, I hope Monty Hall's all right, after Jimmy got through with him! Of the few less humorous songs on "A1A", "A Pirate Looks At Forty" is probably the most prospective, and is a companion song both musically and lyrically to "The Captain And The Kid, from "Havana Daydreamin'". "Trying To Reason With Hurricane Season" has its wonderfully tense moments, as the citizens of the island of Kaua'i have been in the same situation with Iniki in '92. With "A1A", Buffett still finds himself in his country phase, and the rest of the songs here are fine compositions as well. Pretty much from this point forward, Buffett would delve into more Caribbean influences in further developing his sound, which would net him a new "flock" of fans known as "ParrotHeads". If you're unable to make it down to Key West, just play "A1A" on your stereo, fill a "Tin Cup Chalice" with good red wine, or fire up some lime daiquiris in the ol' blender, whichever you prefer, chew on some honeysuckle, and you'll think you're in paradise, on the beach, away from your hectic and hurry world. With "A1A", you'll never have to worry about this "Buffett" filling you up. You can come back for more...and more... and more... Once you're in paradise, you'll never want to leave. Take that trip down "A1A" real soon! Can't you just feel the wind at your back, with the sun in your eyes?
