 There is not one terrible song in this collection of pop standards from  1971. Jerry Reed's "When You're Hot, You're Hot", Lobo's "Me  And You And A Dog Named Boo", Hamilton, Joe Frank and Reynolds  "Don't Pull Your Love" and the Fortunes "Here Comes That  Rainy Day Feeling Again" are the best of the bunch. Richie Havens even  has a cover of the Beatles' "Here Comes The Sun". Every fan of  early '70's music can pick their favorites here. One question: Why was  Rhino reluctant to include Three Dog Night's "Joy To The World"  here? that is perhaps the only downside of this CD. Good pop music is here,  nonetheless. A good buy.
