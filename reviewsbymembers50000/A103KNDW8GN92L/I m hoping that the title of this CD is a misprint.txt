 Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the correct title of this CD "Three Dog Night", or simply "One"? Anyway, this is TDN's first album, and it contains many treasured gems, such as the 'Dogs first top ten hit single, titled "One", as written by the late Harry Nilsson. But wait, there's more. Also included on this, TDN's first effort, is the upbeat rocker "Heaven Is In Your Mind", which was previously covered by Traffic, as well as the Robbie Robertson penned "Chest Fever", which (I believe) was also covered by Robbie's group, The Band, on their "Music From Big Pink" album. Let Brother Cory Wells move your soul with the gospel-like uplifting "Try A Little Tenderness" is sure to provide you. To hear Danny's, Chuck's and Cory's three-part harmonies really come to life, I recommend you listen to the choice cuts "It's For You" and "Let Me Go", for they're sure to win your approval. Cory Wells also bares his soul in the bluesy "Bet No One Ever Hurt This Bad", as written by Randy Newman. You say you're feelin' down and lonely? The guys recommend you "Find Someone To Love". I mean, "Nobody" should have to go through such an ordeal. Danny, Chuck and Cory also suggest that you "Don't Make Promises" you can't keep! By the way, Neil Young contributes a composition here as well, titled "The Loner". Three Dog Night would eventually earn their place in rock 'n roll history from this point forward, as they will have amassed twenty-one Top 40 singles, eleven top ten hits, three number ones, as well as an impressive twelve gold albums by 1975. Their record sales to date are an approximate ninety million units sold, which is an enormous feat in and of itself. "Three Dog Night" or "One", is no longer available in the U.S., and is only sold as an import title. Better grab it soon, because it's the only "One" of its kind left. Don't say I didn't tell you so!
