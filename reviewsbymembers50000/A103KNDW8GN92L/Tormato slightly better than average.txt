 After hearing about some of the thumbs down reviews the rock critics gave "Tormato", and after reading a review or two here on the amazon.com review center, well, you just can't please everyone. I, for one, say that this work by Yes, although it's not their best, features some fine numbers that feature solid musicianship. Take Rick Wakeman's whirlwind keyboard playing on "Future Times", and his aquamarine style on "Don't Kill The Whale". "Arriving UFO" is an all-out, hardworking effort, while "Circus Of Heaven", featuring Jon Anderson's son, gives the track a unique perspective. "On The Silent Wings Of Freedom" is nothing to write home to other about, and "Onward" is just average. Even though "Tormato" is not Yes' best CD, fans of this group will want to add it to their collection, nonetheless.
