 This double-disc was recorded live during Genesis' 1976 European tour in Paris. The majority of the tracks featured here are from the Peter Gabriel years, and Phil Collins does a fine job in singing these tracks, including the tracks from the post-Gabriel era. The cream of the crop here is "Supper's Ready", an astounding 24 minutes long. This live version is a tad slower than the album version, as featured on "Foxtrot", but the musical styles featured in this version are superbly crafted and are a perfect compliment to Collins' vocals, as are all the songs featured on this live musical feast. It is on this 1976 tour that Genesis hired ex-Yes, King Crimson and ex-Weather Report members Bill Bruford and Chester Thompson, respectively, to handle drumming duties so Phil Collins can freely roam the stage and focus on his vocal duties. There are some songs I wish the band had included here, such as live versions of "The Battle Of Epping Forest" and perhaps either "Stagnation" or "The Knife". I mean, can't you just imaging PC just singing these songs? "Seconds Out" is the last Genesis album featuring Steve Hackett, who left the band immediately after its release. Of all their live albums I'd recommend, it would have to be "Genesis Live" and this one. Any fan of this great group would have to be a fool if they dont have BOTH of these CD's in their collection. Better buy 'em now while supplies last!
