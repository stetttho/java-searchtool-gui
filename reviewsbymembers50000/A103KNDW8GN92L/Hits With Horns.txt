 "Chicago IX-Greatest Hits" features 11 songs the band recorded from the early to mid-seventies, and every song featured here is a classic. You get Chicago's first major radio hits "Make Me Smile" and "25 Or 6 To 4". Melancholic ballads can also be found in "Wishing You Were Here" and "(I've Been) Searching So Long", although the fiesta-like horns feel found in "Call On Me" can also be classified as a ballad, as is "Colour My World". Please, by all means, have a rockin' good time with "Saturday In The Park" and "Feelin' Stronger Every Day". No need to be time-conscious with "Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?". "Beginnings" is a rather fine tune as well, but the AM radio version heard here is not as good, considering the horns fade out at the end before the band is heard chanting. "Just You 'N Me" has that "relax in the park" type of feel. Much of the lead vocal tracks here were supplied by the late, great Terry Kath, who is sorely missed in the music industry, even almost 23 years after his death. Because of the fact "Chicago IX-Greatest Hits" has the roman numeral title in it, fans of Chicago will want to add it to their collection all the moreso.
