 In honor of Neil Diamond's 35 years in the music industry as a recording artist (as well as a songwriter, which spans a total of some 40 years plus, going back to the late '50's, when Neil wrote his first song for his girlfriend titled "Hear Them Bells"), comes this 2001 reissue of the 1998 release "Colin Anthony Performs A Tribute To Neil Diamond". Although Mr. Anthony's semi-smooth, semi-gruff vocals make this collection of Neil's most popular 1970's and early '80's hits worthy of many a listen, his vocals don't come close to "The Master Himself", but are still quite good. The orchestration in this version of "Mr. Bojangles" sounds exactly like Neil's original LP version (as heard on "Touching You, Touching Me"). One must wonder if Lee Holdridge conducted the arrangements on this version as well, including the rest of the arrangements featured on this fine tributary to Mr. Diamond. The bouncy intro of "Cracklin' Rosie" is also worth the price of this CD, as are all the musical selections here. As for the female vocalization on "You Don't Bring Me Flowers", it is well done, except for the high range parts, which are too much a task for this particular uncredited singer to handle. Colin's vocals keep this tune in check, nonetheless. With all the success Neil Diamond has achieved throughout his long and illustrious career, it's a wonder why more tributes aren't done in his honor, either live or on record (or on CD, whichever you prefer). If you're a true "Diamondhead" who enjoys hearing Neil's hits done in a rather unique style by a different performer, then you'll be pleased as punch to add this wonderful tribute CD to your burgeoning Neil Diamond collection!
