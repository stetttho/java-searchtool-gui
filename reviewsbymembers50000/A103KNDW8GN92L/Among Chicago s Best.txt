 Chicago was in their most productive period with this double-CD put on a single disc. With the first five tracks on "Chicago VII" being instrumentals, they compliment the vocal tracks quite nicely. The instrumentals here are mostly jazz-laden, with "Prelude To Aire" and "Aire" opening the set rather nicely. "Devil's Sweet" is a very sweet and blissful piece of work, and "Italian From New York" sounds very high-tech for the era, with its computer-generated synthesized sounds featured at the opening and closing of the track. The horns then go into high gear on the closing instrumental "Hanky Panky", with guitar and horns interspersed throughout. The bouncy "Life Saver" is the perfect vocal lead-in, while the other vocal tracks on this CD reflect on personal issues, as evident in the Top 40 hits "(I've Been) Searching So Long" and "Call On Me". The Beach Boys sing backing vocals on the interpersonal "Wishing You Were Here". This CD also features a bit of a folk sound in the Peter Cetera penned "Happy Man" and in Terry Kath's "Byblos", as well as in "Song Of The Evergreens", complete with an up-tempo, rousing finish. Signs of the disco era are starting to blossom in "Woman Don't Want To Love Me", another Cetera-penned number. The band lets it all hang out in the fiesta-like "Mongonucleosis". Robert Lamm even contributes with a composition of his own, titled "Skinny Boy", including backing vocals from The Ponter Sisters. "Skinny Boy" also appears on Lamm's solo album of the same name. It is the plethora of music styles, not to mention those world-famous horns, that make "Chicago VII" a success and a must-buy for any fan of Chicago's music.
