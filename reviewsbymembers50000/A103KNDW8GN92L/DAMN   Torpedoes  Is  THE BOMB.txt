 After putting out their first two efforts, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers really deliver the goods with the 1979 release "Damn The Torpedoes". This is one of Petty & Co.'s most successful recordings to date, alongside such gems as "Hard Promises" and "Full Moon Fever" (among others), and it contains two major hits in "Refugee" and "Don't Do Me Like That", including two moderately minor hits with "Even The Losers" and "Here Comes My Girl". What gives "...Torpedoes" such a unique musical flavor, are the creative musical intros displayed in "Shadow Of A Doubt (Complex Kid)", "Century City" and in "Louisiana Rain", where Petty, Benmont Tench, Mike Campbell, Ron Blair and Stan Lynch have these particular musical stylings down to a science. Petty and the 'Breakers take full advantage of their Byrds and Dylan-esque influenced sounds on many of the tracks here, as found in "Even The Losers" and in some others on this CD. In evidence of Petty's unique musical/lyrical landscapes, there's the rockabilly-like "What Are You Doin' In My Life", which features a bit of that Dylan angst, mainly in the lyrics dept.. Petty and the Heartbreakers would continue to experiment with different musical styles in future efforts, thus forever leaving an indelible stamp on the rock era in fine form. "Damn The Torpedoes" is the album that cemented Petty's status as a world renowned, bona fide rock 'n roll star. Any fan of straightforward, hard-line rock 'n roll can justify space in their CD library by adding "DTP" to their must-have CD library today!                                          As far as the sound quality of MCA's "Compact Disc-Compact Price" version of "DTP" is concerned, it is probably no worse than the recently remastered version. I happened to pick up one of the last copies of the pre-mastered 1987 CD version while shopping at Circuit City last week. The "CD-CP" discs are generically packaged and have the color/line grid on the back of these CD's. I've amassed several copies of these discs over the years, and they occupy a good portion of my CD collection. Even though MCA for the most part no longer produces this series, I'm sure most people will find the remaster versions equally to their liking ("Damn The Torpedoes" included). The only negative aspect concerning the "CD-CP" series discs, is that they do not contain any original artwork, lyrics or liner notes. These unique discs make wonderful collector's items, so make sure to add them to your collection today, before there are none left!
