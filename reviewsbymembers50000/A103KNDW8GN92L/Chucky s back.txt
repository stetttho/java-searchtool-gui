 Just bought this CD, and I must say I'm impressed with Mr. Negron's vocal range throughout this CD. Not only does he cover some of the old Three Dog Night stuff, but he includes new originals as well, and he does it with a  flair and style all his own! I also think including his children in some  tracks is a nice, personal touch, which adds a unique, robust flavor here.  The only song I don't care for is the 'discofied' version of "Joy To  The World." I commend Chuck on getting his message across and for  sharing his personal story with us. This is a must-have CD for all hardcore  TDN fans and for those facing personal issues in their life. I highly  recommend reading the book "Three Dog Nightmare", which is an  accompaniment to the CD. Good work, Chuck!
