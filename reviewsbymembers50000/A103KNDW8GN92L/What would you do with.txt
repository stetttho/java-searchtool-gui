 Hmm...let's see...For starters, I would buy myself five or six mansions in different parts of the world, possibly start up a car collection, or perhaps take a few dozen trips around the world and deposit the rest in a bank account. The point is, "Brewster's Millions" is a delightful comedy that stars Richard Pryor as a down and out ex-professional baseball player who must spend thirty million dollars in thirty days. If he is successful, he'll inherit $300,000,000. Sounds easy, right? The catch is that Mr. Pryor must have no assets of any kind after the thirty days to obtain the money. John Candy co-stars as Pryor's buddy and is an "en route" benefactor to Pryor's real fortune. Stephen Collins also co-stars as an attorney who would like nothing more than to con Pryor out of his millions so he can obtain the fortune for his future firm Granville and Baxter. Pat Hingle does an outstanding job as the overseer of the conditions of Montgomery Brewster's (Pryor) great uncle's (Hume Cronyn) will. All this makes for a well-crafted, suspensful comedy. o do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of "Brewster's Millions" today. Chuck Fleming (Peter Jason), Action News!
