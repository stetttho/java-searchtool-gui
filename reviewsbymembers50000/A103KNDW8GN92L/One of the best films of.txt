 If one needs proof of Robin Williams' dramatic acting skills, then he/she needs to look no further than last year's highly effective "One Hour Photo". Here, Williams' cinematic performance is worth many a rave review, and clearly puts him in the spotlight, up close and personal as Sy "the one hour photo guy". We look in on our study in action, working as a lab photo technician at a Wal-Mart-type knockoff. While developing many a photograph, one particular family catches Sy's eye, as well as his personal camera lens, as Sy's job becomes his personal obsession, an obsession that could wind up going too far if Sy isn't careful. In fact, this job means everything to our photography expert, as this storyline is conveyed clearly to the viewer. As the film progresses, the story itself becomes more intense, with the action becoming even more developmental with each passing scene. But, Robin Williams, whose performance here is nothing short of breathtakingly spectacular, isn't the only star whose performance shouldn't go unnoticed. Kudos should also go to Gary Cole, whose performance as a superstore manager and Sy's boss, although somewhat brief, is also worthy of high marks, especially in the intensity dept.. Cole's character is the absolutely perfect opposite foil of Williams' character, where the latter exhibits a Type B personality as opposed to Cole's Type A demeanor. With so many hooks to keep the frequent moviegoer (and regular video purchaser) entertained, and with its star and supporting cast's performances to boot (including Eriq La Salle's [of "ER" and "Coming To America" fame] credible role as a police detective), "One Hour Photo" just might earn Robin Williams the Best Actor Oscar of 2002. This "One Hour Photo" is always in service at your local video retailer today. With all the recent upgrades in video technology, the DVD of this title is your sure ticket to intense chills, thrills and spills, so don't miss out!
