 "From Genesis To Revelation" is the first of a long line of  albums from a gifted and talented group of musicians known as Genesis. The  music on this CD can be described as a cross between early The Moody Blues  and early The Bee Gees. The music on FGTR is easy listening throughout, and  has pleasant tracks like "Am I Very Wrong, "The Conquerer",  "One Day", "In Hiding", "A Place To Call My  Own" and "The Silent Sun", which was Genesis' first single  released in Britain. Not bad for a group's first album. FGTR is produced by  Johnathan King, who had a hit with "Everyone's Gone To The Moon"  in 1965. The members of Genesis at the time of FGTR were students at  London's famous Charterhouse School, and graduated soon afterward.  Personnel and managerial changes would develop by the time Genesis started  work on their second album, "Trespass." FGTR is a nice collection  of songs for any Genesis fan to have in their repertoire.
