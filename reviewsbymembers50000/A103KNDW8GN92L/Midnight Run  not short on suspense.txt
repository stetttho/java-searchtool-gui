 Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin star is this action-packed suspense thriller with a touch of comedy in between. Bounty hunter Jack Walsh (De Niro) is in pursuit of a hypochondriac-type accountant named Jonathan Mardukas (Grodin), whom Walsh gains custody and must return Mardukas from New York to L.A. in order to collect a $100,000 reward. The two men encounter intrigue and danger on this journey, and switch to various modes of transportation to keep the F.B.I. off their trail. Although the writers of the script tried to make this picture into a comedy, the action and suspense overshadow the few comedy scenes, so they (the comedy scenes) don't come out too good in the wash. Even though the intrigue keeps "Midnight Run" moving at a rather slow pace, there's somewhat of a climactic build-up toward the end that may keep you on the edge of your seat. De Niro's straight character combined with Grodin's introverted comedy character give the film's script an even balance, although in various scenes Grodin's character proves to be just as straight as De Niro's. If you like your movies with an overabundant "cops and robbers" feel, then "Midnight Run" will suit you just fine. Add it to your must-have video library!
