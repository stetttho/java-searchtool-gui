 "Whole Oats" is Daryl Hall & John Oates' first album. With  this album, Hall & Oates were experimenting with various musical  styles-from folk music standards on songs like "All Our Love",  "They Needed Each Other", "Southeast City Window" and  "Thank You For...", to rhythm & blues standards on "Fall  In Philadelphia". It is this kind of experimentation that makes this  CD wonderful to listen to. "Lazyman" features the theme line  "is your a** getting sore?" and "Goodnight And  Goodmorning" was later covered by Cecilio And Kapono. The CD's cover  featuring an opened oatmeal box isn't bad, either. Better buy this CD  before Atlantic decides to shelve it.
