 "Smokey And The Bandit" is the epitome of the classic "good guy vs. bad guy" flicks. The starring cast fits this movie quite suitably, and the southern atmosphere and the car chases are out of this world! Jackie Gleason gives the finest acting performance of his career, and Burt Reynolds, Sally Field and Jerry Reed, who also provides the film's soundtrack, offer stellar performances as well. Smokey And The Bandit's two sequels don't hold up as well as this first one. So, if you're a fan of these "southern-fried" car chasin' comedies, then "Smokey And The Bandit" is one movie you gotta own! Now, I think I'll run out and grab me a Diablo sandwich and a Dr. Pepper!
