 There are some good songs here, like the upbeat anthem  "Celebrate", the sentimental ballad from the musical 'Hair'  "Easy To Be Hard", covers by Laura Nyro and Elton John  "Eli's Coming", "Lady Samantha". Three Dog Night also  contributes with a couple of their own compositions as well, with the drum  instrumental "King Solomon's Mines", and Danny Hutton's  "Dreaming Isn't Good For You". This album put TDN on the map. Too  bad "Suitable For Framing" isn't available domestically. Better  purchase this version before it, too goes out of print.
