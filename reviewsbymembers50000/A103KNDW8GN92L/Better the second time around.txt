 The thing that makes "National Lampoon's European Vacation" stand out from its original predecessor "National Lampoon's Vacation" is the lush, green European scenery combined with the dialogue between the film's characters. Add the delightful comedic talents of Monty Python's Eric Idle, and you have the makings of a hilarious movie, with Idle adding an element of slapstick, screwball physical comedy that occurs with each accident that brings with it a style only Chevy Chase's character, Clark Griswold can create. Dana Hill and Jason Lively fit into their roles as brother and sister Audrey and Russ Griswold quite nicely. Let's not forget the lovely talents of Beverly D'Angelo as Ellen Griswold, whose shower scene in the movie is sort of on the risque side, but ends up being hysterical when she finds it advertised on an Italian billboard due to Clark's accidental videotaping! I did find the kissing scene between John Astin's game show emcee character and the Griswold daughter (Dana Hill) character to be totally inappropriate for a film that the whole family can watch together. If you're into scenic films with a good dose of comedic dialogue and action-adventure, then "European Vacation" is the movie for you! Highly recommended
