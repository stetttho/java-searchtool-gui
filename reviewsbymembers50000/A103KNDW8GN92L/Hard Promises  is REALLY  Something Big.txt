 On this album, Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers really come into their own, thus coming up with a variety of unique musical styles and arrangements. This is evidenced in a majority of the selections featured on "Hard Promises". The album starts off with a rockin' flurry, courtesy of the first three numbers ("The Waiting", "A Woman In Love (It's Not Me)" and "Nightwatchman"), then mellows out with a soothing cool down, as noted in the tracks "Something Big", "Letting You Go" and "Insider". The CD almost ends just as it began, with the driven-homeness of "The Criminal Kind" and "You Can Still Change Your Mind". Even though Petty and the 'Breakers left a little of their Byrds and Dylan influences behind on "Hard Promises", this is still an outstanding effort, for the most part. Petty & crew really proved to the world they could stand on their own ten legs (even with a little help from Stevie Nicks, who provides backing vocals on "Insider" and "A Thing About You". Petty later returned the favor on Nicks' "Bella Donna" album, released later the same year "Hard Promises" came out [1981]), and it shows in the band's musicianship, as featured on this CD. Bob Dylan would be impressed with Tom Petty's awesome sound-alike vocalization on "The Criminal Kind". One of your first New Year's resolutions should be including this priceless musical gem in your CD collection. This should be one "Promise" that isn't "Hard" to keep, and thus, is one "Easy" sell!
