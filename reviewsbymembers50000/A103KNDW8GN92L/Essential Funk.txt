 "The Best Of Kool & The Gang-The Millennium Collection"  contains all their best radio songs-with no filler. The majority of these  songs were released during my high school years, and, man, were these songs  HUGE!!! In this sampler of some of K&TG's greatest hits, you get one of  the greatest party songs of all time, "Celebration", which will  have you dancing for hours! You also get "Too Hot",  "Joanna", "Cherish" and "Fresh"-all a staple  of early-to-mid '80's radio playlists. "Hollywood Swinging", one  of Kool's early hits, was the main reason I purchased this priceless gem of  Mercury/MCA's 20th Century Masters Series. So, if you're into funk, or if  you don't want to spend more on a pricier Kool & The Gang Greatest Hits  Collection, this is the CD for you! Buy it before the record company(ies)  decides to take this 20th Century Masters Series out of print.
