 The 1977 release "Changes In Latitudes, Changes In Attitudes", continues with Jimmy Buffett's shift away from the country music sound, as featured in his earlier albums, and more toward the Carribean sound he would become well noted for amongst his legions of "ParrotHeads". "Changes..." is a ParrotHead's paradise, as displayed in the CD's two hit singles - the title track and "Margaritaville", which contains a dated reference of yesteryear - the venerable pop-top. These pull-off ring tabs, mostly featured on both soda and beer cans, ceased production around 1980 for soda cans (1980 was also the year when most soda canneries opted for aluminum over steel cans). Thus, the pull-off tabs were replaced in favor of more stationary pull-back tabs. The pull-backs resulted in fewer minor skin abrasions (including fewer use of band-aids), thus being beneficial for the consumer. The conventional pull-back, peel-off ring tabs were continually being used on some beer cans up until around the mid 1990's or so. Getting back to the main review, a majority of the remaining tracks are comprised of easy listening flair, as featured in such selections as "Wonder Why We Ever Go Home", "Lovely Cruise", "In The Shelter", among others. "Tampico Trauma" is a number that somewhat capitalizes on those Caribbean influences, as mentioned above. For songs with a bit of a harder edge, there's the title track and the closer "Landfall". It is on "Changes..." that Buffett really puts his best foot forward into his unique storytelling and songwriting talents, and definitely should not be overlooked by any die-hard ParrotHead by any means. For best results, serve chilled - shaken, not stirred!
