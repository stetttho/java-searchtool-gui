 "Three Chord Opera" is Neil Diamond's first CD of original material since the 1996 release "Tennessee Moon", as well as his first overall in nearly three years since 1998's "The Movie Album: As Time Goes By". "TCO" is perhaps a slight return to form in the way of original material since Neil's release of "Lovescape" ten years prior. "TCO" can be classified as the ultimate feel-good Neil Diamond CD, with its upbeat, inspirational messages, as contained in the selections "Don't Look Down", "Baby Let's Drive" and "Leave A Little Room For God". "At The Movies" has a lush, conceptive feel to it in regard to the lyrics, and is just plain fun! Classic Diamond romantic fare and sound can also be found in the many tracks featured on "TCO", as in "I Haven't Played This Song In Years", "I Believe In Happy Endings", "Midnight Dream", "You Are The Best Part Of Me" and "Turn Down The Lights" are many true Diamond gems just waiting to be discovered. Neil pays a nice, lovely tribute to his son on "Elijah's Song", and should not be ignored or overlooked. The same can be said for the rest of the songs on "TCO", which is destined to become a rare Diamond masterwork, as well as yet another multi-million seller in the virtual Diamondville gold, or perhaps platinum mine. Many a listener will be fooled upon first glance of the CD's cover (featuring Neil holding an acoustic guitar), into thinking the songs have a complete acoustic nature. One further look at the cover (with Neil wearing a black leather jacket) should somewhat explain the tone of the songs, which will surprise the listener upon the very first listen. "Three Chord Opera" is one CD for the ages, thus, any "Diamondhead" would be foolish to pass this one up!
