 In 1974, sensing "Red" would be the last album King Crimson would record together, Robert Fripp, John Wetton & Bill Bruford decided to go out with a metallic bang. Such is the case on the opening title track, which leaves the listener both amazed and awe-struck the entire 6:12. As the record moves into the second track, "Fallen Angel", the listener is treated to even more of these "semi-heavy metal" abrasions, including Wetton's vocals sung in between these muscular metallic arpeggiations. The parallel guitar riffs present in "One More Red Nightmare" by Fripp, are masterful and hook-laden, which demonstrates the mastery of his guitar playing intricacies brilliantly. Wetton's bass work and Bruford's percussion rhythms (especially on "OMRN") are audio poetry in motion as well. The latter two cuts, "Providence" and "Starless", display David Cross' mastery of the violin and Mel Collins dexterity in his saxophone playing respectively, both exquisitely done to a tee. Sadly, "Red" would be the last album to feature the core trio of Fripp, Bruford and Wetton. Fripp would retire King Crimson for six years, before gathering together a new lineup in 1981, featuring the likes of Adrian Belew on lead vocals and Tony Levin on bass, among others. With so much "heavy-metal", classical & jazzy get-up-and-go, not to mention three highly talented and competent musicians to bring it all home in splendid fashion, "Red" is definitely a must-have KC masterwork you'll definitely want to have in your progressive-rock CD library!
