 A manic dialogue, combined with an irregular dose of hilarity performed in Bill Cosby fashion, makes for an interesting stand-up performance in this 1981 "concert" taped in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Bill lets loose a tongue galloping marathon bonanza, as he pulls no punches in describing such subject matter as dysfunctional families, independent toddlers, hillbilly rednecks, dentists, and many more. Expectant mothers and fathers-to-be are sure to get a hoot out of natural child birthing, which is explained in a way only Mr. Cosby can, bringing hilarious results, no doubt. Also, for educational purposes, there's "Say No To Drugs The Cosby Way" - he'll show you how to say no, all right!!! Bill also receives some good tips from his own children about what to eat for breakfast (this you gotta hear!), and the results may surprise you! As a result, Mr. Cosby hasn't lost his comedic touch, which means that "Bill Cosby, Himself" may be Bill's best stand-up work since his "Bill Cosby Is A Very Funny Fellow - RIGHT!" album (which features the equally hilarious, classic "Noah" skits). "Bill Cosby, Himself" definitely belongs in everyone's comedy library. A 1,000,001 laughs will be had by all who view it!
