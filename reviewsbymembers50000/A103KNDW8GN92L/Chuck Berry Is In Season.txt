 Chuck Berry has forever left an indelible stamp on the rock era, with his unique signature guitar playing and somewhat risque personality. With "Chuck Berry Is On Top", there are plenty of premium "berries" to snack on, including the tasty "Maybelline", the aromatic "Johnny B. Goode" and the rather filling "Roll Over Beethoven", for starters. "Blues For Hawaiians" makes a satisfying after dinner dessert (and it reeks of sheer Berry geniusness, too), all candied up with a unique brand of Polynesian sweetness. And if all this isn't enough to satisfy a hearty craving, there's "Jo Jo Gunne" to fill that hungry belly. Chuck Berry is (perhaps) the first African-American to perform in rock 'n roll circles, and thus has influenced many artists, including the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and the Who, to mention a few noteworthy artists. Yes, folks, these "berries" are definitely in season, so it would be wise to pick a few, before "Chuck Berry Is On Top" is taken out of season for the last time.
