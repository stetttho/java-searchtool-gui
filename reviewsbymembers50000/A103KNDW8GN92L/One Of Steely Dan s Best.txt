 "The Royal Scam" is perhaps one of their best CD's I've had the  pleasure of listening to so far. Here, the team of Walter Becker and Donald  Fagen employ the use of a horn section on "The Caves Of  Altamira", which gives this otherwise lethargic track added gusto. The  highlights of this CD are "Kid Charlemagne", "The Fez",  "Haitian Divorce" and the title track. Can't quite understand the  logic behind the album cover, but it's a nice one, nonetheless. Nice music,  including the work of the backup musicians. This one's worth owning!
