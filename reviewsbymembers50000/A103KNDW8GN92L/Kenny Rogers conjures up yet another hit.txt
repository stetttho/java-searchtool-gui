 The 1980's, as well as the latter half of the 1970's, proved to be the most successful decade and a half of Kenny Rogers' music career, as he ascertained a majority of hits on both the pop and country charts during those two decades, respectively. The 1983 effort "We've Got Tonight" is no exception, as it contains one pop/country/AC (adult contemporary) hit, titled "All My Life", with the rest of the tracks being predominantly country, of course. Either a country or pop music afficianado will find these selections a true winner: the title track, which features Kenny performing a duet with Scottish pop siren Sheena Easton, the introspective "What I Learned From Loving You" and the Joe Cocker remake "You Are So Beautiful", among them. It is on "YASB" where KR provides his smooth, gruff trademark vocals. "Bad Enough" and "Farther I Go" are also superbly done musical and lyrical compositions as well, with both latter tracks featuring up-tempo, bouncy choruses. The lyrics of "Scarlet Fever" are a little on the sexually explicit side, as expressed in one such line: "She looked twenty-five, but I was told she was just sixteen." There are other semi-risque lyrics featured in this selection, but I won't delve into those any further. The chords featured in "Scarlet Fever", however, are a delight to the ears, which more than make up for the somewhat underaged tone of the lyrics. These are only some of the above mentioned "guilty pleasures" that you'll find on "We've Got Tonight". You'll feel even more guilty if you don't have this one in your collection. Get it, before it's gone!
