 I recently bought the remastered version of "Foxtrot" on CD, and in comparison to the original non-mastered previous version of "Foxtrot", needless to say, I couldn't tell the difference in sound quality. This is still a great CD, remastered or not. It's just a shame that none of the CD titles in the Genesis Definitive Edition Remaster Series contain bonus tracks, although, according to various sources surrounding the Genesis camp, there are/were quite a number of "throwaway" singles the band could have included here. For instance, the Definitive Edition Remaster of "Selling England By The Pound" should have contained the bonus track "Twilight Alehouse", but, for some reason, either the record company (Atlantic) or the band decided not to include it. To my knowledge, no extra tracks were recorded during the "Foxtrot" sessions. The least Atlantic could have done was to include one or two live selections from the "Foxtrot" tour on this remastered version. In the way of sheer brilliance and originality, this is still a five-star work of art, nonetheless. The standout track on "Foxtrot" is the 23 minute long and delghtful "Supper's Ready". I love those silly, profound lyrics, and the varying musical styles used throughout "Supper's Ready" are astounding! You'll find other choice cuts here as well, like the opening track "Watcher Of The Skies", "Time Table", "Get 'Em Out By Friday" and "Can-Utility And The Coastliners." If you are a Genesis fan or just a lyrics buff, this is the CD for you!
