 Women, for the most part, have faced some major problems during the first half of the 20th century (including events that occurred beforehand & certain situations that continue to thrive even in today's world). Some of these problems include suffrage, second-class citizenship & job security - the latter subject being the primary focus of "North Country". The movie deals with a group of working-class women facing an upheaval struggle while working at a Minnesota factory. The discrimination these women encounter is apparent throughout the film, & is captured beautifully & theatrically, leaving no stone unturned. The sexual harassment premise will leave the average viewer on the edge of their seat, leaving one to ponder the fate of these women on the road to nowhere, with a slimmering ray of hope off somewhere in the distance. Featuring outstanding performances from both Charlize Theron (as a lead worker & advocate of conditions in the workplace) & Frances McDormand (as a worker later debilitated as a result of the plant's negligence), "North Country" has enough stamina to maintain a continual flow of dramatic nuances to keep one from falling asleep at anytime during the run of the picture. Kudos to Woody Harrelson (as an attorney) for providing one of the film's most upstanding displays of character, & a rather moving portrayal at that. Based on actual events, "North Country" could very well be in the running for earning some serious hardware at award ceremonies before 2005 is history. The soundtrack is not to be taken lightly, either - featuring songs by the likes of Bob Dylan (a Minnesota native) & various other musical artists which deserve more than honorable mention raves. This is one movie that's destined to be in one's all-important DVD library, that's for certain!
