 This CD contains some untimely classics (Black And White, Pieces Of April) satire (My Old Kentucky Home) and rockers (Chained, Tulsa Turnaround). Love that line "when a man's gonna eat fried chicken he's gonna get  greasy!" There's a nice ballad titled "Freedom For The  Stallion", as well. I recommend you buy this CD. You will not be  disappointed!
