 "Boy In The Box", Corey Hart's sophomoric effort, is a step up from his previous release "First Offense". It is on this album where Corey delves deeper into his introspective songwriting capabiities, with many of the lyrics being more biting and insightful than on Corey's previous effort. This insight is well-scoped out in such tracks as "Silent Talking" and "Water From The Moon". Two of the songs on "Box" feature a Latin flair - those being the album's title track and "Sunny Place, Shady People". A very tender ballad is featured in "Eurasian Eyes", with wonderful lyrical and musical content, which is brilliantly played to the hilt. The star ballads on "Box" belong to both of the album's singles "Never Surrender", a song about searching for lost love and having the courage to make your own choices in the face of adversity, and "Everything In My Heart", a powerful soul-grabbing number. "Komrade Kiev" deals with the cut-throat pressures of the Cold War in a serious manner, while "Waiting For You" is absolutely fun. With so many good songs to pick and choose from, "Boy In The Box" is one CD you'll definitely want to have in your collection. It is only available as an import title, as are a majority of Corey's CD's. Get it, before it's boxed up for good!
