 This is the best King Crimson offering I've heard so far. "21st  Century Schizoid Man" and "In the Court Of The Crimson King"  are wonderfully superb, progressively hard-rocking bookends. The pages of  this book contain somewhat somber, moody songs like "I Talk To The  Wind", "Epitaph" and "Moonchild". There is a  relaxed instrumental which follows "Moonchild" titled "The  Dream And The Illusion". "In The Court Of The Crimson King"  is truly a work of art. You'll want to add this masterpiece to your  collection.
