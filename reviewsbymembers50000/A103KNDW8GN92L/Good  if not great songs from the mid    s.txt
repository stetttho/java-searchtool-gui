 "Have A Nice Day Volume 13" features some nice pop tunes from the year that spawned Watergate-1974. "Midnight At The Oasis", "The Night Chicago Died", "Please Come To Boston", "Rock Me Gently", "I Can Help" and "Life Is A Rock (But The Radio Rolled Me)" are the pick of the litter here. Both tunes by Bo Donaldson And The Heywoods, titled "Billy Don't Be A Hero" and "Who Do You Think You Are" are just average, while the Jim Stafford song "My Girl Bill" is a little too silly for my tastes. Ranking right up there with the other primo tunes in this collection is "Radar Love" by Golden Earring. So, take your pick here and enjoy "Have A Nice Day-Volume 13", the only CD series endorsed by Mick Foley (WWF's Mankind, aka WWF Commissioner). HAVE A NICE DAY!!!
