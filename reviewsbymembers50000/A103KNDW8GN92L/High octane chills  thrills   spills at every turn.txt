 Hal Needham directs this 1981 box office "runaway" hit, which features an all-star cast. Needham spares no expense in maximizing the physical car chase ambience, except, unlike his prior pictures which also feature Burt Reynolds (i.e. the first two "Smokey And The Bandit" movies, "The Cannonball Run" (for the most part) lacks the physicality of the car crashes that were an integral part of the "SATB" flicks. Instead, Needham relies on some dirty-pool interplay between various contestants to add to the cross-country racing element. There's still plenty of action to be had, however, as Needham does a splendid job in bringing everything together, including the somewhat exhausting job of bringing a unique and well-known array of celebrities. Some of these standout entertainers featured in "The Cannonball Run" include the likes of Dean Martin and fellow "Rat Packer" Sammy Davis, Jr. as well. Jack Elam, Mel Tillis, Terry Bradshaw, Dom DeLuise, Burt Reynolds and even a young, up-and-coming Jackie Chan also come along for the ride in this free-for-all run for some big bucks (and not to mention some FAST women!!!). The race is on from New Jersey to California, as everyone is out to claim the big prize, no matter what the cost. The closing moments, as well as the bloopers featured in the final credits, make "The Cannonball Run" well worth the purchase. So, race on down to your local retailer, and order this souped up vehicle today, or you'll be left at the finish line (in last place, with nothing to show for it, of course)!
