 I saw this movie when it was in the theater in 1989. I liked it so much that I had to buy it on VHS. Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor star as two innocent guys-one deaf, one blind, and both are on the run for a murder they didn't commit! Add the wonderful talents of Joan Severance and Kevin Spacey, and you have the makings of one well scripted and very funny movie! Oh, and let's not forget Alan North as the police chief. The film's plot makes for a cops and robbers type of suspense. Of all of Gene Wilder's and Richard Pryor's works, "See No Evil, Hear No Evil" is as equally funny as "Silver Streak", which makes it a must buy!
