 John Conlee has had a phenomenal career in the world of classic country music, and this collection of John Conlee standouts is an ultimate testament to that outstanding career. Most of the selections featured here display a theme of lost love and sheer romantic bliss - a Conlee trademark. These traits are successfully captured in the signature "Rose Colored Glasses", the amnesiac ambience of "I Don't Remember Loving You", the lowbrow man's anthem "Common Man", and in the roundabout, pent-up heavy "Friday Night Blues", among others. There's also a fantastic rendition of Ray Charles' "Busted", as well. "Old School" will defiitely take one back to their high school reunion, replete with memories of their first love. For lovers of up-tempo numbers, there's one titled "I'm Only In It For The Love". This is one CD that's worth many a repeated listen in your CD player, that is...IF ONLY THIS TITLE WAS MADE AVAILABLE ON CD, as other John Conlee so-called "greatest hits" collections aren't as complete as "John Conlee 20 Greatest Hits" is. This is one CD that definitely deserves to carry the "Greatest Hits" title, and is a CD that desperately needs to be brought back into print. And so, the question that needs to be raised is: HEY RECORD COMPANIES, ARE YOU LISTENING!?! PLEASE BRING "JOHN CONLEE 20 GREATEST HITS" BACK INTO PRINT, PRONTO!
