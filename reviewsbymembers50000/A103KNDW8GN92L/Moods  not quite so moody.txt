 This is Neil Diamond's follow-up 1972 album after Stones. You would expect  from this album's title that the songs featured here would display a lot of  heartfelt emotion-guess again. While ND's previous effort, Stones, ran the  gamut of emotions ranging from happy to sad and somewhere in between,  Moods, on the other hand, displays emotions ranging from happy to downright  silly. This range of motion is prevalent in the songs "Song Sung  Blue", "Play Me", "Captain Sunshine",  "Morningside", "Walk On Water", "Porcupine  Pie" and "Gitchy Goomy". There is very little sadness to be  felt here. Still a nice, listenable piece of work which I'm sure you'll  enjoy as much as I do. Get this CD!
