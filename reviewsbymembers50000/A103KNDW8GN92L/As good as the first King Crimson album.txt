 With "Larks' Tongues In Aspic", King Crimson takes us on yet another wondrous and thought-provoking musical, as well as lyrical, journey. This particular journey starts out rather calmly on the title track, then the Larks descend on their prey with a fury of fire as the track progresses. "Book of Saturday" is a nice, overly sentimental number, while "Exiles" is a track that features rather schizoid musical tendencies, in that the guitar has a mind of its own. The crown jewel here is the comical "Easy Money", complete with a morbid sense of humor and maniacal laugh at the end. Just what in blue blazes are "moccasin sneakers" anyway? "The Talking Drum" is somewhat of a misnomer, yet is very free-flowing with its odd bass and percussive rhythms. The Larks appeared to have awoken from their long hibernation in "Larks' Tongues In Aspic, Part Two", and return with that same fury of fire as in the beginning. Hmm...I guess those Larks are/were still hungry. If you have an enormous appetite for King Crimson's music, you better grab these "Larks" before they migrate south for the winter, permanently!
