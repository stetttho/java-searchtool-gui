 "Super Hits of the '70's - Have A Nice Day Vol. 24" contains an even balance of strong and weak latter '70's Top 40 hits. The CD's strong points are well stated in the tracks "Makin' It" (David Naughton),"Save Your Kisses For Me" (Brotherhood Of Man), the unique and untimely instrumental "Feels So Good" (Chuck Mangione), the Bee Gees penned "Emotion" (Samantha Sang). The strongest of these strong points in this collection is the Andrew Gold smash "Thank You For Being A Friend" (which, of course was later re-recorded by an unknown artist and was used as the theme of the hit '80's sitcom "The Golden Girls"). Let's not forget the Elvis Presley tribute song "The King Is Gone", complete with a well-styled Presley-like vocal, courtesy of Ronnie McDowell. Unfortunately, the weaker tracks noticeably offset the stronger ones. Therefore, Rhino could have put better songs in the place of such horrendous tracks as the Eric Carmen penned "Hey Deanie" (Shaun Cassidy), "Love Fire" (Jigsaw), "Everybody Be Dancin'" (Starbuck) [with these two groups putting out much stronger previous tracks with "Sky High" and "Moonlight Feels Right", respectively, which are also contained in previous volumes in this '70's series] and perhaps the most horrendous track of all, which rears its' ugly head here with "Did You Boogie With Your Baby" (Flash Cadillac & The Continental Kids). "Vol. 24" provides adequate middle ground, as featured in the tracks "Heaven On The 7th Floor" (Paul Nicholas) and in the doo-wop styled "Street Corner Serenade" (Wet Willie). Even though "Vol. 24" is perhaps the most mediocre effort of this 25 volume CD series, you'll find that there are better volumes in this series, hands down. "Vol. 24" is recommended for completists only.
