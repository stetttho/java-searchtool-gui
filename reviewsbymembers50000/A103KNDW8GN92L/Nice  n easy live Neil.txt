 When I bought "Neil Diamond-His 12 Greatest Hits on cassette back in  1989, I noticed there were two live versions of "Holly Holy" and  "Sweet Caroline" found there. Needless to say, years later I  figured out these songs were on the "Hot August Night" CD, so I  went out and bought it. Here, you will find the early '70's Neil Diamond  hits performed live in a relaxed style at the Greek Theater in Los Angeles.  The two above mentioned songs are my favorite on this two-disc set. All the  other songs are good, as well. If you want to buy only one Neil Diamond  live CD, look no further than "Hot August Night".
