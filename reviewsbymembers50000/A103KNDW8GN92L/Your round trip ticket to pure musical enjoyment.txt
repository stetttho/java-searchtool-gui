 Coming off "The Jazz Singer" movie and soundtrack on a high note, comes Neil Diamond's Autumn 1981 release "On The Way To The Sky". It is here where you'll find the major AOR/pop hit "Yesterday's Songs" and the major-minor hits "Be Mine Tonight" and the title track. "Right By You" should have been a major AOR/pop hit in it's own right, with its mellow, infectious bluesy rhythms. "OTWTTS" features rockin', semi-up-tempo numbers as well, in the uniquely titled "Fear Of The Marketplace" and in the melancholicly titled "Rainy Day Song", which will give you a quick pick me up on a cloudy day. "Guitar Heaven" will literally and figuratively have you floating on Cloud Nine upon the first listen! Tom Hensley's and Alan Lindgren's orchestral arrangements and talents are really extraordinary and tastefully done in the compositions "Only You" and "Save Me", among other selections featured on this CD. "The Drifter" and "Love Burns" are fine tracks as well. With all these brilliantly arranged cuts to choose from, and with the never-ending listening pleasure "On The Way To The Sky" is sure to bring you, and at around ..., is cheaper than most round-trip airline tickets. Buckle up, and have a pleasant flight!
