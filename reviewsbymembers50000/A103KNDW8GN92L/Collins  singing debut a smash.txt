 "A Trick Of The Tail" marks Phil Collins debut as Genesis'  full-time lead singer, replacing Peter Gabriel, who left the group a year  earlier. Not only does Collins do a superb job on lead vocals, he is also a  seasoned pro on the drums. Collins has a more than capable supporting cast  in Tony Banks, Mike Rutherford and Steve Hackett. Together, the talents of  these four individuals reall shine on this CD. There are no standout track  here, and each one is a classic. How can you go wrong with the explosion  provided by "Dance On A Volcano?" "A Trick Of The Tail"  contains an equally impressive ballad titled "Ripples", and  "Robbery, Assault And Battery" has somewhat of a comical side.  This CD also marks the first of a long line of pure instrumentals in  "Los Endos", a rolicking, progressive piece of music. Please Buy  this CD, along with the group's follow-up "Wind & Wuthering".  Either or both of these CD's are a delight to have in your colection!
