 "Roger Williams Greatest Hits" is a spectacular collection of this remarkably gifted composer's career. This collection features twelve of Williams' most cherished recordings, which even a classical connoisseur of this style of music can best appreciate. The CD beigins with a symphonic fury of fire, courtesy of the beautifully crafted "Autumn Leaves". All of the other standout compositions featured here are sure to make one a student of the school of classical art. Roger Williams' finest adaptable movie scores make appearances here as well. "The High and the Mighty" stands tall on its' own merits, while "Tammy" brings out a feminine side all its' own, complete with a smooth orchestral flow, as is the case with the majority of the selections featured on this "Greatest Hits" 'mini-anthology'. But, Williams' is not totally content to rest on his serene musical laurels, for on "I Got Rhythm", he really sews his wild musical notes in a progressive-like fashion. Even Roger is apt to turn such classics into a work of art, like the masterful "Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto #1". Heck, even ol' "Tchaik" would tip his hat to Mr. Williams' piano stylings, thus making the master proud. There's not one bad composition to be found on "Roger Williams Greatest Hits", although it is most likely one will find more complete Roger Williams anthologies in print. With that said, this greatest hits collection is a must-have item to have in one's classical CD library. Musical genius of this magnitude only comes along once in a lifetime, so it's important to make this a wothwhile purchase ASAP, before MCA takes it out of print.
