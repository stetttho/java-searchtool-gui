 Three Dog Night was the hottest thing going between 1969 and 1974, and this CD is in the midst of that hotstreak. This CD contains some wonerful ballads (An Old Fashioned Love Song, Never Dreamed You'd Leave Me In  Summer) along with some nice rockers (The Family Of Man, Never Been To  Spain, Jam, Murder In My Heart For The Judge) and good poetic vibes from  Intro/Poem: Mistakes And Illusions:Peace Of Mind-proving the 'Dogs can be  both sentimental and versatile here. A must have CD!
