 This is my favorite early Genesis CD. Each and every song here diplays a  wealth of artistic arrangements and talent. The creme de la creme musically  is Tony Banks work on the Mellotron on songs like "Dancing With The  Moonlit Knight", and on the instrumental "After The Ordeal"  and "The Cinema Show." Mike Rutherford's use of the Sitar on  "I Know What I Like" is also appreciated. Phil Collins adds his  vocals on his lone track here titled "More Fool Me", a weepy,  senimental ballad. Let's not forget the comical "The Ballad Of Epping  Forest", a well thought out laugh fest! Gotta love the lines  "Accountants keep a score, 10-4, "The blue bell are ringing for  sweet, clear Sam, clear ham, handing out bread and jam, just like any  picnic...picnic!... picnic!" how about this line: "The butler's  got jam on his lens like dough out of the pot, with teeth on a silver pot  just like any picnic!...picnic!... picnic!...picnic!" Sorry, but I  couldn't help overindulging myself! The point is, with Genesis, typically  early Genesis, you never know what to expect. aside from the excellent  musicianship displayed on "Selling England", Peter Gabriels  vocals are nothing to sneeze at. If you are a true Genesis fan, and you  don't have this CD in your collection, what are you waiting for? buy it  now. I highly recommend it!
