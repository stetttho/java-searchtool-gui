 The self-titled "Genesis" album (aka "Shapes") is a nice body of work, considering its '80's overly-synthesized theme. The opening track, titled "Mama", is just so-so, due to Phil Collins' frightfully annoying whining throughout parts of that entire track. "Home By The Sea" and "Second Home By The Sea" feature wonderful instrumentalization throughout, particularly by Tony Banks. "Illegal Alien" finds Phil Collins sporting an annoyingly funny Mexican accent, which sort of accompanies the fiesta-like music adequately. The standout tracks here are the standoffish "That's All", the tough-love approach of "Taking It All Too Hard" and the soulful "It's Gonna Get Better". "Silver Rainbow" features nicely crafted musicianship between Banks, Collins, and Mike Rutherford as well. "Shapes" is a nice embodiment of songs for any Genesis fan to have in their collection, which makes it a must-have CD.
