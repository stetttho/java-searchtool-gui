 Yes, folks, Dylan goes country! What makes this CD enjoyable to listen to  is Mr. Dylan's smooth, relaxed vocal style, an improvement over his usual  nasal-twanged voice. The standout track here is "Lay Lady Lay".  "To Be Alone With You" and "Peggy Day" are welcome  tracks as well. Mr. Dylan also teams up with Johnny "The Man In  Black" Cash on "Girl From The North Country", a sort-of  sentimental ballad. The only complaint I have about this CD is that is a  very short 27 minutes long. I would have liked to hear more of this lovely,  "new and improved" vocal style, which is unique in it's own  right! This may be one of the very few times you'll hear Dylan in this  style, so please buy this CD, and tell 'em David sent ya!
