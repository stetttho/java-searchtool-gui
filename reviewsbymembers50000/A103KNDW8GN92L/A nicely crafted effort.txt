 As I stated in a prior review, I bought "Bankstatement" when it initially came out on cassette in 1989. I recently purchased it on CD, and, unlike the cassette, it contains a bonus track, titled "Diamonds Aren't So Hard", which features a superbly-blended combination of Alto Saxophone and Tony Banks' haunting keyboard melodies. Nearly all of the tracks on "Bankstatement" are good, except "Queen Of Darkness" and "A House Needs A Roof", both of which sound too much like an aerobics class, although "QOD" has a nice guitar/keyboard intro. Jayney Klimek's ultra-sexy, powerful vocals give these two otherwise drab tracks much needed life, while Alistair Gordon's vocals on the other tracks (Throwback, I'll Be Waiting, Raincloud, The Border, The More I Hide It and Diamonds Aren't So Hard) have a somewhat limited range, and are just average. "That Night" is a lovely, sentimental ballad that features both Gordon and Klimek sharing lead vocals. Tony Banks' vocals on "Big Man" suits that song's lyrics and music perfectly. It's just too bad that this is Tony's only vocal appearance on "Bankstatement". TB's whirlwind keyboard style is rather effective on the lone instrumental track "Thursday The Twelfth". It is Mr. Banks' chilling keyboard work on this CD that makes "Bankstatement" worth having in any Tony Banks or Genesis fan's CD library. Too bad Atlantic Records in the U.S. took this one out of print, but it is still worth paying more for the import. Better buy "Bankstatement" before Virgin decides to take it out of print.
