 "This Side Of Paradise" provides a sampling of the classic Cars sound, and why not? Some of Ric Ocasek's Cars mates help him out on his second solo release, although Ocasek breathes a somewhat different life in a few of the songs here. Take, for instance, "Emotion In Motion", with its slowed-down rhythms and unique lyrics, which don't sound like the typical Cars record. The same can be said for the title track, along with "Emotion In Motion". which lack the new wave appeal and sound The Cars helped define. The other tracks, such as "Hello Darkness" and "p.f.j.", have that Cars sensibility written all over them. Even though the music and songs featured on this CD are very similar to that of Ocasek's group, The Cars, "This Side Of Paradise" is still an enjoyable CD to listen to. The reduced price is a sure sign it won't be around forever, which is why any die-hard Cars/Ric Ocasek fan should have this title in their collection.
