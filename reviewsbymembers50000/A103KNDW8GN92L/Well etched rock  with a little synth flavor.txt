 "First Offense", Corey Hart's first album, features some rather diverse musical styles. For instance, there's the synthesizer-rock driven "Sunglasses At Night", the jazzy "Peruvian Lady" and "She Got The Radio" and the melancholic, heart touching ballads, which are Corey's forte, foretold both musically and lyrically in "It Ain't Enough" and "Jenny Fey". There's also a little Latin flavor in the somewhat salsified rhythms of "At The Dance". These are just some of the tracks which make "First Offense" a CD to add to your collection. It's a real shame this is no longer available on EMI as a domestic title, so get it while you still can!
