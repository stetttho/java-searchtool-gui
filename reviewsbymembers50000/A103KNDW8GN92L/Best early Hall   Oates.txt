 "Abandoned Luncheonette" features the kind of music at which  Daryl & John are most adept-Philly Soul. All the songs here are  excellent, with the cream of the crop being "When The Morning  Comes", "Las Vegas Turnaround", "I'm Just A Kid (Don't  Make Me Feel Like A Man)", the title track, "Lady Rain" and  "Laughing Boy". "Everytime I Look At You" is the most  soulful track on this CD, which has a "hillbilly" banjo and  violin-laden instrumental at the end. This is probably as close to country  that H & O ever got! This has to be the best CD in their entire  catalog. Oh, and "Abandoned Luncheonette" also contains their  first hit single, "She's Gone", which appeared on the Billboard  charts on two separate occasions. If you are a fan of soul and/or pop  music, you can't go wrong here. Please buy this CD!
