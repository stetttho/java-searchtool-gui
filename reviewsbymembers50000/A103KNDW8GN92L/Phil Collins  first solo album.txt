 "Face Value", an album featuring tracks primarily rooted in soul and r & b, is in a class by itself. "In The Air Tonight" is wonderful power-pop, while songs like "I Missed Again", "Thunder And Lightning", the remake of Genesis' "Behind The Lines" and "Hand In Hand" feaure r & b influences provided by Earth, Wind & Fire's brassy horn section, which is heard on a majority of the tracks here. The Motown sound and psychedelia are featured in the tracks "If Leaving Me Is Easy" and "Tomorrow Never Knows" (where Phil can be heard singing a line from the Wizard Of Oz's "Over The Rainbow"- sort of unusual). There's also a jug-band feel to "The Roof Is Leaking", and mambo rhythms featured in "Droned". Phil Collins does a good job here in utilizing different musical styles, which makes "Face Value" worth its weight in gold and is a must-have CD.
