 Columbia/CBS Records did a very intelligent thing by putting all this wonderful music that was originally released on a double-album onto a single CD, saving valuable time and money for the consumer. Chicago Transit Authority's first self-titled album gives the listener a grand audio insight of what would become this group's trademark sound-it's brassy and mardi gras-like horn section featured on songs like "Questions 67 And 68", "Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?", "Beginnings" and "Introduction". The audio byte at the beginning of "Prologue/Someday" from the 1968 Democratic National Convention gives this number a "grasroots" socio-political feel to it, and the closing live track "Liberation", is a bit long-winded, but caps off a nice, rousing finish. The group's cover of Spencer Davis Group's "I'm A Man is very original, and Terry Kath's "Free Form Guitar" is a head trip, and Peter Cetera's bottomed-out bass in "South California Purples compliments Robert Lamm's rather flowery keyboard playing here. When you listen to this CD, please listen with the headphones on, crank up the volume and get ready for the ride of your life! You will want to purchase this introductory musical gem in order to familiarize yourself with Chicago's sound. It's just a shame this group was legally forced to change its name to the city where "all save one were born." That special place is none other than, you guessed it-CHICAGO! It's ice to know they hung onto this sound for many years to come from this point!
