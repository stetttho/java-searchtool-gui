 "Don't Shoot Me I'm Only The Piano Player" has got to be one of Elton John's best early '70's albums, if not THE best. You will hear EJ at his rockin' best here in songs such as: "Teacher I Need You", "Elderberry Wine", "Midnight Creeper", "Crocodile Rock" and "I'm Gonna Be A Teenage Idol". Elton even does his darndest to sport a "Southern-Hombre" type accent beneath his British dialect in "Texan Love Song". "Don't Shoot Me" brings out its melancholic side in the songs "Daniel", "Have Mercy On The Criminal", "Blues For My Baby And Me" and "High Flying Bird". The bonus tracks featured here are a delight. There are nice rockers in "Screw You (Young Man's Blues)" and "Whenever You're Ready (We'll Go Steady Again)". There's a little country flavor in the short, but sweet "Jack Rabbit", and easy-listening flair featured in "Skyline Pigeon (Piano Version)". The compositions featured here are some of EJ's and Bernie Taupin's best musical and lyrical works. But don't just take my word for it. Buy your copy of "Don't Shoot Me" today!
