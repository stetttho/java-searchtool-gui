 "Heartlight" is a gem of an album Neil Diamond put out in 1982.  Amidst this wonderfully crafted array of satisfying easy listening tunes  lies some up tempo rocking numbers that will have you dancing in the  aisles. The title track is taken from the motion picture "E.T".  My personal favorites other than the title track are: "I'm  Alive", "Front Page Story" and "Comin' Home". The  fact that this CD contains songs written by Burt Bacharach makes  "Heartlight" a masterpiece. Buy your copy today!
