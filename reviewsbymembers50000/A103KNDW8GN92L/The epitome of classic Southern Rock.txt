 There are so many great songs from "Second Helping", Lynyrd Skynyrd's sophomore album, that it's extremely difficult to pick a favorite. "Sweet Home Alabama" is sweetly scintillating with its opening guitar riff. "Call Me The Breeze" will take you on the ultimate rock 'n roll ride of a lifetime with Southern references like "I Dig You Georgia Peaches". "The Needle And The Spoon" somewhat delves into the band's experimentation with various drugs, yet is still a hard-rocking, enjoyable number, as are all the songs on the album. "Workin' For MCA" is perhaps the first song with a record label in its title. MCA is also the label which Skynyrd recorded for throughout much of the band's heyday in the '70's and early eighties when the already disbanded Skynyrd split ranks and reformed as "The Rossington-Collins Band". The most touching song from "Second Helping" is "The Ballad Of Curtis Loew", a blues-tinged number that tells the story of a blues legend from the Old South (not the Confederate South!) who played strictly for the love of (his) music. "Don't Ask Me No Questions" is also one of the top selections here. With so many good songs to choose from, you'll be back for third and fourth helpings! With the fact that "Second Helping" was also produced by blues master Al Kooper, this makes this Southern-rock masterpiece a must buy for any Skynyrd and Al Kooper fan!
