 This is the first Genesis album that features the classic lineup. It is on  this CD where we are introduced to the talents of Steve Hackett and Phil  Collins. Peter Gabriel's vocals take on a "thespian' style,  particularly on the opening track "The Musical Box", where Tony  Banks' use of the Mellotron is quite fluent, as is the case on the majority  of the tracks here. "Nursery Cryme" is the hardest-rocking of the  early Genesis CD's, which adds depth as well as profound wisdom to the  lyrics. Although the CD is fairly short overall, it is not short on musical  talent. A must have.
