 It is on "The Fugitive" where Tony Banks continues to tantalize us with his diverse keyboard styles heard in the instrumental tracks  "Thirty Three's" and "Charm", which Tony took a page  from "The Grand Parade Of Lifeless Packaging" from the Genesis CD  "The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway". "Moving Under" wil  have you wondering "Where have I heard this before?" It is songs  like "Moving Under" and "Sometime Never" that give this  CD its "poppish" side, unlike TB's non-poppish predecessor,  "A Curious Feeling". And, unlike "ACF", Banks handles  all the vocals on "The Fugitive", whih are a refreshing change of  pace compared to Kim Beacon's, which have hardly any life at all. If you're  a die-hard Genesis fan, or if you're into early '80's pop, then this CD is  for you!
