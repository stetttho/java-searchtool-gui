 Recorded live at Doug Weston's Troubadour in Los Angeles, "Neil Diamond GOLD" is an electrical-acoustical delight to the ears, performed in an intimate atmosphere. Originally released on the Uni label in the late '60's/early '70's, it's such a real treat to hear Neil perform some of his early Bang material live, as featured on this CD, and he really breathes life into these live numbers to boot. "Lordy", "Cherry, Cherry", "Thank The Lord For The Night Time" and "Brother Love's Traveling Salvation Show" (the former three tracks are from the Bang years) really showcase Neil's ability to rock with a little bit of a hard edge in all-out fashion, while the live versions of "Holly Holy" and "Sweet Caroline" featured here don't work quite as well without an orchestra. The orchestral arrangements work wonders on both "Holly Holy" and "Sweet Caroline", where these particular live versions can be found on the double live "Hot August Night" CD set, complete with orchestral arrangements, as mentioned above. Neil really tops himself on the live "GOLD" version of "Brother Love's", as opposed to the original studio version, as he puts a signature, hard-edged polish on this live version, where Mr. Diamond rocks out like no one else I've heard before, or since. There are no duds here in this semi-acoustic live masterpiece. "Neil Diamond GOLD" is a perfect CD to relax with after a long, hard day.
