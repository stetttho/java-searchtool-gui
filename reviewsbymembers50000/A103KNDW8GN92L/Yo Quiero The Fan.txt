 If you're one of those people who are into sports and sports-based movies,  like myself, then "The Fan" is for you. Here you will see the  marvelous talents of Robert DeNiro and Wesley Snipes as a disgruntled knife  salesman and major league baseball player. John Leguizamo plays Snipes'  million-dollar agent, and handles his role well, for a serious actor. I was  rather surprised to learn the chihuahua with a bit part in this film is  none other than Gidget, the "Yo Quiero Taco Bell Dog!" You'll  enjoy this film's suspensful ending, as well as the storyline. I saw  "The Fan" at the theater, so  thought I would add this VHS title  to my video library. You should too.
