 Ah, "The Great Outdoors", fresh air, down-home barbeques, wild animals, the rustic smell of an open fire, etc. When Dan Aykroyd and John Candy take to these serene, natural surroundings, that fresh air just might become a mite polluted...make that totally polluted! Add to the above pleasures three wiseacre raccoons and toss in a couple of bears for good measure (not to mention a pair of eerie twin girls, similar to the twins in "The Shining"), and you have one colossal motion picture that is "The Great Outdoors". Roman (Aykroyd) and Chet (Candy) arrive at their cabin at a Midwestern lodge, and proceed to have one wacky misadventure after another, with a majority of these capers bringing hilarious results, no doubt! Since this is one roof-raising film that's suitable for the entire family, there's no need to rough it. "The Great Outdoors" is perfect with a "big 96'er" (see movie) and some rather tasty "lips and ..." (see movie) and an ice cold beer to wash it all down with. Enjoy!
