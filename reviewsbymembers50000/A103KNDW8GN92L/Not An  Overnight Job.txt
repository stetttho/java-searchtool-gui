 Mike Rutherford's first solo album, "Smallcreep's Day", is a well laid-out piece of work from start to finish. Noel McCalla does a fine job on vocals, which are perfectly suited for the tracks on this album, some of which display a "Mike & The Mechanics" vibe, and somewhat better. There are too many good tracks here to determine which ones stand out, but if I had to choose, it would probably be "Moonshine" because of its up-tempo, hard-edged feel. Gems like "Smallcreep's Day" are hard to come by, so any die-hard Genesis and/or Mike & The Mechanics fan should include this one in their CD collection before it goes out of print.
