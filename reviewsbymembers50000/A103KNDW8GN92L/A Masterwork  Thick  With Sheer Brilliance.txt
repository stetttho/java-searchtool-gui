 After the highly successful "Aqualung", Jethro Tull felt they had something more to prove to themselves and to their fans. The result is this masterwork chock full of ascerbic wit, mayhem and musical introspection - all of which come to the forefront in grand Tull fashion on "Thick As A Brick". Anderson & Co. extended their repertoire from their last effort by displaying a barrage of musical stylings, complete with a plethora of riffy rock, mixed in with a dash of folk and flute introspections masterfully done by Ian Anderson. These ingredients make for a uniformly veritable "passion play", and contain every artistic method kown to mankind, all of which are found in both heavy-duty "Bricks" featured here. A stripped-down live version (performed at New York's Madison Square Garden, circa 1978) is also featured here - another extra brick thrown in for good measure. Ah, but the fun doesn't stop there, for, as an extended bonus, there's an interview featuring Anderson, Martin Barre and Jeffrey Hammond revealing all concerning the making of this very special masterpiece, a crowning touch added by the folks at Chrysalis. Please allow a number of listens in order for all the melodrama to sink in. One will discover a whole new set of sounds with each passing listen. You'd have to be mighty "thick"-headed not to include "Thick As A Brick" in your must-have artistic CD collection. Do yourself a favor, and purchase your "Brick" today!
