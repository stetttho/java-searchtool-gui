 Fresh off the heels of his James Gang success comes Joe Walsh's first solo album with the nonsensical title "The Smoker You Drink, The Player You Get." This album contains the hit smash "Rocky Mountain Way". There are some hidden gems here as well, like the somber "Book Ends", the tame "Wolf", the Jethro Tull-esque flute vibes heard in "Days Gone By" and also in the lone instrumental "Midnight Moodies". Psychedelic folk-rock can be found in "Happy Ways", and a similar sound of Todd Rundgren's "I Went To The Mirror" can be heard in "Dreams". "Meadows" features good straight-ahead rock 'n roll, while the short and sweet "Daydream (Prayer)" closes out this CD on a high note. For those of you still suffering from "James Gang Postpartum Depression", I advise you to pick up a copy of "TSYD, TPYG". Listening to this classic rock gem will cure those "Midnight Moodies" for sure!
