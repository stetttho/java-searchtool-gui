 "Sweet City Woman" contains a collection of songs by Canada's premiere country-rock group, The Stampeders. This Calgary-based trio, fronted by Rick Dodson, Ronnie King and Kim Berly, saw major success in the U.S. with their hit single "Sweet City Woman", which cracked the Billboard Top Ten in 1971, and is one of the songs featured in this collection. Of the fourteen tracks (on the Collectables Records edition) featured on "Sweet City Woman - A Golden Classics Edition", twelve of them are pure CanCon (Canadian Content) radio classics. The Stampeders are more than just a country-rock band, as the songs in this collection signify. There are R & B standards ("Gator Road", "I Didn't Love You Anyhow"), as well as ballsy rockers ("Only A Friend", "You Got To Go", the bouncy "With You I Got Wheels", "Man From P.E.I." - the initials of the Canadian province of Prince Edward Island). Among the noteworthy Stampeders country-rock standards on display here are "Carry Me", the group's first entry onto the Canadian charts, "Train To Nowhere", "Gator Road", the melancholic "Oklahoma Country", which has a snappy mandolin intro, "Sunday Prayin'" and "Tuscaloosa Woman" are among the many favorites here. Unlike the selections as listed above, the "Golden Classics Edition" of "Sweet City Woman" contains two bonus tracks - the delightfully sinful "Devil You" and a remake of "Hit The Road Jack", featuring an appearance courtesy of Wolfman Jack via telephone. The latter two tracks also saw minor American chart success as well. With so much wonderful music on display here, you're bound to like what you hear. "Sweet City Woman" is just one of the many CanCon delights you'll want to have in your collection!
