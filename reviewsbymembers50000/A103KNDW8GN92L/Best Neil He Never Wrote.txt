 Let's face it, some of the songs Neil Diamond performs on "Touching You Touching Me" were written by other artists:Mr. Bojangles (Jerry Jeff Walker), Everybody's Talkin'(Fred Neill), Both Sides Now (Joni Mitchell) and Until It's Time For You To Go (Buffy Sainte-Marie). But, hey, when he sings them, he really makes them come to life! His compositions on this CD are better than the above mentioned songs, like the up-tempo "Smokey Lady", the religious "Holly Holy", the touching "And The Singer Sings His Song", and the country-bumpkin tones of "New York Boy". Every song's a winner here, which makes "Touching You Touching Me" a must buy.
