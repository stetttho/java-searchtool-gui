 For those who are familiar with the progressive rock Yes is noteworthy for, you may be surprised when you listen to this, Yes' first offering. The reason for your probable surprise is that very few, if any of the tracks featured on "Yes", display any sort of a progressive feel. The closest thing to progressive rock is most likely found in the opening track "Beyond And Before" and in "Looking Around". Otherwise, the rest of the tracks display either a softer, more mellow feel (the melancholy ballad "Yesterday And Today", the equally touching "Harold Land" and "Sweetness") or a rather bluesy perspective ("I See You"). The band has its one and only cover tune, and it graces this first album in fine musical form - the Beatles tune "Every Little Thing", a nice, quaint rocker. "Survival" closes things out nicely, although somewhat on a somber note. Even though it would take a few more albums for Yes to reach their full blown progressive pinnacle, that being on "Fragile", when Rick Wakeman and Steve Howe joined the band (although Howe became part of Yes during their previous album "The Yes Album", an effort that features some noteworthy progressive chops). That said, this first effort, titled "Yes", is not a bad album, to say the least - for on the group's next album "Time And A Word" (the last to feature guitarist Peter Banks), there would be a sign of things to come in the realm of Yes' style of progressive rock, which is somewhat absent on this first effort. If you're a completist, you'll definitely want "Yes" in your CD library. Even if you aren't a fan of this band, but are a fan of more "casual" rock, you just might want to make this title an essential purchase before Atlantic decides to take it out of print.
