 "Three Dog Nightmare" is a wonderfully written, compelling story about Chuck Negron, one of the vocalists of the legendary rock group Three Dog Night, who had a treasure trove of top ten hits between 1969 and 1974. "Three Dog Nightmare" is an insightful tour de force, and will take the average reader on a journey through Chuck's rise as a college basketball player, then as a singer in various bands leading up to Three Dog Night. It is in this group where Mr. Negron begins to experiment with various drugs, including cough syrup. He then discovers the more potent drugs (marijuana, LSD, cocaine) which will eventually lead to his downfall, and to the dismissal of Three Dog Night. At his lowest point, Chuck finds himself as a useless, burned out hardcore drug addict and eventually becomes homeless. Then, redemption sets in, finding success in beating his addiction at his 37th rehab center, Cri-Help. He finally gets his music career back on track, and agrees to get his message across to others, including to offer help to other hardcore drug users, like he was. Hence, "Three Dog Nightmare". Once you start reading this, you will not want to put it down! Also, you might want to pick up Chuck's CD "The Long Road Back". It is a wonderful accompaniment to the book. Both items are a must have for any Three Dog Night fan, as well as anyone facing personal struggles in their life. Enjoy!
