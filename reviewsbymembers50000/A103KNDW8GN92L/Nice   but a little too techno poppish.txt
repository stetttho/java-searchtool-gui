 "Invisible Touch", which came out in 1986, may have won a lot of praise for Genesis' experimentation with this advanced-technological array of songs. Needless to say, this CD didn't exactly bring out the hardcore Genesis fan in me, but there are a few good songs here. The masterpiece here is the lone instrumental "The Brazilian", which Tony Banks shows off his keyboard/synthesizer skills. Genesis fans will want to add this CD to their collection, nontheless.
