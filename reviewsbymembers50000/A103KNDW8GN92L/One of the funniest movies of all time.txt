 "Caddyshack" has to be among the top ten funniest films of all time for a number of reasons. #1) The supporting cast. Although not overtly funny, both Chevy Chase and Ted Knight play straight men to two funny comedians: Chase's character to Bill Murray's wacky, doped-out greenskeeper character. An example here is during the scene when Chase is visiting Murray's residential quarters, and Murray offers Chase a place to sit and relax, and Chase says: "No thanks, I don't want to stick to anything". Knight and Rodney "I get no respect" Dangerfield have some classic exchanges throughout the movie as well. You'll have to hear them for yourself.  #2) Dangerfield is a class act all by himself in "Caddyshack". With comical lines like "Last time I saw a mouth like that, it had a hook in it", "Now I know why tigers eat their young", "Hey toots, how'd you like to earn ten dollars the hard way" and many others, it's easy to see why Dangerfield became a mega-superstar soon after "Caddyshack" was released. #3) There's also the Baby Ruth bar in the swimming pool bit, which is a must see. If you ask me, the Rodney Dangerfield barbs are alone worth the price of this classic film. Kenny Loggins' smash hit "I'm Alright" is a perfect mini-soundtrack for the movie. As an added bonus, there is a trailer before the movie. You'll hear from the stars themselves talk about the making of "Caddyshack" as well as personal moments and their memories in making this comedy masterpiece. This movie shows no sign of wear and tear, and doesn't appear to be dated, even after a little more than twenty years! Since "Caddyshack-19th Anniversary Edition" is a rare collector's item, you may want to purchase it before it's a part of history!
