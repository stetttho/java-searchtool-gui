 "Hot Shots" is a delightful collection featuring 12 of Trooper's best known Canadian radio classics. Produced by Randy Bachman (The Guess Who, Bachman-Turner Overdrive), for the most part, two of the selections here feature a bit of a BTO hook: the sassy "General Hand Grenade" and "Ready", both fine, outstanding rockers to boot, as are nearly all of the tracks on "Hot Shots". Trooper also bares its soulful side a la Pablo Cruise in "Round Round We Go". "Moment That It Takes" also displays a softer side. Neither of these two tracks fit in the general musical mold of the Trooper sound, which is earth shaking, in your face, Canadian rock 'n roll at its ultra-rocking best! Although the above-mentioned tracks are well worth the price of this disc, the real reason for making "Hot Shots" an essential purchase, is due to these outstanding CanCon classics: "Two For The Show", "Santa Maria", "We're Here For A Good Time (Not A Long Time)" and perhaps Trooper's best known rock anthem "Raise A Little Hell". These hits are all yours at an import level price, although it is worth the money. This is truly the ultimate party "crank up the volume and bug your landlord (or landlady)" CD. Buy "Hot Shots", before the party's gone - for good!
