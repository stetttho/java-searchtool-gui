 After recording the mediocre album "Relayer" in 1974, it was clearly evident Yes needed a break. Three years later, the versatile prog-rockers returned to the studio. The final output resulted in Yes' most prolific musical work to date - the marvelously well executed "Going For The One". Perhaps the main element that helped Yes return to its artistic glory, was the return of keyboardist Rick Wakeman, who was the missing piece of the Yes musically dynamic puzzle. The title track definitely sounds like the Yes of old, and starts off the album in high gear. "Turn of the Century" has that classic Yes brand of storytelling written all over it, complete with the opening line: "Realizing (American spelling - sorry!) a form out of stone", which is, archeologically speaking, a lyrical and musical find, as well as moving, to say the least. Both "Parallels" and "Awaken" feature a pastoral sound, courtesy of the church organ featured in both tracks, particularly in the latter selection, where the organ is featured in the middle stanza. "Wondrous Stories" offers much sageful wisdom, which will leave one feeling all the more knowledgeable even after just one listen. Wakeman's return was definitely the major boost Yes desperately needed after the so-so "Relayer", but the wonderful Yes wall of sound wouldn't be standing tall much longer, for Rick Wakeman left the band after Yes' next release, the very average "Tormato" (1978). If you're a fan of this great progressive group, and you don't have "Going For The One" in your CD collection, all I can say is, "WHAT? ARE YOU NUTS?!!?"
