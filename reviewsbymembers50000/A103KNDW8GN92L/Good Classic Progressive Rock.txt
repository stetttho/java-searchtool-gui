 Although many of the songs on "Time And A Word" have a classic rock feel to them, the primary reason for that is because this is Yes' second album, and they're sill attempting to find their niche, which would ultimately end up as full-blown progressive rock by the time they recorded "Fragile". Nonetheless, there are some very well-polished selections here, as in the opening track "No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed", which sort-of displays a bit of that progressivism the band would be noted for in the near future. Other tracks, such as "Then", "Sweet Dreams" and "Astral Traveller" continue to display that hard-line progressive-rock feel, as well as in the instrumental "The Prophet". The other tracks with the classic-rock sound, such as "Everydays" and the title track, have wonderfully-written lyrics, but sort of miss the mark musically. The string arrangement featured in the title track, although a nice touch, seems out of place in a Yes song, don'tcha think? The weakest track on this CD is quite possibly "Clear Days", for some unknown reason. The first change in Yes' personnel would soon take place after this album, as Peter Banks would depart from the group, and the group's musical portfolio would be more dimensional with Banks' replacement of Steve Howe. Even though "Time And A Word" has a few minor musical glitches (such as the strings), it is a CD even the most die-hard Yes fan would love to have in their collection.
