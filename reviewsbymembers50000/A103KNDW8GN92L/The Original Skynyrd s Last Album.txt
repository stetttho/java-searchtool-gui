 "Street Survivors" is most likely Lynyrd Skynyrd's most memorable album, because of the tragic October 20th, 1977 plane crash, which took the lives of three of the legendary band's members. Killed in the crash were lead singer Ronnie Van Zant, guitarist Steve Gaines, backing vocalist Cassie Gaines and road manager Dean Kilpatrick. The other members were seriously injured, but eventually recovered. "Street Survivors" would eventually serve as a fitting tribute to the original lineup's music, and what a true last stand of a Southern rock gem it is, with delightful tracks such as "What's Your Name", "You Got That Right" and "That Smell", a tune that takes a rather obscure look at drug and alcohol abuse. Skynyrd's true Southern rock roots shine in "One More Time", while the other tracks keep the CD flowing through quite nicely. The CD also features both album covers: one on the front of the booklet showing the original cover with all seven members engulfed in flames, and the all black memorial cover with all seven members on the back of the booklet and on the CD's back cover. Since "Street Survivors" is the last "real pure" Lynyrd Skynyrd album, die-hard fans of this group will want to add this title to their must-have collection(s), nontheless.
