 Paul Anka has had a phenomenal career, both as a singer/composer and as a sometime actor during his five plus decades in the entertainment industry. "Classic Hits" contains a sampling of this talented performer's remarkable career, with a majority of these classics recorded during his 1973-1977 tenure with United Artists. Four of the hits contained in this collection feature duets with Odia Coates, including the gospel-like "I Don't Like To Sleep Alone", as well as their number one smash "(You're) Having My Baby" and the smooth "One Man Woman/One Woman Man". "(I Believe) There's Nothing Stronger Than Our Love", another major hit for both Anka and Coates, is included here as well, as is one of Paul's most memorable and beloved hits, complete with a Frank Sinatra-like vocal performance with "Times Of Your Life". "My Best Friend's Wife", although somewhat overrepetitive, is still an enjoyable tune, nevertheless. "Anytime (I'll Be There)" has its melancholy moments, but fits in here with ease. Three "newer" renditions of familiar Anka classics are included here too - "My Way", which has been recorded by dozens of artists, including Sinatra and Elvis Presley. This version is brilliantly played out in grand Paul Anka fashion. The peppy "A Steel Guitar And A Glass Of Wine" and the downtrodden "Let Me Try Again" complete this stellar sample collection, courtesy of an international superstar that is Paul Anka. But, since "Classic Hits" is geared more toward the casual Anka fan, the Anka afficianado will find "30 Years Of Hits" more to their liking, as that compilation contains twice as many songs covering Anka's earlier (and later) period(s). "Classic Hits" is still an essential collection all the while, and thus belongs in any music fan's CD library. Make sure it's included in your purchases today, before it becomes a lost treasure!
