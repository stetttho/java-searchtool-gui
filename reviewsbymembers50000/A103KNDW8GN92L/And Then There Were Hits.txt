 When Genesis' two main players Peter Gabriel, and later Steve Hackett left  this stellar group, it would appear that this supergroup would run out of  steam. Now reduced to a trio, Genesis released the quietly progressive, yet  poppish ...And Then There Were Three... in 1978. It is this album that  Genesis had their first U.S. Top 40 hit with "Follow You, Follow Me.  This CD contains some brilliant musical masterpieces as well. Tony Banks'  keyboard work is quietly haunting in songs like "Undertow",  "Ballad Of Big", "Snowbound", "Burning Rope",  "Deep In The Motherlode", "Say It's Alright Joe" and  "The Lady Lies". Let's not forget Mike Rutherford's stunning  guitar skip in the intro of "Down And Out", as well as Phil  Collins' stormy drumming toward the end of this track. Daryl Stuermer  filled the void on some guitar work on a few tracks as well. Wonderfully  crafted musicianship throughout. ATTWT will definitely make you sing for  your supper and will have you coming back for infinite servings!
