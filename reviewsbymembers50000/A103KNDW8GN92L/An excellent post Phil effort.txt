 OK, so Ray Wilson is no Phil Collins, but his singing style (which has a dark, yet delightful moody persona to it) is perfectly suited for the songs featured on "...Calling All Stations..." As you might have guessed from this review so far, a majority of the songs here have a dark and moody feeling to them, and that suits even the most die-hard Genesis fan, such as myself, just fine. It has been said that Ray Wilson's singing style is comparable to Peter Gabriel's, which also has a dimly-lit, chilly feel to it. It is that type of quality that gives "...CAS..." such a distinctive flavor. That unique flavor can be heard in Tony Banks' keyboard/synthesizer playing in "The Dividing Line" and "There Must Be Some Other Way". Mike Rutherford makes good use of his guitar playing qualities in songs like "Shipwrecked", " "Not About Us", "If That's What You Need", "Alien Afternoon", "Small Talk" and the title track. Nice African-Caribbean influences can be heard in "Congo", and "Uncertain Weather" features some "chills down your spine" vibes. Overall, there's not really a bad song on the entire CD. With all this talent, including Ray Wilson's vocals, it would be a shame if Genesis doesn't continue onward. We will have to wait and see. That is why even the most ardent Genesis fan should add "...Calling All Stations..." to their CD collection. Oh, and it also features superb drumming by Nir Z. and nice musicianship from Nick D'Viriglio as well.
