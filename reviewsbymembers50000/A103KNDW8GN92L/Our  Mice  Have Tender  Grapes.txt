 As is true of all John Steinbeck novels, all of the stories are set in Salinas, California - Steinbeck's hometown. This is the geographic region where this prized author spent all of his time (generally outdoors) writing and observing, and was a very studious "freak of nature", so to speak. A surprisingly interesting read, "Of Mice And Men" focuses on two subjects named George and Lennie. George dreams of getting steady work on an animal farm, while his aimless, slow-witted friend (Lennie) has an ongoing desire to pet (and mangle) mice and other assorted creatures. These two take up residence with various other persons along their evasive journey as well. But, there's one pressing problem: Could George tame Lennie long enough to help make this dream a reality? You, just like our two "heroes", will have to journey through the vast rivers and valleys of Salinas to find out! If you're just an average reader, like myself, you'll want to read "Of Mice And Men" at least twice, just to understand the subtle nuances and charm of the overall story. With so much to offer, this Steinbeck tale of yore is definitely a keeper!
