 "September Morn" is perhaps one of Neil Diamond's few low points in his storybook career. There are a few high points here: The sad, yet sentimental title track, the jazzy, euphoric "Jazz Time" and the downbeat "The Good Lord Loves You". I didn't care for Neil's own version of "I'm A Believer", a song that was really made to be an up-tempo number, as the Monkees' version was. "Stagger Lee" just wasn't cut out to be an easy listening tune. But, if you are a true Diamond fan, you'll want to add this CD to your collection.
