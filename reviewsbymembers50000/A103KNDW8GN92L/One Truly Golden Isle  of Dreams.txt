 Although Alfred Apaka wasn't quite the legend say, Don Ho (and perhaps other countless names in Hawaiian music) was and (still) is/are, this collection of island favorites does justice to this late, great balladeer's all too short life and career, which ended abruptly in 1960 at age 40, due to a heart attack while playing handball. Apaka puts a unique brand of spit and polish to his vocal abilities, adding a Frank Sinatra touch to his soaring vocals in selections such as "This Song of Love (Dahil sa lyo)" - [pronounced "Da Hill Sigh Oh"], "Hawaiian Love Call", "Bali Ha'i" and on "I Wish They Didn't Mean Goodbye", including other worthwhile compositions. With such a beautiful voice on display, Alfred Apaka would have possibly reached immaculate heights had he lived, perhaps sharing equal superstar status as Mr. "Tiny Bubbles" himself - the one and only Don Ho, who's still providing top notch entertainment to his many legions of fans the world over to this day. But, as loved as Mr. Apaka was (or is), this gifted performer left behind many wonderful island musical moments for his many beloved fans to cherish. His music is fondly remembered to this day, even after four decades after his passing, which is a testament of a great performer. May Alfred Apaka's legacy live on in infamy.
