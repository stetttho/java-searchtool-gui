 "Close To The Edge" is the best early Yes album, if not the  all-time greatest Yes album of their entire catalog. The best track here is  the lengthy "Close To The Edge Suite", where the intro opens with  a "tranqil sea" instrumentation, then breaks into a hard line  guitar and bass piece. 'Total Mass Retain' features a banjo-line in certain  parts, and 'I Get Up, I Get Down has another hard line bass sound etched  throughout, then that "tranqui sea" fades out at the end.  "And You And I" has a folksy, mellow feel to it, while  "Siberian Khatru" just fades into black. The ability to shift  musical themes as well as provide chilling, gripping lyrics is what makes  Yes so talented. You'll feel the same way after listening to this CD.
