 "Fish Out Of Water", Chris Squire's first and only solo album, really delves into the heart and the mind of the Yes musical empire (although Rick Wakeman's solo works come in a VERY close second). Many of the tracks on this CD display the obvious signature 3/4 time changes evident in early Yes recordings of that era. With "Fish Out Of Water", Squire seems to be in a league of his own, and utilizes his creative energies to their fullest effect. The supreme track here is the progressive-blues tinged "Lucky Seven", with its oft-repetitive bass-keyboard rift and that 'Pink Floyd-ish' alto saxophone featured throughout the track. "Hold Out Your Hand" and "You By My Side" are wonderfully composed tracks as well. "Silently Falling" is rather engulfed with those spiraling signature time changes, in the second half, anyway, then fades out with a symphonic fury of fire. The same can be said for the second half of the 15-minute long "Safe (Canon Song)", with its repetitive thumping bass- playing mixed with orchestral arrangements. I think you'll agree with me that this is the best of the Yes solo projects, bar none, although Rick Wakeman's solo projects are nothing to sneeze at, either. "Fish Out Of Water" still sounds as fresh and musical as it probably did 25 years ago. As to the mystery of why Chris Squire hasn't recorded another solo album in all these years, I haven't the foggiest idea, as the British would say. This CD is another of those rare gems just begging to be re-discovered. It's a shame "Fish Out Of Water" isn't available as a domestic title. Better catch this "Fish" now, before it becomes an endangered species!
