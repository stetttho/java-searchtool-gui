 On this CD, Neil Diamond hooks up with The Band's Robbie Robertson, who  produced this melodic and sentimental array of compositions. Here, the most  ardent ND fan will find heartwarming ballads (If You Know What I Mean, Home  Is A Wounded Heart, Lady-Oh), good-time standards (Stargazer, the title  track, Jungletime) and the feel-good "Don't Think...Feel".  Robertson also contributes musically here, playing guitar on songs like the  equally touching "Dry Your Eyes". Robertson's "The  Band" mates (Garth Hudson, Rick Danko, Richard Manuel) also perform on  this CD as well, which gives the songs here diverse arrangements of musical  styles. All fans of either ND or The Band should add this CD to their  collections. "Check it out!"
