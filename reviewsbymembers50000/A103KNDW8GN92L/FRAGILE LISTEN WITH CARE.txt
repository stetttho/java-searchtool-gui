 "Fragile" is the album that put Yes on the commercial map with the outstanding tracks "Roundabout" and "Long Distance Runaround", although it would not be another twelve years before they would return to the U.S. Top 40 with "Owner Of A Lonely Heart" including some personnel changes. It is on "Fragile" where we are exposed to the classic Yes lineup and sound featured on the above two tracks, as well as in meticulously composed arrangements like "Cans And Brahms", which shows off the band's penchant for classical music, as well as in Chris Squire's offbeat, syncopated bass rhythms heard in the brief "Five Per Cent For Nothing". Repetetiveness is the operative key heard in the line "Tell The Moon Or Tell The Marcher", which is the main line along with the sometime repeated title in "We Have Heaven". The tone is then set for the chilly, then progressively rocking vibes in "South Side Of The Sky". Yes' progressive-rock roots begin to take shape in "The Fish". while "Mood For A Day" and the first half of "Heart Of The Sunrise" slow down the pace of the CD in general, but is finally relieved by the rollicking finish in the latter half of "Sunrise". New member Rick Wakeman's musicianship and style of play put "Fragile" in the proper musical perspective. This is one CD to add to your collection!
