 Ain't it the truth? "The Bluesmeister" B.B. King never misses a step on "Completely Well". In fact, "The King Of The Blues" is just smokin' with his "gal" Lucille the entire way, from the very first note of "So Excited" to the final fade out of "The Thrill Is Gone", which is B.B.'s first and only Top 40 hit single here in the U.S.. With each and every song on "CW" a true winner, you'll want to hit the ol' continuation button on your stereo to derive maximum musical pleasure from this one. As your doctor will tell you, he'll/she'll suggest that you listen to "Completely Well" (or any of B.B. King's masterworks) twice daily, and will ask you to call him/her in the morning! Yes, folks, "CW" is a sure fire cure for the blues, or for whatever else ails you. Heck, you don't even have to be sick to reap the benefits of great listening pleasure from "Completely Well". This is one CD you definitely need to have in your collection. With this remastered edition, complete with artwork and liner notes, you can't lose. Don't let this one pass you by!
