 My Dad bought me an 8-track tape of "Silk Degrees through Columbia House when I was eleven years old. Needless to say, I was immediately hooked on much of the material. Hearing the song "Lowdown" is what made me want the 8-track. I bought the CD many, many years later, and just as before, the music is as fresh and vibrant as that first day I listened to the 8-track! The majority of the songs here are tight-fisted soul and r&b, from the eclectically pleasing "What Can I Say", to up-tempo numbers "Jump Street" and "It's Over", to the blue-eyed soul/reggae vibes of "Love Me Tomorrow". I prefer Boz's version of "We're All Alone" to Rita Coolidge's, which runs a very close second. A fan of Boz Scaggs or even soul music will have a delight out of this marvelous array of songs, which is why I highly recommend "Silk Degrees".
