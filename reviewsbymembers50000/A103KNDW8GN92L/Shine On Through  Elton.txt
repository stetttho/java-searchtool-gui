 "A Single Man" may not be Elton John's best album, but it ranks right up there with his classic albums from the early seventies. Here, EJ experiments with certain musical styles ranging from the jazz-laden "Big Dipper" to the 'countrified' "Georgia". There's also straight-ahead rock featured in "I Don't Care" and "Part-Time Love", an AM Top-40 radio staple in 1978. The pyrotechnical, yet powerful "Madness" breathes more life into "A Single Man", while "It Ain't Gonna Be Easy" tends to bring the album down just a melancholic tad. The lovely piano-encompassed instrumental "Song For Guy" provides both a sentimental and rousing finish to a stellar, finely crafted album. These are good reasons to add "A Single Man" to your CD library.
