 On "Countdown To Ecstasy", Steely Dan's sophomoric effort, Donald Fagen and Walter Becker delve even deeper into their first-rate jazz-oriented flavorings, which are uniquely combined with "The Dan's" one-of-a-kind rock 'n roll stylings. These two genres provide an interesting backdrop in the opening track "Bodhisattva", which jump-starts this CD in fine Steely Dan fashion. "Razor Boy", "Pearl Of The Quarter" and "King Of The World" each have their moments, but the selections that really make "...Ecstasy" worth the purchase, are the smooth, ultra-hip hepcat tones of "The Boston Rag", the magical ambience of "Your Gold Teeth" and the festive "My Old School", as well as the power-driven "Bodhisattva". This is also the album where Fagen, Becker and the gang really get their creative teeth into their playing, getting their brand of jazz oriented rock down to a tee. No one can truly call themselves a true Steely Dan fan until they make "Countdown To Ecstasy" a part of their must have, must own CD collection. With this recently remastered version, no fan of "The Dan" can really go wrong. The group's follow-up title, "Pretzel Logic", is the perfect companion CD, so it would be wise to purchase both items simultaneously. One will find a virtual (digitally remastered) gold mine just waiting to be rediscovered!
