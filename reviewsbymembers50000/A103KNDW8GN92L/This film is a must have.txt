 "Ransom", directed by Ron Howard, offers chilling performances  by Mel Gibson, Gary Sinise and Rene Russo, all of whom are highly talented,  seasoned professional actors. Donnie Wahlberg, Lili Taylor and Brawley  Nolte make up a fine supporting cast as well. The kidnapping plot and  storyline are well thought out and well scripted, and make for a wonderful  suspense thriller from start to finish. This one's worth owning!
