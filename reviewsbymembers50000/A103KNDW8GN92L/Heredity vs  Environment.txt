 With this film's plot centered around a bet made by two old geezers (Ralph Bellamy, Don Ameche), this age-old question is met with some rather unique and strange results. Randolph Duke (Bellamy) makes a $1 bet with his brother Mortimer Duke (Ameche) that environment usually plays a bigger role than heredity in developing a person's personality and character. To achieve this feat, the Dukes' play havoc with the lives of their star-broker employee (Dan Aykroyd) and a socially-disadvantaged street urchin (Eddie Murphy) by switching their personalities. Billy Ray Valentine (Murphy) takes Louis Winthorpe III's (Aykroyd) place and is successfully molded as a wealthy executive, getting Winthorpe's house, car and assets, while Winthorpe is set up by the Dukes' and loses all his worldly possesions and gets arrested for illegal drug posession and winds up on skid-row. Winthorpe then loses his fiance and is paired with a setimental, caring hooker (Jamie Lee Curtis), who eventually takes heed of Winthorpe's plight and lets him move in with her. Valentine then learns of the Dukes' scheme to switch he and Winthorpe back to their respective environments, and Valentine and Winthorpe get set to move in for the kill. They get even by putting the Dukes in the poorhouse, and make a similar $1 bet the Dukes made. This is one movie that has comedy and suspense rolled into one!
