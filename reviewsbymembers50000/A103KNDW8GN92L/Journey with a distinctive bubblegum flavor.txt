 "Raised On Radio", an album which was released two years after Steve Perry's debut solo album (1984's "Street Talk") and three years after the last Journey album (1983's "Frontiers"), is a well-balanced blend of Perry stylings casually blended with the sharp-edged rock and roll craftsmanship Journey had been known for in prior outings. Although some die-hard fans of this supergroup are apt to rate "ROR" as a sellout effort (with all the Steve Perry ballads which show up on here), others are quick to accept this album for what it is: good old-fashioned rock and roll with a polished, artistic flair that doesn't compromise between flashy musical overbearings or unpretentious mish-mosh, which "Raised On Radio" doesn't fall into either category. It is the unique display of arrangements on "ROR" that give it a really spirited flavor - bubblegum, if you will. Jonathan Cain and Neal Schon bring a lot to the Journey musical core all through this fine effort, while Steve Perry's vocals are as razor-sharp as ever. It is the session work which adds a little something extra as well, featuring Randy Jackson's powerful bass playing. Aside from the hits featured here, such as "Girl Can't Help It", "Be Good To Yourself" and the major hit "I'll Be Alright Without You", there are also other hidden gems featured here, including "Suzanne", "Once You Love Somebody" and "Why Can't This Night Go On Forever", among a few others. It is these tracks which give "Raised On Radio" the perfect introspective "Positive Touch". Yes, Journey may have lost two of its main players (Ross Valory and Steve Smith) by the time "ROR" was recorded, but that shouldn't distract even the most die-hard Journey fan from giving it adequate listens. "Raised On Radio" will even grow on casual fans of this mega-group, making it one CD you'll be "Happy To Give" this holiday season!
