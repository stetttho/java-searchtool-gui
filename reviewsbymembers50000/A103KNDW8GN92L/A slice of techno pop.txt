 When I first listened to this CD, I was a little surprised Neil Diamond  strayed pretty much from his usual "soft side" and went for a  harder techno-pop sound here. This is not a bad CD to say the least, and  many of the heavily synthesized tracks provide a welcomely refreshing  change of pace in songs like the title track "Headed For The  Future", "Stand Up For Love", and the Stevie Wonder penned  "Lost In Hollywood", on which Stevie provides the keyboards. This  CD also has its melancholy side with tracks like "The Man You  Need" and "It Should Have Been Me", as well as sentimental  tracks ("I'll See You On The Radio) Laura" and "Me Beside  You". The techno-pop, synthesized sound is alone worth the price of  this CD. Even true Diamond fans will want to add it to their collection. A  must buy!
