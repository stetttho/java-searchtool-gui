 When one thinks about Billy Joel and his outstanding career, many superlatives come to mind: thought-provoking compositions, stadium sell-out crowds, adoring fans, gold and multi-platinum records, and last, but not least, the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame (if Billy hasn't been inducted already). After the huge success of the 1977 release "The Stranger", it is highly likely that Mr. Joel began to achieve many of these above-mentioned accolades by the time "52nd Street" was released, making Billy one of the top ten best loved and most recognizable faces in the history of rock music. "52nd Street" shows Billy is quite capable of pulling out many different musical styles neatly housed in his well-oiled artistic arsenal. Yes, folks, Mr. Joel can and does it all on this spectacularly crafted release, as he really rocks out with fine-tuned precision in the angst-laden "Big Shot" and on the slightly down tempo "My Life", as well. Billy once again proves why he's the quintessential master of the ballad, as is clearly the case with the hit single "Honesty" and on the slow-burned non-single "Until The Night". Joel does jazz, too, as he puts a unique spin on the Steely Dan/Chicago-influenced "Zanzibar", bringing amazing results, no less. "Stiletto" has a certain jazzy flavor as well, although a tad more peppery and bouncier in spots than on "Zanzibar". For good measure, Billy adds a touch of doo-wop in the pacey "Half A Mile Away", and the short and suave title track closes out the CD on a positive note. Although "52nd Street" isn't exactly Rodeo Drive, it is still a nice, adventurous drive filled with wonder and awe at every turn. For best results, drive in a classic 1957 convertible (with the top down of course), and let the cool, gentle breeze calmly caress your cares away. "52nd Street" is fun, wholesome summertime driving (digitally remastered music) at its' best!
