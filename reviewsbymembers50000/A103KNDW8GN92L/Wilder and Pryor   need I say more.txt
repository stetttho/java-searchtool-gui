 If you like your movies with mystery, intrigue and comedy all rolled into one, look no further than "Silver Streak". This 1976 comedy-action thriller stars Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor, who make their debut together here. Jill Clayburgh also stars as Wilder's love interest. George Caldwell (Wilder) is a Los Angeles businessman who wants to take a vacation, so he decides to take a train to Chicago to relax and get some work done. But, little does Caldwell know he is in the ride of his life, and he encounters some hooligans on this journey. Add guys like Patrick McGoohan, Ray Walston and Richard Kiel (who play bad guys, of course), throw in a sexy blonde secretary (Jill Clayburgh), and add a vitamin salesman-turned federal agent (Ned Beatty), and you've got the makings of a suspense filled-edge of you seat action thriller, directed by Arthur Hiller (I'm a poet and don't know it!). Let's not forget the deliciously comical talents of Richard Pryor in this film, as an escaped convict who accidentally falls in the clutches of one Gene Wilder. It is here when these two meet that "Silver Streak really kicks into high gear, and the laughs never stop.... Scatman Crothers is a hoot here as the train conductor. If these aren't good reasons to buy this title, then I don't know what is! Buy yours today!
