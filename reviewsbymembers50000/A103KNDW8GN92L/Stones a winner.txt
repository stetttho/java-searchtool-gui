 Neil Diamond put out one of his finest works in 1971 with this album. Some  of the songs feature a somewhat moody persona (The Last Thing On My Mind,  Suzanne, I Think It's Gonna Rain Today) that'll leave you feeling maybe a  little melancholy. The up-tempo "Crunchy Granola Suite" will have  you singing and humming the lyrics, and perhaps dancing. Joni Mitchell  penned a song titled "Chelsea Morning", which shows up on this  CD. Roger Miller even contributed to this collection as well, with the  unforgivingly interpersonal "Husbands And Wives." The CD's title  track is a classic in it's own right. The signature track here is the  autobiagraphical "I Am...I Said- a song Neil Diamond stated that it's  been his hardest song to write to date, which took him four months to  compose. It was well worth the wait, for I Am...I Said is one of Neil's  most memorable songs. Lee Holdridge's musical arrangements really shine  here as well. This title is a must-have for all Neil Diamond fans to add to  their collection.
