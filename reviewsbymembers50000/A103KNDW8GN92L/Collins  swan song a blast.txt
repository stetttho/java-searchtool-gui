 "We Can't Dance" is a well put together album of fine songs and outstanding musicianship from the trio of Banks/Collins/Rutherford. The three continue to marvel us with an array of compositions, featuring the likes of "No Son Of Mine", "Driving The Last Spike", "I Can't Dance", "Never A Time", "Dreaming While You Sleep" and "Hold On My Heart". Genesis even take a swipe at televangelism with "Jesus He Knows Me", which has its hilarious, yet truthful side. "Fading Lights" turned out to be a fitting swan song for Phil Collins, who left the group almost four and a half years later after "We Can"t Dance" was released. Collins' depature may have left Genesis in dire straits, but the problem would be resolved in the not too distant future, for it was just yet another fresh beginning for the extremely talented musical duo known as Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford. Phil Collins' final exit makes "We Can't Dance" a must buy.
