 "The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway" is Genesis' first stab at a concept album, and it's a darn good one at that. This double-album centers around a lost soul named Rael, who wanders the streets of New York City and finds himself in one crazy adventure after another. The Disc 1 highlights are: the title track, "Fly On A Windshield", "Broadway Melody Of 1974", "In The Cage", "The Grand Parade Of Lifeless Packaging", "Back In N.Y.C", "Counting Out Time", "The Carpet Crawlers" and "The Chamber Of 32 Doors". "Cuckoo Cocoon" and "Hairless Heart" are fine tracks as well. Disc 2 highlights: the superbly crafted instrumental "The Waiting Room", "The Supernatural Anaesthetist", the melancholic "The Lamia" and "Silent Sorrow In Empty Boats", "The Colony Of Slippermen", "Riding The Scree" (love the line "Evel Knievel, you got nothin' on me!"), "In The Rapids" and "It". Nothing against "Lilywhite Lilith", "Anyway", "Ravine" and "The Light Dies Down on Broadway", as they are all well written tracks. Genesis' collective genius really shone through on this album, and is one of the best of their early period. "Lamb" also marks Peter Gabriel's curtain call with this remarkably talented group of musicians, who found the strength to continue onward as a unit. "Lamb" is a rather unique concept album, and this one-of-a-kind double CD gem should not be missed by any die-hard Genesis fan. This one's a must-have!
