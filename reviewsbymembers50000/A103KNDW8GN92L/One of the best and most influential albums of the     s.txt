 "Alone Together" is a well composed, musically put together album from one of rock music's finest guitarists. Here, Dave Mason rocks with great musical precision in the cuts "Only You Know And I Know", "Waitin' On You" and "Look At You Look At Me". It is on the latter track where Mr. Mason lets loose his interwoven, technically dispalyed guitar virtuosity. "Alone Together" displays a toned-down, moody side as well, which is present in such interpersonal songs as "Can't Stop Worrying, Can't Stop Loving", "Shouldn't Have Took More Than You Gave" and "Sad And Deep As You", all gorgeous and wonderful soul-grabbing numbers to boot. With all its' musical glory, the only thing missing on "Alone Together" is the original artwork, and therefore doesn't really deserve to carry MCA's "Compact Disc-Compact Price" generic moniker, as this is among the finest CD's classic rock has to offer. With that said, "AT" seriously is in need of the remaster treatment, although the sound quality featured here isn't all that bad. Since this is Dave Mason's first solo effort, I guess one could say he directed "Traffic" quite nicely. "Alone Together" should not be overlooked or missed by any fan of classic rock, Traffic afficianado or not. So, get it, if you haven't already!
