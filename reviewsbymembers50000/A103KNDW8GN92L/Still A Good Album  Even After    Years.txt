 Coming off the heels of both their highly successful "Naturally" and "Golden Bisquits" LP's, comes the equally gold(en) "Harmony". This has got to be one of Three Dog Night's best three albums, along with the aforementioned "Naturally" and "Seven Separate Fools". As you will hear for yourself, "Harmony" doesn't fail to disappoint, for this album contains the hits "Never Been To Spain", as written by the late Hoyt Axton (who was a fishing buddy of TDN member/singer Cory Wells), the environmentally-conscious "The Family Of Man", as co-written by Paul Williams, as well as "An Old Fashioned Love Song", also written by Paul (TDN fans, you must also hear the 45 version of "An Old Fashioned Love Song" from the double-CD "Celebrate" collection, as it's something to absolutely die for!). The non-singles featured on "Harmony" are just as good, if not better. The guys let it all hang out on "Jam", while they ease into a soulful groove on a song previously done by the late Marvin Gaye, titled "You". Another Motown legend, Stevie Wonder, contributes a composition of his own titled "Never Dreamed You'd Leave Me In Summer". Talk about one of the most prolific songwriters of our time, as Joni Mitchell adds "Night In The City" to the mix, as well. Even a childhood friend of TDN's Danny Hutton gets into the songwriting act, as a song written by Terry Furlong, titled "My Impersonal Life", somehow finds its way here. There's a price to be paid for all this wonderful music, as Three Dog Night is found guilty of "overexcessive pleasure", as they commit "Murder In My Heart For The Judge". Ah, but the sentence doesn't last long, for, as an appeal, Chuck Negron recites a magnificent poem to the judge, titled: "Mistakes And Illusions", thus our boys are set free from their so-called "crime". Alas, TDN found "Peace Of Mind" at last! To get yours (Peace Of Mind, that is), just purchase a copy of "Harmony" right now!
