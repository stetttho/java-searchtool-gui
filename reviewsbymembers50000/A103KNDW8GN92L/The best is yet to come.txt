 Fresh off the heels of their 1969 debut "From Genesis To  Revelation", the band felt they needed a fresh approach for their next  album, 1970's "Trespass." Genesis got themselves a new manager  and recorded this sophmoric effort in the English countryside to give the  album a "grass roots" British feel to it. The results appeared to  work, but many Genesis fans felt the best was yet to surface from this  quintet just out of the Charterhouse School in London. The polished tracks  here are "Stagnation" and "The Knife." Some personnel  changes would develop after this album as well. Guitarist Anthony Phillips  and drummer John Mayhew departed, with the former putting out an occasional  solo album. Genesis fans would then be treated to the classic lineup, aka  "the best yet to come."
