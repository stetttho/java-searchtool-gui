 With "Back In The Alley", B.B. King demonstrates he can do more than just belt out a blues number with great authority. He also incorporates a jazzy atmosphere into a fair number of the tracks in this upstanding collection of both live and studio cuts (courtesy of B.B.'s backing band, who are talented in their own right, "The King of the Blues" included). B.B. really takes the cake (and eats it too!!!), especially in front of a live audience, as evidenced in the live compositions "Sweet Little Angel", "Sweet Sixteen" and "Gambler's Blues". Lucille has a mind of her own, too, for she doesn't take any sass from anybody - B.B. included (just kidding!!!)! "The Bluesmeister" gets all the credit for making Lucille all she has turned out to be, for it takes magical, majestical fingers (such as B.B.'s) to really get her jump-started and electrified. All the studio tracks here are priceless gems as well, especially "Paying The Cost To Be The Boss" and "Lucille", as these two musical delights are truly a musicians institution. Although "Back In The Alley" is now out of print, a majority of these numbers can be found on other B.B. King compilation CD's, such as on "Paying The Cost To Be The Boss" and on the currently in print live CD "Live & Well", among others. Hopefully, MCA will give "BITA" the remaster treatment, as they have done with a majority of B.B.'s other CD titles, with the exception of "Indianola Mississipi Seeds" and the aforementioned "Live & Well", to which both could definitely use the remaster treatment. If you are lucky enough to get a hold of a copy of "Back In The Alley", you are in for a treat. If you already have it, then you already know what a treasured gem this recording truly is. No B.B. King fan can live without it!
