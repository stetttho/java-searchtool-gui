 If you were near a radio in the late '70's, then chances are, you were bombarded by the latest hit single from England Dan & John Ford Coley. This collection of their very best hits contains some of their most memorable songs: Their first and follow-up singles "I'd Really Love To See You Tonight" and "Nights Are Forever Without You". ED & JFC also struck it rich with the following: "We'll Never Have To Say Goodbye Again", "Gone Too Far", "It's Sad To Belong" and "Love Is The Answer". But, not only do you get the above mentioned AOR/Top 40 songs featured here, you also get the country-esque "Lady" and "Showboat Gambler", including a little disco flavor in "What Can I Do With This Broken Heart", as well as many other hidden gems performed in a style that only England Dan & John Ford Coley can muster. Dan Seals, without the "England", would later find success on the country charts in the mid-'80's, both as a solo and as a duet artist with songs such as "Meet Me In Montana" (with Marie Osmond) and "Bop". As for John Ford Coley, last I heard, he was selling used cars in Podunksville, Texas, although I could very well be wrong, which I am! Even though JFC may no longer be involved with the music business today, he sure left behind a lot of good music during his brief partnership with (England) Dan Seals (whose brother is Jim Seals of "Seals & Crofts", who had a plethora of early '70's pop hits as well). "The Very Best Of England Dan & John Ford Coley" is a very suitable and soothing collection of songs for any connoiseur of this style of music to have in their collection(s). But, like all good things, this CD won't be around forever. So you better purchase this priceless gem of must-have songs before it becomes a thing of the past. Buy yours today!
