 This is an all-out, well written and well composed effort by Mr. Neil  Diamond. This is a world-class superstar who continues to delight, as well  as entertain his audiences for almost 35 years. "Velvet Gloves And  Spit" is a wonderful collection of songs pleasing to the senses.  "A Modern Day Version Of Love" is as smooth as silk, while  "Honey Drippin' Times" is as refreshing as an ice cold glass of  lemonade on a hot summer day. "Brooklyn Roads" is reminiscent of  the happy, carefree days of childhood, and "Knackelflerg" wreaks  of that "love-bitten, head-in-the clouds" sensibility.  "Merry-Go-Round" speaks about the way of the world, and  "Holiday Inn Blues" is a laugh. The only down side of this CD is  the naive "Pot Smoker's Song", although the interviews here are a  nice, personal touch with thought-provoking insight. The lyrics throughout  the CD will really make you stop and think. I really like that cover! This  is one CD worth owning. You'll find yourself lstening to it over and over!
