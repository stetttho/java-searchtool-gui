 "Wind And Wuthering" is a worthy follow-up to "Trick Of The  Tail", and equals that album both musically and lyrically. W &W's  opening track "Eleventh Earl Of Mar" gives the listener some  insight on the journey upon which the songs take. "Eleventh Earl Of  Mar" could represent a course of action taken, while "One For The  Vine" could be representative of one's fate under adverse  circumstances. "All In A Mouse's Night" can be taken as someone  striving to obtain something worthy of being searched, yet searching for it  under dangerous circumstances. "Unquiet Slumbers For The  Sleepers" is an instrumental piece which can be interpreted to mean  that someone is traveling a smooth paved road after obtaining what that  person wanted, then weathering a difficult storm ahead: riding a rocky  road, then caught in a violent whirlpool. Then we get to  "Afterglow", where our person in peril   finally sails on a sea  of tranquility and finally reaches his destination. The interpretations  listed here can convey different meanings. "Your Own Special Way"  was the first Genesis song to reach the U.S. Billboad Hot 100. "Wind  & Wuthering" displays fine singing from Phil Collins, and  excellent musicianship from Tony Banks, Mike Rutherford and Steve Hackett,  who departed from Genesis shortly after this album. I recommend you buy  this CD!
