 I had not previously read Paul Cartledge, and to my surprise, I found his book on Alexander to be one of my favorites.  I do, however, recommend that this is an excellent book for those who already have some notion of the chronological events in Alexander's life, the overall problems with ancient sources, and the difficulties in trying to present a balanced portrait of the man himself when so many scholars apparently plump either for the Vulgate sources or Arrian - what I call the "Bad Alexander/Good Alexander" conflicts.  Cartledge's expertise carries him effortlessly over a review of the facts of Alexander's brief life and permits him to dwell thoughtfully on aspects of his character and accomplishments in an essay form.  Thus he focuses not only on Alexander's life, but on the legends that grew about him and how those legends as well as his life impacted generations unborn around the eastern world.  I found it often delightful, but again - I would not make it the first book to read about Alexander, but one for a student who already understood the basics.  I particularly liked his views on Alexander's hunting of animals and how elements were brought to his lightning wars, as well as a necessary discussion of Alexander's faith and its impact on his actions.
