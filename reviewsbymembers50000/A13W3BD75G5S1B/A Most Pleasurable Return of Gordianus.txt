 For those long-time fans of Saylor's Roma Sub Rosa mysteries, "A Mist of Prophecies" is a deeply satisfying return after several years' gap between it and Saylor's "Last Seen in Massilia."   The shocking conclusion of Massilia is referenced, but Gordianus' problems with his own family take backstage to the chaos of Rome during Civil War.  Both Pompey and Caesar have moved east to the ultimate battle between them for control of the Roman world.  Left behind, the capitol seethes in financial collapse, rumor, and fear.  Into this, a beautiful, half-mad seeress, Cassandra, explodes into Gordianus' life.  Dying in his arms in the Forum, we then backtrack through Gordianus' meetings with her and her involvement in the intrigues taking place in the paranoid world in which Caesar and Pompey, far away, are determining Rome's future. In discovering why she died, we meet some of Rome's most famous women, each of whom may be a suspect and each of whom is deeply involved with the desperate civil struggle playing out all around them.   The women are sketched with particular vividness.  We have met Fulvia and Clodia before in earlier novels.  I particularly enjoyed Caesar's wife, Calpurnia, whose small but highly memorable part in the mystery makes her far more interesting than the little that is known from history.  Old friends Milo and Caelius also help turn the plot. Saylor easily balances the personal woes of Gordianus with the the larger canvas of war and intrigue.  I found it consistently satisfying and, in its surprise ending, I suspect we may look forward to the next in the series as a completely different change of pace.   Although I missed actually seeing Caesar and Cicero in the novel (both are in the East), this is a fun, refreshing, and energetic read and - as always with Saylor - you will learn something about Rome.  Enjoy it!
