 Elaine Fantham (perhaps best known in the non-academic community as the Classical commentator on NPR) authored, with other contributors, this superb introductory study to women's studies in ancient Greece and Rome in 1994.  Since then, the whole field of studies in the lives of classical-age women has taken off like a rocket, but Dr. Fantham's book - with her co-writers, Helen Peet Foley, Natalie Boymel Kampen, Sarah B. Pomeroy, and H. Alan Shapiro - still manages to provide the best introduction I know to this subject.  As stated in the preface, "The purpose of this book is to gather the most important primary sources, both written and visual, for the lives of ancient women, and to present them within their historical and cultural context."  Therefore this is a tremendous sourcebook not only for original sources on women's lives, but with equal emphasis to art as well as the written word.  If you're beginning to learn about this fascinating field (which is still 'relatively' new in classical studies), this book is a must.
