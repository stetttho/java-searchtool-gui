 Julius Caesar is rather an avocation of mine, and I've tried to read all available fiction about him, as well as all available scholarly resources.  I haven't been this impressed with a book about ancient Rome in a very long time.  Jaro's writing style is effective and lyrical, her evocation of Rome hits all the right notes (and those are NOT easy to hit for many writers).  Making Caelius her narrator is an effective, indeed fascinating, plot device; the man knew everyone, apparently, and Catullus, Antony, Curio, Cicero, and others are solidly grounded in her story.  But of course, this is a novel about love and about Julius Caesar (not a phrase that automatically leaps to mind).  The love of a young, ambitious, rebellious Roman for what appeared to be the most brilliant, charming political operator of his day, a reformer who, too, was disillusioned with the power establishment?  Yes, that and much more.  There is a tone of wistful "what-ifs" in this book I feel strikes a realistic note for those living through the turbulent, violent last years of the Roman Republic.  Although I have minor qualms about the author's choices - her Cicero is a bit too noble, her Caesar's hinted bisexuality arguably too emphasized - in all the primary elements she finds an admirable balance in tale-telling between the history of the period (which she obviously knows intimately) and the projections we must all bring to it to make it come alive.  Thoroughly recommended and fascinating.
