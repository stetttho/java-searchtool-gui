 This has turned out to be one of the more interesting books on Caesar I've ever read, although a fictional account (and little can match the history itself for fascination). But this writers did a very good job in tracking Caesar's career the last 20 years of both his life and the Republic's; her narrator is Marcus Caelius Rufus who was, of course, the infamous lover of Clodia, accused of attempted murder, defended by Cicero. And involved in multiple aspects of the Civil War. As narrator, we see Caesar, Cicero, and others through Caelius (Cicero was a good friend and teacher and Caelius wrote him many notable letters in 50 when Cicero was governing Cilicia and Rome was falling apart). That said, Jaro's writing is elegaic and (I think) quite good - she picks up her story while Caelius, having turned against Caesar in the Civil War, is waiting fatalistically to be overwhelmed by one of his armies and reviewing his past life to see why he fell in with this extraordinary character. Occasionally the tone dips a bit too much into modern self-analysis, but I read it with pleasure. I'm not too sure if I agree with her portrayal of Caesar in some details - his alleged bisexuality being one of them - but I think her portrait of the man himself is pretty fascinating. He feels very authentic. That said, most of the books I've read which try to delve into Caesar's fictional personality fail miserably because Caesar is such a chameleon in history - they try to come down on one side or the other (devil-Caesar, noble Caesar) and go splat. Or, like Allen Massie's book, it's just a hodgepodge of his own writings and the character of the man himself never peeks out of the book. So I'd give it a slightly cautious recommendation if you want to try a fictional work on the great man. There are those who love Caesar who will take issue with some of her conclusions, but much of the picture she paints of Caesar rings true, which is an accomplishment in itself.
