 I was recomended this album/band from a friend, who said that I should definetly pick it up if I could find it. It is impossibly hard to find records from "obscure" metal bands where I live, also known as 85% of bands from outside North america. So one day while I was shuffiling through the Metal CDs at my local Record store, to my utter surprise, I found this. since I had a pocket full of recently made cash I felt I had to buy something, so not finding anything else that I was interested in, I grabbed this one. I had not heard any songs from the record, and I hadn't listened to Ensiferum or Norther, although I did hear good things. To say the least I was completely floored by just how good this album is! Wintersun is in no way a rip-off of Ensiferum, or any other band for that matter. Jari Maenpaa has made a very unique melodic death/power/folk metal blend here. to go off the topic of music for a second, I also really liked the artwork on the cover and in the booklet, it has a very cool frost-like effect on the pages where the lyrics are. At first Listen Wintersun seems to be a CoB/Kalmah/Norther rip off, but about half way through the Record you will realise that Wintersun is so much more then the aforementioned bands. So If your a fan of the melodic death metal scene, you have to listen to this. It breathes life into a genre that is getting more then a wee bit stale.  If you managed to read this entire review, and didn't feel like kicking me in the teeth after doing so, or found it remotely interesting, appealing, or helpful please take a second out of your busy and important day to press the "yes" button next to "Was this review helpful to you?"
