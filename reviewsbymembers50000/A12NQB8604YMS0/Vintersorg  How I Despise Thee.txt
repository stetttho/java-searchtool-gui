 The music in "Epic" pretty interesting, but it has some flaws, for example on "Traveller"; the short syth intro is very complicated and fast and it sounds good by itself, but then they add in everything else,it becomes confusing to listen to, because the synths end up sounding a little louder then everything else. Im nuts about "the weight of wind" its such an interesting track; and Vintersorgs nasally voice is nowhere to be found on this track. Vintersorg is a very overrated singer IMO why people love him so much is beyond me. Anyway I also like the sing-along chorus to "Relate" . . . HOO! . . . HA! the rest of the song...isnt quite as good. I should stop here; i dont want to end up talking about this track for track.  I'll start with the things I do like: great musicianship, interesting keyboard work. some singing is catchy.  Things that I don't like: Vintersorg's singing and songwriting, 85% of the lyrics bug me. it ends up sounding more like a science essay then a metal CD (for example: aaalgae and plaaaankton!!!...ugh, its just god-awful). some lines sound so obnoxious put alongside vintersorgs cocky vocals they make me want to smack him upside the head (like 2:50 of Quintessence). if this was Vortex or Garm I would be able to stand the annoying lyrics(they both are 10x better singers then vintersorg In my opinion.) The repetition of older borknagar lines bug me a little i.e. inherit the earth, quintessence, talking about the 4 elements some more etc,etc. but this dosent bother me too much.   Whether this is a step up or down from empiricism is really up to the listener and his/her tastes in music. personaly I think this is pretty simmilar to it, besides the keyboards holding a more signifigant role then they did in Empiricism. And, for the record, I think Empiricism is a horribly over-rated ablum. My favorite release from borknagar is still - and i think will remain as long as Vintersorg is in charge of the mic - The archaic course.
