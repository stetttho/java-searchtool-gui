 _The Shadowthrone_ and _Dark Medival Times_ are true Black metal classics. This, and _Hvis Lyset Tar Oss_ by Burzum, were my introduction to black metal, and I can't say that I could have found a better place to start. The whole album is as cold as ice, from the Battle cry that opens the album to the funeral sythn ending. If you've just discovered satyricon, you could pick this up but I'd recommend getting _Nemesis Divinia_ before picking this up. I say that because _Nemesis Divinia_ is the bands most famous record. And It is an easier introduction to this band overall.  But if your already fammiliar to satyricon and/or black metal Pick this up now! And for those of who like bands like Cradle of Filth or Dimmu Borgir, go out and listen to some of the bands that made the bands you like what they are today.
