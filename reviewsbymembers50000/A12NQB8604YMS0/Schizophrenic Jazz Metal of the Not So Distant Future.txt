 This is my first experience with the Arctopus, and I'm sure it won't be my last. Behold...THE ARCTOPUS have a great combination of technical metal/jazz metal going on; Sometimes it will rend and flay your head and upper torso into a steaming pile of fleshy tissue, and at others it will sound like very laid back, melodic type of Jazz/Jazz metal. They Kinda remind me of "Cynic", That is  If Cynic lost the keyboards and robo voices, and shot themselves up with steroids and Caffine.   This touch guitar stuff is crazy, its got me very interested in finding out more about the instrument, as I have never heard of them before. And another amazing thing about this band is that it is a three piece. I could swear that they have 2 guitarists and a bass going sometimes. The only thing I have against them is that the guitarist is prone to go into wild shred-fests every now and then, which can get on my nerves sometimes.   But everything else about this EP is top-notch stuff. It might not be very long, but when you listen to it, every second feels like three because of the insane complexity of it all. But also not to be overshadowed are the beautiful mellow passages like in Sensory Amusia...Man its so relaxing and peacefull, you could listen to that in a cafe...although 60 seconds down the line you might listen to it at a destruction durby, or at a construction site.  The arctopus has also recently signed to Metal Blade records,(Home of Cannibal Corpse, The Black Dahlia murder, etc) So If you enjoyed this Ep like I did, Im sure that even better material will be coming from the Arctopus in the very near future. Keep Your eyes on these guys.
