 Save your money. This is by far one of Kenyon's worst books. I've read nearly all of her Dark Hunter books, and for the most part, they're entertaining reads, but  nothing substantial and definitely nothing to make you think. She's hit a new low with Unleash the Night. While I liked Wren and Maggie and I wanted to enjoy the story, I was constantly thrown out of the story by the complete lack of any emotional intensity or any thought to actions or decisions. The characters make random decisions and you just can't see where they came to their conclusions except by plot device. The book was filled with cliches, triteness and complete and utter predictability. It's such a disappointment, because I want to like these books.
