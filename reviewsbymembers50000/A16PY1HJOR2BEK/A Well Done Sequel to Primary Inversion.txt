 For fans of Catherine Asaro, THE RADIANT SEAS does not disappoint! In it is the continuing saga of the Skolian Empire. Although the blurb implies that much of the book is focused on Sauscony and Jaibriol, it's actually an  epic of two empires struggling for power and the political intrigues  involved. Asaro takes time to develop her characters and make them  believable. She evokes the readers' emotions with introspective  examinations of characters' decisions and actions, and the sacrifices that  each of them makes. But she also keeps the action and plot moving along at  a rapid pace. I literally could not put this book down and found myself  wanting more when it ended. Fans of sci-fi, romance, and action novels will  definitely want to read this once you finish with PRIMARY INVERSION.
