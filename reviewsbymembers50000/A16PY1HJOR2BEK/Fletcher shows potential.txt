 The premise was interesting: a secret society of immortal witches that takes care of its own. Our  hero, Dagon, is a powerful witch who plans on marrying another witch of equal or greater  power. Unfortunately, he finds  himself attracted to Sarina, a witch who mysteriously lacks power  and is  quite clumsy. Sarina has her own secrets and doesn't quite trust the  arrogant witch, but she, too, finds herself falling in love with  him. Okay, read this, thought it was all right minus the odd dialogue and  the sermons on love (I know,  it's a romance, it's supposed to talk about  love, but this was a little over the top--very sappy and wishy-washy). The  dialogue was too archaic. Although the witches are immortal, you would   think their language would change with the times. Instead, they seem to be  trapped in the  medieval ages, despite the fact that it's the 1990s. There  were a few too many sermons on the  magical and omnipotent aspects of love.  After the first two, I though "Enough already...get on  with the  story!" Regardless, I liked the book. Enough to look for its  prequel, WEDDING SPELL. If you like paranormal romances, you'll probably  enjoy this one. Donna Fletcher has created an interesting fantasy world I  wouldn't mind visiting again.
