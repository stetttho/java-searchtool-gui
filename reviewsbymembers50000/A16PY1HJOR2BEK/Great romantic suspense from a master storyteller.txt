 I liked this one even more than THUNDER ISLAND. HALF MOON BAY  definitely belongs on the keeper shelf of all romance lovers. There was a nice,  even balance between the suspense and the romance, and the characters  were all  too human. Amy Conroy has always been disfigured--one side of her face  has been marred by  a terrible birthmark. As if that doesn't make her life  bad, she's being pursued by a  twisted sociopath. Then she's in a car crash  and mistaken for one of the victims,  Rochelle Raston. Amy's face is  reconstructed, the scar disappears, and that's where the fun  begins. Matthew Jensen, an investigative reporter, would rather leave  Rochelle Raston far behind. Being stalked by a maniac isn't his idea of  fun. But he finds himself drawn to this new Rochelle, who doesn't seem as  obsessive, who would rather have little to do with him, and to whom he  finds himself irresistably attracted. Meryl Sawyer makes you laugh and  ache along with the characters, and sends chills down your back when the  bad guys start to catch up. Matthew Jensen belongs in the Romance Heroes  Hall  of Fame for being one of the most likable, soft-hearted, but toughest  men I've read  about in a long time. He isn't vicious a cruel to Amy,  though he has every right to  be, since he thinks she's the stalker who  threatened his sister. The premise of this book was so unique to me. A  woman who's gone through life  disfigured suddenly becomes a gorgeous  sexpot with a new identity. And gee...a stalker victim falling for his  "stalker" :)  Think of the mental  gymnastics he's going  through! If you haven't read this, you'll definitely want to! The plot,  characters, and  secondary characters are fantastic!
