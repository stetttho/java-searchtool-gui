 Creed Rivera has been assigned to track down and apprehend Dominicka Starkova, who is rumored to be brokering a deal with terrorists to sell a nuclear warhead. He finds her in a Denver library and as soon as he arrives, all hell breaks loose.  Cody Stark, aka Domincka Starkova, is trying desperately to hide from the bad guys after her. She's being pursued by terrorists who want the location of the nuclear warhead. Tired, worn, and stressed, all hell breaks loose in the library she's working at. She's rescued by Special Forces agent Creed Rivera. They're attracted to each other, but neither of them want to trust the other.  This was my first exposure to this series, but it's the third book in Janzen's "Crazy" series. I enjoyed it and loved the action/adventure theme, though I felt that it overpowered the romance quite a bit. The first 2/3rds of the book was almost complete action, with the h/h running from the terrorists, then the heroine trying to escape the hero, getting caught, escaping, getting caught... You get the picture.  I felt Janzen handled very well the Creed and Cody's various traumas from their past. They're both strong and tough characters, but not completely broken. Just wary and cautious. However, Janzen was playing up on Creed's darkness and broodiness (he witnessed his friend and partner tortured and killed in front of him as he was tied and helpless), but this seemed to dissipate halfway through the book, and he became your regular old Special Ops hero. Cody was a great heroine. Strong and resourceful, and extremely intelligent, I admired her and her ability to fend for herself.  My favorite parts, though, were the scenes between Baby Bang (Skeeter) and Dylan. I cannot wait for their book. They had such chemistry on the page and were so much fun.  I'm definitely going to keep on with this series, and likely get the first two books as well. They're light (to me) reads, but a good page-turner and vacation book.
