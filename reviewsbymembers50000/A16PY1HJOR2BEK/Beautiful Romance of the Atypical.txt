 If you're looking for a darker, angsty read of the unusual, this romance is one of the most beautifully written pieces of the genre. A keeper for me. Yes, Imogene wants Jonas to teach her art, but he also teaches her about courage and strength, and in return Imogene teaches the bipolar Jonas about trust and love. Set in the early 1900s, this novel is an amazing testament to Megan Chance's skillful ability to craft realistic characters.
