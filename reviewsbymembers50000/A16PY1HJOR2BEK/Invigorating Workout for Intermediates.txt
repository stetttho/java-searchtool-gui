 This dance-inspired yoga workout is great for intermediates. Skip the beginners workout (it's only about15-20 minutes anyway) and head over to the intermediate workout. If you are curious about the beginners, go through it, as it shows modified positions for when you're not at home and maybe want to do some yoga in the office or in some random alley. The Intermediate workout keeps you moving, maybe a little too much, but gives you a full-body workout - abs, arms, legs, and back, and has a fairly extensive stretching section. I've started doing this workout pretty often, over the others that I own. You just need 1 hour during your day to do it, and you can feel the difference. I do find the switch from voice-over to speaking in the workout a bit annoying, but after awhile you just ignore it.
