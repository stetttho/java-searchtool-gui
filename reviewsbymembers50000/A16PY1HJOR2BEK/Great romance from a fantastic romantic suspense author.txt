 Meryl Sawyer has been touted as one of the leading ladies of romantic suspense. In  THUNDER ISLAND, her latest book, she brings together two former lovers whose  lives have been made difficult by past  misunderstandings and unexpected deaths.  Sawyer's characters were wholly  realistic and believable. The secrets both kept  from each other, and the  inadvertant misunderstandings, strengthened their  relationship. They could  each sense the other's pain and rather than making  fantastical accusations  (as so often happens), they strove to find the source of the  pain and to  ease it.  I only took issue with Kyle's attitude and treatment of Jenny  when she first joined  his class. His condescending attitude really irked  me, but of course, anti-terrorism  is a male-dominated profession and part  of that male bastion of careers that have  little tolerance for women.   My only other problem with this book was that the "suspense"  part of it didn't  really build until the last 4 chapter or so (the part  that the back blurb indicates is  the main part of the book--"But the  aftermath of their desire leads to murder--and  Jennifer is the prime  suspect in a crime that has its twisted roots in Thunder  Island's maze of  shocking secrets and dangerous lies..."). And it was easily solved,   with little suspense. But the romance part was great. Based on this book,  I've gone  out to buy as much of Meryl Sawyer's backlist as possible!
