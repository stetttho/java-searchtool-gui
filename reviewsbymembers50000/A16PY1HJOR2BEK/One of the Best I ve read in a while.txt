 This was a fabulous book! Asaro goes above and beyond wonderfully personable characters, great plotting, and excellent subplots. I haven't enjoyed a book this much in a long time. So glad it's the first in a  series--that much more to look forward to. The characters are believable,  and although I'm not a fan of older woman, younger man romances, Asaro made  this one work for me. Highly recommended!
