 A fan since the first book, I was pretty disappointed with NARCISSUS IN CHAINS. It took me almost three weeks to get through it, when I used to read Laurell Hamilton's books in one sitting. In NARCISSUS, you meet all the regular characters, plus some new ones. The Plot: Um. I'm still working on that one.  NIC is definitely a transition book - Anita is discovering more of her powers, she's trying to figure out her personal life (as she's been doing for the last 7 books or so), and she's trying to protect her wereleopards. Beyond that, there isn't much of a plot (unless it's "Save Gregory!" which takes up over half the books). This book lacked a lot of cohesiveness and the characters weren't true to themselves. They acted, and reacted, very differently than I would have expected. For example, Anita used to stand on her moral and ethical high ground when it came to sex and who she had it with. In NIC, she's involved in orgies and with strangers. Where's her moral highground?? Or are we seeing the moral degradation of her character? I am still something of a fan of Laurell Hamilton's, but can't help being let down with this book. Anyone interested in starting her books should start with the early ones - they are her best examples of great story-crafting.
