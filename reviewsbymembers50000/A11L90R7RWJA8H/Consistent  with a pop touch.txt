 I'd been meaning to get this CD for years, ever since I saw the Kinks give a fantastic performance on a tour that featured a number of these songs. While I don't have the Kinks' entire catalog, this one is more adventurous than "Low Budget". I'm surprised at the distaste that some Kinks fans have for this. I'm guessing that this album is less likely to appeal to fans looking for the arena rock of "Destroyer" or "Do It Again". Sure, this collection of songs has a lighter groove to it; nothing wrong with that. Which is not to say that this is an album of ballads, not by any stretch. Although the lead single, "Working at the Factory" never particularly tripped my trigger, "Welcome to Sleazytown" in particular is a must-have. "Lost and Found" is a classic, just listen to song samples online. "How Are You", ditto. "Video Shop" is a light, fun narrative that doesn't try to make any big statements about the human condition. The title track should have been the single released in the wake of "Come Dancing". Unfortunately, that honor fell to "Rock and Roll Cities", quite possibly the worst song in the Kinks' catalog. Still, I like this album a lot. It's no wonder that half this album makes up the MCA years compilation "Lost and Found". The criticisms remind me a lot of how critics greeted a good album like the Stones' "It's Only Rock n Roll". They rode the band hard for not putting out another "Exile On Main Street", but the band had changed gears on them. At the price this CD is going for, it's a bargain.
