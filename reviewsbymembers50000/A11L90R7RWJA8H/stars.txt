 Nuggets II will appeal most to the guys who endlessly troll record swaps for painfully obscure historical artifacts. Like everyone else who bought this the day it came out, I'd had the original Nuggets two LP set, and then the Pebbles series, and Highs In The Mid-Sixties, and the first Nuggets box set, and so on. Typically with those series, the first few volumes would be indispensable (e.g. Pebbles 1-4), and the remainder would grow increasingly spotty. So too with this box set. It's got a lot of good stuff, but the music here leans less toward the Standells and more toward the Ides of March. More toward the '67-68 psychedelic sound, less '65-66 "punky" sound.  It really shouldn't matter whether a record was a hit or not, but when you get a box set from this era that loudly proclaims "no hits!", you begin to suspect that the track listing was designed with built-in blinders. I don't care if early Pink Floyd is well-known or not, "See Emily Play" would have been good to hear in this context. Or a couple more tunes by Them. But that would cause the purists who are hung up on obscurity itself to bristle. Hey Rhino - those guys are gonna buy this thing anyway. A third of the tracks here are top shelf "shoulda beens", the remainder are of varying interest. I'll buy Nuggets III when it comes out, but I hope that Nuggets III returns more to the balance of the original two record set. All in all, the anglocentric style of Nuggets II will especially appeal to music fans who thought that "Ride My See-Saw" was special.
