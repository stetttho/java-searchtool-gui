 I bought this book almost three years ago and every time I delve into it the writing style has me so bored I can't make it beyond the first chapter. The author is so busy documenting that this book becomes about as dry as a heap of court paperwork. While the events described may make a good tabloid documentary someday, this particular book is better left as source material for another writer.
