 No use repeating what's already been said by others. This season was when West Wing turned into one ridiculous parade of grinding "big dramas". Here's where it started turning into a dreary soap opera, where DC becomes "Dallas". In previous seasons the show could stand on its own merits, on the fascination of the political process, on the characters, but this season descended into muck as someone must have decided that every show had to be more whiz-bang than its predecessor. You almost expect Bruce Willis to show up.   The addition of the bookish Josh Molina doesn't compensate for the loss of Rob Lowe's character. Add to that the amazing mortality rate of so many interesting characters who appeared for awhile during the first few seasons, then vanished into thin air and it seems that something was just slowly going wrong.   Somewhere in the middle of this season this show outlived its usefulness. Maybe if we simply stop feeding it, it will go away.
