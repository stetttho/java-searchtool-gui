 It should have been called "All That You've Heard Before". One pumped three minute single to start the CD and a bunch of wallpaper to fill it out. While the completist U2 fan will want to add this to their collection, there are too many other great CDs out there for the rest of us to have bought this particular one. Although I haven't heard every last U2 album, this is easily the least of the seven or eight that I've heard. It's assembled all the trademarked sounds and peculiarities that fans have grown to expect but when an album provides all the satisfaction of tap water, sometimes being U2 is not enough.
