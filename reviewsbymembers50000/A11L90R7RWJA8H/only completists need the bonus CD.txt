 Sure, get the album - but only if you already have their first four classics: Eat to the Beat, Parallel Lines, Plastic Letters and Blondie.  The two singles leap out at you, distinguishing themselves from the rest of the album. Some good moments, but unlike Blondie's first albums, where the styles were woven together into a cohesive patchwork quilt, this one is just all over the map. They really need to kill the cleverness and get back to basics or run the risk of turning into a novelty band. The lounge moments are strong, but that may be because it harkens back to what worked about the early Blondie pastiche. The pastiche evoked an *era*, an era of girl groups, surf sounds, lounge swingers, hep cats and delightfully weird sci-fi movies. Then came the '80s and along came the rap and the reggae and suddenly they'd crossed their cultural references and lost their sonic cohesiveness. The bonus CD? Pleasant but not worth the added cost. "Heart of Glass", being the closing song of a live set, goes on about two minutes longer than even my attention span. "Rapture" is as annoying and just plain stupid as it was the first time around. "Call Me" and "Dreaming" are the best moments here, but there aren't any real adventures away from a straightforward delivery of those two songs. "Heart of Glass" does wind down with riffs snaked from Jimi's "Third Stone from the Sun" I think it was. Clem Burke is spectacular throughout both disks. It's good enough that I'm looking forward to more Blondie in the future.
