 Three careers, three CDs: the statement being made is that they were only good for their singles, not their albums. May not be the intended message but that's what comes across. 1 CD of the Osmonds, 1 of Donny, 1 of Marie. In any of these cases you're better off with one of the 20+ track single disk compilations.  I decided to pass on this package, pull out my old vinyl and put together my own compilation instead so it would include must-have numbers like "I Knew You When" and "Flirtin'". To the compilers' credit they did include an album cut, "Chilly Winds", one of the Osmonds' finest moments ever. But I'd expect a box set to include a few b-sides or rarities too, things like "Keep On My Side" (the so-so flip of their best single, "Yo-Yo"). Yes they're from "Utah", include that song too!  All they really needed to do was to intertwine the songs from all the careers in chronological order over a four disk set to provide the depth that a worthy box set should give. With that kind of career perspective they could even afford to make you smile by including something ancient like "When The Red Red Robin..." from the Andy Williams show. Where the careers were seriously divergent, the cool and simple inclusion of interview sound bites between, e.g. "Last of the Red Hot Lovers" / "Crazy Horses" or "Going Going Gone" / "My Drum" would both help the segue and flesh out the box set beyond just a rote recitation of popular recordings. When they put THAT box set out, I'll buy it.
