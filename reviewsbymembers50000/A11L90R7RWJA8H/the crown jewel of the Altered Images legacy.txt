 I had been waiting for this perfect gem, checking the "Altered Images" section at the shops for years, hoping for its reissue on CD. "Bite" was a smooth, succulent pop album with nary a misstep when it came out twenty years ago and it sounds even better today. Unlike many eighties albums that sound embarrassingly dated, "Bite" proudly retains a timeless sound. Song for song, "Bite" was as good or better than any pop album released that year or this. Its lead single, "Don't Talk To Me About Love" is simply one of the best pop 45s ever released. It's good to have its 12" on CD here as well - both A and B side. The dance mixes for singles "Love To Stay" and "Bring Me Closer" are also welcome bonus tracks. The addition of the b-side "Surprise Me" lends a slight flavor of the "Pinky Blue" album to the proceedings, and that's a happy bonus too.  The enclosed booklet includes original album artwork and gives a nice history of Altered Images circa "Bite". The only thing that might have made this reissue "perfect-er" would have been the inclusion of the band's cover of "Little Town Flirt". If only we had Clare Grogan and Altered Images now!
