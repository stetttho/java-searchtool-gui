 You'll enjoy this CD. Seems like the only time we hear tubas are on cartoons from the 1940s, but that's okay because most of the material here is from the first half of the 20th century. So you thought tubas were only sound effects for Dumbo? Guess again. There's some really enjoyable jazz here, and yes, unlike a lot of jazz, "Tubas From Hell" has a great sense of humor. "Yakkety Tuba"...how could anyone resist? But this CD isn't a joke, it makes for good listening, good enough to reinvent how you see the tuba.
