 Two other reviews on this page already express how good this set is. Only thing I could really add is that "Round Midnight" is quite possibly the most stunning moment in June's entire catalog.  I loved the  "Something Cool" CD but tended to be naturally skeptical that the  rest of someone's catalog could measure up to that classic. "The Misty  Miss Christy" closed the deal for me, making me a dedicated June  Christy fan. Although I'm also  especially fond of "Dearly  Beloved", "A Lovely Way to Spend an Evening", "Sing  Something Simple" and of course, "For All We Know" (no, not  the Carpenters song) every song is, well - it doesn't get any better than  this.
