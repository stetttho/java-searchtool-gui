 If I had to put together a best of from Amy's three Koch albums, this is almost exactly the collection I'd assemble, right down to the wickedly funny unreleased (on CD) "Keep It To Yourself". Sure, my favorite Amy CD, "Middlescence" could stand to add another couple favorites here, particularly "Laboratory of Love" and "As Is" but there's always room for quibbling.  If you're already familiar with Amy, no doubt about it, you've already gotten her first three CDs. If you're not, this is a great starting point. Nothing beats Amy's combination of top notch songwriting, incisive wit and musicality. Of all the performers that my friends have turned me on to in the past dozen years or so, I'm most grateful for being introduced to the music of Amy Rigby.
