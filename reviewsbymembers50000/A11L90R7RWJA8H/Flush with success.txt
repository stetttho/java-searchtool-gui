 Two stars because even in its worst year West Wing is not Seinfeld or any of the other insipid formulaic glucose that clutters up the airwaves. But seasons four and five make it clear that West Wing did have a formula, albeit a winning one, and that formula was thrown out. The charm is gone.   Many of the episodes in this season are simply not worth watching. The characters are out of character and every episode attempts to up the ante with BIGGER DRAMA. It's as though the producers were taking their audience base for granted and were now trying to justify their existence by boosting numbers. The stories seem as though they were written with the weekly promo spots in mind. Gotta have that explosion. This season is a drudgery to watch, an appeal to the action movie crowd.   The dialogue fares no better. In the early years West Wing made an attempt, however weak at times, to show both sides of the coin so the viewer could reasonably understand how each of the opposing sides could hold those views. By this point in the show's devolution that effort has been discarded and content is generally replaced with one-sided advocacy; some of the scenes should bear subtitles stating, "this is a paid political advertisement". You can visualize the character stepping forward to the edge of the stage to bellow another hamfisted soliloquoy. Once again the "big explosions" mentality gains ascendancy and West Wing loses the balance that once made it interesting.  There were errant moments during this season when in spite of themselves the writers and producers let a worthy episode slip through onto the airwaves. But this is why we have home taping.
