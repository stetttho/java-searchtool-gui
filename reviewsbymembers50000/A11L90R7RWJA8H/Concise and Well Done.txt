 This was the one I was willing to spring for; the inclusion of Joe South's "I Knew You When" made the difference. A single disk collection has to include all of the key hits from their primary chart run. This one does. It also leaves off material from the lower rungs of the charts that would be better suited to a more in-depth compilation.  While this won't fill the gaps in the catalog for those who want a comprehensive series of reissues, you won't find a better single disk compilation of the Osmonds. Unlike some of the earlier cheapie compilations the packaging is as well-done, informative and respectful as anything you might find on the Rhino label. One small detail that makes me smile - the typeface used on the booklet song listing is reminiscent of the typeface on the cover of the Osmonds' self-titled debut.
