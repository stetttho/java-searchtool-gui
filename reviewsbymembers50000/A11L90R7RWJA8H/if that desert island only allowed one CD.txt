 If that legendary desert island only allowed one CD, this would be mine. I stumbled across this in shopping and took a chance on it. All instrumental, in turn subtle, melodic, beautiful, mournful, vibrant; in short, the most moving music I've ever heard.  I don't know if this is what klezmer music sounds like or not but I've never found another CD to match this. After discovering this delight I tried several other groups and compilations but nothing came close to the sound of the CKB. I would describe it as having all the best aspects of classical music but without the wearisome bombast of an entire orchestra.   In their subsequent CDs the CKB have branched out from this foundation, experimenting here and there, but this remains my favorite of their works. I really can't find the words to describe this album or express how perfect it is.
