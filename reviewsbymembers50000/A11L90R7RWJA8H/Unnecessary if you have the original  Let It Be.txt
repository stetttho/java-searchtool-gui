 For years I'd thought that the Let It Be album must have been bloated with unnecessary orchestrations that got in the way of what might have been an otherwise halfway decent collection of Beatles songs. This release proves me wrong. If you have the original "Let It Be" album this one is entirely unnecessary unless you wish to scrape the bottom of the barrel.  For instance, I'd always assumed that "The Long and Winding Road" would still be sappy but would be redeemed by the removal of the intrusive string section. Wrong. I'd expected that it would now be a lovely melody played on solo piano but instead there seem to be sections of the song that seem unfinished.  This album still contains the liability of some of the Beatles' weakest material, e.g. I Dig A Pony and I've Got A Feeling, and the album cuts still sound like the filler they were thirty three years ago. Get Back still ends prematurely but its humorous ending ("I hope we pass the audition") is gone, removing the one touch of distinction the truncated album version had. Now it's just another take pulled out of the can.  The 21 minutes of "fly on the wall" studio chatter on disk two s pretty spotty even for studio banter. While there are a couple passing moments of interest, as a whole this is not something I'll ever play again. To make matters worse the entire CD is a single track so you have to fast forward if you want to get to the even marginally interesting stuff at the end. Let It Be was never much of a Beatles album to begin with but unfortunately this reissue does nothing to improve that stature. If I'd heard it before I'd bought it I would have spent my leisure cash on something else...
