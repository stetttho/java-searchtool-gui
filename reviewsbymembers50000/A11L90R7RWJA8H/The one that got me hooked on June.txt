 I was familiar with June singing the pop hits of the Kenton orchestra, so I was intrigued when I saw a whole CD of June Christy. What the heck, twenty four tracks, can't go too wrong, right?  A discovery like this  comes along only a few times in a lifetime. The CD reissue packs in an  extra 13 bonus tracks, adding a pop flavor from her singles to the  "cool" jazz vocals of the original album. I'm sure that fans who  had the opportunity to own the original albums must've been thrilled with  the release of delights from the vaults such as "Out of  Somewhere", one of my favorites. The reason June Christy is my  favorite jazz vocalist is that she sings with subtlety and finesse, so that  unlike the jazz vocalists who beat you over the head with their  "style", June wraps her lovely voice around a song while allowing  the song its own due. Once you hear this one, you'll probably wind up  getting the rest of her catalog. I know I did.
