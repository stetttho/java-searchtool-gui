 This drudgery is the most dreary and artless "Christmas movie" in recent history. It attempts to portray a dysfunctional family being visited for the first time by a supremely self-conscious fiancee, then gradually redeeming each of them through the run-of-the-mill excuse that they're all damaged and have their own secret pain so somehow that makes their beastly behavior understandable and all right.   Well, no. As portrayed in this holiday date movie the characters start out being so nasty that by the time each secret pain is revealed, their personal affliction comes across more as karma than anything else. And you, having to endure all this for the better part of two hours! The one commendible thing about this sad effort is that the casting was perfect, to a T.   That something this vacuous, yet utterly lacking in either insight or confection, is actually on the market serves as ample proof that the western world has too much money, too much time, and not a lot to say beyond zombie platitudes dished out on fortune cookies and afternoon talk show pitches. At least if it had been doused in a cheery syrup of Jimmy Stewart holiday saccharine some might have found it a guilty pleasure.   Bring this turkey to a family gathering of people you hate and leave it there.
