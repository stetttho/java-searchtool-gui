 These two were produced by Bill Miller, and come  from 1960 and 1963. The first time I heard this CD I was wowed. As the titles indicate, this is night music, the intimate side of the Misty Miss Christy. On "The  Intimate Miss Christy", June is accompanied only by a guitar and bass.  From this collection, "Don't Explain" is a smoky number that  would be in the running for my favorite June Christy recording of all time.  From "Ballads for Night People", "Make Love to Me" (not  the Jo Stafford hit) is a perfect firelight moment, though this entire CD  is a gem.
