 Right from the start Ken gets it right. You pop it into the DVD player and instantly something Word Jazz is happening. No corporate logos, no flying (and noisy) graphics, no trailers for other products, just instant wonder wandering as the DVD spins up.  Those familiar with Ken's body of work (work? hardly, it sounds more like play) will recognize a number of the numbers here, from a brush with "Colors" to his most recent renderings of the past dozen years. Each is classic Nordine.  The dreamlike images reflect the meditative thoughts and the ideas-as-lilypads chain of ruminations. As a whole the visuals and storytelling evoke the sense of flying through the clouds in a sentient dream, descending through a billowy blanket of cloud cover and emerging below to see the sparkling lights of a city in the distance bejewelling the horizon. As you draw closer you realize that some of these lights have a pattern, connections between those dots that you'd never noticed before, paths that you can't even see yet but can tell that they're there.   That's Word Jazz, linking disparate ideas and notions with invisible avenues you'd never dreamed of, a stream of consciousness populated by a myriad of lilypad ideas for you to hop. Every constellation in the nighttime sky begins with the first hop from star to star and if you've ever had trouble jumpstarting your imagination, Ken's narrations will help you find star one.
