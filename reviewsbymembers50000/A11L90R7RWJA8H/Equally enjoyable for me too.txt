 I'm thrilled when our two year old goes to the DVD cabinet, pulls this out and says, "I want Star!" Of all the DVDs in our library for our two year old, I prefer this one head and shoulders above the rest. In fact, I enjoy it myself. Unlike other childrens' DVDs, this is wonderful even if it's just playing in the background while the children play with blocks in the next room. The classical soundtrack is refreshing first thing in the morning. And the artwork! I'm glad that my child is being introduced to the beauty of Van Gogh and Picasso at a young age. It's very well done and the artworks chosen are appropriate and enjoyable for children, even including one from "Goodnight Moon", one of her favorite bedtime books. The only flaw might be that this is thirty minutes long. My two year old doesn't object to that, but when this DVD is over I find myself playing it again. I wish there was a 60 or 90 minute version for grown ups!
