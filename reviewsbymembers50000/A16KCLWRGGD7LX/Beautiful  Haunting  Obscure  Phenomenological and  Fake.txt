 I have researched Castaneda quite a bit over the last 10 years. All of his books had a powerful efect on my imaginative life in my early twenties.  However, I am convinced that Castaneda made it all up. I think Richard De  mille's research proves it. I read "Castaneda's Journey" and  found it to make tremendous sense. He studied phenomenology (This is where  he gets his concept of intent), and studied Ethnomethodology with  Garfinkle. After this book I did further research that convinced me that he  concocted it all. Nonetheless, his books can help people, and are beautiful  in the hope and magic they infuse into the mundanity and boredom that many  feel characterize life today. In one sense, Castaneda's books are one of  the most imaginative services ever done to Phenomenology. Pop- Pseudo-  Shamanistic Phenomenology, if you will. I never wanted to discover this  evidence, as it could make anyone that much more cynical, but I still find  Castaneda himself to be all the more fascinating for succeeding to the  extent that he did, if in fact he made it up. That would make him one of  the most Authentic and vivid examples of a trickster teacher in our times.  This book is over the top in hallucinatory power. Here Don Jaun ups the  ante. Reading about Don Genaro walking up the tree sideways, alone made  this book worth it.
