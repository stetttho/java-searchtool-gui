 Johan Wolfgang Von Goethe gave himself a rite of passage by writing this book. He was suffering from a great deal of emotional confusion at the time, and the story served as a catharsis to expunge what he felt were  unhealthy aspects of emotionality in his personality. The story is  popularly classified as Romanticism because of it's rich organic imagery  and overwhelming emotional tone. Goethe never thought or referred to  himself as a Romantic. In his later years, he viewed Werther as a stage of  life in which he had undergone a sort of transformation that aided him in  leaving his adolescence behind. The story of Werther that unfolds through  his letters is a lucid description of the strong subjective nature of  restless emotionality characteristic of a youthful stage in life. The  significance of what Goethe captures in this novel is how clearly it  demonstrates, in an archetypal manner, the transgressive and oppressive  nature of the emotions when fixated at immature levels of masculinity. The  story is absorbing and beautiful, and made all the more remarkable by the  fact that Goethe wrote it at age 24! I will never forget this book. If you  want to read Goethe this is the place to start!
