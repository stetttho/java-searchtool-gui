 Down Lewis down!  This book confronts me. I open it's pages and it is like looking in the mirror. Everything I can see is there, I cannot hide from what I don't want to see. I command and march my ideas into the text only to have them obliterated and sucked into a black hole. The book costs all of your ideas-literally. However, once you hand 'em over, your in for one heck of a rebate. Paradoxically, you will have no more options, only to inherit everything as is, after which, there is no refund. This book is honest and rare-I like it better than anything I have seen in a long time. For all the brilliant philosophy we have in the world, I don't know how many can actually stand up to exposure to the scorching rays of this honesty. This entire book reads like a question and a bomb. A mind bomb that explodes illusions so that by the end of the reading, you will know what time it is.
