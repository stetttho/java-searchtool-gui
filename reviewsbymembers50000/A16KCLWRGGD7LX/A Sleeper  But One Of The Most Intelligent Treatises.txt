 It is a Shame that no one knows about this man. He is one of the most intelligent spokesmen for the spirit since Thomas Merton. This book has no b.s. These are profound thoughts of a deep and highly sensitive man. No  rhetoric. He draws on his own past experiences from childhood, with his  teacher, and as a filmaker. He is humble and I get the sense he is as real  as they come. I cannot reccomend this highly enough. This should be on the  New York Times Bestseller List. This makes the Celestine Prophecy look like  purile sandbox spirituality!
