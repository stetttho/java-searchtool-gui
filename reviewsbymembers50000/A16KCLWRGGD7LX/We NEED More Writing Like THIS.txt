 This book is rant that as you read it, begins to have a profound effect and creates a strange hypnotic reality. I venture to guess that Mr. Hyatt is gulity of the toxic magic he elucidates. All the more admirable. We need  more books like this one, where the author tells those things that rarely  are ever articulated. I love the book. It inspires me to stop recycling  newspaper, cans and bottles for starters. I for one think that some day  people are going to look back on this time in history and laugh at us!  Could it be true? Five thumbs up(per hand). Rated R for Reality. I am going  to read this puppy over and over.
