 I guess not many folks have read this extremely intelligent book. Merton's close readings of many giants of literature from his Christian perspective are illuminating. My personal favorite is his reading of Camus. It would  have been fantastic if these two could have sat down and spoken to one  another! While I am not into orthodox or fundamentalist Christianity, I  fully agree with Merton's perspectives, and he has nourished my  spirituality with his writing. As an English major he has altered and  illuminated my readings of these great authors. I think that this, along  with "The New Man" and His "Asian Journals" provide the  most in depth, intelligent, mature writings of Merton at the height of his  powers. Incidently, "The New Man" is largely based on his reading  of Camus and the Romantics, and he provides a perspective that is missing  from the many critical perspectives that have been offered, even up til  now.
