 This book is the result of Bohm's collaboration with Krishnamurti, which lasted for over twenty years. David Bohms background as a proven physicist enables him to explain K.'s thought to the West in a more systematic, clear  fashion that even K. could. This book was put out after Krishnamurti's  death, and so it represents the results of their collaboration from Bohm's  point of view. The implications of this analysis of thought are profound.  It out does phenomenology in depth as well as it's avoidance of the hideous  academic jargon. The only other thinker to take as in-depth a look at  "Thought" is Rudolph Steiner (see 'Intuitive Thinking As A  Spiritual Path'). This book brings a focus and clarity to a subject that  never quiet graduated beyond the experimental dialogues between Bohm and  Krishnamurti. Bohm also took the dialogue format (very similiar to  Socratic) as his methodology (see his book on communication).   Bohm felt  that Krishnamurti's greatest contribution was his ideas about the  "observer and the observed" and the nature of thought. Bohm had  already had intimations of these ideas in sub-atomic physics.  Excellent  stuff!
