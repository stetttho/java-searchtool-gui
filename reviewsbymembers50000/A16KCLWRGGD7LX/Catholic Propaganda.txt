 This book is written very well, no question about it. However, it seems designed to SCARE you into belief in God. Perhaps, Mr. Martin was told to go out and write a book to bring in new members. It certainly would not be  the first time the Catholics have tried such tactics! The book is just too  neat in the moralism behind each case. It is reactionary against "the  New Age," individualism, philosophy, and the seeking for spiritual  experinces. The Catholic-Christian doctrine is built on the premise of  randomly bestowed grace ie., we are on a need to know basis with God.  Anything beyond the acceptance of this doctrine makes you a target for  Satan and his minions. Don't question authority, don't seek to know more  than the Vatican wants you to, if you care about yr soul. Again, this is a  fully entertaining read, and SCARY! With the turn of every page you will  expect the temperature in your room to drop! Beware, this book is graphic.  The first story makes Silence of the Lambs look like Sesame Street.
