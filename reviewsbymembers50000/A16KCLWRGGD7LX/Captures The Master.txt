 Lee Lozowick is an underrated Master. I think he is criticized by many because he scares many. Out of the hand full of Guru's that have fallen from "grace" in the last 20 years, Mr. Lee is still going strong. This book is a condensed articulation of his way of teaching;  his living philosophy. What makes Lee a MASTER par excellence is his  example. He once said: "The work you have come here to do is the work  I have come here to do. The difference is, I have assumed it, you have not.  His amazing discipline is the furtile manure that informs his wit and  shining clarity. Lee's words are time bombs that will explode in your  consciousness six months later.  Whether or not this Man fits your  preconeptions of what a spiritual teacher "should" be or not,  even more so than Evander Holyfield, This MAN is the REAL DEAL.     Back to  the book. Lee clearly states his vision of the importance of such themes  as: community, diet, spiritual practice, the role of the teacher among  other important topics. Remember as you read, this Master is not a master  of rhetoric he is an exemplar of the highest degree. Not until you can walk  the kind of walk that he has walked will you be qualified to be even close  to having an inkling of where from this Master speaks. Jai Guru!
