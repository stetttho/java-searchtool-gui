 Chetanananda who is carrying on the teaching for Rudi, brings his own style to the wisdom of the east stripped of all of it's cultural baggage,   extracting a potent concentrated clarity. This is an intellectual poetic  book that is double edged in that; the insight it brings clarifies and  inspires and reveals the gunk and horror of what habitually falls out of  our awareness. His metaphor of the pendulum and acting from a place prior  to our projection of good/bad, positive/negative jarred me awake from a  place of deep slumber. This book is beautiful.
