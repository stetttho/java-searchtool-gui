 What I appreciate about this book is Lee's refusual to sugar coat his convictions. With  crazy-wise eccentric humor, and a few expletives to boot...; Lee calls it as he see's it.  A close reading will reveal that this man could care less about signing up a bunch of feel good  New Ager's desiring to avoid the dirt and crap that also are a BIG part of  the spiritual path.  "The Alchemy of Love and Sex" elucidates,  with not a little humor, the dynamics that obscure men and women from  living in a harmonious relationship, what creates dissonance and what  creates resonance. The book will prove to be immensely unpopular as it  offers no easy answers, except the obvious, that relationship is hard work.   Just try treating your mate with the respect, awe, and supersensitive  conscience that you would your Spiritual Master, or your favorite movie  star, or anyone else you want to serve and impress. Try this for the rest  of both of your lives. This book offers none of the usual rhetoric.  It was  Umberto Eco who said: "Common sense, even when true is always  vague."  In this book Mr. Lee exhibits a startling knack for bringing  the vaguaries of common sense to the forefront. John Gray's "Men are  from Mars, Women are from Venus" is rated G for commonsense Compared  to Lee's "Alchemy" which is rated X for explicit common sense. It  is perhaps Lee's unique contribution that he has retrieved spirituality  from all the  "All is One" or "There is nothing to attain,  you already are Buddha or Jesus, and instead replaced it with an overall  context of common sense. If you spill the milk, clean it up! This is more  revelatory than many of us seem to want to admit. Then again there's alot  we don't want to admit. This book admits alot, and to the extent that you  will also, then this book will admit you to it's "secrets."
