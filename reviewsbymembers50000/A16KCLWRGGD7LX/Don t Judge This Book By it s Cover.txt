 This is a good book, although it needs some updating and editing. Come to think of it alot of Lee's books do. Nonetheless, there are many pearls of wisdom, and I would argue this is one of his better books. Why a living teacher and not a dead one? The do's and don'ts of spiritual practice,  there is plenty of good advice here. "Dead Guru's can't kick  it!" How true, although I believe Franklin Jones was the originator  of the expression. Unfortunately, Franklin was a little too literal with  that one. There are plenty of original revelations here though. Reactional  Enquiry is a humorous, adaptation of Ramana Maharishi's question; "Who  am I?"  Now, It is: "Who am I kidding !  Order this book, Don't  kid yourself this is a 3000% Potent Teaching. I'd Love to see a Millenial  revised and updated postmodern cutting edge cover. Maybe with Sri Yogi  Ramsuratkumar on the cover(Hint)!
