 Thank Goddess for Christopher Hyatt. This book transcends the cultural barriers that prohibit most of us from being able to appreciate Tantra for what it is. It most certainly is NOT the stuff adverised in the back of  your local new age periodicals. This book confronts,exposes and celebrates  what we are normally conditioned to be ashamed of, via religion and  fascism. If you want to get your mindbody back and you are sick of American  sentimental baby land; where all the products we consume are substitute  nipples and gentitals...Read this book, along w/ The Psychopaths Bible,  Secrets of Western Tantra and Undoing Yourself. READ em over and over and  practice, practice practice. may you die befor you die! This is REAL  LITERATURE. Makes all the other teachers out there look like Baby Huey!
