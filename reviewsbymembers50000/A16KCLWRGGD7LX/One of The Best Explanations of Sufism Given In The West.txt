 When one thinks of Sufism in the West, most often it is related to Rumi,  or it is a very general apprehension of Sufism in a starkness that fails to  convey it's heart and reality. This book is, as of yet still not very well  known, but it will soon be very well known- because Robert Frager exposits  the teaching, and psychology of Sufism in the most complete manner that has  ever been done in the West. He is a scholar, but he is also a Sufi Shaykh,  in the lineage al-Jerrahi al-Halveti. Shaykh Frager has had incredible, and  powerful teachers in Shaykh Muzafer Ozak, and Shaykh Tosun Bayrak.  This  book contains the essence of what Shaykh Frager has benn teaching over the  years. It is all here, finally put down in book, and is fantastic.  The  language of the book is intuitive, clear, and precise. It draws one to  examine the one's self. The teachings on the nafs and the lower self are  very serious and important. This is a path of Love in action. It teaches of  the Eye of the Heart, or Intellect of the Heart as the reigning wisdom that  subdues all ignorance, and obscuration of being-It shows you how. The  spirit of true prayer is also conveyed by this book. It is a rich treasure  that once ingested will remain in the soul for the rest of one's life. This  book will prove to be vey hard to improve on. All praise to Allah!
