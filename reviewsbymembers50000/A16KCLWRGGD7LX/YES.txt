 This book is soooo clear. I felt upon reading it that I had found the words I have so long sought. This is a remarkable application of the consequenses of Nietzche's philosophy. Kaufmann has obviously done a fair share of his oun thinking over the years. In fact, it reminds me of Nietzche: "We should spend less time in relentless activity and more time in relentless thinking." Kaufmann is simply relentless!
