 Basalla has produced an absolutely fantastic overview of the history of speculation about life on other worlds and the scientific quest to communicate with intelligent aliens. He manages to top himself by collecting a series of devastating arguments that reveal the anthropomorphism that has always tainted, and continues to taint, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. (Aliens are trying to reach us with radio telescope technology? Really? Why, what a convenient coincidence-that's same technology we're using to try to talk to them!) In a scant 200 pages, Basalla manages to place the search for E.T. in unvarnished perspective as the quasi-theological longing it is. This book should be required reading for all SETI buffs.
