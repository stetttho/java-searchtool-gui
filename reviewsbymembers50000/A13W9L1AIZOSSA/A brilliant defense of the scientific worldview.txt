 Norman Levitt's name will be familiar to anyone following the so-called "Science Wars." It was, after all, his (and coauthor Paul Gross') earlier book, "Higher Superstition," that sparked the most recent  slew of battles in this war, and inspired Alan Sokal to write his notorious  hoax article for Social Text. For those who appreciated Sokal's own recent  book, "Fashionable Nonsense," but found the pacing a bit  sluggish, rest assured: Levitt is a better writer than Sokal, and even  wittier. Also, with only a single author, this book is more focused than  other recent volumes on the topic, such as Koertge's "A House Built on  Sand."  Levitt is not afraid to tread on sensitive toes: already in  the Introduction, he's put forward his compelling case that nonscientists  are almost humorously unqualified to pass judgment on the validity and  veracity of the conclusions drawn by mainstream, traditional, objective  scientific programs. If you still think, despite all you've heard and read,  that all scientific conclusions are socially conditioned, why not give this  volume a spin and try to rebut Levitt's arguments.
