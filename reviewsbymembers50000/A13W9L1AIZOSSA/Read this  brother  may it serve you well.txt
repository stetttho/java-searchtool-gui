 An astonishingly insightful, personal, and comprehensive interpretation of the Beatles mythos. McKinney successfully analyzes the special bond between the Beatles and their audience, in all of its kaleidoscopic complexity, from Quarry Men days to Apple rooftop and beyond. His organizing metaphors--including circles, holes, meat (!), and others--are strikingly original and on-target. The sections on the Paul-is-dead rumor and the dawn of the bootleg industry were especially fascinating to me. (It turns out that one bootleg song I'd always enjoyed may not even be by the Beatles at all!) Given its stance as a work of musical/historical/cultural criticism, the book is ideal for fans already somewhat familiar with the basic Beatles chronology. So glad the Village Voice Literary Supplement ran a review of this book, alerting me of its existence.
