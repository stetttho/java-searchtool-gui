 Whether you've just gotten interested in Ellison's work or have been a fan for decades (I've been hooked since 1984 when a friend lent me "Strange Wine" at summer camp), this book offers an indispensable look at both the context and substance of HE's work--the 1950s pulp markets in which he published his earliest short stories; his seminal contributions to SF's "New Wave" of the late 1960s; and the various themes that run throughout his more mature stories of the 1970s and onward. Weil and Wolfe deserve high marks for their objectivity, neither excessively praising HE's unique talents nor damning his occasional lapses. Nearing 70, HE's output has slowed in recent years, so perhaps this is the ideal time for retrospective criticism of his career. This volume aptly summarizes one of the most notable talents in the history of speculative fiction.
