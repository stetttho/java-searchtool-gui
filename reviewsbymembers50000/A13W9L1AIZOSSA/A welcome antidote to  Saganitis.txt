 "Saganitis" is a common malady suffered by the scribblers of popular science books. It is defined as "a quasireligious need to believe in the existence of intelligent extraterrestrial life, in the  absence of any facts whatsoever that would tend to support this view."   To the rescue come the authors of Rare Earth, who inject some hard reality  into the fantasy world of deluded terrestrials:  it just ain't that easy to  evolve creatures as complex as we; in fact, it may be damn near impossible.  And don't even THINK about invoking the Copernican Principle, that overused  security blanket of the Lonely Earthlings Club: yes, if we assume that our  local physical conditions are ordinary, we would be justified in inferring  that life (of whatever level of complexity) might exist elsewhere. But as  the authors show in glorious detail, that assumption is glaringly false. We  are the end-product of EXTRAORDINARY physical and geological conditions,  not ordinary ones. It's about time someone wrote a book like this.  Don't  miss it.
