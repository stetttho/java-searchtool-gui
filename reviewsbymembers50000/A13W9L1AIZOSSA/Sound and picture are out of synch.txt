 Yep, there's nothing I like better than ordering a DVD of my all-time favorite violinist, sitting back to enjoy it, and finding that I'm hearing the notes a full half-second or so before Heifetz plays them. Now Jascha was pretty good, but that's one feat he didn't intend. My guess is that in transferring this old (c. 1971) video to DVD, the tech folks at BMG either were unable or (what's worse) didn't give enough of a damn to properly synch the audio with the video. C'mon, guys...Heifetz deserves better than this. Having said that, Heifetz is still spectacular at the twilight of his career (he stopped performing in public the year after these performances were recorded).
