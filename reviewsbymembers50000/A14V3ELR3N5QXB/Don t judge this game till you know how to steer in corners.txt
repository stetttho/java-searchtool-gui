 General/Summary:  This game is GREAT so long as you turn corners by pressing down on both the brake and gas triggers at the same time - easing from one to the other - pumping them as needed.  You can control phenomenal power slide turns, 180's and so on with little trouble - and the feel of it is excellent. This is when you'll appreciate the physics system of the game... If you like arcade racing games a la Midnight Club Street Racing, Driver and Burnout - you ought to like this game. Issues? Yes. You can get caught on walls of buildings. Avoid them. You can drive through trees. AI cars in oncoming traffic purposely steer into you...if you learn the cornering technique...you won't care nearly as much about these issues because the game becomes so much more fun.  Graphics:...Good, but blurry sometimes. Not the end all but certainly quite nice. Sound: Voices are fun if you like campiness. Music is actually pretty decent techno but you won't notice that until you go to the options and crank up the music volume in relation to the engine and effects volumes.
