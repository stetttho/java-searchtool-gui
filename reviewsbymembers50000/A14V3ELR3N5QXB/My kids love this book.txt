 Rarely does my 2-year old sit through a reading of a whole book.  This one he does!  And my 3-year old as well.  They love chanting "Please, baby, please!" and the other variations of that phrase throughout the book.  The story is fun and something that both my kids and I can relate to - an adorable toddler getting into trouble.  The combination of excellent writing and beautiful illustrations make this a huge hit with my family!
