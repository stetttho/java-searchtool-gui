 Is the DaVinci Code just fiction?  On the one hand, yes, it's fiction.  Dan Brown says it's fiction and it gets shelved in fiction.  Hey, who's arguing?  But on the other hand the book is positioned as being some place between fact and fiction.  Now here we are in Barnes & Noble, perusing the fiction shelves; but look, the first page in this book is filled with "Facts".  And here's Dan Brown on tv saying his book is but a novel, yet here he is a moment later claiming the story is backed by extensive research and scholarship.  The media portrays it, along with the movie, as "historically researched," "based on historical facts," "an historical novel," "based on impeccable research" and so on.    Christianity and DaVinci Code author Dan Brown have this much in common: both claim to know the truth, both offer evidence in support of their positions, and both point to experts to back up their claims.  Both sides may be wrong.  But both sides can't be right.  Don't be duped, deceived or sold down the river by either one (or anyone else).  Look into it for yourself.  If you see the movie, then check out the reliability of the evidence.  Check out the reliability of the witnesses.  The truth is out there.  Two final thoughts:  Imagine a murder mystery in which it turns out that it was none other than your mom who did it - and, by the way, in this movie she's a whore.  But it's just fiction.  Extensively researched and biographical, yes, but also fiction.  No need to worry about mom; no one's going to believe anything that happens in any movie...  Would you go see such a movie?  Would you recommend it to others?  Or imagine a major Hollywood movie claiming that the core beliefs of any religion other than Christianity were all a big lie.  Would it get made?  Would it be treated by the media as "just a movie"?
