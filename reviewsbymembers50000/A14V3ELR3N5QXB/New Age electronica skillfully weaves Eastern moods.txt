 I've sampled about 75% of the tracks on this CD at a listening station at Tower Records.  This album reminds me of Sacred Spirits by Yeha-Noha, which took authentic and plaintive American Indian vocals and set them to a mellow ebb and flow of new age electronic strings and synths atop soothing percussion.  On Deja-Blues the theme is Egyptian (?).  I don't know exactly how to describe it.  Like the CD says, it makes you think of pyramids and deserts, but perhaps at night or deep inside the pyramid, not out in the scorching sunlight.  The electronica elements are more varied and textured than Sacred Spirits, yet without being obtrusive or distracting from the hypnotic quality of the tunes.  This is intelligent music which fans of strict electronica may think too new-agey.  It's definitey not music for dancing.  It's for dreaming.
