 Just wanted to let other parents out there know that someone likes this movie.  I understand others' compaints: especially, Ice Cube saying d*** a few times.  But if you can overlook that and you don't insist on a realistic portrayal of how kids act then you might enjoy this.  I laughed quite a bit, and I see a lot of family movies that put me to sleep.  This movie is rather like Planes, Trains and Automobiles for kids.  It also has a Home Alone/kids-versus-the-world feel to it.  I don't think kids will take this literally.  It's just fun.  And in the end Ice Cube learns the importance of family and wins the kids' respect so that they are able to let their guard down and feel safe for once.
