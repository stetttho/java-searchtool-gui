 Someone recently (early December of '99) asked whether anyone's beliefs were actually swayed by this book.  Mine were, when I read the book last year about this time.  I had been an atheist/agnostic for over ten years -  and had been seeking God off and on throughout that time.  Though I worked  at a bookstore and was daily exposed to a large "Religion  Section," I never found books that satisfactorily addressed my  questions and objections.  It was not until I met a devout Christian man  through recreational tennis that, by his recommendation, I found this book.   Certainly "The Case for Christ" will not answer all of your  questions and objections, but, as someone else here stated, it is a very  good starting point for an evidential basis to come to faith.  Read this  book; let yourself be overwhelmed by the evidence.  Continue to pursue the  answers to your questions.  You will come to the point, I believe, at which  Christianity becomes the only sensible path.  But you will find that taking  that path requires a leap of faith.  If the evidence were absolutely  irrefutable, we would effectively be coerced by God to believe in and  worship him.  That's not what life is about.  It's about challenges and the  gift of free will that allows us to accept or reject the evidence God has  given us.  The other books that helped me to find Jesus Christ are:  "Mere Christianity" by C.S. Lewis, "Can Man Live Without  God?" by Ravi Zacharias (largely about the absurdity of regarding  truth as a relative commodity), "Darwin on Trial" by Philip  Johnson, and "The Science of God" by Gerald L. Schroeder.  And by  the by, "Mere Christianity" did not have near the impact on me it  now has when I first read it before I became a believer.
