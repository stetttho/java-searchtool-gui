 I am a total neophyte in the trance world, but I've gone on a trance cd-buying rampage since I first heard Sasha's xpander at Best Buy of all places.  I now have Sasha's GU Ibiza record, Digweed's GU Hong Kong,  Oakenfold's GU New York, Sasha's xpander single, Gatecrasher Red, Robert  Miles' Dreamland, Paul Van Dyk's Another Way, BT's ESCM, Sasha and  Digweed's Northern Exposure 2 East Coast and Ibiza's Cafe Del Mar 3.   Clubber's Guide to Trance is my favorite of these, definitely.  I never  feel the need to skip tracks, there are so many great songs here.  Buy it!
