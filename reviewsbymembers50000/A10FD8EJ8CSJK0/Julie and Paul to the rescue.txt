 I can see why they call this one of Hitchcock's lesser flicks (or whatever...) but it's still good because Julie Andrews and Paul Newman are electric onscreen. It is a tribute to their excellent portrayals here that this film has won my approval. My favorite quote-- I love the way Ms. Andrews delivers that line-- "a marriage should always come before a honeymoon cruise". The best part of watching is to see the effortlessness in which Julie Andrews transmits her emotions without moving, just by the expressions on her face. It's very compelling. The other actors do not add to the value of the film, sorry to say, for myriad reasons, some were over-acting and others distracted with their ominous deliveries of what should be ordinary lines, applying too much emphasis or saying with a look what should have been left unsaid. The inescapable fact that Paul Newman and Julie Andrews are great actors cannot be masked by the failings of the supporting characters, plot line or the direction of this movie so it still gets a good grade.
