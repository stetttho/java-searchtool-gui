 Rob Estes plays a cop who is unknowingly the real Nostradamus, and ends up having to save the world from Armageddon. The plotline of Nostradamus is slim but believable for the most part and the movie is both funny and thought-provoking. The swift movement of the action to the climax and conclusion also helps to make this a drama worth watching, providing an interesting twist to the Nostradamus legend. For all fans of Rob Estes from his "Silk" days, he is still as good as ever!
