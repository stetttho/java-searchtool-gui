 Season 2 of "The Pretender" holds onto the momentum established with Season 1 and builds on it. All of the drama continues. The tale of the Pretender, 'Jarod' who is a genius who could become anyone he wanted to be but didn't know who he was, still refreshingly original. Jarod's experiences are skillfully portrayed with sensitivity by the lead actor, Michael T. Weiss. Season 2 introduces the character, 'Mr. Lyle,' played with finesse by James Denton, of current Desperate Housewives fame. Jamie Denton, as he was called then, is so convincing as the nefarious 'Mr. Lyle' that he has been avoided by people in real life because of the role! The same actually goes for Andrea Parker who plays the very complicated character 'Miss Parker,' and has had similar reactions from people in real life. (What a tribute to these performers. How can you not watch?) But unlike 'Mr. Lyle,' 'Miss Parker' is not just a one-sided person. She isn't just pure evil. 'Jarod' is very good at showing us the other facets of her character as he challenges her in ways she would never expect from anyone. Andrea Parker owns the role of 'Miss Parker' and I hope she will get to play it again at least one more time in a final "Pretender" movie. Meanwhile, I will enjoy these DVDs, which by the way, also contain one of Andrea's favorite episodes, "Toy Surprise." No spoilers here, you'll have to watch to see why! This DVD set is very definitive Pretender, perfectly crafted drama, mystery and comedy, pure and clean, classic entertainment your whole family can enjoy. A+++++++++++++
