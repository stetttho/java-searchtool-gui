 The Emancipation of Mimi, Mariah's 10th studio album is a hot compilation of searing collaborations! You have got to own this record! A virtual who's who of r&b/hip-hop royalty, featuring the likes of Snoop, Jermaine Dupri, Twista, Kanye West and Nelly, the album is literally a treasure trove of hot hits. The top 10 dance track and first single, It's Like That, is in a word, awesome! The second single is poised to become this year's prom favorite with its easy-going ballad style and Mariah's soothing voice.  "To the Floor" is an original-sounding club-hit-in-the-making that I look forward to blasting from my stereo on Friday and Saturday nights or anytime I feel like dancing. Mariah continues to display on "Emancipation..." her special genius for blending different styles to create a unique sound for her songs. This is also an album that has something for everyone, the dance fans, the ballad fans, the belting fans, this album has it all.   You have to buy this album to hear for yourself just how good all the songs are. Every one of these songs is a certifiable hit! And fyi, Mariah never went anywhere, this album proves yet again, as her last one, that she was always at the top of her game, musically. As an artist she has never stagnated or chosen to remain cloistered in a particular genre. She is a pioneer of the genre-breaking or genre-bending styles that seem to be flourishing these days. You don't know what to call it, you just know it makes you want to get up and dance! And yet, no one ever gives her credit for that. Listen to "Mimi" and get emancipated! This album is a perfect portrayal of the talented voice that charmed millions around the world from the moment of her eponymous debut to her latest hit single; and the genius artist who continues to push the envelope in bringing an original sound to the world.
