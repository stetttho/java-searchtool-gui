 The story of Joseph is vividly brought to life in this classic Continentals' performance. Cam Floria is truly inspired and the Continental singers are equally blessed. I was fortunate enough to see a live performance of this record and it was wondrous. The CD, which I bought many years later, turned out to be a re-release with all-new recordings of some of the same songs and a few new ones added; but it is no less sublime and just as inspirational. I was delighted to finally own one of the greatest bible stories magnificently retold in song. The lessons of the life of Joseph are presented in stirring performances that inspire and bless the audience.  You will want to learn these songs and sing along to the beautiful voices of the Continental singers and very soon, like me, you will know each word by heart! This cd is a must for anyone who loves musicals or appreciates beautiful and inspirational music.
