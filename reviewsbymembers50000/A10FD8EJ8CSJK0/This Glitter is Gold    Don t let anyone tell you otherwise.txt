 I can't get enough of "Glitter"! It is a beautiful soundtrack compilation with a diverse array of songs that fit the movie perfectly whatever you may think of the movie itself. This is a superb party album too because of the great mix of songs and the covered music truly rivals the originals like only Mariah can. Get this cd, it is a keeper. From the raw beginning of "Loverboy" lust to the sentimental "Reflections", Mariah gives the world a glimpse of why she is a world leader in music. True blue Mariah fans would buy this because it is Mariah, and then cherish it because it really is an awesome CD. I do.
