 Mariah Carey/MC/Mimi shines on this outstanding album which deserves a Grammy. I have been listening non-stop to The Emancipation of Mimi since I received it and I am not tired of it! Her voice is amazing, the lyrics are catchy and the rhythms enticing. I must say I'm not a fan of many rap collabos but I am enjoying all the collabos on this album. Even the bleeps where the green verbs are on "One and only" have not thrown me off because the song is so emotionally expressive that I just enjoy it completely! MC is at her expressive best on this album, which is also a little bit tongue-in-cheek and funny! And her vocals are just...Wow! I love this album so much it will be another one of MC's album that I buy in duplicate, the first one since Daydream. All but one of the songs are about love, falling in love, being cheated on, being afraid to confess love etc but who cares whether you can relate?! I wish these songs spoke about my life but I'm glad at least some of them don't! I still love to sing them out loud though! Fly Like a Bird is the beautiful exception to all the love songs but you will start loving gospel if you didn't before with MC leading the way to higher heights! Get this album today, it is a keeper!
