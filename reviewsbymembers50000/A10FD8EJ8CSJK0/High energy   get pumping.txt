 This maxi single could earn its keep with just one song- the album version of "I Know"-- but you get more 'bang for your buck' than that, and that's why this CD is definitely worth it's weight in gold ... and then  some. If you haven't heard "I Know", get it today and you will  want to play that rocking, heart-thumping rhythm over and over again.
