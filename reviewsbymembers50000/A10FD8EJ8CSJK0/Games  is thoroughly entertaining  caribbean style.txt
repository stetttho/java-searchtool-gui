 Michael Anthony portrays the island life he knows so well with consummate ease, and draws the reader into the excitement of his characters' lives. Even now I can envision the climactic race, and feel the heat of the  Caribbean sun-- Anthony's imagery remains vivid and strong long after  you've turned the last page. One does not have to be a cyclist or even a  sports enthusiast to get into this story, because it transcends those  boundaries.  This is a wonderful book for teens, and for the young at heart  -- it's a great way to reminisce.
