 I loved this when I saw it and even after watching it three times, I still enjoyed it so I went and bought it. This is a delighful comedy which anyone can enjoy over and over. Sandra Bullock is in fine comedic form here, and her stellar costars also perform admirably. If you're a fan, get it because this is one to own. If you're not a fan you may very well become one after Miss Congeniality charms her way into your heart. And of course, who can miss the chance to see Miss 'Murphy Brown' Candice Bergen reincarnate herself in her role? Lots of eye candy for the boys and timeless beauty tips for the girls. This is lighthearted fun without being too fluffy and there's an actual plot too!
