 I didn't know what to expect of the movie, which is kind of old but I must say on first looking at it, I wanted to watch it all the way to the end (3 hours later) because it was such an entertaining movie! It is great g-rated entertainment, the kind they rarely make these days. Julie Andrews will wow you with her versatility as an actress on full display in this movie and the other actors also put on fine performances. Some people may be slightly put off by the long overture at the beginning but that's why you have a skip button on the remote! Other than that this is a really wonderful story, that deserves as many accolades as that famous movie about a governess that Julie did sometime before this one (The Sound of Music!) and I'm a little confused as to why it is not as well known. Do buy the DVD because it is packed with bonus features, pictures and interesting behind-the-scenes stories and shots. This dvd is a pleaser that can entertain the entire family.
