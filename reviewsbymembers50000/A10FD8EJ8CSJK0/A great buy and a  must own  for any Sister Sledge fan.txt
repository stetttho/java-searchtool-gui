 The album title says it all. This is a definite must-own if you are a fan of Sister Sledge and a great one to buy if you aren't a fan but want to have some Sister Sledge music. It is 80s music but most of it still sounds fresh and kickin'! 'Frankie' is a favorite must-play for all retro parties even in this new millennium. You don't have to love the lyrics to get your groove on with this song! The other selections on this album are equally entertaining.
