 It's been an age and then some since I read this book but I have only pleasant memories of the story. Enid Blyton's fantasies were always fascinating and entertaining for me and the Wishing Chair stories no less so than any of the others. Enid Blyton weaves a story that transports you to a fun and fanciful place where the adventures are exciting and the happy endings always come. Perfect for pre-teens and even teens who still like their adventure tales less fraught with danger and nightmare fodder than the average Harry Potter installment.
