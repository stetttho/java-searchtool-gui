 Everything about this movie is majestic, the scenery, the music, the voices, the actors. They all fit perfectly together to produce the most beautiful sound on film the world ever heard. Time will never detract from its magic which will always remain enchanting the young and young at heart, charming its way into their souls. In "The Sound of Music", Julie Andrews is the quintessential romantic heroine, sweet and vulnerable and completely innocent. Christopher Plummer assumed the role of the handsome captain convincingly and all the women in the world fell in love with him. The children are adorable and their portrayals all realistic, with a freshness that remains pertinent even many years later. What a great Reverend Mother too! I can go on, but you get the picture (get it!) and you'll see what I mean! This is a "10 stars" film, 5 are not enough!
