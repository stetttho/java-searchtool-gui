 I am a fan of Jason, what can I say? Have you seen him in 'Days'? He's awesome, and while in this movie he doesn't get to exercise his acting skills too much, I think you will still find it entertaining. The actor who played his brother was a joy to watch...he almost stole the show...I was quite impressed! The plot is imperfect but what plot isn't. Screenplay writers have so many people to answer to. The special effects were completely low-tech but fun. I enjoyed this more than I thought I would, and I wasn't expecting much seeing that this is Sci-fi. I give it 3 stars because with a little more work, it could have been great.
