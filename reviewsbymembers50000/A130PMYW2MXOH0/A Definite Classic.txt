 Cat Stevens' "Tea For The Tillerman" is truly a classic album, and classic albums don't get any classier than this. "Tillerman" boasts three well-known classic tunes: "Where Do The Children Play", "Wild World" and "Father And Son"(probably one of the smartest songs you'll ever hear on radio), but the fun doesn't end there, as every other song on the album has the makings of a classic. Here are a few standouts: "Sad Lisa" with its string arrangment is one of the album's best songs. "Miles From Nowhere" and "But I Might Die Tonight" are terrific rockers, the latter being my favourite song on the album - a brief tune about the monotony of the working day. "Into White" has a more traditional folk sound. With these songs in mind, its not hard to understand why "Tea For The Tillerman" has been a staple in folk and classic rock record collections since the day it was released. It is my favourite Cat Stevens album, and a wonderful album at that.
