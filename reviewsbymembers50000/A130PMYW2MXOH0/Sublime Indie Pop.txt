 I bought this album quite some time ago on the strength of the song "Here's Where The Story Ends" - a magnificent song that reminded me alot of the Smiths. Thankfully, the rest of the album didn't disapoint.  The Sundays' music could best be described as acoustic pop. The masterful combination of both acoustic and electric guitar sounds is very reminiscent of the Smiths, and as a previous reviewer stated, David Gavurin is like a Johnny Marr with a less complex guitar style. The warm acoustic guitar and Harriet Wheeler's beautiful pixie voice creates an atmosphere that is almost dream-like. The lyrics are beautiful and touching in an adolescent, girly kind of way. Every song on the album is great and carries its own special charm. Notable standouts include "Here's Where the Story Ends" (of course!), "Cant Be Sure", "You're Not The Only One I Know" (probably my favourite track on the album) and "My Finest Hour".  So what are you waiting for? Get this album now! No matter what music you enjoy (except maybe gangsta rap or rap-metal), I guarantee you'll fall in love with this album.
