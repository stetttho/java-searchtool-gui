 I was literally blown over and left smiling after I had heard this album in its entirety. Where were the bad songs? I asked myself. I seemed that there weren't any! Folks, this is one of those rare album where filler is nowhere to be seen! Bragg really outdid himself in this, his second full band album, "Don't Try This At Home". The sound this time around is richer, more refined than that of his previous albums, and more commercial-sounding as well. This time Billy's band includes famous guests such as Johnny Marr (of the Smiths) who played guitar, co-wrote and co-produced a number of songs on the album, as well as Peter Buck and Michael Stipe (of REM).  As with "Back to Basics", there are far too many individual standouts on his album to mention them all, but here's some: "Moving the Goalposts" and "God's Footballer" are absolutely beautiful. Two classic folk covers "Everywhere" (featuring mandolin by Peter Buck) and "Dolphins" are equally as breathtaking. "North Sea Bubble" sees Billy returning to his punk roots. "Sexuality" packs a powerful pop punch with witty lyrics and a killer tune. "Tank Park Salute", a tribute to Billy's late father is, hands down, Bragg's finest song, and one of the most moving and beautiful songs ever written. Well there you have it, and there's plenty of variety in these 16 songs. This is undoubtedly Bragg's most accessible set of songs, and is clearly one of the best albums of the early 90's. Plus, the art in the booklet is way cool!
