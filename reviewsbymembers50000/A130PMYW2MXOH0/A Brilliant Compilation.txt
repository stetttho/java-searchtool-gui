 Billy Bragg is undoubtedly the exponent of modern British folk music.  Spanning Billy's 17 year carreer, this collection of B-sides and rarities  is an awesome addition to any Bragg fan's collection.  The songs, coming  from different stages in Bragg's carrer, are pretty diverse musically,  ranging from just guitar and vocals to the more produced, full-band sound  of his recent work.  Whereras most other artists record B-sides just for  the sake of backing up a single, Billy seemed to put as much effort into a  B-side as any of his singles or album tracks.  There are so many excellent  tracks here that I don't know where to begin. There are some biting  political rants in the good-ole Bragg tradition - the superb "Think  Again" and "Days Like These"; some beautifully sparse love  songs - "Ontario, Quebec and Me" and my personal favourite  "Scholarship Is The Enemy Of Romance"; some poppy full-band tunes  - the sublime "Sulk" and "Bad Penny"; and some inspired  covers - "Jeanne" [The Smiths], "She's Leaving Home"  [The Beatles], "The Tatler" [Ry Cooder] and "Heart Like A  Wheel [Kate and Anna McGarrigle]. A few other songs worth mentioning are  "Shirly", a remake of "Greetings To The New Brunette"  on which Johnny Marr plays all the instruments; "Walk Away  Renee", a love poem read by Billy accompanied again by Johnny Marr;  and a nice sleepy folk song, "Rule Nor Reason". If you are a  die-hard Bragg fan this is a must have, but if you are unfamiliar with  Bragg or are just getting into him, don't start here - instead start with  "Back To Basics" - it's a marvellous introduction to this much  overlooked talent that is Billy Bragg.
