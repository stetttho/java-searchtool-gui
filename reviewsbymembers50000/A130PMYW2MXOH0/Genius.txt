 "Back to Basics", a compilation of Bragg's first two albums      ("Life's A Riot With Spy VS Spy" and "Brewing Up With Billy Bragg") and the "Between The Wars" EP is the one Billy Bragg CD I find myself listening to the most. Each of the 21 songs sounds rather sparse - largely just electric guitar and rough cockney vocals, with some organ and trumpet here and there. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as the raw, spare arrangements are the perfect complement to Bragg's biting protest and heart-wrenching tales of young love.  There are far too many standouts to mention (there is absolutely NO filler), but I'll mention a few: "Richard", "From A Vauxhall Velox" and "Strange Things Happen" are pieces of perfect punk-pop. "Island Of No Return" is a bitter Fauklands War protest song. "St. Swithin's Day", "The Myth of Trust" and "The Saturday Boy" are haunting love songs, the latter featuring beautiful, medieval-sounding trumpet. "A New England" and "Between the Wars" are two of Bragg's best known tunes, and perfect examples of his unique urban folk sound. If you're a new Billy Bragg fan, this is the album to begin with. Even if you're not that enthusiastic about Bragg, I highly recommend picking this CD up. Pure genius!
