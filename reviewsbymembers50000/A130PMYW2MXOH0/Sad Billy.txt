 This isn't my favourite Bragg album, but it's still very good. It is the least political of his albums and most of the songs are about a failed relationship Billy himself had (with a girl named Mary, perhaps?). "Worker's Playtime" is also the first album Bragg recorded with a full band, including his best mate Wiggy on guitar, Danny Thompson on double bass and Cara Tivey on keyboards. The mellow, folksy sound of this album is largely due to it being produced by veteran folk producer Joe Boyd, who previously worked with the likes of Nick Drake and Fairport Convention. There is only one word for the love songs on this record: heartbreaking. If you have just suffered a break-up, I would not recommend listening to this CD, for you'll be in tears by the end of track 2. That is not to say that these songs aren't good - far from it. "Must I Paint You A Picture", "The Short Answer" and my fave song on the album "The Only One" are among Bragg's best love songs. The few political songs aren't that bad either, such as the a capella "Tender Comrade" and one of Billy's most popular tunes "Waiting For The Great Leap Forwards". This is quite an accessible album and I would recommend it to  anyone new to Bragg, or anyone who enjoys mellow, 70's style folk-rock.
