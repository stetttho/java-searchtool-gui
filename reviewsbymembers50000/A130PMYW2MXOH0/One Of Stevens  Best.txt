 "Teaser And The Firecat" was my first Cat Stevens album, and undoubtedly one of his best. This was the album which made him a household name in many parts of the world, and is also one of Stevens' most accessible albums, and there are a number of excellent songs. "Moonshadow", "Morning Has Broken"(I remember singing this one in school assembly when I was a nipper) and the calypso-flavoured "Peace Train"(one of Steven' best songs) were the obvious hits, and are among the songs that most new Cat fans like the most. Much of the lesser known stuff on the album equals the greatness of the aforementioned songs. "How Can I Tell You" is an overlooked masterpiece, and a very beautiful song to boot. "Rubylove" is a nice little folk song with a Greek flavour (Stevens even sings a few verses in Greek). "The Wind", although brief, is another excellent folk tune. "Bitterblue" and "Tuesday's Dead" are both fairly upbeat and catchy pop/rock numbers. If you're a new Cat Stevens fan, this is a worthy first purchase, and although it may not be as perfect as Stevens' masterpiece "Tea For The Tillerman", it is nevertheless a superb album.
