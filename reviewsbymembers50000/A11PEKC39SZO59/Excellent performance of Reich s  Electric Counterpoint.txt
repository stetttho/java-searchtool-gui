 This is a really, really odd collection of classical guitar (played by Reinhold Westerheide) and harpsichord (played by Annelie de Man) pieces. I bought it for Westerheide's all-acoustic rendition of Steve Reich's "Electric Counterpoint," which is a truly inspired performance. Westerheide's playing is sensitive and deliberate, and the use of acoustic guitars and basses is wonderful even in a piece that was intended to be played on electric.  The rest of the CD is hit or miss. I'm no fan of obligatory 20th century dissonance, nor of the harpsichord - frankly I'd rather have a hundred thousand root canals than listen to either for more than ten seconds - and those two elements pervade the remaining eight tracks. The one exception is the piece that Westerheide composed - another solo guitar effort, it sounds a lot like "Electric Counterpoint" redux but is pleasant anyway.  Here's a track listing, since at the moment Amazon doesn't list it:  1 - "A lady shaves her legs" (Chiel Meijering) 2 - "Dulcamera" (Roderik de Man) 3 - "Continuum" (Ligeti) 4 - "Balance" (Westerheide) 5 - "Electric Counterpoint" (Reich) 6 - "Toccare" (Bruynl) 7 - "Central Guitar" (Gismonti) 8 - "Fantango" (Tiensuu) 9 - "Micro Piezas" (Brouwer)  Originally released in 1992, or so my copy tells me.
