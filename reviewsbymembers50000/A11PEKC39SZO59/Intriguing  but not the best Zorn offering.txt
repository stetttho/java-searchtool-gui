 I bought this disc because I have and love other John Zorn projects (Naked City, Masada), and I knew of Bill Laswell through his production work and great band Material. I find Execution Ground to be full of interesting textures, bizarre rhythms, and insane drumming - plus plenty of shrieking sax, as one would expect. Although it's certainly intriguing, it falls short of Zorn's other projects for me. The long compositions seem directionless and the endless reverb and delays are a little hokey. I do like the second disc a little better, because the static feel naturally lends itself to the ambient mode, but overall I'd rather listen to Naked City or Material than Painkiller.
