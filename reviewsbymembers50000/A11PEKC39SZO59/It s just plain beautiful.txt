 I've read a lot of comments like "this album reaches deep inside the human condition, and describes the pain of everyday life." Please. We're not listening to Morrissey here. It's not whiney or self-involved. The lyrics are often nonsensical, and I take issue with people who assume they understand what they mean. Like most great art, you find your own perspective in this album as much as anything else. Regardless, Kid A has a depth, a humor, an artistry, and a *beauty* unlike any other release in recent memory. The textures are subtle, the shadings are supple, and the use of space is astonishing. Overall, an amazingly original release.
