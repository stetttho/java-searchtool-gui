 I wouldn't generally describe myself as a big metal fan. Most of it is too predictable and self-absorbed for me to take it seriously. And a lot of it that is supposed to be all super hard just isn't. Enter Meshuggah's Chaosphere. It has all the components of a good metal album: fast tight riffs, intricate drumming, thundering bass, harsh vocals and brutal screaming. But this album goes to a whole new level. The compositions are way more intricate than typical metal, introducing levels of polyrhythms that are really intense. Polymetric rhythm (i.e. playing in more than one meter at a time) is all over this album; the drummer is frequently playing in 4/4 time with the hi-hat and snare, and doing something completely different with his feet and toms. Or they frequently take a rhythmic pattern, loop it, and then add to it or take away from it to introduce new cross rhythms. And while all that is happening, you are being constantly flogged by the pulse. I wasn't really into the vocals at first, but I started to appreciate how they fit rhythmically into the mixture as well. It is an achievement to have taken those lyrics and fit them into those songs that well. Plus, the moment when he screams the word "Lies!" in "New Millenium Cyanide Christ" just kills me. So, be warned: After hearing this, other albums may just pale in comparison. It happened to me.
