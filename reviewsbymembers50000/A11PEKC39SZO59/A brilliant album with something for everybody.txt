 Flow is hands down my favorite Foetus album yet, and here's why: 1) It came from nowhere. Recent Foetus releases have been so uninspiring that I had practically written him off. Flow took me by complete surprise. 2) The lyrics are some of his best ever, e.g. these serious winners from The Need Machine: "whoever has the most toys always wins / they'll genuflect then kick you in the shins / give me librium or give me meth / I'll filter out the nutrients / and cut the rest to mix your Mickey Finn." 3) All of his masterful instrumentalism is at his peak performance. Crazy drumming. Great horn playing. The orchestral samples / performances (I'm not really sure how he gets all those sounds) are magnificent.  4) More jazz influence is always nice, and the hilarious track Heuldock #7b gives us more of that fast crazy death-swing that we want, on top of the scathing lyrical torture of some unfortunate ex (hmmmmmmm... wonder who that could be). Plus the gospel influence in "Grace of God," and the oddball bossa "Cirrhosis of the Heart." 5) The companion album "Blow" with all the remixes is also excellent and makes you appreciate "Flow" even more. 6) While I normally don't like the slow tracks so much (and here the long slow grind of "Mandelay" doesn't suit my palate), the excellent "Someone Who Cares" is a notable exception. Slow and sexy, it makes you want to drink yourself into the gutter with this poor old sod. Anyway: I see/hear many people repeat the adage that all of Thirlwell's best material is the "old stuff," you know, Ache and Hole and Nail and all that. Those are incredible albums, no doubt, and I love all that stuff. But if I wanted to introduce someone to Foetus for the first time, Flow is the album I would play for them.  Flow rules. Buy it. Now.
