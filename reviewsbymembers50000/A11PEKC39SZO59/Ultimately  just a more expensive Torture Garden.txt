 Torture Garden (included here in its entirety) is probably my favorite John Zorn offering. The amazing compositions, coupled with the stunning musicianship of Naked City, make for one of the greatest listening experiences of our time. Unfortunately, the extra tracks you get on Grand Guignol don't really offer too much. To begin with, the title track just sounds like a more boring, watered-down version of Leng T'Che - and where the latter feels like it's over too soon at ~35 minutes, Grand Guignol feels aggravatingly too long despite clocking in at about half that length.  The subsequent classical arrangements are somewhat interesting, but you have to really, really like this sort of proto-avant-classical thing that Zorn does. I suppose if you like Messiaen then you'll love the selections here; personally, he drives me nuts, so I'd rather pass. Likewise, the Debussy arrangement is creative, but ultimately much less satisfying than the original. So... I waffled a little bit about how to rate this, and I decided that since Torture Garden is already its own disc, the rating here should be for the extra material unique to Grand Guignol - which is unessential at best. Get the Black Box version instead.
