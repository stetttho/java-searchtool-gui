 Pyramid Song is a beautiful, beautiful song; however, the CD single may hold interest for collectors, but there's not much here to offer that you can't get on Amnesiac. The extra two tracks definitely sound like B-sides, i.e. tracks not good enough to make it onto an album. They're nice and all, but nothing to shout about. Maybe if Pyramid Song sported a different arrangement or mix it would have more to offer. Even so, I give it a pretty high rating - lesser Radiohead is still greater than the vast majority of everything else.
