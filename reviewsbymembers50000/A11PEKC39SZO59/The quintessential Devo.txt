 Twenty years after I first heard it, this album still makes its way into regular rotation on my stereo. This is a collection of brilliant songs recorded at the peak of Devo's career; compositionally superb, lyrically eloquent, catchy and singable. And it rocks - albeit in a robotic, highly quantized way.  Even setting aside the radio hit ("Whip It," as if you didn't know), the album has so many of my favorite Devo songs: Girl U Want, Freedom of Choice, Gates of Steel, Ton O Luv, the weirdly touching Snowball... there's not a bad song on there. What makes this album so perfect is that it keeps the weirdness and edginess of their previous albums, but adds in a few shades of pop. Regrettably, this mixture only succeeded for one more album (New Traditionalists) before they started leaning too far to the pop side of the fence. I think by the time the album "Shout" was released they had thrown away their guitars completely, which made me sad. Also, some of my favorite songs were written by Jerry Casale, whose compositions are notably absent from later Devo albums. I've always wondered about that. The original LP also had the most hilarious (or was it serious?) record sleeve - a catalog of the oddest Devo products imaginable. To this day I regret not ordering the leisure suit. I hear people compare this band with other supposed "new wave" bands, whatever that means. Two comparisons work for me - Oingo Boingo and Talking Heads. If you like them, you will most definitely like this.
