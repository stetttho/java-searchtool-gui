 I suppose it was just some bozo in marketing that prevented these dual sets from being released in proper chronological order... it would have been so much more satisfying to have Q: and Duty Now on one disc, and Freedom of Choice / New Traditionalists on the other, but whatever, such is life. At any rate, these are still two of my all-time favorite albums hanging out in one place, which is very, very good for the world. New Traditionalists boasts some classic songs, e.g. the oft-mentioned Beautiful World and Through Being Cool, and my personal favorites, Jerkin Back & Forth and Going Under; and I just adore the hilarity that is Duty Now for the Future -  from the somber strands of Devo Corporate Anthem to the rollickin' good time of Smart Patrol/Mr. DNA, this album is chock full of great songs, bizarre sounds, and more of that early, rawer (read: guitar/bass/drums rather than synth) sound. All in all, excellent music, excellent entertainment, and a great antidote to having accidentally listened to some of those terrible later releases like Shout or Smooth Noodle Maps.
