 There's just something alluring about taking a bunch of really, really, ridiculously cute-looking fuzzy animals, giving them a bunch of huge guns, and letting them blow stuff up. I mean, come on, the premise is ridiculous! Yet I'm still playing it, hours and days and weeks later. It's got a cool plot, isn't over the top with the omnipresent gore and blood-splattering [mess] (yeah, if that's what you're looking for, it ain't here), the puzzles are challenging, and the graphics are really good. The whole game has a really good humor to it, too; it's littered with wacky pop-culture mockery - my favorite is the Warhol-ish painting of a can of Pet Yums in the Quackenheim Museum.  The only things preventing me from giving Fur Fighters five stars are that the camera angles are occasionally weird (especially when swimming with the Rico character), and the music pretty much [stinks] (some exceptions, e.g. the Dinotopolis world has a jazz theme which is great).
