 "gregm_inca" enthused so much about this album that I went back and gave it some more listens. But my conclusion is still the same as when I put this on the shelf a few years ago and let it start collecting dust: Mighty Whity, Verklemmt, and Slung are great, but the rest is kinda boring and not that noteworthy. Too much of the directionless slow and grindy stuff ("Friend or Foe," "Mortgage," etc) and not very much life overall. The production is great, as is the musicianship, but that doesn't overcome the less-than-average compositions in my book. Especially when you compare this album to Flow, which I think is years ahead of Gash.  That said, the three tracks I noted above are really quite good - Mighty Whity is a shredding punk tune, Verklemmt a kinda catchy pseudo-dance-hit, and Slung is a brilliant jazz assault. They're worth buying the album for.
