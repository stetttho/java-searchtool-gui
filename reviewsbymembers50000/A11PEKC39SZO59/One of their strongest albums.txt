 An excellent album with a strong mix of styles and moods, ranging from the hardcore of "Dead Souls" and "Teresa, Give Me That Knife" to the dark and moody "Forget Your Life" and "Real Love." The music is challenging at times but still delivers a lot of energy and is a great emotional release. Lyrically this album is fantastic and eminently quotable, e.g.: "I couldn't remember my name / so I called myself Bob / it's weird being a Bob / but I'll get used to it, I HAVE TO!" Like many NoMeansNo albums the mixing leaves something to be desired - for example the drums are immersed in this annoying reverb that really detracts from the sound and performance. Not quite as bad as on 0+2=1 or Sex Mad though. For a better introduction to NoMeansNo I highly recommend Wrong which IMO is their strongest recording. But if you're looking for the next one to get, definitely get this one.
