 I'm a fan of Michael Moore. I like his politics; and though I think his humor sometimes misses the mark, more often than not, he leaves me with something to think about. That said, I don't think that Stupid White Men is his best work. With the exception of the first chapter (dissecting the Bush presidency), there's not much here that he didn't already rant about plenty enough in his first book, or on his website. And some of his rants this time around are a little silly, e.g. calling the whole recycling concept a failure because he once saw someone throw the carefully collected items from the recycling bin into a trash dumpster. I can't fault him for this, but a lot of Stupid White Men feels out-of-date since it was written pre-9/11 but published afterward. Since I bought the hardback edition, I'd look forward to reading a paperback version with some additional "War On Terror" insights. I imagine that would be very valuable. Overall, recommended for big fans of Michael Moore. Others, I'd stick with his first book (Downsize This!), and check out his website.
