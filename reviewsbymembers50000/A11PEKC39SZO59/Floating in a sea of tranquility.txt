 Beck has this great effect on me: each album he releases becomes my favorite album. I've all but ceased to listen to Midnite Vultures, one of my favorite albums of the last decade, because Sea Change is so, so beautiful. From the mournful opening guitar strums of "The Golden Age," this album intrigued me; by the time the infectious bass lines and mellow groove of "Paper Tiger" had come in, I was hooked. It's an interesting sound... mellow like Mutations, but with a funk-and-groove twist, like a scaled down version of Midnite Vultures. At first I thought I would be alone in not getting sad when I listened to this, but I'm happy to see that it's a familiar theme in the customer reviews. The lyrics are of heartbreak, but the music is uplifting. It makes you float over the emotions rather than get buried in them. It feels really odd to be singing along with lines like "These days I barely get by / I don't even try," and feel your soul soaring over the countryside like a freed eagle... but that's what this music does to me. Sea Change definitely grows on you, even if you aren't expecting it to. So if the mellowness turns you off at first - and I fully expect diehard fans of "Midnite Vultures" to feel this way - give it some time.
