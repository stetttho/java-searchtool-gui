 I first heard this when I was in high school. Its melancholy demeanor, luscious melody and intriguing orchestration spoke well to me then. Over a decade after the first listen, this disc still remains compelling. The sequence of tracks that runs from "Thais (I)" to the end of the album is fantastically beautiful; if those tracks were an album unto themselves, it would be one of the most listened to albums I own. I still have just as much fun singing along with "I Must Have Been Blind," and I still adore the cover of David Byrne's "Drugs." And the ambient tracks (too numerous to mention) are superb. I can't give it the five stars because, like the other TMC releases, it is inconsistent. Some songs haven't lasted as well and now they get on my nerves. Luckily, they seem to be crowded more towards the beginning of the disc.
