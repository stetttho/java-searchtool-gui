 I agree with others who have said this album takes many listens to get used to. It's ultimately a very rewarding experience if you invest some time in it. I'm totally baffled by how they make all these amazing noises - and that the same minds that brought us the danceable "Incunabula" are capable of bringing us this highly deconstructed, angular soundscape.  "Surripere" (track 5) is one of my all-time favorite electronic compositions. It's absolutely brilliant. Although created entirely with very cold digital sounds, it manages to convey an impressive emotional depth.   My only complaint is that certain tracks do not have much of a direction; they start out strong and then gradually dissolve into something weaker. It demands perhaps a shade too much focus from the listener to stay engaged.
