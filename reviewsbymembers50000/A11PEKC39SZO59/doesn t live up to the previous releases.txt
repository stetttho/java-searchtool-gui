 I felt compelled to write this after seeing another reviewer remark that "only some underdeveloped tracks annoy; the rest is flawless." Are we listening to the same album? Of the 5 or so people in my group of friends who are TMC fans, the sentiment about Blood is unanimous: they were trying to do another Filigree & Shadow, and fell way short. I gave it a couple years' worth of sporadic listens before finally selling it to a used store. Can't say I've ever missed it. Especially when I can listen to Filigree & Shadow and hear what this excellent band was really all about.
