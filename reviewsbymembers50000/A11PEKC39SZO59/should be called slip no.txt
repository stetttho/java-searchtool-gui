 With 688 other reviews to compete with, it's tough to imagine what else I can say about this album that hasn't already been said. But here's what drives me nuts the most when I listen to this. It's the drumming. It's just so terrible. The guy does that freakin' horrible fill down all the toms every three seconds. Or are there two drummers doing that? I don't know. The guitar riffs are sometimes nice. They sounded good blasted at 10,000,000 dB on the stereo of a speedboat that went by me when I was waterskiing, which is how I was duped into buying this disc. So I guess that's how they earned the second star. I remember seeing an interview with this band where they claimed that they used to practice something like 8 hours a day. I highly doubt that. But just in case they're not making that up, 8 hours a day is clearly not enough for these guys. I suggest that they stop rehearsing together for a while and send their drummer(s) to some private lessons. Just about anyone would do. Someone needs to teach him/them a new fill or two. Meanwhile, if you had the misfortune of buying this disc, why not drop it in the recycle bin, and go purchase something by Fantomas or Meshuggah instead.
