 This is my favorite Delerium album. It's by far the most spacey and minimalist. I almost didn't give it a fair shake because the samples of HAL from 2001 in the beginning of the first track are so obvious and silly that they make me laugh, but the other five tracks are really top-notch stuff, especially track 6 which is a very beautiful ambient piece a la Brian Eno's "Apollo" or early Tangerine Dream (but with better production). "Spheres" is not at all like later Delerium releases - e.g. Semantic Spaces, Karma, Poem, etc., when they got more danceable and added the female vocalist(s). Those more dancey albums aren't my bag - I hate the vocals and the tame, predictable beats don't do much for me. Chances are, if you like those later albums a lot, you probably won't like this.
