 A great album for both those new to Fela and those long familiar with him. There's not a bad song on here: all four tracks are infectious and danceable, with a variety of rhythms and tempos to keep it interesting and excellent soloing from Fela and the rest of his band. I think Sorrow Tears & Blood is my favorite Fela song; lyrically, it is timeless, and musically, it is enchanting.
