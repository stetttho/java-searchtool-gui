 I had listened to this album perhaps two or three times before the first track, "they," got stuck in my head for 48 hours solid. Her voice kept me awake at night crooning "I'm sorry, so sorry, I'm sorry, we do this..." It's a touching song full of depth and emotion, surprising for what could easily have been a cheesy pop album.  The other track that I love on this album is "24," with the heavy guitars. It's equally catchy. I've caught myself humming it many times since hearing it. Although some others are apparently put off by the guitar sound (which is odd because they're actually quite tame), for me they really give the song an extra lift.  On the downside, the production often sounds forced. The hyper-compressed vocal sound robs the listener of the natural beauty of Jem's voice - or perhaps is there to cover up the flaws. The fake orchestral instruments are cliched and tiresome.   Also, despite the excellent songwriting on "they" and "24," most of the rest are too fluffy for me to think of them as anything but filler.
