 This incredible album still blows my mind after ten years of listening. I can only assume that every Foetus fan has heard it by now, so this review is directed at the Foetus newbie who wonders if this is the next one s/he should buy after "Flow". The answer is a resounding YES YES YES.  This is good ol' Jim Thirlwell at his 80's peak, recording his deliciously witty, musically insane songs in some scummy studio with no sequencers or Pro-Tools or any of them other computerized falsifiers of evidence that abound these days. You have to imagine this one man, undoubtedly drunk, locked in a dark room with a delay pedal, recording the beginnings of "I'll Meet You in Poland, Baby," spending hours twiddling the delay knobs to get all those samples to line up JUST RIGHT. You gotta imagine him laying down the drum track, then the next drum track, then another and another and another... then a bass track... then horns, organ, guitar, millions of vocals - like Satan's version of Prince. Knocking off everything from punk to jazz to Iggy Pop to the Beach Boys to old school funk along the way... nothing is safe from the Foetus tirade. But as much as I love his music, the real reason why I love Foetus so much is the words. The dark humor, the endless puns, the never-ending string of witticisms - I don't know why, I just love them. Example, from "Satan Place" : "I'm knock-knock-knock-knockin on death's door / do you remember where you've seen this cadaver before / this swan song's sung on a watery grave / blow your brains out, baby!" Foetus isn't for everybody, much as I want to believe he is; very few of the dozens of people I've played him for have picked up the ball and run with it. Let's just say this: if you are looking for an artist truly out of the ordinary, truly weird, ridiculously talented, and with many, many axes to grind - then Foetus is your man, and this is your next album.
