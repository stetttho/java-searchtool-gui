 Ever since Kid A I've approached each new Radiohead release with some kind of scientific skepticism. Something in me just doesn't believe that they can keep putting out such quality work. And there's also that part of me that, while absolutely adoring the beautiful calmness of Kid A and the fluid weirdness of Amnesiac, has been totally craving a return to the intense energy of OK Computer. Well... here it is, and here it ain't. Hail to the Thief combines the electronica elements of Kid A and Amnesiac with the guitar-driven frenzy of OK Computer, and mixes in a whole new dimension of lyrical/vocal and synthesized exploration.  Things I love about this album: the blending of real drums with techno beats; the more intimate sound of the vocals; the more liberal use of vocal harmonies; and the superb energy in the more  aggressive songs - "Myxomatosis" is probably their most rocking song since "Paranoid Android."  But, the flip side is that for every aggressive song, there are two "soft-n-slow" ones - and of late these are veering away from the strong ballads Radiohead used to write, and going more in the direction of "Thom Yorke whines with guitar or keyboard accompaniment." There are exceptions, but most of the slower songs get pretty annoying pretty fast. This CD could easily have been pared down to 8 or 9 tracks without losing anything. So... it makes me a little sad, because this album seems to cement the direction Radiohead started taking with "Amnesiac" as their new sound. But the more energy-laden songs are still fresh and exciting to me, so who knows? Maybe there is still hope after all.
