 Perhaps Devo liked to think of humanity as devolving into a self parody. Isn't it intriguing, then, that the career of Devo represents a similar, though probably unintended, de-evolution in and of itself. Blame whomever you want, but ultimately, their recorded output documents a band that began as an astonishingly original, raw, flippant, creative force - and ended up as a flat and boring pop-synth act without much to say. Incredibly, their transformation from interesting to annoying took only two albums - beginning with Oh No, It's Devo, and ending with Shout. But where Oh No had a least a couple of interesting or funny songs to keep your attention (e.g. Speed Racer, That's Good, Patterns), Shout doesn't offer much. It's rife with fluffy songs, generic sequencing, and bland instrumentation. Gone are the brilliantly satirical lyrics. Gone are the witty observations on human life. Gone are the well-crafted songs with the unique blend of punk and synth. All have been replaced by songs that sound like they were written by a ghost writer. Or a terrible producer. Tragically, every album Devo released after this one (Total Devo, Smooth Noodle Maps, etc) is pretty much the same. No matter how much they milk the re-releases, they can't cover up the fact that they've totally lost the fire. Bottom line? Stick with Duty Now for the Future, Are We Not Men, Freedom of Choice, New Traditionalists, and the other older re-releases like Hardcore.
