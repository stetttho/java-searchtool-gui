 This is my favorite book on inline skating.  It is loaded with color pictures and the explanations are very simple.  There is a section on equipment which even explains cleaning and upgrading equipment.  The book begins with First Techniques for the beginner and goes on with chapers like Moving, Improving, Skillful Techniques, The Real World, Specialist Skating, etc.  The Moving and Improving chapter covers topics like parallel turns, forward crossover, slalom turns and dynamic striding.  Each lesson has clear instructions and suggestions accompanied by numbered color photographs.  At the end of each chapter is a section called Troubles that covers each technique taught in the chapter and lists Problems with Reasons and Corrections.  This is what makes the book so useful for learning new things.  The best thing about this book is how clearly it is written.  If you have just learned or want to learn to inline skate get yourself a copy and grow with it.
