 This video is very helpful for someone just learning to inline skate.  Debbie Merrill very enthusiastically takes a group of beginners through stopping, turning, and much more.  She explains and demonstrates things very simply and explicitly, with hints to get you started.  Merrill breaks things down into several steps, with drills to help you learn.  For me the video was better than a book.  It takes a lot of words to explain movements that are easier to learn from seeing them done.  I have never skated before.   From the video I learned how to use my brake, turn, and improve my skating.
