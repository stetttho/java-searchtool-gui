 I probably would have given this pot 5 stars when I first bought it a little over 2 years ago.  I have had no trouble with the whistle or the cover, and I like the design.  This pot (ebameled metal) has been used daily.  After about 6 months I noticed some rust at the spout where the water comes out.  This rust area has grown.  Now the inside is deteriorating.  Flakes of the inside coating are coming loose and it seems to be rusting a bit inside as well.  I would suggest avoiding the colored versions and going for the stainless.
