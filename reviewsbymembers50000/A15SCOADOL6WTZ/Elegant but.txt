 I bought this after my enameled kettled rusted out and chipped on the inside.  So I was looking for stainless, something with a handle that did not require a pot holder, and I was struck by the design of this kettle. It has a satin finish, a heavy handle,  and a reinforced bottom that sits well  on the burner.  I am a big tea drinker so I use it a lot and admire its design.  The problems:  The whistle is soft and does not always work.  It does not always work because the cover doesn't always fit well and steam escapes around it.  Also once it boils and you want to put up some more water the cover doesn't always come off when the pot is hot.  (My husband the industrial engineer says it has to do with the materials expanding with heat, etc.)  It is very well made and elegant though.
