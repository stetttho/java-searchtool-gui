 I am an experienced knitter and I was surprised by how much I learned from this little book.  I always followed patterns for better or worse.  This book gives you patterns but it also gives you formulas so that you can take a pattern and convert it depending on the weight of your yarn or even use the formulas, ratios really, to create your own patterns.  I learned two handed knitting for aryan designs and more.  The sweater I used following this book's formulas was a design I adapted from somewhere else and it is the best fitting sweater I ever made.    There is much more too.  Elizabeth's great comments and opinions that are funny and often thoughtful. For example I never thought about wool as a renewable resourse as opposed to knitting with a petroleum product.
