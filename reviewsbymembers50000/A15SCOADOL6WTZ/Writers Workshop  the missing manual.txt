 I just discovered this book (we have a copy in our school) and used one chapter to teach short story writing to my 6th graders.  Her lesson suggestions and reproduceables taught my students what was missing from their writing and how to improve it.  The binder contains many quotes and handouts.  They are well designed.  For example, by filling out the one on their main character, my students had the germ of a real story and were ready to write.  I had to adapt it a little, but the basic teaching ideas and structure was very helpful to me.  It helped students make meaningful changes to their own writing.
