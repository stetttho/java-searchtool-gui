 This easy to understand book is good for writers of all ages.  I have used lessons from this book to help my middle school and high school students improve their writing.  Fletcher concentrates on specific aspects of writing, like leads or characters, and uses simple but powerful examples that implicitly show students how to improve their writing.  If you are using a workshop class, many of his ideas lend themselves to effective mini-lessons.
