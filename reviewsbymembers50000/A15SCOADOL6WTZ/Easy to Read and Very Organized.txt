 Pros: While this manual is not as complete and technical as the phone-book size Missing Manual (Pogue), it is very detailed.   It is written in language anyone can understand with many clear screenshot llustrations.  I think it would be an excellent book for someone who is very new to Apple OS X.  I have been using Macs for more than ten years.  I bought this after using OS X (and now Jaguar) for over a year and I learned how to take care of some annoying things and also how to use many things I didn't know I had.  It is laid out as 24 chapters (thus the 24 hour title) clearly named in the Table of Contents so you can easily find what you are looking for.   The chapters end with a summary and a helpful Q & A section that often covers troubleshooting questions.  These are followed by Workhop (practice), Quiz questions and Activities. Almost every option from the file menus of every program is defined in simple English as you learn about the program.   Cons: Some of the programs have been updated either with Jaguar or with downloads and these latest features or options aren't covered.  As I said before it is not as technical as others, i.e. you will not find sections on Bluetooth.
