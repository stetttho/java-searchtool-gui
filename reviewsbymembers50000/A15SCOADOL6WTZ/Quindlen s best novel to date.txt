 This is a simple story, revealed in an unforgettable way.  The pacing is steady, the characters complex and unusual, and the writing even more beautiful than in Quindlen's previous novels.  In this story, which could easily become overly sentimental, the author explores her characters motivations and their pasts, what things have brougt them to the movents where they intersect with such precision and, at times, surprise.  For me it is these  understated truths and reflections that make this book so memorable.  This book will resonate with me for a long time.  I am only sorry that I finished it so quickly and cannot savor it longer.
