 I have gone through many more expensive fancier tea kettles and this is my favorite. For many years I made coffee with a Chemex pot and now I am a tea addict.  This kettle does its job very well.  It has a large flat bottom that heats water up very fast.  It has a reliable whistle that is attached so I don't misplace it in my kitchen or burn my hands using it. That is handy for me when using an electric stove which doesn't cool down instantly.  It is easy to rinse out with no enameled inside to corrode over time.  We use one regularly and neither me nor my husband who has large hands have any problems with it.
