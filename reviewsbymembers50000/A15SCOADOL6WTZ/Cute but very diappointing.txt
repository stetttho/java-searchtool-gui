 I am using the iTrip made for the old model of iPod.  I have found it very difficult to get good sounding music on this thing.  I am used to using the iRock (a battery version with only 4 stations) for long drives.  It works much more reliably and the sound quality has been excellent.  Even when the iTrip works the sound is often distorted at normal volume-- noises from base and unclear sounding.   When I drive really far from even a small metropolitan area the sound clears up, but I have much better reception with the iRock.
