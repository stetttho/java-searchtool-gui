 This book is a collection of very short illustrated fables and stories.   Some are folksy and some have more contemporary situations.  I used them in  beginning and intermediate esl classes in middle school, but I would  recommend them for older students as well.  They are followed by some  excercizes that are simple and reinforce comprehension and vocabulary. The  excercizes vary but they include cloze paragraphs and putting events in  order. The illustrations are simply drawn and my students copied them and  did retellings after each story. These stories are simple but can lead to  class discussions on many levels.
