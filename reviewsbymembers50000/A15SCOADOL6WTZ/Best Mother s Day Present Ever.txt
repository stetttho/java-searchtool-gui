 There are two kinds of people in the world: Those who have an iPod and those who don't know what they're missing.  It's small, it;s light, it's very easy to use, and the sound is incredible.  I did order a leather case (online) which protects it and has belt clip, etc.  You can even use it in a car with a tape player and an adapter (about $20) for a cd player.  The battery holds a charge a long time.
