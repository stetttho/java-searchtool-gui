 Finally a Star Trek film with a bit of ooomph! Ok its not the only good one, but Nemesis is a great one.  The space combat is great, the story has a couple predictable but interesting plot twists one sort of resembling ST 2 and 3. There are a few areas where the plot seems to not make sense, or that the characters make or dont make logical decisions or reactions, but if you can suspend your disbelief enough to over look them, the story will grab you and suck you in.
