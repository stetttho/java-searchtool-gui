 I had never seen this movie before (I grew up in the 80's too), but after seeing it pop up in a couple of list mania lists, i thought I'd check it out. The movie is really well done for its time period, although the majority of the music chosen for the film doesn't age well. James Spader plays a sort of underdog hero role in this film compared to some of his other teen oriented 80's films where he's the antagonist.  He's new in town, and foils a mugging that is taking place.  This sets him up as the target for the local gang.  Which is pretty much what half the movie is about, how the gang wants to get him, and how he foils their attempts.  The other half is the budding romance of Spader and Richards.  Kim Richards plays the gang leaders girl friend and slowly falls for Spader.  Downey has a few small appearances, but barely seems like he's in the movie.   The story is very predictable for the most part, but is still fun to watch.   I would say buy it if you like 80's, teen or underdog movies.
