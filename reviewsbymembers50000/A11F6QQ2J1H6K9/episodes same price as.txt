 Ok, the folks at HBO publishing are getting greedy.  Season 5 was only 8 episodes.  So in HBO's infinite wisdom they decided to charge us fans the same list price as a 24-episode season, with no extras worth mentioning.  (However they do split it up onto 2 DVD's to make you think you're getting more for your money.) While the shows are great I have to ding this season with 3 stars because of the blatant disregard for loyal consumers.   In season 5 we have Carrie being free and single, Miranda dealing with the baby and Steve, Samantha dealing with Richard, and Charlotte in life after Trey.   If you're a junky/collector I guess you'll end up purchasing it like me, otherwise send a message to HBO and just rent it.
