 I was hoping for a game like 11th Hour or Fools Errand.  This game is more arcade like, but the puzzles are fun.  Turns out I'm liking the game more and more as I play it.  I do get tired of shooting the ghosts that come at you from all driections, I've got plenty of shooters to do that.   The basics of the game are that you are hired by the good ghosts of the mansion to get rid of the evil spirtis.  You go from room to room solving puzzles in order to capture free spriits that allow you to gain access to other parts of the mansion.  Along the way evil spirits and creatures attempt to do you harm.   The graphics and sound are very well done.  Its easy to just pickup and play a room, save and go do other things, or you can sit for a few hours and work the game.   Definitely worth a rent, but good puzzle games are so few and far between, give it a purchase so we can all enjoy more titles in the future.
