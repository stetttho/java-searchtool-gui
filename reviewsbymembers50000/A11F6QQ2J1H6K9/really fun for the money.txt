 I'm a little lost why everyone is bashing the heck out of this title.  It only costs $10 folks, and its worth it.  The game is fun and simple.  There are plenty of different modes to play and lots of things to unlock.  Basic play is rather easy.  Despite what people say, there are differences in the cars from year to year.  for example, a 67 will out run a 63 in a straight line.  If the cars were all the same, that would be impossible.  The older cars have awful brakes just like they did in real life.  The c5 a re fluid and graceful and the c4's are chunky and tempermental, just like in real life.  (i've owned a c3, c4 and c5)  The graphics are pretty nice, and the tunnel vision at 100mph is a nice effect.  The courses are pretty good (although there are some that i dont care for).   Dislikes: 2 player mode makes you race the same era of cars. dirt and pavement traction is fairly similar.  physics aren't too real, but close enough for fun.   The game could be imporved upon without a doubt, and if it was I'd pay the normal $50, but in this case i only paid $10, and I feel that the game is a great value for the money.  I dont need a clone of GT3 or NFS or anything else.  i have those and if i want to play them i will.    lastly, the most humorous defect i've found so far:  When in 2 player mode, if player 1 wins, then player 2's car will not have any engine noise.  You still hear tires screaching and wind noise though.  rather funny.
