 Well there are two stories to this movie, that sort of tie together.  As you may assume from the title, an underlying theme in this film involves letters.  While this isn't addressed too much except for the first story, the theme is present durring the film. The first story deals with a woman who has moved into an apartment and how she deals with what she finds out about it, and its previous occupant.   The second story is that of a man who is invited out from the UK to stay with a family in the US who is hosting a woman from Bosnia (I think it was Bosnia).  Anyway, he is brought out in hopes of marrying her so she doesn't have to return home to a war torn country.   The acting is ok, the film is rather low budget, and there are no extras on the dvd (in fact there are no chapters as the movie in whole is 1 chapter).  This stories are slow, and a bit depressing.  So why 3 stars do you ask?  Well I'm biased a bit.  I'm one of the uncredited pool players in the second story.  My little claim to cinematic fame.  :) If you like stories that tie together, or have an interest in seeing some seens from the bay area in a movie, or just want a inde sort of film, check this one out.  Otherwise, it probably won't do much for your interests.
