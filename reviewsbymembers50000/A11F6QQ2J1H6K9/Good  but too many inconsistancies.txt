 Bond a prisoner for over a year?  Nope, sorry not going to accept it.  Cars 12 feet apart can't hit each other with a plethora of weapons.  Oh ya, and they never once suffer a bit of body damage.  Given that, Die Another Day has plenty of bond gadgets and girls and all around fun.  Not Pierces best bond, but enjoyable for those action movie nights.   The movie had a couple instances where it could have ended early, but bond being the licensed assasin he is chooses to not kill his target, but instead chooses to lengthen the movie.  Fire the director and try again.
