 Well, first off let me say I loved the PC versions of Heroes.  This is what I hoped for in the PS2 version.  I was very unhappy with this game.  The graphics are pretty, but it limits you to the troop types and quantity your hero can round up.  Also, as mentioned in another review the only resource is gold, so you can't use a market place to make your life easier.  Combat is very well done with the exception of dead troops getting a counter attack.  I also like that you can pull troops from a garrison.  However don't go over your control limits of troops  as they will go insane and kill off the rest of your troops.  I stopped playing it after 2 attemps to have fun.  3DO if you are reading, you should have RENAMED this title so as not to confuse it with a great game series.  Borrow a friends copy before wasting ....
