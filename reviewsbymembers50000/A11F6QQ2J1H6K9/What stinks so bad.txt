 Its St. Anger by Metallica. What happened with these guys.  They used to know how to play.  Now they are just raking money in on their past success.  I was truely excited when I heard they were comming out with a new cd, but imagine my dissappointment when I heard it.  The drums sound like buckets and paint cans, the vocals are just plain lousy, James stop trying to sing, you've lost it.  The lyrics are stupid and unbelivabley repetative.  Someone said the songs were disjointed.  Now that is an understatement.  There are little snippits which sound good, but then they decide to go and make it sound bad shortly after that.  I would give it 0 stars, but that isn't an option.  I'd rather listen to Brittney Spears than this cd.  Heck even Barney sounds better.
