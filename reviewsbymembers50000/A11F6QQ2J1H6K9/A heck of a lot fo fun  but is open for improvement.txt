 The perfect flight combat game?  quite possible.  For those of you who want to climb in the cockpit of a historic warbird and just fly around a blow enemies up, this is the game for you.  Flight is easy, and not realistic.  The sounds are great, and game play is excellent.  Why only 4 stars then?  The game has lots of room for improvement. Dislikes: 1: There are no instant action ground attack missions or gun turret missions. 2: You can't always choose your preferable aircraft for every mission.   3: Wingmen are reletively useless. 4: Auto targeting doesn't always pick the closest enemy to you. 5: In the menu there is a greyed out "Bonus Missions" I'm guessing you have to unlock these, but I'd like to know how.  It isn't mentioned anywhere in the book. 6: There are only 15 campaign missions  (yes a few are multiple mission missions, but you can't save in the middle so really they are just really long multiple objective missions.) 7: Not all secondary and bonus objectives are presented to you at the start of the mission.  You have to pause in the middle of the mission to see your objective listing. Likes: 1: You don't have to know how to fly to fly these planes. 2: The background music is perfect, reminds me of the Battle of Brtiain soundtrack. 3: The storyline is fun and the films add a lot to the game. 4: The missions progress in difficulty and variety 5: Addictive game play Definitely worth purchasing if you like air combat games, and jsut want to blow things up.  :)
