 How is it that all the other SNL dvd's have comedic clips and this one is a documentary?  And its not even funny!  This is just to cash in on the success of the individual performer dvd's.  The dvd is actually 2 documentaries, and neither are really worth watching since they are the same thing really.  I think they had two runner's up and just put both on the disc.  The remaining members of the original cast and crew  talk a little bit about what it was like doing the show or what it was like working with comedian 'X'...   Save your money, or if you must have this, buy mine please.
