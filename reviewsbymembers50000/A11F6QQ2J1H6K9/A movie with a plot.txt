 It so rare to come across movies with an actual plot these days.  If you are in the mood for a legal drama without the courtroom battles, this is for you.  Timothy Bottoms is great as Hart a 1st year law student finding out the hardway what it takes to succed at Harvard.  John Housman is phenominal as the Contracts professor who is as hard as they come.  Excellent story, and some humor.  The obligitory love spiel is ok.  I like Lindsey Wagner, but its flighty at best, and semi detracts from the film.  So with a complaint, why did I give it 5 stars?  Because the movie earned it.  Its gripping from the start, and holds you to the end.  Very enjoyable.
