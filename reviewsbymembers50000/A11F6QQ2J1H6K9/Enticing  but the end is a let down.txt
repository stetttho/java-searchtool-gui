 I really enjoyed SCiFi channels Dune, so I was very happy to see Children of Dune.  The story is quite gripping, and the return of actors makes it all the more enjoyable.  The sets are the same quality as Dune.  I think where the problem lies in this is that they put two books into this 4.5 hours of film instead of making it two movies.  The build up is great, but without giving away the ending, its not as exciting as it could have been. Acting is good, characters are believable.  If you like a good story, and are a Dune junky then you should get this movie.
