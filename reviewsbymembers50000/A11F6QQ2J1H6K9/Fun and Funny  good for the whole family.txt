 One of Harland Williams best films (hard to find a bad film of his).  The only bad part of the film is that it isn't out on dvd. The basic plot is a con man is released from prison and runs into a couple thugs he owes money to.  A series of events leads him to hide out as the new Headmistress of an all girls prep school, while he trys to con the schools main benefactor out of half a million dollars.   Shawna Waldron is excellent as Beryl, a neglected teenage girl who thinks her father has forgotten her.  The interaction between her and Harland is very well done.   The jokes in the movie are clean and humorous.  Definitely a movie worth owning.
