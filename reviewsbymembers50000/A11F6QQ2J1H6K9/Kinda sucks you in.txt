 Well the marketing department did their job.  The cover is a joke.  The only thing that is accurate about that is the actors names.  The movie is slow, but at the the same time, you kinda get sucked into the characters.  The acting isn't great, but at the same time, you can suspend your disbelief.  A woman is taken for a financial ride by a crooked garage.  With the help of some friends (in the last 15 minutes of the 85 minute movie) they get her money back.  Bad karma affects the bad guys, and the good guys have a drink.  No special effects.  The only sports cars you see are parked.  Yes, I bought it hoping for some chase seens, but ended up watching the movie because I wanted to see how it ended.  Rent it if you want to see a fair drama, buy it because it's inexpensive and has Lili Taylor in it, or pass it by because its not the Gone in 60 secondsish style movie you thought it might have been.
