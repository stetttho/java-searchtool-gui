 When I first read about this game, I was really excited as i loved the old microprose Pirates.  I was hoping for something similar.  I was skiptical when I read some of the negative reviews for the game, but they kind of focused on the 2 player portion (which is lame).  I'm glad I bought it.  The graphics are ok nothing spectacular, but the play is fun.  There are two modes, ship and captain.  In ship mode you sail around fighting other ships, and attacking forts.  There are multiple ships to buy (kind of wish you could capture ships you attack) and the bigger the ship the more power and strength it has.  Gun fights are fun, and you definitely need strategy for the forts.  (I like to turbo by them and blast them with the supershot).  In captain mode, you are running around islands fighting pirates, crabs, skelitons, and who knows what else looking for treasure.  The combat is pretty good, but not great.  The camera is better than most, and fairly easy to control as you move around.  I like how the game lets you have every item in the game, but limits you on how many.  What I would add to make this a perfect game:  Capture ships, cargo and guns.  Be able to sell excess cargo.  Better directional control when jumping.  Be able to ignore the enemy ship explosions.  Zoom view so you can plot attacks better.  HOwever, the game is very addicting, easy to play, all in all a good purchase.
