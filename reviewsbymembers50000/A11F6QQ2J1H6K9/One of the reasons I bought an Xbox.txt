 I Loved 4x4 Evo, so naturally i wanted to try version 2.  Finally had an opportunity to purchase an xbox and well this game is darn cheap at costco so what the heck.   The game hasn't changed too much from the first version.  Now teams are available which is a nice toucha nd the cars and track list is increased. The same gripe I had about the first game still applies though.  When you purchase an upgrade the computer automatically gets it.    If you are winning races and thus earning money, shouldn't the computer have to do the same?  Essentially, the rule of thumb is only mod your truck to things you need to be a bit more competative, but not to make a monster truck. Once you have everything you'd want in a truck, the computer is sure to beat you. Where this game really shines is in two player mode.  Computer can't cheat this way, and its just you and a buddy beating up a couple of trucks.  Lets face it, its pretty fun to beat up your own SUV and not have to worry about repair bills. The fully open courses also make the game very fun.  In free drive mode, you can practice the courses, and plan for the short cuts which are mandatory if you want to win some races. Definitely worth the price I bought it for...
