 And we're not talking dragonflies!  I don't think they beta tested this game at all.  Unlike the PS1 games, this one is loaded with flaws. I have only explored 2 worlds besides the main world and the game has frozen twice, the sound has vanished, and some monsters weapons extend beyond the horizon and through walls. Annoyances: You have to hear the name of each dragonfly you catch, and Spyro always says "Hey it's:..."  (could be a tad more diverse) Can't skip intro production credits. Load times take far too long. There should be an option to turn off the auto help.  I dont want to be stopped constantly in the early levels and be told how to do something I know how to from previous games.  If this is your first Spyro game, then turn that on. Lastly, it plays slow. I give it 2 stars because when you do get a chance to play, it is fun, and brings back the enjoyment of the previous games, but it is too painful to play. Nice new features include new breath weapons. Some well thought out puzzles. The game could have been a lot better.  If this is your first Spyro experience, you probably wont be as dissapointed (except for the bugs).  Rent it, see if you like/tolerate it.
