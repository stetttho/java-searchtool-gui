 If you enjoyed those 'Choose your own adventure books' when you were a kid, or your kids read those now, and you like fantasy, this dvd is for you. As far as games go, its very simple.  You watch a small cinematic and then choose what you want the group or character to do from a given menu of options.  Thats really it.  Don't expect more than that. The graphics are pretty.  The characters personalities are sorta campy, but all in all a pretty good effort. Supposedly there are 990+ combinations of stories.  I have not, nor will I ever see them all.  However, that isn't such a bad thing as I can come back to this DVD time and time again and the story will probably change every time.   Its a nice thing to have for game night as it provides a short break from what ever games your group normally plays.   If you like to watch movies more than once, and enjoy choose your own adventure, this is a great dvd for you. If you expect gripping combat and lots of action, this will not do it for you.
