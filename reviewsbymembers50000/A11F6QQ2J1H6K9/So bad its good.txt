 For all the folk that were expecting a bargin basement movie that you'd never heard of to be top quality, well, um, you better have a rethink on your expectation list. Now about the movie.  Its totally unrealistic.  The premis of the movie is that you have two world class car thieves, a super car that doesn't require gasoline, and two uber-rich and powerful evil guys who don't like each other much.  One wants the super car, the other is well, you'll have to watch to find out. The cars in the movie are beautiful, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Aston Martin, Lotus...  That alone is worth the lost cost of the film.  Throw in Femke and well thats a bonus.  Yes the movie is stupid and silly, but its also fun if you approach with the correct mind set.  This is a B class movie so dont expect much.  Given that, enjoy the show.  It really isn't a bad movie for sheer stupidity level.
