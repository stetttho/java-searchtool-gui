 This selection consists of nearly 2,000 pages of some of the best drama of the English Restoration, through the Glorious Revolution, and into the Georgian Period.  The editors break up the works into categories, which are not always appropriate and are sometimes biased.  The bulk of the book, however, consists of the works themselves along with brief introductions to the author and the play.  The following plays are included in this selection:  "The History of Henry the Fifth" by Roger Boyle, First Earl of Orrery "Tamerlane" by Nicholas Rowe "Lucius, The First Christian King of Britain" by Delarivier Manley "The Unhappy Favorite" by John Banks "Lucius Junius Brutus" by Nathanial Lee "Cato" by Joseph Addison "All of Love" by John Dryden "The Fair Penitent" by Nicholas Rowe "The London Merchant" by George Lillo "Marriage a la Mode" by John Dryden "Oroonoko" by Thomas Southerne "The Conscious Lovers" by Richard Steele "The Committee" by Sir Robert Howard "The Man of Mode" by George Etherege "The Rover" by Aphra Behn "City Politics" by John Crowne "Love's Last Shift" by Colley Cibber "The Way of the World" by William Congreve "The Beau Defeated" by Mary Pix "Love at a Loss" by Catharine Trotter "A Bold Stroke for a Wife" by Susanna Centlivre "The Old Troop" by John Lacy "The Careless Lovers" by Edwards Ravenscroft "The Country Wife" by William Wycherley "Friendship in Fashion" by Thomas Otway "A True Widow" by Thomas Shadwell "Sir Anthony Love" by Thomas Southerne "The Beaux' Stratagem" by George Farquhar "The Beggar's Opera" by John Gay "The Princess of Cleves" by Nathanial Lee "The Lucky Chance" by Aphra Behn "The Relapse" by John Vanbrugh "Polly" by John Gay "The Rump" by John Tatham "A Fond Husband" by Thomas Durfey "Venice Preserved" by Thomas Otway "Amphitryon" by John Dryden "The Author's Farce" by Henry Fielding "The Belle's Stratagem" by Hannah Cowley "She Stoops to Conquer" by Oliver Goldsmith "The School for Scandal" by Richard Brinsley Sheridan  I recommend this book to Restoration and early eighteenth-century students.  Theater troupes looking for unique plays may find this collection useful as well.
