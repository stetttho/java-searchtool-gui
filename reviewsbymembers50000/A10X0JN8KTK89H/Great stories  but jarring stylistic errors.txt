 Mary Gaitskill's stories are very vivid and edgy.  Nothing is taboo for, especially sex in all of its sweet, perverted, and confusing forms.  I especially enjoyed "The Girl on the Plane."  It is a triumph for a woman writer to empathize with a certain kind of man, a chauvinistic type that is not at all a stock character.  The man on the plane is very real and very present in society.  I believed Gaitskill's portrayal of him.  Ironically, I am not so convinced about her portrayal of women.  I did not appreciate the flippant, sex-crazed, selfish women in "The Dentist."  I didn't believe them for a second and thought the work belonged as an appendage to a cheap romance novel.  On the whole, there is some good work in this collection and it is worth reading. Stylistically, Gaitskill needs some work.  She tries to dazzle her readership with misplaced high-brow language.  Believe me, she does not get away with it.  She will have a character speak colloquially, and then have them think with exotic and thesaurus-like words.  This inconsistent voice makes the reader stop and wince for a moment, thinking that the author is trying to write above the characters and, sadly, the reader.  Her writing is so gritty and in-your-face, but it is softened and often made artificial when she shows off her knowledge of the English language.  Again, great stories, but please let the characters dictate the voice, not the author.
