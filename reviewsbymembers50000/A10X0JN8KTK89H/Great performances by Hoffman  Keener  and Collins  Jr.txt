 The success of this film relies heavily on the performances of Philip Seymour Hoffman as Truman Capote, Catherine Keener as Harper Lee, and Clifton Collins, Jr. as Perry Smith.  This film is a dramatized biopic of Capote's relationship with convicted killer Perry Smith, which leads Capote to write In Cold Blood, arguably the first nonfiction novel.  I admit that I initially thought Hoffman was mocking Capote's sexual orientation and effeminate mannerisms.  But Hoffman was very true to the real Capote, and as the movie progressed, I believed Hoffman's performance completely.  Keener gives an understated performance as Harper Lee.  She is at once Capote's companion, fellow author, admirer, and mother figure.  Given that there are long periods in the film when Lee is not with Capote, Keener's ability to make Lee's influence on Capote felt is a credit to both Keener and Hoffman.  Collins, Jr. nearly steals the movie.  His complex performance as Perry Smith hits every emotion perfectly.  The chemistry between Collins, Jr. and Hoffman is spectacular.  Although Hoffman is the film's star and Capote was certainly a self-centered man, the viewer believes wholeheartedly that Capote would sympathize with Smith and even fall in love with him; thus, it's very appropriate that Hoffman lets Collins, Jr. take control of pivotal scenes.  Capote's proximity to the subjects of his work challenges the "nonfiction-ness" of In Cold Blood, but no one can say that the novel isn't a book of truth.  Likewise, the viewer of this film perhaps comes away somewhat confused about the moral character of Capote, but this in no way detracts from the truths about Capote in this wonderful film.
