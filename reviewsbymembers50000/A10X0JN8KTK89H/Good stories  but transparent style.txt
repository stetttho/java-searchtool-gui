 Eathan Canin does a wonderful job of presenting a variety of perspectives in this collection.  I especially liked his empathy for the elderly in the title story and "We Are Nighttime Travelers."  His older characters are very active, still struggling with love and identity, and most importantly, Canin makes them believable. There are a number of stories in this collection that are not believable, they seem to end inappropriately, or the events become far too predictable to satisfy a modern reader.  "The Carnival Dog, the Buyer of Diamonds" comes to mind.  The narrator has too much power in this story, and in other stories as well, and the characters become stock and their movements boring and inevitable.  This particular story centers around a conflict between an aging, gruff father and a son who does not want to subjugate his father.  We've heard this story a million times, about how a son defeating his father at something becomes the saddest day in the world for both parties.  The son in this story prevents such an ending, but it feels forced and unwarranted. The story "Lies" may as well be John Updike's "A & P."  The similarities are too perfect. Overall, this is an easy-reading book.  The title story, "We Are Nighttime Travelers," and "Star Food" are the most satisfying, but the others are passable or mediocre at best.
