 Smart comedies are often relegated to the cult bin or even the bargain bin because they lack a universal quality. _Amelie_ has the ability to appeal to everyone, to transcend any language barrier (the film is in French and comes with subtitles). In the end, the film is a different kind of romantic comedy for all of those reclusive nerds out there who live in their own world and are itching to join the outside.  _Amelie_ features some wonderful, playful music using instruments that U.S. movie watchers may not be familiar with. The film is decidedly French, with its exaggeration of colors and tonal hue and variety of different camera lenses.  (On a side note, the film is likely the source for the sudden commercial use of the gnome imagery, iconography, and branding.)
