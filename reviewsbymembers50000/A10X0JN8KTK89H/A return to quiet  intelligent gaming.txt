 General/Summary: While I haven't yet finished the game, I have gotten a good taste of this game's brilliance. The graphics are quite beautiful, and the full 3D view grants a realism that previous Myst titles lacked. The story intrigues, the puzzles puzzle, and the game simply emits a wondrous atmosphere. Myst III tends towards what true gaming should entail: detailed visuals, subtle and accurate sound, intelligence, and a well-developed narrative. Gameplay: The gameplay is quite simple and rightly so. Myst III revoles around the point and click method of gaming. The game attempts to alleviate the potential boredom of wandering around in circles by allowing the user to remove the pretty fade in/out screen transitions and "zip mode" to sections of a given area quickly. Bear in mind however, stopping to at least look at the roses is a large part of the experience of this and many other adventure games. My only complaint is that the mouse doesn't tell the user where the user CAN'T go on, say, an island. This may sound like a strange grievance, but I'd like to know the places I can't go, so I don't waste my time clicking all over the screen--when I'm stuck on a puzzle--in search of a place I haven't yet explored. Graphics: The lighting is marvelous; the colors are vibrant, and the exquisite detail is truly wonderful to behold. Sound: I enjoy subtle ambient music and effects. The music's frequency of play can be adjusted to accomodate the user. Overall, the sound is excellent.
