 This collection will expose you to not only some of the best short stories by Anton Chekhov, but some of the best stories ever written in any language.  Chekhov's sense of mood and characters overrides his need to provide a predictable plot.  He is the forerunner for America's beloved Hemingway, Raymond Carver, and may others in between.  People may criticize some of Chekhov's Romantic devices and tendencies, but no one can deny the exactitude of his writing.  His work is simple and does not rely heavily on existential characters and events, creating a timeless air. For writers (and interested readers), there is an appendage of letters that Chekhov wrote to friends about writing.  His advice is so right and simple that you'll wonder why your favorite author, or even you, didn't think of them first.  Chekhov turns out to be a rather arrogant guy, claiming he never spent more than a day on a story and that his only job was "to be talented," but that is part of his charm.  He is the link to modern fiction that is often forgotten.  Buy or check out this book.  It is a must.
