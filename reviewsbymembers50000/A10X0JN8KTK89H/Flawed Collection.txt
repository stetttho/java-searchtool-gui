 There's no reason why these plays need to be randomly strewn throughout three different volumes.  For example, why would someone split up Sophocles' Oedipus Rex, Oedipus at Colonus, and Antigone?  They should all be a part of the same volume.  These paperback books themselves are of decent quality and fairly priced, but some of the translations and introductions are 50 years old!  There are more complete and organized collections available, some by the same editors of these books.
