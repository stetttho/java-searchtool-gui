 Bag of Bones is a mixed bag, indeed.  Alongside Stephen King's wonderful talent for composing appropriate and surprising metaphors is his overuse of writers as characters.  The writer-writing-about-writers game is a tired and self-indulgent practice, but King persists with this characterization even when it doesn't work.  Like many of King's later works, Bag of Bones needs to be edited down.  King essentially tells two stories: One is about a struggling writer who has lost his wife, and the other is about a ghostly mystery.  Both stories interpret the book's title differently, yet King forces a bridge between them.  On a positive side, readers of Bag of Bones do get two novels for the price of one.  There's no doubt that King is a good writer.  His proliferation is immense, so he is bound to hit and miss on occasion.  Bag of Bones is one of those blends of hits and misses.
