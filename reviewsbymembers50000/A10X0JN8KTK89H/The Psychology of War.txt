 Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket is one of the greatest wars films ever made.  The film stands with and apart from Kubrick's anti-war films, Paths of Glory and Dr. Strangelove.  Full Metal Jacket takes its subject seriously.  It's not interested in sensation and artifice; rather, the film is interested in the young men who train to be killers and go into other countries to do terrible things.  To claim that the film doesn't have some element of anti-war theme would be disingenuous, but the psychological reality of war is darkly documented here.  It appears that Kubrick lifted and borrowed from sources other than the novel The Short Timers, on which the film is based.  Familiar elements are given new life under Kubrick's wonderful direction.  I am somewhat annoyed that this version is full screen and not wide screen.  Other Kubrick films from this collection were not even re-mastered (the video of the 2001: A Space Odyssey DVD was very grainy).  This version of Full Metal Jacket appears to have been re-mastered, but go for the wide screen version if you can find it.
