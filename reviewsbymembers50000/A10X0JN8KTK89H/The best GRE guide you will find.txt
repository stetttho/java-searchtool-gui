 This is by far the best GRE preparation guide.  That does not mean it isn't without faults.  For example, anyone endeavoring to use this guide should start early.  There is a lot of information here, and it will take you at least a few months of review to get it all down pat.  Unless you have a lot of time to devote to GRE preparation, I do not recommend getting a bunch of guides.  The strategies you need to be successful are generally the same.  The biggest difference among most of the guides is the vocabulary list.  You won't find a better vocabulary list than the one in this guide.  The trade-off is that you may find slightly better math reviews in other guides.  Despite the great book, the CD-ROM is not to my liking.  It does not accurately replicate the real GRE experience.  It's far too easy.  The same goes for the free sample test at www.gre.org.  It's like no one wants to admit that the test can be somewhat challenging.  Look at the CD-ROM only after you are confident about your GRE abilities.  And take the resulting scores with a grain of salt.  You know how prepared you are better than a silly computer program.  Note: The version of the guide that I have still contains the analytical review.  The last time I took the GRE (October 2005), there was no analytical section.  This has been replaced by a writing assessment section, which basically consists of responding in writing to some highly, highly boring scenarios in 45 minutes.  Good luck on your GRE!
