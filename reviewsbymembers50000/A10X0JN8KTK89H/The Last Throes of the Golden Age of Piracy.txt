 Marcus Rediker wonderfully recreates the world of the late 17th- and early 18th-century pirates through a variety of historical sources and documents.  He attempts to explain what a pirate was, who tended to be pirates, and why someone would go "on the account" (turn pirate) in the first place.  Rediker explores the role of gender in piracy.  Most pirates tended to be men, yet Rediker devotes an entire chapter to Anne Bonny and Mary Read, two of the few known women pirates.  Race was likely not as important an issue to pirates as class, working conditions at sea, and respect for the labor force of professional sailors.  Rediker also investigates the surprisingly advanced systems of government aboard successful pirate ships.  Rediker's style is relaxed and not at all pedantic.  He has a great command of the topic and steers it expertly.  Some readers may detect that the author sympathizes with the pirates too often.  Yet Rediker is careful to explain that many pirates were indeed bad men while others were once state workers, and when they were no longer needed, they were dubbed pirates and villains of all nations.  I recommend this book to those interested in the period and in the history of piracy.  Rediker's other books are great as well, and you may want to look into Peter Linebaugh who sometimes collaborates with Rediker.
