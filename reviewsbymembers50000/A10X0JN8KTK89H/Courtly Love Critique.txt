 Like The Romance of Tristan and Iseult, The Lais of Marie De France offer the reader more than the literal.  There is high emphasis placed on the symbolism of animals.  There are dead nightingales, weasels that know the secret to new life, a jilted werewolf, and others.  The lais and Tristan and Iseult were written during the same time period, as evidenced by the lai entitled "Chevrefoil," which retells one of the closing scenes in The Romance of Tristan and Iseult. Most of the lais follow the courtly love tradition, but often with a twist of the opposite, especially in "Eliduc."  Courtly love challenges the institution of marriage and other social conventions.  It examines the problems that arise when people fall in love: selfishness, disloyalty, and violence. I do fear that there is a lot lost in the English translation.  The lais were originally long French poems, but the translation is presented as prose.  However, where the music of the language lacks, the consequences of the work remain.
