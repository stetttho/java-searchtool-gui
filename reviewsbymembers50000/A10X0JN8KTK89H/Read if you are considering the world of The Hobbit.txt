 I approached The Hobbit at the age of 25.  Never having read anything by Tolkien and being recently uninspired by the overrated trilogy, I decided to read for myself--what's the big deal here? The Hobbit is not a comfort book for me.  Since I didn't read it as a child, I don't have fond memories to draw me back.  I can, however, somewhat empathize with those who do read and re-read this charming tale. The Hobbit takes the reader on a trip over wide landscapes, mostly from the perspective of a gentle nobody, Bilbo Baggins.  Tolkien works hard to reveal characters as different types of people.  Hobbits, Dwarves, Wizards, Dragons, Trolls, Goblins, Eagles, Wolves, Elves, Spiders, and Humans all represent some type of human condition.  The young reader of The Hobbit will not realize that he or she is quite possibly being exposed to every type of person he or she will ever meet.  Let us thank Tolkien. Tolkien gives the same breadth to the landscapes of adjacent but strange lands and the inhabitants therein.  The land fits into Tolkien's environmentalist sensibility very pointedly.  That is, this isn't a purely fantastical story--neither is the Lord of the Rings Trilogy--and that's what makes Tolkien's work so wonderful.  Like C.S. Lewis--they were friends, in fact--Tolkien is able to pour morality, politics, philosophy, and spirituality into his works without mocking or tricking the reader. If you have not read The Hobbit, please do.  You'll enjoy the trip.
