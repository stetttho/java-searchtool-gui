 Here is a complete English translation of the Tristan and Iseult Romances that we have been able to find.  That in itself makes this book a valuable work of literature. What I enjoyed most about the Romances is the unreality of it all.  You feel like you are somewhere else, somewhere magical and vicious, somewhere beautiful and bloody.  This is the setting for the courtly love traditions. I also enjoyed the challenges the books presents: Is there repressed homosexuality between King Mark and our hero, Tristan?  What can Tristan's dog teach human beings about loyalty and love?  What issues exist in a world of both love and violence, and why are the two so closely connected? This is a great social commentary as well as an entertaining Romance.  While the text reads quickly and seems simplistic, there is a lot going on under the surface.
