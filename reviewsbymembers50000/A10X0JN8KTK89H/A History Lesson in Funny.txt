 Plautus is an important Roman comedian, because he preserves Greek works (The Swaggering Soldier is a re-telling of a lost Greek play, Alazon, or The Braggart), and he shows us some of the similarities between ancient Greek and Roman senses of humor, which are not far from contemporary Western senses of humor.  Plautus also influenced other great playwrights.  For example, The Brothers Menaechmus is generally considered a simpler template for Shakespeare's richer The Comedy of Errors.  In this selection, one will encounter some of Western society's earliest slapstick comedies and humorous, moral critiques of undesirable human behaviors.  Plautus' penchant for wordplay is also showcased in this text.  Plautus' plays are very easy and quick to read, and this 1965 translation definitely has a modern sensibility to it.  For example, you will find that Plautus' characters like to cuss a lot, generally at the expense of women.  I recommend this book to readers of ancient Rome and readers interested in the history of the stage.
