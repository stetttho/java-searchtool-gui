 I find it difficult to properly address the broad spectrum of writing in Lydia Davis' Break It Down.  There are traditional stories like "Story," "What an Old Woman Will Wear," and the title story as well. There are complex, compact, and hauntingly accurate micro-stories like "In a House Beseiged," "What She Knew," "The Fish," "City Employment," and the chilling, "The Mother." Last, there are strange mind trips like "Liminal: The Little Man", and "French Lesson I" that challenge not only the art of writing fiction, but also expand and stretch the meaning of words and language.  Davis tries very hard to get the reader to understand her complex thoughts regarding the liminal, the barely persceptible.  She also guides the reader through a French lesson, where at the story's end, non-French speakers will understand the story in French.  It's mind-boggling. I give her four stars, because many of the stories miss their mark.  There are either too contrived, or they are not at the level of the rest of the book.  I would prefer to give her 4.5 stars, as she most assuredly deserves it.
