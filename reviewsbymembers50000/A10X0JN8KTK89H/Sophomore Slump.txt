 It's too bad, really.  I had hope.  But I simply don't see the need for this film.  The questioning and yearning of the first film is what made it so wonderful.   The sequel tried so hard not to be a smattering of special effects, but it failed.   Most of the characters in the first film were asexual.  Cipher, the Judas of the group, was the only really libidinous character from the first movie.  His desire was portrayed as evil, and so he was killed (Mouse was killed, too for manufacturing the woman in the red dress).  Yet soon into the sequel is an uncalled for orgy; likewise, Trinity and Neo are all over each other.  These kinds of inconsistent thematic movements from the first to the sequel ruined the film for me.  The changes were not at all interesting. This sequel also relied too heavily on telling rather than showing.  Remember the first film and the emotion in Morpheous' face when Neo asked him why his eyes hurt?  He looks sadly at Neo and tells him that he's never used them before.  Story, plot, emotion, etc. were well mixed in the first film.  Yes, the first film imparted much information to the viewer, but all of us felt like Neo: New to the ship and new to the real world, we needed an explanation.  The sequel doesn't have this grace. Despite some fun fight scenes, this was a mediocre film.
