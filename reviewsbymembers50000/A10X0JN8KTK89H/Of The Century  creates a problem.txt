 I respect and totally understand that this is the editors' choices of the best stories in America from 1915-2000.  Notice that there is no Salinger, a writer Updike did not appreciate.  There is also very litte meta-fiction.  For this, many reviewers dislike the book. However, I commend Updike for presenting a collection of stories that not everyone already knows.  People wanted to see "The Lottery."  Why?  Everyone knows it.  I wanted to see Salinger's "For Esme-With Love and Squalor" or "A Perfect Day for Bananafish."  But why?  Everyone knows those stories already. Granted, I'm generalizing a bit, but I think Updike and Kenison did a great job of finding stories that may not be known yet needed to be read.  It was probably a terrific headache to have to say "No" to many excellent stories.  I don't blame Updike and Kenison for that.  This is not the definitive anthology and reviewers need to quit treating it like it is.  This is a taste of our country, and with that in mind, it does its job, with or without our favorite stories.
