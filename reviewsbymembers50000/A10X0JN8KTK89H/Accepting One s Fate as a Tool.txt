 Other reviewers have remarked that the lack of description hurts the novel's quality, but they do not give Orson Scott Card enough credit: He offers the young reader ideas and action sequences in a loosely detailed, futuristic environment and asks you and your mind to fill in the details.  This is important for young adult and children's literature, and Card should be commended.  Nonetheless, the motivations of the characters in the Wiggin family are categorical and un-dramatic.  Peter is the smart, evil one, Valentine is the smart, kind one, and Ender is the smart and balanced one.  This symmetry is central to the characters' actions and is quite forced, especially Valentine's weakness (because she's a girl?) in the face of people whom she knows (because she's smart) are trying to deceive her.  Ender plays the part of the tool in this novel.  He is even informed by another character that human beings are, in fact, tools when humanity "needs them."  Instead of a smart child being used to cure a disease, advance art and philosophy, or lead the world by example, the child is recruited to engage in a pre-emptive war campaign.  The description of Ender's psychological turmoil is accurate, indeed; it's the description of a young mind being impressed upon and made less innocent by adults.  I do wonder if the novel at large argues for a nave and barbaric just war theory via hindsight as well as blind fear of the unknown Other (the Buggers).
