 I've grown tired of first-person shooters.  You run around, kill things, get a bigger gun, and kill things some more.  Max Payne doesn't let you get away with that.  Yes, you run and around and kill things, but this game runs deeper. The story is quite intriguing and gives the player some narrative reason to keep playing.  The story is narrated and presented in the form of stills from a graphic novel--very nice. The voice acting is superb and the sounds are accurate and subtle.  Having a good 4.1 or better speaker system is a must. The graphics are gorgeous and graphic.  The faces of the characters are very realistic and expressive. Bullet time: This may be the game's crowning feature.  Think The Matrix, where Neo dodges a few bullets.  You can do this on a regular basis in Max Payne. If you want a game with stellar graphics, an intelligent and nicely developed story, great sound, and you want to kill things, Max Payne is for you.
