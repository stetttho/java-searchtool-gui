 That's the most imporantant thing when attempting a story, a poem, or even an essay.  Write what you know.  Few people have been able to accurately portray war (something this author definitely knows) through the art of story telling like Tim O'Brien.  Your stomach will twist when you read these stories, but you'll know it is true. Perhaps the best work in this collection is "How to Tell a True War Story."  This is not a traditional story, rather it is an ambitious essay concering the art of telling stories.  You will learn what writers do, how they get away with what they write, how they know what will appear as true and why it matters.  There is a lot of information for writers and readers in between the lines, between the didactic lessons O'Brien offers about telling stories and the wonderful narrative.  This book is worth getting for that essay alone.  No one should write another word without having read it.
