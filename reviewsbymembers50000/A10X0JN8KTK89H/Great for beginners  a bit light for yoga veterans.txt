 The best part of the Yoga Zone series is the level of instruction in how to perform the poses.  Alan Finger and his crew understand that mere observation and vague, vapid monologues about relaxation and breathing do not sufficiently explain yoga poses and practices.  Yoga Zone instructors do point out how yoga can lead to inner harmony and abstract notions of spirituality and being, but the majority of the series is spent telling and showing you how to perform yoga safely, emphasizing that yoga is not about competition with others, but with the self.  Some instructors are better than others, and some routines feel like repetitions of other DVDs.  I am writing this introduction to all of the Yoga Zone DVDs I own.  The following pertains to this particular DVD.  Yoga Zone's Conditioning and Stress Relief is a great starting point for beginners.  You can do this routine for a long time before having to move to different routines.  The main reason for this is that the full and modified forms of the poses are quite different in their levels of difficulty.  My main complaint is that the DVD is not longer.  The routine needs an extra ten to fifteen minutes.  Not enough time is spent on releasing the muscles in your neck, hips, and groin, which are generally the seats of the most stress.  I find myself pausing the DVD to perform extra long neck and hip/groin poses and exercises.  Yoga Zone founder Alan Finger leads this routine.  He comes off as a little pretentious and corny at first, but if you ignore his delivery you will find that he is excellent at explaining how to do the poses, including proper breathing.  This is especially important for those new to yoga.  I recommend this DVD for beginners to yoga and for those who desire a lighter routine.
