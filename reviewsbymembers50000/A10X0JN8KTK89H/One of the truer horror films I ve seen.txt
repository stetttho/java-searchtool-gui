 The horrors of addiction and the death of dreams fill this intense tale.  The film shows how so much of everything we do can become an addiction, an unhealthy and even dangerous routine if we put an unrealistic focus on impossible, materialistic dreams.  The breakneck visuals concentrate the brutal honesty of the film.  In the hands of a less talented director, the visual techniques would have appeared more like a music video and less as a narrative.  The score of the film consists mostly of variations on the same piece of music.  The haunting remixes accurately represent the film's dark mood.  If you respected this film (it's hard to "enjoy" a film such as this), you may like Darren Aronofsky's Pi as well.  Be sure to get the director's cut of Requiem for a Dream.  There is no reason to belittle this film by pretending that its subjects are only rated R.
