 Not nearly as bad as the horrid second book in the Diablo series, Legacy of Blood at least has some semblance of a plot and the narrative seems to properly motivate the characters.  The main problem in the book is redundancy of description and constant recounting of key events.  Richard Knaak also tends to get lost in detailing every little thing that happens.  He clearly does not trust the reader to understand anything without being beaten over the head with explanation.  And using chapters to flip between groups of characters is a device that gets old fast.  I fail to understand why female characters of this genre need to be represented as big-breasted, near-prostitutes.  While I understand that only adults are supposed to have access to this book, clearly the book is written for teenage boys who fantasize about perfectly formed, sexualized women.  I would be much more interested in the female characters if they were treated with an ounce of humanity.
