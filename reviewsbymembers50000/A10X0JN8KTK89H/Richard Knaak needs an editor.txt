 I would like to point out a passage that is particularly terrible: "The blade severed the upper part of the fiend's torso, but that upper portion still managed to wrap bony fingers around the upper part of the weapon's shaft" (p. 319).  This book is filled with such linguistic gems.  There is no excuse for this kind of writing making it past an editor and onto the shelf at the bookstore.  The story is mildly entertaining, but I found myself wanting it to end at about page 100.  I think Knaak's plots would work well if the number of pages and unnecessary descriptions were cut way back.  So much of this genre exists in the mind of the reader, but Knaak does not trust his readers to think for themselves on any page of this book.
