 Where to begin?  Hmm, Mel Odom successfully butchers (an important word in the novel, which he beats over your head repeatedly) the English language into horrible adjectives and misplaced modifiers.  Prepositional phrases galore!  And if you like to actually picture the story in your mind, Mr. Odom makes sure you are disoriented, as he cannot for the life of him describe spatial relationships.  And the ending being tacked on was just crap, but that's ok.  I was more entertained by "Go, Dog, Go" and "See Sally Run."  Don't buy this book.  Stop the unending flow of tripe in genre fiction.  It doesn't have to be this bad.
