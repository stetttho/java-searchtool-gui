 Or so says Stephen Blackpool.  Like many of the Hands (factory workers), Stephen Blackpool feels stuck in a life of mediocrity.  He and others like him are trampled by the Mr. Gradgrinds and Mr. Bounderbys of the world... Hard Times is Dickens' critique of just how evil capitalism is at its heart.  Before modifications of capitalism (like sexual harassment laws, child labor laws, civil rights, the 40-hour work week), commercial life, especially factory work, was dangerous to not only the body, but the mind (some would argue that this still is the case).  And when someone wants out of that life, it isn't always as easy as walking away. Dickens also criticizes the Gradgrind philosophy of Fact, Fact, Fact!  There is no pleasure found in Fancy or imagination according to Mr. Gradgrind, and Gradgrind drills this into his students and children.  The results of his philosophy do not surface right away.  However, soon his daughter lapses into indifference, his son rebels and becomes a selfish thief, and a student of Gradgrind's (Bitzer) shows the coldness of Fact, Fact, Fact. The symbolism is often blatant and comical (such as the name of one teacher, Mr. M'ChoakumChilde), but there is also some very disturbing criticism (reality will take a "wolfish turn, and make an end of you") that still gives me the chills. Also, there is a mass of scholarly criticism that rivals the novel in length, a very nice addition. This is truly one of Dickens' great works.  It is just as powerful as "A Tale of Two Cities."
