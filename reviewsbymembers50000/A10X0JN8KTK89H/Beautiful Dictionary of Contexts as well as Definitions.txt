 The Oxford Spanish Dictionary, Third Edition is wonderfully bound, and the presentation is beautiful.  The system of bold, color, and italicized fonts helps the user locate information quickly even though the font size is quite small.  The dictionary also contextualizes most definitions so that you have the meanings in different situations and grammatical constructions.  Some may find this annoying if they only want a definition of a word.  The problem is that in translation, context matters much more than set definitions.  I applaud Oxford for realizing the importance of context and phrasing in the formation of word meaning.  The second half of the dictionary translates English into Spanish with the same degree of care for context.  The version I purchased (just the hardcover dictionary) comes with pronunciation software but no electronic dictionary.  You'll have to pay extra for that.
