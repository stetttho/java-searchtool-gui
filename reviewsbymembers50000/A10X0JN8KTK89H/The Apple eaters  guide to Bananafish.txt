 J.D. Salinger knew us all with Catcher in the Rye.  He knew our teenage mannerisms and our hypocrisy, our feelings of dejection, our moments of euphoria and the times when no one understood. In Nine Stories, Salinger travels to other areas of the urban psyche, the other phases we all pass through but don't always realize or understand from a distance.  In this collection, he writes about men and women experiencing mid-life crises.  He reminds us about the mental corruption to which experience inevitably leads by providing a dichotomy of innocent children.  Salinger's incredible sympathy for childhood and adulthood is amazing.  You'll wonder if you've been an Apple-eater most of your life, why the Bananafish seem to know more about what's important than you do, and you'll have to make a decision as to whether you can continue living your life as you always have...Salinger is that good.
