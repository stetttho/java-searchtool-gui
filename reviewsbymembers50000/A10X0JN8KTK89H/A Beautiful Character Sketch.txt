 Lantana sheds a specific plot in favor of entangled characters.  Reminiscent of The Ice Storm and other such dramas exploring regret and poor decisions in life, the film does not uplift or even attempt to lie to the viewer.  That is not to say that Lantana is not without morality; honesty maybe the film's most admirable quality. Some may find Lantana uncomfortable and too attuned to the dregs of human relationships, but it's the constant reminder of the complexity of tragedy that keeps audiences aware of others' feelings and perspectives.  As with The Ice Storm, the film allows characters to do what they will, for good or evil or something in between--the something that most people experience.  In the depths of dark characters doing dark things, something good--even if it's only a lesson--must bloom.
