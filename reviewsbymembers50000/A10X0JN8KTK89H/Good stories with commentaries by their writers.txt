 Ann Charters has done a wonderful job of compiling a variety of great works of short fiction.  There's Oates, Chekhov, Borges, Updike, Bierce, Carver, Cheever, and MANY others. There is also an extended amount of commentary on the works themselves.  You'll read about Flannery O'Connor's "Reasonable Use of the Unreasonable," John Cheever's "Why I Write Short Stories," and more.  You often get a candid response from writers about not only their writing, but other writers as well.  It is a very nice touch. Before each story, there is a small biography of the writer, often informing the reader about the origin of the story that follows. Last, the appendices to the book are quite good as well.  They cover the basic "Elements of Fiction" and "A Brief History of the Short Story" as well as a glossary of literary terms that are handy for students of short fiction and helpful for those simply interested in the technique behind the art. The book doesn't pretend to present everything about short fiction, but gives you a taste for the good stuff out there.
