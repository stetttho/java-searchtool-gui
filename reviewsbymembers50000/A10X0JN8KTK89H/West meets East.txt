 Unsurprisingly, one of the best westerns once again comes from anywhere but America.  Like "The Man With No Name" trilogy, "The Searchers," and so on, this anime concerns America's fascination with the cowboy, the frontier, the sidekick--with a dash of some sexy women-and mixes it with some Generation X cynicism, eastern mysticism, jazz, blues, rock, and funk.   I am new to anime yet I found this film Romantic (with a capital "R") and its characters seductive and full of charm.  The movie doesn't add anything new to your life; rather it reawakens your old impulses of feeling young and immortal, dark and vigilant. Whenever we see live action movies of this caliber, they are generally horribly acted and embarrassingly cheesy.  The medium of anime at least has the chance to tell these types of stories, much like a graphic novel can.  If you are new to anime, this is a good place to start to see what everyone has been watching.
