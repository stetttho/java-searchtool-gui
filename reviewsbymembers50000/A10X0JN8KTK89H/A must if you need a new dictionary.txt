 I write a lot of papers, and sometimes I am not able to access Merriam-Webster's website.  So, I need an accurate and up-to-date dictionary and thesaurus on my computers.  You can install both the dictionary and thesaurus, and they only take up 28 MB of disk space combined.  That way, you won't have to use the CD-ROM.  Very nice.  The dictionary itself is great as well, perfect for college students and anyone who values the English language.  Also, it is cheaper than a lot of the other larger and cumbersome dictionaries out there.
