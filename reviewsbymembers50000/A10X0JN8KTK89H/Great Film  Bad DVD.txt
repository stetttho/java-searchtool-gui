 Since there is no way to properly sum up the greatness of experiencing this movie, I would like to point out how terrible the DVD version is: The video is grainy, shakes, and the resolution is unacceptable for a DVD.  It reminds me of a rental VHS tape that has been played a few too many times.  The trailers are presented with more care and respect.  This is not at all a tribute to Stanley's work. The audio was digitally remastered which does add something to the experience.  We can be thankful for that. Overall, I have to recommend the film because of the vision and philosophy it contains, but the anniversary edition on VHS looks much better.  This is a movie that is very much dependent on the visuals to understand what is happening.  The DVD version fails in this regard.
