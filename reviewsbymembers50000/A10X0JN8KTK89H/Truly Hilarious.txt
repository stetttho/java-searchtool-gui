 The Day After Tomorrow is clearly a comedy being marketed as a disaster movie.  The film has the appearance of being heavily edited down; for an epic, world-ending disaster, you need at least a two-hour movie.  The film presents a dark look at how helpless humanity is in the big scheme of things and how our petty lives and culture mean nothing to mindless Mother Nature.  Yet anyone with any iota of meteorological knowledge knows that disastrous weather does not happen this quickly.  And the way water and ice behave in this movie is truly ludicrous.  And what if it did happen, and just as The Day After Tomorrow portrays?  What could we do against a world where the laws of nature cease to exist?  The end of the world (or nearly so) is either a tragedy or a comedy.  Judging from this film, it would be hilarious, indeed.
