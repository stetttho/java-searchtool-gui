 The issues revolving around a dead mother, a single father, and a handicapped son are treated with careful grace in this film.  The adversity the characters triumph is more personal than the creatures of the deep.  Learning to love as well as let a child live life despite the danger is powerfully difficult for many parents.  I also enjoyed how DeGeneres' fish wasn't exclusively comic relief.  The movie would have set a conflicting tone if the forgetful fish didn't find a way as well (I'm staying vague so as not to spoil the film). The dangers of the deep are so well personified.  I love when the movie is able to stop and let us get to know the sharks and the sea turtles yet still keep the feeling that the story is moving.  The subtleties of plot are as beautiful as the scenery. It's difficult to write happy stories.  This is one of the best ones I've ever encountered.
