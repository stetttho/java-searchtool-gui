 George Sand's Indiana dramatizes and explores a wide variety of concerns in the nineteenth century with a brilliance one rarely finds in a first novel: Arranged marriages, what it means to be a Creole, colonialism and plantation profiteering, slavery, the beginnings of the deterioration of Old Europe, and the rise of the businessman.  In terms of narrative style, this may be one of the most unique novels I have read.  The use of narrator to facilitate multiple endings is ingenious as well as baffling.  Once you get to the end and discover who the narrator is or could be, you will likely want to re-read the novel, and voila!  It's like experiencing the novel for the first time.  It is a very rare talent indeed to create one novel for a first reading and a second novel for a second reading.  It's a mystery to me how Sand has lost much of her notoriety.  This novel is far superior than most you will find anywhere and in any language.
