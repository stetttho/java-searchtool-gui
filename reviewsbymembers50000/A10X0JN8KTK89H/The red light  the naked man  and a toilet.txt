 Self Storage ranges from a Croatian family in America, to men and their baseball, to cars with red lights that keep coming on, to the well-crafted title story that offers commentary and philosophy on the materialistic accumulation of "stuff". Mary Helen Stefaniak's sense of character, tight and unwavering language, and especially voice, make her writing very pleasing to read.  She offers a nice blend of entertainment, intelligence, and humorous observations in every story. You'll be telling your friends about Staramajka, the naked man, you'll empathize a little more with your grandma, and you might rethink your life a bit when you step back to look at your own self storage; Stefaniak's writing is that powerful.
