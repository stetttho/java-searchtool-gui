 Garbage is garbage.  People don't go to MacDonald's in search of nutrition.  They do, however, expect their food to be devoid of feces and bacteria and viruses and human body parts--it's not asking much.  Fast Food Nation is a much-needed update to The Jungle.  Schlosser documents his book nearly every step of the way, and the times when he appears to stray, one senses that he's not far off. I won't quote any of the extraordinary facts from the book.  Please read it for yourself.  In the first part of the book, you'll get to know the history of the fast food industry as well as the commercialization of the United States in general.  Then, you'll find out how the food you most often eat is made, processed, and grown.  The book should anger and frustrate you and compel you to write to your local and state congressional members. One complaint I have about the book concerns its distractedness.  In extended efforts to tie seemingly unrelated ideas--for example, the complex relationship between General Motors, fast food, California, and the interstate and highway systems--Schlosser sometimes leaves his ideas for far too long and returns to them out of breath and laboring to rally the point. All in all, there's no reason why I should not recommend this book.  It's the truth about Happy Meals and most of the food that people in this country consume.
