 You know there really are a lot of wonderful new writers out there today.  And I, for one, am thankful for that!  I get so bored with the same ol' same ol' by the writers of yesteryear with nothing new to say.  For the most part the more seasoned writer becomes boring after awhile.  It seems to me like they change the characters names and a few other (small) changes here and there and then...YOU GET THE IDEA, RIGHT? New talent like Ms. Johnson is such a welcome change for heavy readers like me.  I loved this story and have little doubt anyone who reads it will love it as much.  I promise you, buy the book, you won't regret it!
