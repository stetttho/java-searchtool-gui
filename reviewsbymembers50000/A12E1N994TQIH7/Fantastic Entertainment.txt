 'CH' by one of the best writer's out today (Christy French) is such a wonderful book!  I love it!  The characters are very real and the plot was anything but predictable!  I laughed until my side hurt at some of the fun stuff the ladies club calling themselves 'WAR" got into!  GODD STUFF!!! If you want to read something worth while then look no where else this is the BOOK to purchase!
