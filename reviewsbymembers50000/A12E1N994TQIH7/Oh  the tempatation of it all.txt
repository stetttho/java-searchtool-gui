 WHAT A FABULOUS ENDING TO THIS FUN FUN SERIES!!! I was glued to this book from the on-start and held completely captive until the last page had been read, reread and read one final time! I really hated that the Lambert series ended!  I will miss Nouri and Company very, very much! Thank you Ms. Murray for such a terrific time!  I will be waiting for your next book to come out!  Just hope I don't have to wait too long!
