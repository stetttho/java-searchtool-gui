 I have had so much fun lately discovering the many talents of some of the new writers out today.  Mr. Morris has written such a wonderful story.  Very entertaining!  I will add his name to my ever-growing new list of writers to be on the lookout for!  If you haven't read this book yet, buy it, you'll be glad you did!
