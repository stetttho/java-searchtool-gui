 the 3rd book in this MUST READ Romantic Drama Series left me wanting more!  I swear!  From beginning to end this talented writer had me hooked on her fabulous on-going soap opera! I love Nouri and "HER" men...and I love the way the storyline is unfolding! I look forward to the final in the series with a lot of eagerness!!!  I am a LAMBERT FAN !!!
