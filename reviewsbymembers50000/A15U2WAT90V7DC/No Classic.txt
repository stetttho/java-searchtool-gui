 Unfortunately, this band sounds a lot more like Robert Schneider's other band than Jeff Mangum's.  While not as sickly sweet as most Apples in Stereo stuff, it still lacks the edge and toughness to be great pop.  And of course, it's needlessly "challenging" with all the random sounds and beeps and whatever. I think this band and the Apples (see Her Wallpaper Reverie) put that kind of stuff next to their conventional songs because they are trying to make up for the fact that their songs are a little too bubbly and sugary to be taken seriously.  You often end up with the worst of both worlds- lightweight pop and unlistenable noise.  I believe that Elephant Six produced many fair-to-good albums, a whole bunch of garbage and just two unquestionably great albums: The Coast is Never Clear and In the Aeroplane Over The Sea.  Consider this a good one, but make sure you have those two before wading into this one.
