 Exactly what America needs! A completely earnest and wholly unquestioning history of a highly controversial figure!  All you historians and biographers out there: Peggy Noonan is here to show you the way.  Don't do any research! Never question the Official Line! Just pick your favorite person and tell the world why he/she is wonderful! As fine a piece of journalism as any Soviet-approved history of Stalin, approved by the Politburo.  If you haven't been following Peggy's literary career for the past few years, I'll sum it up for you: Ronald Good, Hillary Bad.  Thanks Peggy, now we're on our way.
