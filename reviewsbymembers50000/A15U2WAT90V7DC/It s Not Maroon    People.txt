 Anthropologists should study the reviews to this album.  It is a hilarious snapshot of what happens when worlds collide.  I love to hear from revolted MTV fans who don't have any idea what to make of this band.    The truly negative reviews are clearly split into two categories:  Top 40 fans who blundered onto this after buying ther John Mayer and Maroon 5 albums and longtime MM fans who are offended by any hint of commercial success.  I think they're both wrong.  For the first group, I have little time.  There's a whole world of music out there for those of us who find VH1 and MTV irrelevant.  I'm sorry you didn't enjoy your first venture into this world.  Don't worry,  there will be more Switchfoot albums.  Goodbye.  For the second group, I would say that I don't think this is anywhere near a sellout.  In fact, I think that THE MOON AND ANTARCTICA is actually a slightly more accessible album.  If this is a sellout, what are Dancehall and This Devil's Workday doing on it?  Rather than parts of a commercial album, those songs are almost like poison pills, making sure that the Hoobastank fans leave the Modest Mouse world and never come back.  The bottom line is this.  This is not much different than earlier Modest Mouse.  If anything, the production is a little brighter which allows a somewhat difficult song like Float On to rise to the level of accessibility and become a hit.  That said, this album just doesn't measure up song for song to LONESOME CROWDED WEST and THE MOON AND ANTARCTICA.  But it's still recommended.  If you first heard Modest Mouse on the radio this year and are intrigued, you should probably start with MOON and move backwards through the catalog.  If you're new to this but came to it independently of their hit after listening to indie bands like Built to Spill, the Pixies and Pavement, you might prefer LONESOME CROWDED WEST.
