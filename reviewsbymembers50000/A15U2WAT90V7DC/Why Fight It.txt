 Ryan Adams and Whiskeytown certainly provoke a lot of controversy and some very mixed opinions.  Are they derivative?  Of who? How much?  But really, who cares?  It's true that they have borrowed from landmark 80's bands like the Replacements and Uncle Tupelo.  But isn't that better than borrowing from Billy Joel?  If Ryan Adams spent his teens listening to punk and early alt-country, who can blame him when his influences seep into his music?  "Yesterday's News" could have been on any post-Let it Be Replacements album, true, but it's still a great song.  "16 Days" is an incredible achievement for a 22 year old.  "Inn Town" and "Losering" are also standouts.  I think people who complain that this stuff is derivative are thinking too much.  Just play it for someone who is not steeped in 80's and 90's music history and I guarantee they will love it.  In my opinion, Ryan Adams is still somewhat immature as a songwriter, but he has enormous talent and I think it will be fun to watch him grow, possibly into an all-time great.  For now, I think the music he has made both with Whiskeytown and solo is enormously satisfying, even if it's not groundbreaking.  This album may be the best place to start, since it is a more stylistically unified "alt-country" set compared with the diverse and very entertaining "Gold."
