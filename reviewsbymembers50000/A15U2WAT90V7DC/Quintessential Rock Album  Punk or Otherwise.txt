 My main goal in writing this review is to get the average up to a full five stars.  This album deserves no less.  In some ways this is as representative of rock music as any album in the last fifty years.  If you think rock should be played at the loudest possible volume, should pump you up, should make you think and should tap into your own emotions, then you have here the quintessential album.    A couple of points:   1. As mentioned before, this is clearly one of the most influential albums on the power-pop and punk revival stuff that followed.  But the second half of this album is also clearly the jumping off point for Britpop such as Blur and Supergrass.  2. I think it's a shame that so many reviewers need to tear down some of the bands that followed in the Buzzcocks footsteps.  Specifically, Green Day should be seen as a worthy successor to the Cocks.  They're far inferior, no doubt, but I think they get it in a way some of the more cynical recent punk creations don't.  And I think they are a band the Buzzcocks would be proud of having influenced.      3. I find it very interesting that VH1 currently uses one of the more obscure and less accessible (although still brilliant) tracks on this album -- Why Can't I Touch It? -- in a promo for the channel.  Clearly, someone over there has some very good and very interesting taste in music, which doesn't come through in the corporate rock that they force down our throats hour after hour.
