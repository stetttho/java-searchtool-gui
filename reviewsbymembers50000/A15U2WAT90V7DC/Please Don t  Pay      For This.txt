 This is a good record.  If you're coming to this via the Hold Steady like me, you won't be disappointed.  Just take the big arena sound of that band and replace it with some punk/new wave backing music and there you are.  I actually prefer this to Almost Killed Me, but not to Separation Sunday, which is a masterpiece.  Just DO NOT pay $100 for this.  I bought it on iTunes for $10.  In general, watch out for the price gougers selling used copies of out-of-print CDs.  Itunes might surprise you with some of the out-of-print stuff it sells and, of course there are other slightly less reputable online vendors selling deeply discounted mp3s that you can always check before letting some dude rob you of a day's pay.
