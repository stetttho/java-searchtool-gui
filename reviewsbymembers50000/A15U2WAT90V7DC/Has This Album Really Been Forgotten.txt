 I bought this album years ago, I believe at the beginning of the '90's when it had been touted as one of the best albums of the previous decade.  To look now and see it selling for $6 with only two amazon reviews is a little disconcerting.  I can't imagine that the New Orleans R&B/Funk sound has ever been captured more perfectly in a studio environment.  Four of these songs (Hey Pocky Way, Sweet Honey Dripper, Fire on the Bayou and Brother John/Iko Iko) are among the most rollicking and intense performances I've ever heard on record.  Run Joe is an infectious midtempo rocker and the cover of Jimmy Cliff's ballad Sitting in Limbo is beautiful.  But wait, aren't there 8 tracks on the album?  Unfortunately, yes.  Aaron's two syrupy ballad covers are atrocious.  Regardless of whether you like the songs in and of themselves (I don't), there can be no doubt that they destroy the momentum and pacing of what could have been a perfect album.  In the CD era, I couldn't lunge for my remote fast enough to forward through those tracks.  But in the iPod era, no problem: slice 'em, dice 'em and leave them on the cutting room floor.  For this price, who cares if you're left w/ less than 30 minutes of music?  Edited down, this can't be beat.  Buy it and do other potential buyers a service by not letting this go out of print.
