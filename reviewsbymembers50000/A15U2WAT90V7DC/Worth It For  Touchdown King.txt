 Monsters was probably the low point for the Meat Puppets in their original incarnation (in other words, not counting Golden Lies, which I have never heard).  They were probably reacting to the times, which were really a depressing middle ground between the great post-punk explosion of the mid-80's -- which might be the pinnacle of post-60's rock music and of which they were a leading force -- and the emergence of Nirvana a year after this album.  As a result this album abandons the sharp kick of their mid-80's releases and resorts to heavy rock with heavy production to match.  The songs are all good, but not what you would expect after classics like "Split Myself in Two," "Plateau," and "Swimming Ground."  And the pop brilliance that would reemerge on Forbidden Places and Too High to Die is mostly lost in the heavy mix. The highlight is clearly "Touchdown King," which recalls the more melodic and brighter material of Up on the Sun.  By stretching out this song with some guitar solos, they really do sound like the Grateful Dead of Punk, which I have heard them called. It's still well worth owning but only after you've gotten their best albums which are, in order, Meat Puppets II, Up on the Sun and Too High to Die along with the mid-level albums Huevos, Mirage and Forbidden Places, which are also superior to this one.
