 High pitched, screeching female vocals plus amateurish sax playing plus paranoid, anti-technology lyrics.  On paper, it sounds like an absolute mess.  In fact, it joins Singles Going Steady and the Undertones as one of the catchiest and most lovable punk albums ever.  Every song is a little masterpiece, with a memorable hook and some truly zany lyrics.  The pace is amazingly fast, but the title track, the one song that slows it down a bit, merits special mention.  The dub reggae sound clearly influenced the Slits and Liliput and the lyrics are truly hilarious.  The rest sounds like Debbie Harry and Clarence Clemons on massive doses of speed.   Ear candy of the highest order.
