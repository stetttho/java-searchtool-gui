 I wanted to lend my support to this album, which oddly tends to be seen by some critics as a mild misstep between the masterpieces Painful and I Can Hear the Heart.  I think it is considerably better than Heart and about equal to Painful.  As many of the reviews mention, there's a confidence on this one that allowed YLT to explore the further reaches of the noise that was woven into Painful.  And yes, the noise was present on May I Sing With Me and the Evil That Men Do from President, but it was different.  Those tacked on vicious feedback-laden guitar solos to songs.  Here, the noise is an integral part of the songs themselves, if that makes sense.  I could probably never choose between this and Painful, but suffice it to say they would both make it to the proverbial desert island.  The other reason for this review is to help clear up the confusion about the times listed for the songs.  As I understand it, they lifted not only the song times, but the little descriptions (i.e., "patterns of sound are my bag right now") from some old, unrelated blues album.  So it was essentially a joke, not a mistake.  This is no mystery and YLT-philes could probably be more precise, but in essence, that's the reason.
