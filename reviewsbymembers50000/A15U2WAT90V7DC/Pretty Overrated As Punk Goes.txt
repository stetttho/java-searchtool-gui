 By all means go out and get this album.  It is solid punk and because of its stature in music history, no collection is complete without it.  If you already love punk, you already have this.  If you are first getting into punk, you might buy this and watch it sit on your shelf as you play the following superior albums into the ground: Ramones, Rocket to Russia, The Clash, Singles Going Steady, Inflammable Material, Los Angeles, Wild Gift, Germfree Adolescents, The Undertones, L.A.M.F., Damned Damned Damned, Machine Gun Etiquette, Crossing the Red Sea With the Adverts.  Of course, you COULD just go and get those albums first.
