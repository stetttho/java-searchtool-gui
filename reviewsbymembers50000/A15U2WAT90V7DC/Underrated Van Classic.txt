 I think a case can be made that this is Van Morrison's third greatest album.  While that might not be eye-opening praise for most artists, it is for the man who released Astral Weeks and Moondance, two of the greatest albums in popular music history.  Of the other five I consider essential, I place this above Tupelo Honey and St. Dominic's Preview, each of which reflect a schizophrenic approach to album-making that forced Van to juxtapose his sprawling lengthy compositions with three-minute, radio-friendly songs.  Jackie Wilson Said and Wild Night are fine singles but some of the other shorter tunes on these albums have the feel of filler.  Veedon Fleece is on the level of His Band and The Streetchoir and Into the Music, but the first lacks any Van epics and the second has a few songs I rarely listen to.  As for this album, I'll admit to not "getting it" at first.  It sounded weird to me despite my love of Van and I put it aside for a long time.  Once I finally got into it, though, I was blown away.  The first five songs represent a beautiful mini-album that would probably be more confusing to the unfamiliar listener thatn even Astral Weeks, which itself sounds like no other rock album.  Bulbs is probably the most accessible track on the album, but it is not in the leadoff spot like Domino, Jackie Wilson Said and Wild Night, a fact which seems to demonstrate the anti-commercial approach of this album.  It falls off a bit after that for me, but remains a great album on the strength of its first six tracks.  I think if you combined the first half of this with the second half of Into the Music, you would have an album to rival Astral Weeks.  As it is, this is probably the best of the second-tier Van albums, which is still a lofty place to be.
