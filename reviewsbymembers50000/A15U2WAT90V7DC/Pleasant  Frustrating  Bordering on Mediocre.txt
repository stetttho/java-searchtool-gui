 The best way I can describe the way I feel about this album is that it is constantly in danger of being sold back but hasn't been yet.  It's very much on the fence but something has made me hold on to it so far.  With all the CDs I own, this normally wouldn't get much play, but oddly, I have to "audition" it every month or so to see if I would rather have it or $4 toward another disc, so I actually hear it a lot.  Ultimately, it is a bunch of Irish guys trying to do California 70's rock as many people have said.  Something gets lost in the translation and it feels somewhat phony.  But there are some nice moments, especially One Horse Town and Santa Cruz.  I think the divergence of opinion on this album depends on where the reviewers are coming from.  Mainstream fans probably love this because it is simply better than most of the stuff that one will come to through MTV, VH1 or FM Radio.  Conversely, if you already love indie pop such as the Shins, Death Cab for Cutie, Elliott Smith, Rogue Wave, etc., you won't be too impressed with this and you will find better ways to spend your money.
