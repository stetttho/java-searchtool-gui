 I have great respect for Randy Newman and I have absorbed many of the raves for this album and his other early work, but I have to say this is music that I don't completely love.  Newman is a great lyricist, but let's be honest: he is not a great singer-songwriter.  He has neither the voice nor the knack for melody to make these songs truly take off.    The throwback Tin Pan Alley-ish pop sound guarantees that the usefulness of this CD will be limited:  its neither driving/party music nor effective relaxing/headphone music.  The problem with Newman's voice isn't exactly its lack of musicality.  There have been many great singer songwriters with subpar voices in the classic sense, including the greatest of all time, Bob Dylan.  To me, Newman sounds like he has a constant smirk on his face.  It's either him saying "I know how witty my lyrics are" or him demonstrating that most of his songs are simply artificial constructions meant to entertain others and are not deep and heartfelt in the way the best songs are.  I'm sure many people will read this and say I am missing the point about Randy Newman -- that the pre-rock pop sound and wry lyrics/delivery are exactly what makes him great.  I guess I can accept that, but for me it means he is an artist I admire but won't often listen to.  And I'm sure I'm not the only one.
