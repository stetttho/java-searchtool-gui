 I just can't understand the buzz around this band.  No hooks, lots of experimantal noodling, poor vocals.  They were described to me as sounding like Califone.  Um, sorry guys.  Not exactly.  Go get Quicksand/Cradlesnakes if you want to hear experimental psych-Americana that actually hangs together and bears repeated listenings.
