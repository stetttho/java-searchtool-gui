 The Microsoft Wheel Mouse Optical is the cheapest way into an optical mouse. The mouse is shaped well for your hand and is designed to be used left or right handed. The scroll wheel is large and easy to use. The buttons are large and click well no matter if you are pressing in the middle or the edge of the button. The optical sensors work great. This mouse works perfect on any surface I've tried. Microsoft includes a install CD that has software to customize the mouse to your hearts content. Can be installed via USB port or PS/2 port (USB to PS2 adapter included). If your tired of the goo that collects on the roller ball of your current mouse or are just looking for a second mouse look no further than here.
