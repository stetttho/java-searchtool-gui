 Virus protection software is too improtant to run without. If you have a constant internet broadband connection like me you are especially wary of what might get into your system. I currently have 4 systems running on a home network and am protecting one system with this product. While I believe the product works as advertised I still prefer Norton AntiVirus. I also use the built in firewall but also prefer using Zone Alarm for my firewall duty. I must say that this product has protected as well as the Norton/Zone Alarm combo I run on my other systems. If your an upgrader it is currently free with rebates. If your a first time buyer of virus protection software buy this product and Norton AntiVirus 2003 and try them both out. You will then qualify for both McAfee and Nortons upgrades and can have both for next to nothing
