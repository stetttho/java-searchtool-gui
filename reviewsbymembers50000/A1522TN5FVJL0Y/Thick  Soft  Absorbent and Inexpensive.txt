 I purchased 7 2-packs of these bath towels along with the bonus hand towels and using a coupon that was available for Kitchen and Housewares paid less than $52 for all 14 bath towels and 14 hand towels. The towels are very thick and are the softest towels I have ever encountered. The towels that I recieved were 30" x 54" though not the 35" x 54" that Amazon has listed. Martex is a brand of Westpoint Stevens who makes towels for many department stores like J.C. Penny. I had just purchased 4 of J.C Pennys better store brand towels for much more than I paid at Amazon several weeks prior to receiving these and the Martex towels here at Amazon are much thicker, larger, and softer. After about 8 washings of both brand towels these towels still look brand new where the Pennys towels are already looking worn. I have had no problems with the towels shedding fuzz as one reviewer noted. Stitching is good and they don't shrink or pucker on the end with the three-stripe dobby border.
