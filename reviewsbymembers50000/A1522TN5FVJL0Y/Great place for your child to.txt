 We have had the Little Tikes desk for 4 years now and it is still going strong. My daughter has spent literally hundreds of hours drawing and tracing at this table (She is 9 now). I can't for the life of me fiqure out how this could get hot enough to catch fire as I see in one review? Mine has 12 volt DC lights in it that just do not get hot at all. The only thing that gets warm on mine is the transformer that plugs in the wall! My daughter has left the lights on for days with no problems with tons of papers and crayons all over the desk. Hmm? The only thing I was dissapointed about was that our desk was missing the pull out drawers. They weren't in the box and I never got around to calling Little Tikes about it. My daughter still stores her stuff in the drawer area though. Overall this was a real winner!
