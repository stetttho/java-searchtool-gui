 I have purchased Centon, PNY and several other brands of memory for several machines.  I haven't had any problems with PNY brand memory.  I installed this module in a E-machines T1220 1.2 GHz Celeron system that came with only 128 MB of memory.  You certainly notice a difference when running certain programs with the additional memory.  You should also change the size of your pagefile after changing your ram size.  If you don't like to mess with rebates this is a good price with free shipping.  If you don't mind rebates you can find it slightly less expensive with coupons and rebates at one of the 3 big office stores.
