 This is one of those surprise albums that you come across.  This band never got any push and I stumbled upon the CD when trying to fill out a record club order back in 92.  Recognized the single Dizneeland from the local college radio station I used to listen to so I ordered it.  I have this CD out all the time.  I'm a certified Midnight Oil nut and love Crowded House stuff but I continue to listen to this over and over.  I have suggested this album to many people and have never had anybody say they didn't like it after just one listen.  Buy it!  You'll be glad you did.  I am.
