 Bought this for my 7 year old autistic son who loves cars and trucks.  He loves to watch the cars go around but my 9 year old daughter and 11 year old nephew took over.  They loved to get several cars going and watching the crashes.  We added more track that we had and made an even bigger layout.  If you are having problems with the cars flying off the track you can adjust the speed of the motorized unit so they don't fly off.  Also the track trys to work itself apart as the cars fly around but a piece of scotch tape across the sections will stop that.  Overall I thought it was a great deal and the kids are having great fun with it.
