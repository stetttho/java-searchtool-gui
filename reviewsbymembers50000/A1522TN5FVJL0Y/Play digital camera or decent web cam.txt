 This camera is about as simple as they get.  I gave this camera to my daughter who is 9 and she loves it.  She has it hooked up to her E-machines Celeron Win Xp system and uses it as a web cam for yahoo IM.  As a webcam it gives good images and works well (better than quickcam express USB).  As a digital camera it can take 40 352 x 144 pixel photos or 160 176 x 144 pixel photos.  It can also take 15 seconds of video.  It runs on 4 AAA batteries as a digital camera or off the USB power as a webcam.  The digital camera even has a timer and a multisnap mode that will snap off 5 shots at one second intervals.  It provides a counter for the photos and battery status indicator.  I would suggest going to Logitech's web site and downloading the most up to date software and installing it rather than starting with the supplied CD.  Mine had ver 5.6.3 supplied but version 7 is out now.  With the supplied software you can even set up the webcam to be a motion sensor camera and take shots when it senses movement.  Overall it is a good cheap webcam with the option to remove it from its cradle and take some low quality snapshots.  If purchased on sale with rebate it should be a good deal.
