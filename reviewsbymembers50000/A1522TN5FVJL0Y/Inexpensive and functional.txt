 I have three of these units using one as a router and two as access points.  (...)they have worked without problem for me.  Easy set up and good documentation.  Also have D-link and Microsoft routers and these are as good as those.  If you are looking for a cheap way into wireless this is it.  I haven't touched them in 3 months since I turned them on.
