 Just received this today and it's worth the hupla! Was up and running in less than 10 minutes. Already shot about 20 stills and tried out the 20 second vidoe feature. Works like a charm. Camera is small and would be easy to take anywhere. I also tried out the web cam feature and I must say it makes my [other brand] webcam look horrible. I will be ordering the AC adapter asap so I can use it as a webcam as well. Printed out a couple 5 x 7's on my [printer] and they look great. The rechargable batteries are a nice touch and included. .. Software installed on my HP PIII Win Xp system without a problem and as I said the webcam feature worked well also. Well be keeping this item busy!
