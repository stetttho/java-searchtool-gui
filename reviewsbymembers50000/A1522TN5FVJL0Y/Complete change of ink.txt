 OEM ink works best in Canon printers.  No problems with clogged heads or bad print.  I have had my Canon S600 for a year now and have never even put it through a cleaning cycle and it works perfect.  This set has the three colored tanks and a black.  I would suggest going directly to the office supply store that is supplying this to Amazon and get it from their site.  They are always offering coupons and free shipping as well.
