 I am currently using two of these cards.  I installed one in a PII 200 Mhz 64MB Win 95 system and one in a Celeron 1.2 Ghz 256 MB Win XP Home system.  Installation on both only took 5 minutes and worked instantly.  I would suggest purchasing these individually rather than this two pack unless it is on sale or has rebates.  The 1 pack box of this card is always on sale and always has a rebate making it a better offer for the same card.
