 If your looking to take the leap from roller mouse to optical this is the cheapest way in.  The microsoft mouse is lighter than a roller mouse and moves easily over a desk top.  Mine has been working without a problem for some time and no need to remove the built up goo off the rollers and ball any more.  For the price you can't beat it.  If you alread have a PS/2 mouse installed you can plug this in to a USB port and use both mice.  I can use my old MS PS/2 roller mouse, the new optical mouse and the touchpad on my laptop at the same time.  Mouse comes with software to customize nearly everything on the mouse and wheel feature is nice.  For the current sale price and rebate you can not go wrong.
