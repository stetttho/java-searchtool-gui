 Great DVD for the Midnight Oil fan.  Includes 19 Midnight Oil Videos (clips as they refer to them down under) Also has the Oil's discussing several videos, Peters run for Senate as well as their involvment in the Clayoquot Sound issue.  Also has 19 Live videos from different concert events.  They even included discussions on playing live, their first album as well as the Exxon protest and several other issues.  Sound and picture is fantastic as everything has been digitally remastered.  Now I'll have to go find my Black Fella, White Fella VHS tape and watch that again as well.  Includes bonus video of Redneck Wonderland.  A must for Oils fans!!
