 Ask anyone who has a clue and they will tell you that Norton is the best Anti-virus software available.  I have 4 computers on my home network.  3 of my computers run Norton and one has Macafee's product.  While I have had no problems with either product I prefer the Norton product.  First time buyer?  Buy both!  That will allow you to meet the requirements for both upgrade rebates and let you have both for next to nothing.  Run this with the free version of ZoneAlarm firewall and feel at ease.
