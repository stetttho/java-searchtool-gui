 I purchased this module at Circuit City when I purchased an E-machines T1220 1.2 GHz Celeron system.  This allowed me to bump the memory up to 256 Mb.  Installatiion of these memory modules is a snap and the Centon memory while PC133 is also compatible with PC100 and PC66 systems.  I've just recently removed the memory (replaced with PNY 256 MB module) and installed it in a Dell 550 MHz PIII system without any problems.  It was in the E-machines system for 3 months running without a problem.  Other modules from other brands work as well and can be purchased just as cheaply without fiddling with a rebate.  My rebate took 7 weeks to receive.  Overall decent product.
