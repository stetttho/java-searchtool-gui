 I purchased my drive from one of the big office supply stores with rebates and coupons and got it for less than a doller per GB.  Maxtor drives are easy to install and come with software to help get them partitioned and formatted.  A detailed instruction manual for installation is included as well showing all jumper settings.  I installed mine on a Win XP Home system and it was a snap.  Only negative is that the drive is rather loud during use.  Not bothersome loud but you do notice it compared to the original 20 GB drive that was in the system (also a Maxtor).  Have used Maxtor in the past and never had a failure.  Good Drive
