 I purchased these speakers with a rebate and got them for next to nothing.  They have a volume and treble/bass control on the front of the right speaker as well as a button to simulate 3d sound.  The right speaker also has a mic and headphone jack.  The overall sound quality is a step up from unpowered standard pc speakers but it is not on par with other pc speaker systems that cost just a little bit more.  If you are looking for an inexpensive upgrade from non powered speakers and can get these at a reduced price you shouldn't be dissapointed.  If you are looking for good quality sound for say MP3's then look to a Altec Lansing system or other brand with seperate sub-woofer.
