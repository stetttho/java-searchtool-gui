 Purchased this card to compliment the DI-614+ wireless router I purchased.  Installed this into my HP N5495 PIII laptop (1.06Ghz, 512 MB, Win XP Home) with out any problems at all.  Installed drivers as instructed, installed card and it was instantly recognized and windows finished the new adapter installation.  As soon as the install finished I was connected.  I have heard people having problems installing these D-Link cards without first disabling other network adapters but my computer has two others that are enabled and they cause no problems.  I installed my router in the corner of my basement and can roam to the opposite end of our 3 bedroom brick ranch home with no worse than 55% signal strength.  My Roadrunner service is providing 275-325 Kbps consistantly on this card almost everywhere in the house.  I've had great luck with the card and got a great deal on it.  I have also used 3 other D-link products and have nothing but easy installations with good working products.
