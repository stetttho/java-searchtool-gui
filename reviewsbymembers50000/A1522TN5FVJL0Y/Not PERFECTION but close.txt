 I've been using this scanner for 9 months now and am extremely pleased with it.  My only gripe might be that their is no on/off switch.  Have to plug and unplug it all the time.  I use the copy function on it all the time in my home office and it works great.  I also use it as my fax machine and that works well also.  Have had great luck with scanning photo's and good results.  The only problems I've encountered was doing old slides.  Had to go in and manually take control to get them to scan to my liking.  Other than that I leave everything on auto and all has been good.  Mine is hooked to a HP N5495 laptop with Win XP and has encountered no problems.  Great scanner!!!!
