 I purchased the DI-604 to share my Road Runner internet access with both my HP N5495 laptop and a Emachines T1220 system I purchased for my children.  I removed the "Residential Gateway" (as D-link refers to the router) from the box.  Plugged it in connected the cables and went through the setup without changing any suggested settings.  Whole thing was operational in around 10 minutes and both systems are able to access the internet through the Toshiba PCX2200 cable modem.  Been up and running for a week without any problems.  Both systems running Win XP.  HP Laptop is PIII 1.06 Ghz with 512 meg and the Emachines is a Celeron 1.2 Ghz with 256 meg.  I am sharing a Canon S600 printer off the laptop using a Parellel cable and sharing a Canon S300 via USB from the desktop.  Moving files between systems is effortless and fast.  Have even played Motocross Madness 2 and Midtown Madness 2 between the systems via the network and it works great.  I have Zone Alarm Pro on both systems and that works the same as it did before the router was installed.  Overall my experience with this item has been fantastic.
