 Key Features from Symantec: Includes license for two computers.  Data recovery protects and restores important applications and files from both accidental deletion and virus damage.  Data cleaning eliminates all traces of unneeded confidential files.  Plus all the features of Norton AntiVirus 2003, including:  NEW! Detects and blocks viruses in instant message attachments.  NEW! Exclusive Worm Blocking technology detects worms such as Nimda in outgoing mail to prevent them from infecting other computers.  ENHANCED! Automatically removes viruses, worms, and Trojan horses.  Scans and cleans both incoming and outgoing email messages.  Downloads new virus definitions automatically to protect against new viruses.**  Script Blocking defends against fast-moving script-based viruses such as "ILoveYou" and "Anna Kournikova."  Worm Blocking and Script Blocking can detect new threats even before virus definitions are created for them.      Includes step by step instructions for installation, even on a computer that has already been infected.  AntiVirus 2003 Professional Edition is essentially the normal 2003 version with extra file delete/undelete functions and a two system license.  If you have more than one PC to protect this is the way to go.  I would suggest going to Symantec's website and downloading the trialware version of 2003 Professional first to make sure it runs alright on your specific hardware/software combo.  I downloaded the 15 day trial but it gave me a one year subscription to live updates.  Search for trialware and download it from them.  Hard to tell the difference from the 2002 interface.  Program has been working well for me for 3 weeks now.  I have it installed on a HP PIII WIN-XP, E-Machines Celeron WIN-XP, and Sony P4 WIN-XP systems without any problems.
