 Adobe Photoshop Elements can be used for simple editing or major reconstruction of image files.  There is a lot of things it can do so therefore it takes some time to learn its capabilities.  Rebate from Adobe is for upgraders only so be aware of that.  Some better scanners and printers come with elements so if your in the market for one of those items as well might check to see if you can get it free.  Don't know if it will be right for you?  Go to Adobe's web site and download the trial version first.  They have on-line tutorials as well.  You are allowed to install this product on two machines as long as they are both used by you and not another person.  This is good software at a good price.
