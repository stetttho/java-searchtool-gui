 I received a 30 day trial of this software from Microsoft.  I used it to update my website that is hosted by Yahoo.  I had to load the FrontPage extensions to the server then convert my current pages to FrontPage.  This made me go through the process of reformatting nearly everything.  The simple on-line tools that yahoo provides did a better job and quicker than this software.  I suppose if you really are an office expert and want the look and feel of the office interface then you might like it.  Otherwise I think you can do better elsewhere.  This software takes the cookie cutter approach to building a web presence.  Microsoft was offering a 30 day CD trial but have stopped that.  I wonder why they don't want you to try it out any more before you buy it?  Why indeed!
