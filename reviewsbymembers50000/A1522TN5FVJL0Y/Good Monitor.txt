 Purchased this monitor as part of a bundle with an Emachines system @ Circuit City.  The monitor has a great picture and comes with JBL Platinum Speakers and built in microphone.  While I'm not a fan of built in mic's this one works OK.  The speakers are powered and need to be manually turned on and off via the volume control.  They can be hung on the side of the monitor or they also can be put on the desktop with supplied stands.  They sound pretty good but sound distorted at higher levels.  They are a huge step up from the supplied e-machines speakers that came with the CPU though.  Controls are easy to use and all cables and such are provided.  ...
