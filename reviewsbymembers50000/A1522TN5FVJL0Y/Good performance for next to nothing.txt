 I've used two of these cards with perfect results. Installed one into a emachines T1220 Celeron system running XP and one on a Quantex PII system running Win 95. Both installed in seconds from provided CD and are up and running on my D-link DI-604 router sharing files, printers, and broadband connection. Great!
