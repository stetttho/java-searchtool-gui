 I purchased this camera on sale with rebates and paid much less than retail.  The camera operates fine for me but the quality of the picture is not very good.  If you have bright lighting it works fine although it is tough to get it to look focused unless what you are capturing is very close to the camera. The software that comes with it allows you to take snapshots and video clips.  It provides software to broadcast your webcame to the world but you will need to eventually pay for a spotlife account and this is the only option given by the software.  If you are buying this to just let the kids mess around and make little video clips or just for instant messenger duty it will work fine.  Just don't purchase for the retail price!  FIY - I have mine hooked to a HP N5495 PIII 1.06 GHZ 512 MB Win XP Home laptop.  For the price I paid I'm satisfied with the results of this average beginner webcam.
