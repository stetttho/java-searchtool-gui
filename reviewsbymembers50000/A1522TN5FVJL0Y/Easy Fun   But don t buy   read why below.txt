 This game is fun to run over a network with friends and family. We get bored with it fast if we are playing alone. My younger kids like it much more than me (they think its great). It's a pain that they make you do some mind numbing tasks to unlock cars. I would give it a 3 my kids give it a 5 so we settled on a 4 star rating.  Don't buy this software.  Lookup Racing Madness and you can get this with Motocross Madness 2 as well for the same price. (ASIN B00005N9AA)
