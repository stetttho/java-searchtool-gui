 I've had a Nokia 6185 phone for over 3 years.  In that time I've owned 4 car chargers.  I was sucked into the ... allure of the 10-12 dollar ones sold at the big mass merchant stores.  These things are junk.  Don't reliably charge the phone and are flimsy and break all the time.  After getting one that wouldn't charge out of the box and returning it for one that would charge once in a while (and finally died after a couple months) I recieve a new Nokia one with my latest phone (Nokia 3285).  What a difference.  Works like a charm, is sturdy, and did I mention it's sturdy!!!  Wish the cord was a bit longer but other than that it's great.
