 The Linksys hub is small and stylish.  It self installs itself on Win XP and is hot swappable as well as everything that is plugged into it.  It is compatible with USB 1.0/1.1 devices (not 2.0) Another option available is a AC power adapter for it that will allow the hub to power the devices rather than the battery from your laptop (although the adapter does not appear to be sold on Amazon).  I have a HP laptop with two USB ports and I have 4 USB devices to hook to it.  I was constantly pulling off my scanner or digital camera cable to use my webcam or printer.  The hub allows me to have all 4 connected all the time.  Everything works great.  Highly reccomend at the current low price point.
