 If you already have every one of the Oil's CD's then you have all this already.  If so I point you towards the DVD of the same name that is only slightly more money but gives some great interview clips as well as the video's to each song.  This band is as much about the visual as the music to complete the experience.  If you've seen them live you understand.  If not - get the DVD and understand why they MUST be seen live.  Otherwise this is just another collection of fantastic songs from the greatest band to come out of Australia!
