 This book could have been about 200 pages shorter if they left out the redundant info on content and style of content.  I would call this book "Keep it simple silly" as they must mention the KISS theory about 400 times.  While I did get a better understanding of HTML after reading it. I was surely not prepared to make much of a web page when I was done digesting these 400 pages.  I suggest picking it up at the library as I did and then getting a HTML reference book.  Heck you can just go to WebMonkey or some other tutorial web site and learn just as much but quicker.  It served it's usefullness but I would never buy it or reference back to it after reading it.
