 I am currently using a PCX2200 to connnect to my RoadRunner service. The Modem has been working without any problems. It has connections for USB and RJ45. The power supply cable has the transfomer in the middle of the cable which makes it easy to plug into an outlet strip unlike some that have the plug built into the transformer and hog space. I am using it with a D-link DI-604 router to share my high speed access with two computers. Overall have had no problems and reliable broadband service with it. Update - I have been using this modem in my basement since March.  The temp in the basement runs around 65 in the winter and spring.  Recently it has gotten up to 78 degrees in the basement and my Roadrunner service was slowing and sometimes stopping all together.  Finally realized that the modem was hot.  If I took a file folder and fanned it for 30 seconds to cool it down my service would be back up until the modem got hot again.  Looked at documentation on Toshiba web site and they have many warnings about keeping this unit cool and well ventilated.  Called Time Warner for replacement and they gave me a new one that is now working fine.  The one I had before had something spilled on it when they installed it and that may be what contributed to its heat failure.  Keep it cool!!!!!
