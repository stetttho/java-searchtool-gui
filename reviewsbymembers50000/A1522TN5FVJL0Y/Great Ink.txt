 I have a Canon S600 printer that I use quite often for doing pictures so I only use OEM inks in it.  The separate ink tank system in some of the Canon printers is nice as you don't have that "I just threw good ink away" feeling you get with the combined color cartridge systems when you have to replace them because one color ran out.  I have actually purchased this 3 pack in the past and it usually saves you a couple bucks over buying them separate.  I would suggest buying them directly from one of the office supply on-line stores as they always have coupons available and normally you can get free shipping as well by purchasing a set amount from the site.  No bad experiences with this ink in about 20 ink tanks used.
