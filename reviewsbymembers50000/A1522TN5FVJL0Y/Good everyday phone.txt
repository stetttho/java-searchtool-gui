 I purchased this phone at a local store back in January 2002. This phone is used on my business line. I chose it because it was inexpensive and had the features I needed. Wanted caller ID which this has. The phone has memory speed dial as well. I have voice mail as part of my phone service so didn't want a answering machine function on my phone and this one doesn't have it. I also wanted a 900 MHz phone so it would not interfere with my 2.4 GHz wireless computer network.  Has adjustable volume which works well for adjusting to loud or soft talkers. Battery life is great and range is good too. I have mine in the basement of my house against a cinder block wall and can still go outside and roam anywhere in the yard and get goood reception (big yard too). We have a similiar GE Phone (same handset) with answering machine function we use for our residential line and it works great as well. The phones don't interfere with each other either. Good solid phone.
