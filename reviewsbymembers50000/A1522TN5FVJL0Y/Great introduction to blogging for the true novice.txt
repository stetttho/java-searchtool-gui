 I picked up this book after deciding that I was going to turn my website into a blog.  I had no backround in blogging and this book is geared towards the novice.  Blogging is explained and then they go in to detail on using either Radio Userland, Blogger, or Movable Type to get your blog up on the web.  The order of the chapters is kinda crazy to me but you can read them in any order you like I suppose.  By the time I was done with the book (2 evenings) I was up and running under Radio Userland blogging away like an old pro.  I borrowed this book from the library and only had it two days and wouldn't need to look at it again as all the information included is available on the web as well.
