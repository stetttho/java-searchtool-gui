 This is a good everyday 17" monitor.  Plug & Play, .27 mm dot pitch, 16" diagonal viewable image, digital controls, 1280 x 1024 max resolution, 3 year parts & labor warranty.  You can register the product on line as well as download any needed drivers for your operating system from Envision's website.  Comes with tilt & swivel base that you need to snap on and required cables.  I'm running the monitor in 1024x768 mode on a Win 95 system and I'm impressed by it.  The colors are very vivid and bright.  Sitting next to my Compaq FS-740 monitor it looks no different except that it's not a flat screen.  Monitor is 16" high x 16" deep x 16 wide.  A very tidy foot print indeed.  I purchased mine with a hefty rebate while it was on sale at a local office supply store and got it for less than half of retail.  I'm very pleased with it.
