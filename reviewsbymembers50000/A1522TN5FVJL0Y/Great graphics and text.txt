 I have been using this printer since 11/01 and have nothing but praise for it.  With the exception of the kiniptions it goes through when it is first turned on this printer has both speed and print quality.  I am using mine on a HP laptop via parallel port and sharing it on a home network.  Ink lasts a long time and is inexpensive to replace.  Never had a paper jam or mis printed page with over 2500 sheet pulled through.  Have also printed many photos on photo paper with great results (thats when the ink really gets used).  Overall a quality printer at a great price.
