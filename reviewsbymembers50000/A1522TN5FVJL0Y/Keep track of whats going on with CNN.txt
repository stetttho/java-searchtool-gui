 I purchased this card and installed it into a Emachines T1220 system (Celeron 1.2 Ghz, 256 Meg RAM, WIN XP) and it works fantastic.  I have a home office and use a HP Laptop but have my kids Emachines desktop about 5 feet away.  I just pop up CNN and keep track of whats going on in the world all day.  This was a much cheaper solution to buying a TV.  Graphic quality is great when the display size is kept small but is even acceptable  at full screen.  My daughter even watches cartoons on her PC now.  When I asked her why she didn't go upstairs and watch it on TV she said this is cooler!  It even came with a remote that works with no problems.  Overall I'm very happy with it.  I even used it to tape one of my favorite bands playing on the Late Late show and it worked great.  For what it costs you can't go wrong!  By the way when you install the drivers you are told they haven't been approved by Microsoft for Win XP but thy worked fine for me.
