 To me the only people that can appreciate this live album is someone that has seen the band live.  Having seen the band on the Blue Sky Mining tour (loved Hunters & Collectors too) and Earth and Sun and Moon, this album when playing brings back the vision of Peter doing that strange dance thing he does and spouting politics in between songs.  It reminds me of the ecology groups that follow the bands (greenpeace) and the worn out Earth & Moon & Sun concert T I still wear.  It also reminds me of the preppy Republican dude that sat in front of me when I saw them at Nautica Stage in Cleveland that had me and my friends just laughing our rear ends off as he screamed at Peter between songs because he didn't like the bands political message but would then dance and jam like crazy just as soon as they played.  This is an album to help the true fans that have supported the band live relive those great times.  If you haven't seen them play you just won't "get it".
