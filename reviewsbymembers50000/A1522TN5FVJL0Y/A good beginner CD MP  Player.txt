 The SP50 is a good basic CD/MP3 player without alot of bells and whistles. The player includes a headphone jack, line out jack, rotary volume control, a slide switch to open the player, a enhanced bass/normal selector and a key lock to lock the controls on the top of the unit. The unit has 8 keys on top for operation. I only use four of them as the other four get you into the menu's to search and program tracks and unless I have the instructions it's just to much of a pain to figure out. The unit is shipped with battaries (chinese ones that don't last very long compared to normal alkaline's) and some ear buds that you might as well toss. I have no problems playing my burned CD's on this player. All of my files are at 128K and have been created with Misicmatch Jukebox ver 7.2. The display shows the artist and song on the display and is supposed to show the album but the album info comes up blank on mine. Sound quality with a decent set of headphones is good. Regular CD/s have played fine as well. I have not had any problems with skipping even when attempting to make it do so. ... I've deducted a star for non intiutive search controls, junky earbuds and the fact that the album title doesn't display.
