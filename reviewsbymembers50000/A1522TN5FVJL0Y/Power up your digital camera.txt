 I purchased this for my Fuji FinePix 2600Zoom. The AC Adapter supplies 3 volts DC @ 1.5 Amps. The unit is UL listed and has fold back plug prongs so the plug is out of the way for storage by folding back into the transformer. The cord is 9' long and is sturdy. An indicator LED is on the transformer to let you know when it is plugged in and providing power. While I have had no problems with battery life on my camera I wanted to have this adapter as I plan on using the camera's web-cam feature. Also it will be nice to have for taking pictures in the house when a flash will be needed (like the kids birthday party) With the adapter you can set the cameras power save option off and just have the camera ready all the time. And no need keeping the lcd screen off to save energy. All in all if you use your camera alot you will probably want one of these. Works great and much cheaper than Fuji branded item.
