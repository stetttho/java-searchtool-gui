 I worked for a large food company that was (is) always in turmoil.  When things were really looking bleak a couple of years ago the Vice President of Sales/Marketing gave everyone this book for Christmas.  Six months later just about everyone in sales and marketing was gone - me included.  My boss the Director of Marketing read it the night it was given to him and said it was insightful but he wondered about the message and his job.  Yep he got canned too!  I admit I never read it.  I knew my cheese was about to get moved already.  My wife read it and said it was "interesting" and then suggested I start looking for a job. I guess the only saving grace of my story and this book is that somebody moved the cheese on the Vice President of Sales/Marketing as well.  I hope he kept a copy for himself as he had plenty of time on his hands to read it!
