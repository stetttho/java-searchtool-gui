 I have now had this Cleaner for about a year.  This thing is a life saver as we have white carpet and two messy kids as well as two cats that love to deposit hair balls on the carpet.  The water tank on the unit is not huge but is just the right amount to let you get enough done without your cleaning water getting cold (no water heater).  With the hose and different hose end options I have cleaned several cars with fantastic results.  It also works fantastic on bare floors.  I used it to clean our basement floor before painting it and it cleaned the heck out of the cement floor.  It also works great on tile or vinyl flooring.  Our dining room carpet is white too (glutens for punishment with a 7 and 9 year old).  If the kids spill something on the carpet I just fill the hoover with some hot water and suck it right up.  This cleaner has more than paid for itself many times over.  I cleaned a carpet for my mother several days after she had it professionaly cleaned and wasn't happy with the results.  She couldn't beleive how dirty the waste water was when I cleaned it.  And it actually looked clean when I was done.  I have not had any problems with durability and it still works as well as it did the day I bought it.
