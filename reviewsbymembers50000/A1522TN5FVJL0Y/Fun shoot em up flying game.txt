 This is a good WWII flying shooter with great graphics and easy controls.  Works fantastic with my Sidewinder 2 Force Feedback stick on a PIII 1.1 GHz Win XP system.  Also plays well on a 1.2 GHz Celeron system with integrated graphics running Win XP.  This is not a game that you can play hours on end for days and feel like your getting challenged.  Pull it out occasionally as a break from your other games and it will keep you occupied happily for several hours.  At the current low price it's an easy addition to your gaming library.
