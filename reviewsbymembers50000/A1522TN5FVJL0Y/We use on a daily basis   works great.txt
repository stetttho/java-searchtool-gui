 I originally purchased these back in December 01 so my wife and I could talk back and forth while driving from Iowa to Ohio when we moved.  We drove seperate cars and wanted to be able to coordinate breaks and stuff as we drove with our kids.  I charged these up the night before we left and drove with them for well over 12 hours using them the whole time.  They came in handy as we had to travel through a snow storm and it was difficult to keep in sight of each other.  The range is great.  We were getting at least two miles as advertised.  Now that we are in our new home and live near relatives my daughter grabs one as she heads out the door to Grandma's and we can keep track of her while walking through the yards to get there and she can let us know when she's safely inside.  As for the buttons being difficult we don't have a problem.  Variable volume control is great and so are all the different call signals.  Durablity has been good as well.  Batteries have held up and still will hold a charge for days on standby.
