 Very flimsy and hard to steer.  The heavier your child the more difficult this trike is to pedal and steer.  One of our pedals had lots of left over plastic in the hole that goes on the crank.  This pedal doesn't want to turn and knocks my sons foot off the pedal.  Purchased while on sale but still feel like it wasn't nearly worth the trouble.  Tires don't wear very well.  Ours is hardly used and you can see the wheel wear already.
