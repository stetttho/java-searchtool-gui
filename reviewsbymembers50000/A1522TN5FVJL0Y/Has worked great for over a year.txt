 Purchased this phone over a year ago. Easy to set date and time. Controls are very easy to navigate. Battery life of phone is excellent. Digtital answering system works well. Caller ID holds last 40 calls. I also have another 900 MHZ GE phone (same model but without digital messaging) and the do not interfere with each other. I like 900 MHz phones as I get great reception and theyy don't interfere with my 2.4 GHz wireless home network. Seems like the 2.4 GHz spectrum is getting pretty saturated with all the devices using it out there. Good solid phone.  In response to other reviews I see here I have had no problems with buttons not working.
