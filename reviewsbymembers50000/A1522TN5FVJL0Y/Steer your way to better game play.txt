 I have installed this wheel on both a HP PIII laptop and Emachine Celeron desktop both running Win XP Home.  The included installation CD warned me that the programs were not approved for this operating system but allow you to install them anyway.  Both systems installed correctly and operate without any problems.  The wheel has an adjustable clamp and you will need about 8 inches from the edge of a desk to the back of the unit on the surface and about 5 inches on the bottom of your desktop to clamp correctly and securely.  The foot pedals attach to the wheel unit via a RJ11 patch cord that is provided.  My unit came with a huge transformer power supply that will hog a power strip as it is 2.5" x 3" in size.  The USB cable is hard wired into the back of the wheel unit and is 6' long.  Would have been nice to have a regular USB connection so a 10' cable could be used.  You could always buy an extension cable if needed.  The wheel works well and includes 8 programmable buttons.  Buttons 1-6 are on the wheel face and are located so they can be activated via your thumbs.  Buttons 7-8 are really little paddle buttons that are on the back of the wheel and are activated by your forefingers.  They can be used for shifting.  Microsoft has also included a button in the middle of the wheel that turns the force feedback option on/off.  The pedals are nice and big with good feel.  The platform they are on is solid and doesn't move around on my basement floor.  They will move around a bit on carpet though.  In my opinion the force feedback is pretty unrealistic, but it still is fun.  Have used the wheel with Midtown Madness 2, NASCAR 2002, and the included Monster Truck Madness 2 without any problems.  I purchased mine with a Microsoft rebate while Amazon was having Microsoft promotional rebates as well.  I'm happy with the performance of the wheel for the amount I paid.
