 While I hardly use my Visor Deluxe for more than a address book and electronic note pad that is enough for me.  Have had this items since December 01 and it has taken a beating and kept on going.  My daughter plays with it all the time as I downloaded some games to it.  Hardly can find it when I need it though as she has always got it.  From what I have seen of other palm devices this one is up to snuff and works as well.  These can be had for next to nothing at this point in the tech game as well.  Good Beginner PDA to get your feet wet.
