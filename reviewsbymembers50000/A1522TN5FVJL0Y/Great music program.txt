 I've been using MM Jukebox for several years now and they keep adding features to improve it.  It's easy to use and easy to sort your music.  It's always the highest rated player by all the magazines and websites that rate these things.  My only question about buying it here would be why?  You can download the product directly from their site and it costs less.  If you are using the free version now then all you need to do is purchase a product key from them to start using all the features.  Must be a new version coming out soon as the price dropped on MusicMatch's web site.  Seems they do that right before an update.
