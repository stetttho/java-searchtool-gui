 We run this game on our home network and I joust it out with my nephew or any one else who dare take me on. Great game with easy controls and good graphics. Runs great on both my PIII 1.06 Ghz HP laptop and 1.2 Ghz Celeron Emachines desktop. We have also played on the MSN gaming zone and been smoked by some really good players. We like it! But don't buy this.  Microsoft offers a title called Racing Madness that gives you this game and Midtown Madness 2 in the same box for the same price of this game alone.  Search for racing Madness or look up ASIN B00005N9AA. Have fun
