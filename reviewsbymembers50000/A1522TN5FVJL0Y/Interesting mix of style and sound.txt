 Picked up this CD at the library for my 9 year old daughter as she had to have Complicated.  I have actually been listening to the CD lately.  I actually don't care for the two singles that have been released (perhaps because I hear them about 90 times a day if I'm listening to radio).  The little gems for me on this album are LOSING GRIP with its slightly harder edge, and I"M WITH YOU.  Hey she might not be the most talented singer in the world (heck I like Mick Jagger and Roger Daltrey and neither can sing) but the album is very listenable.  I'm an old fart and I like it!
