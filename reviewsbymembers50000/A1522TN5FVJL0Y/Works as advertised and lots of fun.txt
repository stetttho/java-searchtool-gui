 Purchased this for my daughter (...) She is a huge Harry Potter fan and we have played this game together several times.  Whenever a friend comes over this is one of the first items they get out and play.  The sound of the voice is a bit loud so we put a piece of tape over the speaker holes and all is well.  We have not had any problems with piece not fitting and she is able to make changes to the maze as she likes.  It's a hit at our house.
