 Switched over to optical mice when Amazon had the Microsoft mice on sale for next to nothing several months ago. I'm totally sold and would never go back to the old roller ball type. Just ordered this mouse (I love to get something for nothing) with the current FAR deal. Mouse is well constructed. Plug N Play. While the mouse is USB it can be used via the normal PS/2 mouse port with the provided adapter. Software included allows you total control over your pointing device and its function. While installing the mouse software it claimed that the mouse operates at 800 dpi if used on a USB port (slightly less when using the PS/2 port). Mouse ergonomics are good for my hands (X-large). It even loooks good especially with the Sony system I installed it on. Works fantastic in Win XP Home. How can you go wrong for free!
