 Purchased this mixer during a Friday sale and got it for $99.99 and they had a $20 promo certifiate with a $99 purchase in Kitchen and Housewares to boot. So for the final price of $79.99 I have a mixer that looks and performs as a new one. Couldn't find any eveidence of use of the unit and operates perfectly. The only thing you miss over a brand new one is the pouring shield and at least another $100!
