 Considering her young age I was impressed by this first effort.  This album is easy to listen to and is enjoyable.  It will be interesting listening to her future efforts to see if she grows out of the piano ballad and explores more sounds and styles.  I will have to say that her cover of Paint it Black actually makes me hit the skip button every time it comes up.  As a old guy and Rolling Stones fan I can't hack it.  That cover was ill advised and if they were looking for a filler song they should have produced the CD with one less song instead.  Other than that a solid 4 star effort.
