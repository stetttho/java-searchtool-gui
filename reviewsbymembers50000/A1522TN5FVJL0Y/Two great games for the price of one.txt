 These are both great games.  The best part is you can get them here for the price of one.  See seperate reviews for each game.   MIDTOWN MADNESS 2 This game is fun to run over a network with friends and family. We get bored with it fast if we are playing alone. My younger kids like it much more than me (they think its great). It's a pain that they make you do some mind numbing tasks to unlock cars. I would give it a 3 my kids give it a 5 so we settled on a 4 star rating.  MOTOCROSS MADNESS 2 We run this game on our home network and I joust it out with my nephew or any one else who dare take me on. Great game with easy controls and good graphics. Runs great on both my PIII 1.06 Ghz HP laptop and 1.2 Ghz Celeron Emachines desktop. We have also played on the MSN gaming zone and been smoked by some really good players. We like it! 5 Stars! This is a great deal at a great price!
