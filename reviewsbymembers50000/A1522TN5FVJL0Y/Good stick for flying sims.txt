 I have installed and used this stick on a HP PIII laptop and an E-machines Celeron Desktop.  Both systems running Win XP.  Installation was straitforward and went without a hitch.  I have used the stick with MS FS2002, MS Combat FS, Novalogic F-16, Novalogic Mig-29, Crimson Skies, and even Motocross Madness 2.  All games play fine.  I have had the old Novalogic games forever but never really played them because I have never had a joystick.  What a difference it makes playing these games.  On the games that provide force feedback the stick performs well also.  With the included software the stick is totally customizable allowing you to configure just about everything.  The stick is big and bulky so you need some space to set it when not in use.  The base is 10" wide by 9" deep and it is pretty heavy.  I purchases this with a rebate for buying FS2002 and also other available Amazon rebates so am happy with the performance at the price I paid.
