 Picked these up about a week ago.  They seemed a little small in the toe area when I first put them on but after about an hour of wear the foam padding has given enough that they seem to fit true to size.  I got black and the color bleeds on to white socks (my socks are now grey) and the sole also marks up tile and vinyl flooring.  They are comfortable and warm though.  One other item to mention is that they have a pretty unpleasant odor that over the last week has gotten weaker but I can still smell them.  Hopefully that will go away all together with a little more time.  All in all what you would expect from a $10 slipper made in China.  I actually got them for free as I purchased a better brand of slipper for $26 and currently Amazon is offering a coupon for $10 off $35 on sleepwear products so I added these to my order for $10 and essentially got them for free.
