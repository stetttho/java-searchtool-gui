 I opted for this printer in a systems bundle over the normal Lexmark offering.  I already own a S600 but wanted a printer for my kids to use and this was the choice for me.  Graphics are good and so is text.  Speed is high for this price point.  I am using this on a T1220 emachines system on a home network and am sharing it with my laptop.  Everything has worked to perfection.  It has auto on/off power settings and ink cartridge meters.  The other thing that made this my choice was the cost of ink replacement.  My daughter uses Disney Magic Artist and can drain ink faster than she drains a gallon of milk (fast). Replacement cartridges are much more reasonable than other brands.  Good Value printer!!!!!
