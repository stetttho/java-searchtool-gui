 Any film that can only be appreciated when viewed on a gigantic theater screen can't be all that great. Quite the contrary, if it can still be enjoyed on the tiniest of television sets then it clearly shows that it has much more to offer than what first meets the eye. Not so with 'Lawrence of Arabia'. Like many others who first saw it on the silver screen immediately after its restoration 15 or 16 years ago, I was completely blown away by the sheer size and look of the film. Unfortunately the experience has never been duplicated, not even while watching it with the lights down on our huge HDTV with surround sound system. An utter disappointment. Not only did I find the movie long and boring, but the few flaws that I chose to set aside the first time I saw it became even more evident. Simply put, this is not a very good movie for anyone who is unfamiliar with the historical events that provide the setting for the story. Audiences are never told in any way--not even at the beginning of the film--that the political conflicts recreated for the movie are directly connected with World War One. Thus, movie-goers who are clueless about history have no idea why the English are fighting the Turks, who were allied with the Germans at the time. Such a lack of simple but important information as this can be likened to someone watching 'The Empire Strikes Back' BEFORE having viewed 'Star Wars', an experience which might possiby still be enjoyable if maybe a little confusing. But perhaps the film's worst and irreparable handicap is the gross miscasting of the very British actor Alec Guiness (complete with a very British accent) in the role of an Arab leader. Tragic and comic is all I can say about the choice. Whatever, though. It's very unlikely that I'll ever see this film again, especially since I couldn't even finish watching it on a giant tv, and to this day I've not met anyone who's seen it a second time, either. Have a nice day.
