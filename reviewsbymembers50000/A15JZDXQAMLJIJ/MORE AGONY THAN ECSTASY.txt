 "When will you make it end?" Alas, thus whines Pope Julius II (Rex Harrison) at poor Michelangelo (Charlton Heston) several times during this two hour-plus bore. The pontiff's question regarding the amount of time it had been taking Buonarroti to finish painting the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel could also be asked when discussing the length of this ponderous film, which I recently viewed on video. Though it is without a doubt a handsomely-made film (like most of Heston's other costume dramas), it is neither educational nor, least of all, entertaining. Too fictionalized to be called "biography", too slow to be called "spectacle". Certainly not Chuck's finest hour. True, his earlier 'EL CID' was also pure Hollywood make-believe, but it definitely delivered a lot more than just massive movie sets. For fans of Heston, historical epics and fictionalized biography I would recommend that other movie instead. And if you're an art lover like myself I would also suggest you see the touching and far superior 'LUST FOR LIFE', based on the book by Irving Stone, the author of 'THE AGONY AND THE ECSTASY'.
