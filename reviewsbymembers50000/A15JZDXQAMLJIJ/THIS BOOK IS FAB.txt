 More than a decade ago while browsing through the movie section of my local book store I spotted a little pic-packed treasure on 60's tv actresses that was definitely worth collecting. It was a little worn and beat up, so intstead of special-ordering a new copy I just simply put it back on the shelf and forgot about it. MORON!! I later hated myself for not buying it when I had the chance, but then a miracle happened in the form of SWINGIN' CHICKS OF THE 60'S. Not only does this book contain ALL the tv babes that were previously covered in that other book, but also listed here are the famous models, rock starlets, movie stars (American and foreign), and the Elvis and James Bond girls as well. My only complaint is that there is no chapter dealing with the B-movie queens of the decade, like Martine Beswick and such.  Nevertheless, this is so far the definitive work on the subject, so don't make the same mistake I did. Stop reading my review here and go buy it while you still can. Peace, bro
