 About Mario Testino and his work:  "He is ruthless in his vision. His work does not expose vulnerability, worry, neuroses and conflict, because he edits the world he wants to present and those aspects aren't in it. He determinidely excludes who and what doesn't interest him, and tirelessly works to bring out the life and laughter and beauty that he admires." Alexandra Shulman, editor of British Vogue.  "He has been responsible, more than anyone else, for a particular style of magazine photography--casual, vivid, sensual, and hyper-real." Charles Saumarez Smith, director of The National Portrait Gallery, London.  "The photographs of Mario Testino, one finds in describing them, are much like the man himself: irreverent, assertive and most of all full of life--brimming over with life, as if to push its very essence at you. Mario's photos always seem to connect you with the truest and lightest aspect of yourself. The aspect that thrives on spontaneity, passion, and a perspective void of judgments." Gwyneth Paltrow.  About those who made the above-mentioned comments:  "He who does not know God will kneel [in reverence] to any burro." Old Mexican proverb.
