 My bro and I watched this movie a few nights ago and both of us had forgotten how funny it was. Personally, my favorite scene is when Chuck rams that bald dude's head through the jail bars and just leaves him stuck there all bloody. Anyways, watching 'DEATH WISH 3' is very much like watching an Ed Wood movie. You watch it to get a kick out of how awful it is and not for the plot. Indeed it should be placed in the comedy section of video stores. Anybody attempting to give this movie a serious bad review is in desperate need of a sense of humor. There is no shame in having a guilty pleasure such as this howler in your video or dvd library. Everybody's got at least one or two in theirs, so if you liked this turkey don't be shy to admit it. Peace, my man.
