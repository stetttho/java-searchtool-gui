 Psssst. I got a secret to tell you. Nobody else besides you knows I bought this movie, and I'd like to keep it that way if you don't mind, thank you very much. The reason is I felt pretty stupid watching it, but thank God I was all alone that night, so none of my homies were there to make fun of me because of it. But since then I've made a vow to never again buy another movie without renting it first (you'd think I would've learned my lesson after my big disappointment with GHOSTBUSTERS!). Anyways, BROTHER SUN, SISTER MOON has the honor of being the first video I've ever thrown away, and after this embarrassing experience it will definitely be the last. Peace, bro.
