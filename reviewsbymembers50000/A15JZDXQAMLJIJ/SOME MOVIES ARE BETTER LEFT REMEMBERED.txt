 Ever watch a stand-up comic on tv who wasn't funny and you had to change the channel 'cause you felt guilty for not laughing? Well, that's pretty close to how I felt after watching this terribly outdated "comedy". What a bummer, too, 'cause I remember laughing pretty hard when I first saw it 20 years ago (maybe the fact that I was only 17 when it came out had something to do with it, who knows?). Anyways, I bought this dud recently and I couldn't believe how unfunny it was. Not only was I unable to finish watching it, but what little I did get to see failed to make me laugh once. What's worse is I can't get my cash back, either. It's true we all have our likes and dislikes and I don't wanna offend no one, but I'm amazed at how many people here still think this movie is hilarious. Personally, I would suggest to anyone who hasn't seen it in a while to rent it first before they make the same mistake as I did by buying it. You've been warned! Peace, bro.
