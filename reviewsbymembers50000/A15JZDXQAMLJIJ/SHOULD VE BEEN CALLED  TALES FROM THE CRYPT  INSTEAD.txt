 Yes dear reader, that's a more accurate title for this exploitative "documentary" that relies more on sensationalism rather than informative history. Though I admit that some of the stories contained in this 3-volume set are not without entertainment or educational value, this lavishly made gore fest needlessly recreates in shocking detail the more brutal punishments that took place in the Tower's long bloody history. In fact, some of these re-enactments are so disturbing (the 'Babington Plot' sequence in particular) they make Mel Gibson's execution scene in BRAVEHEART look tame by comparison. I love history and believe that violent events can be told with intelligence and respect for the viewer (or reader), but these video snuff films left me feeling sad and disgusted rather than enlightened with newly-learned knowledge about historical events that I was not familiar with. Of course if you're one of those persons who likes your history a little gruesome and explicit, then perhaps you might wanna add this piece of garbage to your video library and place it somewhere between your prized copies of THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and CALIGULA. For fans of the macabre only, so don't say I didn't warn ya. Peace, bro.
