 Sci-Fi, horror, cop thriller, buddy movie, action flick. 'THE HIDDEN' is a delightful combo of all of these genres. It's almost like watching the best scenes from 'THE TERMINATOR', 'INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS', 'ROBOCOP', '48 HOURS' and 'SPECIES' all in the same movie! And yet, despite having all the necessary ingredients that make up a summer blockbuster, 'THE HIDDEN' has instead received a decent-sized cult following over the years. Perhaps one day it will join other movie greats like 'BLADE RUNNER' and 'HIGHLANDER', both of which were also flops at the time of their theatrical releases but have since then become classics of science fiction and fantasy. Peace.
