 Allow me to begin by pointing out that this is not a critique about the images in this book but, rather, an attempt to set the record straight about what these images really are. As an assistant to a successful fashion photographer (and being a photographer myself) I feel it is my duty to make it clear to photography students and aficionados reading my review that much of LaChapelle's work showcased in this lavish collection is NOT photography and should not be regarded as such. Photography is the process of capturing light reflected from a person or object unto a role of film or any other light-sensitive material. It is not about adding imaginary backgrounds to a photograph with a computer. There is a world of difference between using digital techniques as a modern method for retouching a picture and using those same techniques for actually creating the image itself. To call the latter procedure "photography" is the same as calling the computer-generated carbon copy of Sir Laurence Olivier in SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW a "cameo" by the late actor.   Don't get me wrong. I have nothing against the art and potentials of digital graphics, and as far as my personal opinion regarding the quality of LaChapelle's work goes - well sure I think the boy's talented, no doubt about that. He has a vivid imagination and he's very good at his craft. But call his stuff digital art if you want to, just please don't call it photography.
