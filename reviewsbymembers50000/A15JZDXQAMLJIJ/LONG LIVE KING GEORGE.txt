 Move over, D'Orazio, Testino and DeMarchelier! Go back to school and study the works by the real master of glamour photography. George Hurrell was, simply put, a genius--a genius who'd probably be spinning in his grave right now if he'd see the kinds of pictures taken by today's above-mentioned "artists" who are way over-paid for their limited talents. Nothing we see in today's fashion and entertainment magazines could possibly compare with Hurrell's dramatic and innovative use of lighting which is just as striking today as it was during his heyday. My brother agrees. He's a fashion photographer whose work has been published in some of the majors, and Hurrell is the only photographer who inspired him to pursue that profession. And it is precisely my brother's "borrowing" of Hurrell's style, combined with a desire to bring back beauty and simplicity to glamour photography, that has made him a current success in the business.
