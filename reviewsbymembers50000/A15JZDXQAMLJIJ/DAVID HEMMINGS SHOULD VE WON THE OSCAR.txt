 To be honest I don't know if he was even nominated, but Mr. Hemmings' is the best (and grooviest) portrayal of a fashion photographer I've yet seen on film. I also think that his character is very much misunderstood by both viewers and critics alike. While I certainly agree with anyone here who thinks Dave's "Swingin' London" photographer was shallow and that his attitude towards his models was sometimes pretty nasty, in no way do I feel that he was a man who felt contempt for women, as critic Roger Ebert wrote in his praise for this film. As a guy who works for a professional fashion photographer I can tell you from personal experience that this particular business can be very stressful, especially if you're dealing with models who are either too picky or overly worried about how they look. The photographer, like the character in the movie, must be the one completely in charge of the shoot if the pictures are to come out just right. And a truly great photographer, like my boss, can actually make a very pretty model look even more attractive than she really is, but that can only happen if the ladies in front of the camera take him seriously and are willing to cooperate. And while my boss and I both love our job and get along with everyone we work with, there are times when the two of us wish that he could try to act as aggressive as Hemmings' character was. Peace, bro.
