 I suppose I could go into intricate detail describing the many flaws this overrated "bio pic" has, but I'll skip all of that and briefly discuss, instead, the outrageous miscasting of Leonardo DiCaprio in the lead part. Not once during the entire three hours that I sat through this travesty did I feel convinced that I was watching a movie about Howard Hughes. At first I tried very hard to ignore the fact that DiCaprio bears absolutely no physical resemblance to the real Mr. Hughes, and as much as I wanted to give the poor guy's performance a chance, I could not. The movie begins in the 1920s and ends in the 1940s, yet throughout that whole time Little Leo looked and sounded more like a teen-aged boy fresh out of high school and nothing at all like the fascinating and enigmatic man he was trying to portray. His scenes with Cate Blanchett in particular (who, by the way, acted a lot more like Katharine Hepburn the actress rather than Katharine Hepburn the real woman) are especially laughable considering that she could almost pass for his mother. If the movie had been based only on Hughes' earliest youth or (better yet) if another, more mature actor had played the older Hughes in the second half of the film then perhaps I may have been able to take it a wee-bit more seriously, but, alas, that was not the case here. So it's not so much that I think DiCaprio's performance was completely terrible, just simply that he was the wrong choice for such a demanding role.
