 After realizing that this sander makes the nicest little "r" shaped swirls, I relegated it to the light sanding of paints and primers, between coats.  The problem now is that the paint dust clogs inside sander, never making it into the attached dust canister.  Even with the dust canister completely removed, paint dust still collects inside and is not properly expelled.  Obviously, this requires constant cleaning with an air hose coupled with a heavy "tapping" on the exhaust port with my hammer handle to help dislodge the caked dust.  Hopefully, it will die soon from my endless tapping so that I can buy another, this time from a different manufacturer.
