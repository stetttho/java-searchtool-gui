 This sander has been in my shop for about a year and a half with minimal use - probably less than three hours of total sanding time.  Even though I was diligent in blowing out the dust with an air hose and using the sander as recommended, the bearings seized-up last weekend.  A real shame because when it worked, it worked very well with flawless results.  It's definitely not up to the quality standards of the Porter Cable we used to know and trust.
