 Recently, while in the middle of a hardwood flooring project, I purchased this model sander at a local supplier.  After considerable use, here's my assessment. Positive observations: - It's build like a tank and will probably run forever. - It's well-balanced and offers smooth sanding capabilities Negative observations: - The metal baseplate or "shoe" that came with the unit started warping after 1-2 hours of hard use, due to excessive heat.  Fortunately, I had taken the advice of another reviewer and purchased the graphite impregnated shoe and was able to replace the original shoe without losing time on the job.   - At 12.0 amps, it's still significanly underpowered.  It almost stalls with a 50 grit belt and heavy pressure.   - It's dust collection capabilities are mediocre, at best.  Even when connected to a large shop vac, it clogs continuously during heavy sanding.  Repeated clearing with an air hose is necessary. - The machining on the housing is poor, especially in the area around the dust collection opening near the back of the belt.  The mating surfaces don't align, which adds to the dust collection problems since the dust collects in the misaligned joint.  I was able to improve this some with a small file but access is limited unless you remove the rear roller. - The label on this machine says "Whisper Seriers".  I don't know what Porter Cable's definition of "whisper" is, but it's obviously much different than mine.  Ear plugs are absolutely essential for the operator and anyone else within "whisper" distance. Overall, I would have to say that there are better choices than this sander.  I own numerous Porter Cable tools and have been satisfied with most but this one leaves me disappointed.
