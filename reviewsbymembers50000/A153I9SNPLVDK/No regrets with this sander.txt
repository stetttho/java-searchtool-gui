 It has been almost a year since I purchased this sander and I must say that it impresses me more every time I use it.  It's light, powerful, relatively quiet, with good belt tracking.  And as other reviewers have pointed out, the dust collection is outstanding, even when using the supplied dust bag.  Most recently, I used this sander to edge new hardwood floors and even went so far as to use it for the initial sanding of almost 200 s.f. of oak flooring, using 50 grit belts. Although I did break down and purchase a 4"x24" Porter Cable (a Makita 4"x24" was not available locally) to complete the remainder of the floor, the Makita performed flawlessly, even under heavy pressure.  It simply would not stall, regardless of the pressure applied.  Another good feature of this sander is its compact design which allows you to get into tight quarters.  I was able to sand completely flush to the right side of the sander and to within approximately two inches of the front.  The 4"x24" Porter Cable would get to about 1/4" on the side and 6" in front.  I highly recommend this sander!  It's one of those rare tools that leaves you wanting nothing more, because it would be almost impossible to improve. Real quality at a fair price. I just wish I could say the same for the 4"x24" Porter Cable.
