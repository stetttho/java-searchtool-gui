 After two years, I'm still trying to like this router but I have mixed emotions.  The variable speed, the large hole in the base, the soft start, the dual on/off switches are all nice.  And...the top woodworking magazines recommended it.  But, it's top heavy and awkward, the base is relatively small compared to the size of the router, the plunge mechanism is "sticky" in its midrange, the fine adjustment is complicated to use, and the two-stage switch on the handle is difficult to engage.  Also, with the small base and large hole, there isn't much base plate left to ride on the work piece when it's being used for handheld work.  Coupled with the top-heaviness, this makes it extremely unstable and wobbly, especially at corners.  Overall, it's a good router for the router table but not my preference for handheld work. UPDATE: My review is for the 7529 model.  Apparently, Porter Cable addressed some of the concerns noted during the model upgrade.
