 This is my third random orbit sander in the last 3-4 years and it replaces a smooth operating but poorly made Porter Cable 333.  The positive aspects of the Hitachi are that it is very agressive, has good power, and the dust collection seems to work fine.  Unfortunately, it's nearly impossible to control when the pad is flat on the sanding surface and tends to veer out of control in whatever direction the orbit takes it.  In addition, the top of the sander is very large which makes it uncomfortable to hold and probably adds to the control issue. The Porter Cable clearly led the way in sanding quality and smoothness. All in all, the Hitachi just doesn't provide the blend of aggressiveness and finesse that I desire for my woodworking needs.
