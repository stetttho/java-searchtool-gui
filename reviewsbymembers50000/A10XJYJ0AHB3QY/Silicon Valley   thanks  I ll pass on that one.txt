 I really liked this one.   An extended rant against the narrow-minded  plague of technology focussed libertarians that have overrun Silicon  Valley's corridors of power. Every once in a while I am reminded of why I  live in Michigan, and not having to cope quite so much with this is one  reason why. (There are a few in every academic environment, though, and I  painfully recall the days of trying to have any kind of reasonable  discussion with Ayn Rand followers who somehow all seemed to have an  amazing ability to type at rapid and ferocious speeds).
