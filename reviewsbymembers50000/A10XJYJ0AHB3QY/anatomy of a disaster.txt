 A very interesting book on architecture which focuses on things that don't  get talked about all that often - structural failures of buildings - is  "Why Buildings Fall Down" by Matthys Levy and Mario Salvadori.   If you can get past a bit of well-illustrated mechanical engineering  technical details, it's a terrific tale of how a cascade of seemingly minor  mistakes in design, workmanship, engineering and materials can take a  perfectly reasonable concept and produce a disaster. This book was  recommended to me by a network engineer who said it helped him think about  how computer networks fail under stress.
