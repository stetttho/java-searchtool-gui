 "Finding Flow" is an easy-read paperback subtitled "the  psychology of engagement with everyday life". The thesis cut back to  its core is that optimal experiences happen when you are highly challenged  and have the skills to match, and that too many people spend their lives of  quiet despiration being frustrated,  anxious, apathetic or bored when the  tasks that fill their day don't match up. Mihaly describes this state of  "Flow" as a period of complete focus on the task, no distractions  or irrelevant feelings, and a distorted sense of time. "In the  harmonious focusing of physical and psychic energy, life finally comes into  its own".  You would hope that a book like this would be a pretty  engaging read, or else it would have failed its stated purpose, and for the  most part I was engaged while reading it. It tries to be a self-help book  too, which I  suppose is fair enough -- if you believe that this state of  being is superior to being lazily happy sitting on the couch watching TV,  then you might well want to preach its virtues.
