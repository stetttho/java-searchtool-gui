 And the short answer to the question above, is "Nothing."  So many great reviewers and critics agree that this is one of the greatest masterpieces of literature that I finally had to see for myself.  I was definitely not disappointed.  Even in translation, it is easy to notice the extreme care that Flaubert put into his choices of mood and tone, metaphors, analogies, descriptions, dialogue, his characters' interior monologue, even the length of sentences, paragraphs and chapters.  And his plot is not only perfectly paced, but keeps giving you interesting tidbits right till the very end.  I don't even begin to compare it with "Anna Karenina" or "The Scarlet Letter."  In terms of sheer entertainment value, "Madame Bovary" wins hands down.  While it doesn't provide the scope or the psychological analysis of Tolstoy's masterpiece, I found it less demanding and far more enjoyable.  No, the characters aren't as three-dimensional as Tolstoy's, but neither are there reams of pages full of farming, hunting and local politics with which to get bored.  If you're looking for the first real modern novel, look no further.  Not only is it the first, but it is also one of the very best.
