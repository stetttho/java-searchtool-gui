 O.k., never mind if you disagree with the more controversial topics of the book, particularly the Roe v. Wade led to lower crime rate arguement.  Read the whole book and evaluate it on its merits.  Other economists wish they could be this entertaining and informative at the same time.  Even though I'm an avid reader, it's rare that I stay up until 3 a.m. because I don't want to put a book down.  I've never read, cover to cover in one sitting, a non-fiction book about a topic as potentially deadly as economics.  This book was the exception.  The ideas are riveting because, even though the book revolves loosely around economics, it's really about the human condition, what makes people do the things they do.  Why do they cheat?  How do they cheat?  How can you prove it?  There is no doubt that anyone with any curiosity about how the world really works will enjoy this book.
