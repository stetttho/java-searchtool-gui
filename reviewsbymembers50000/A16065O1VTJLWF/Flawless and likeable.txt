 Russo pulls off quite a balancing act here.  Using as his canvas a sleepy little mill town in Maine with all its quiet inhabitants who lead mostly normal and unexciting lives (particularly the protagonist, Miles Roby), he still manages to make the pages fly.  There is hardly a single wrong note here.  I wanted to know more about the characters after I closed the book.  And that's exactly how I felt after each chapter.    Even though the storytelling is non-linear, constantly switching times, places and points of view, it is easy to follow and compelling throughout.  Every time I wanted to know what happens next to a particular character, he switches points of view and leads you down a different path that is just as interesting.  And he brings it all together logically, yet still unexpectedly, despite plenty of foreshadowing along the way.  It might seem a bit predictable in retrospect, but while I read it, I was hooked the whole way.  The prose, though not lyrical or poetic, doesn't get in the way of the story either.  Russo lets a good story tell itself and still delivers excellent insights into human nature.    Overall, a brilliant piece of writing.
