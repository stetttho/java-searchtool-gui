 Intriguing?  No, not really.  Daring?  I guess it is in the same way that taking a dump in the middle of Times Square is daring.  Listen to any of the samples for yourself.  Believe me, that should be more than enough to help you make up your mind.  If you're not so absolutely fed up with conventional music that you want to throw a grenade at your stereo, if you don't believe that every once in a great while melody and harmony and skillful yet plain singing and playing count for anything at all in pop music, then go ahead and buy this.  It was made just for you.  You'll love this assault on the conventional.  But if that doesn't describe you, if you can appreciate anything between Bach and Public Enemy, between the Sex Pistols and Britney Spears, then beware.  This album falls way outside those boundries.  My honest opinion?  I can imagine more melodious naval battles.  I've heard better harmony from lawnmower engines and beehives.  And I've heard more nuanced singing from parakeets or even during the worst American Idol auditions.  This is the musical equivalent of "Attack of the 50-foot Woman," "Plan 9 from Outer Space" or "Santa Claus Conquers the Martians."  Yes, they were all made intentionally, too. So, by all means, enjoy.
