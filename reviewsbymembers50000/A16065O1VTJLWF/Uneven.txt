 I definitely enjoyed huge portions of "The Magic Mountain," but the novel, as a whole, also took a great deal of time and effort to get all the way through. There are parts of this book -- especially near the end -- that are riveting: the seance and the dual, for instance, and the snowstorm was O.K. (not as exciting as I had hoped), but this isn't a page turner. It's a treatise on the nature of time and a disjointed discussion on religion, philosophy, psychoanalysis and a little bit of history as well.   Being neither historian, philosopher nor cleric, I can't really comment on those aspects of the book other than to say I couldn't always follow the discussion, and frankly, I got bored of it from time to time. Whenever Settembrini and Naphta started pontificating, my mind tended to wander, and it became a struggle to pay attention, let alone to care.   For me, and I suspect for most readers, the more interesting portions of the story have to do with Hans Castorp and Madame Chavchat, the eccentric and annoying Peeperkorn, and the mysterious Ellen Brand. Too bad those characters don't have more to do in the story. Instead we are treated to huge doses of Settembrini, Naphta, the doctors and some of the minor characters like Frau Stohr.   Something else that I found unsatisfying were Mann's lengthy scenery descriptions. They didn't exactly make me feel as though I were there, they merely made me glance at my wristwatch. Get on with the story, already!   Overall, it's an interesting story (though near the end it reads more like a series of short stories, and less like a novel), but Mann could have used a tough editor. Seven hundred pages of this was just too much. It could have been done so much more effectively in 300 to 400 pages. By the end, you feel as though you yourself spent seven years in a sanitorium, or at least like you too might benefit from a vacation in the Alps.  Who knows, perhaps that's the point!
