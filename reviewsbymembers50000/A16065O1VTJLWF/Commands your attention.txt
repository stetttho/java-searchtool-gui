 Because this story is real and the details are often excrutiatingly painful to read, you may have to set this aside from time to time.  But you'll be back, and the story will never leave your mind.  Also, because it's a true story you know the author survived to tell it.  O.K., so what if you know the ending; that is of no consequence whatsoever.  What the author provides is a side of the holocaust that I've never read or seen anywhere else.  How, for instance, were so many people able to hide like the author does?  How did people survive under such deplorable conditions?  Did everyone really do whatever it would take to save their own skins and those of their families?  Did so many people betray one another so readily?  What was it like to hide in a city under siege and welcome the allied bombing that was going on all around you?  Were all Nazis sadistic agents of Satan and Hitler?  Did none of them have a sliver of compassion?  Szpilman answers these and many other questions, providing you with not just a glimpse of the holocaust, but the sights, sounds, smells and tastes of one of the most cruel episodes in human history.  Riveting and highly recommended!
