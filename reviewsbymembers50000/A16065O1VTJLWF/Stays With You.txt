 The 20th Century is so full of horrors that one can hardly learn of the Magdalene laundries and react in shock as though one had stumbled upon Auschwitz or the Cambodian killing fields. But that this particular horror affected so many innocent lives (an estimated 30,000), lasted as long as it did (until 1996), and that it was endorsed -- no, that's not strong enough, "created and run"? no, perhaps "perpetrated" is a better word -- by the Catholic Church, under the guise of "rescuing" these young girls from eternal damnation, is especially enraging. This movie captures that horror and shames every priest, nun and churchgoer who ever knew but turned a blind eye.   Excellent performances all around, though Nora-Jane Noone and her beautifully vacant and bitter stare stands out for me. Geraldine McEwan shines as Sister Bridget, the embodiment of cruelty, and Eileen Walsh effectively portrays Crispina's gradual slide into maddness. Anne-Marie Duff and Dorthy Duffy are just as great in more subtle performances.   Though the production values aren't big budget Hollywood, and the actors are neither well known nor glamorous, the storytelling is far superior to what you typically find on the shelves at your local Blockbuster. The lack of glamour adds to the gritty realism. I was left wanting more, but not because the story is incomplete in any way. I just didn't want it to end.   Fortunately, the DVD does offer more in the form of a documentary. This movie has been haunting my thoughts for the last week. I can't get it out of my head. Memorable, sad, enraging. If you enjoy socially-conscious dramas with just a touch of humor and good stories to tell, you'll love this movie. But be careful about letting the children watch; there are some particularly disturbing scenes, frank subject matter, bad language and full-frontal nudity that comes without warning.
