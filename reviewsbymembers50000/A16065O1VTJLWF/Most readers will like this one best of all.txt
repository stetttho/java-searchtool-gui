 Of all the Dickens novels I've read, this one is certainly the most atmospheric and perhaps the most true to life.  In terms of art, this is probably his supreme achievement.  The plot isn't as convoluted as it is in Bleak House.  The action is more dramatic.  The female characters, particularly Estella, are more believable and (in the case of Miss Havisham, for instance) more intriguing.  The sentimentality and the overall length are under tighter control.  The humor still abounds.  The language is easier to read but no less descriptive.  No, it's not a perfect work -- there are still cloying and annoying characters and incidents, and far too many ridiculous coincidences -- but to me, at least, Great Expectations is Dickens' greatest achievement.
