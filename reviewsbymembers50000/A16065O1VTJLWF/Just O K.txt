 This movie, with its excellent scenery, needs to be watched in a movie theater to really appreciate the cinematography.  The DVD simply doesn't do it justice.  The acting is fine, and you can really see how a trip like that might have influenced Guevara's worldview and why communism easily found a home in poverty-stricken Latin America.  Unfortunately, Guevara's reputation as a romantic revolutionary is not contrasted at all with his later murderous cruelty and ineptitude, so we'll only see more of his iconic image in T-shirt shops around the globe.  But politics aside, the story really isn't that riveting.  Two guys embark on a trek to discover South America.  Along the way they meet people.  They deceive people.  They discover themselves.  They have a great time.  They further cultivate their friendship.  It's the stuff that makes for an interesting book perhaps, but movies are made to be watched.  There isn't a lot of drama taking place here, and the comedy is merely worth a few snickers.  Furthermore, there are a number of annoying and gratuitous jump cuts that might appeal to the MTV crowd, but I hardly see that as the primary audience for this thoughtful film.  But what makes it worse for the person watching on DVD is that the impressive scenery cannot be fully appreciated on the small screen.    Overall, The Motorcycle Diaries is definitely worth watching, but I don't think I'd want to watch it more than once, let alone buy it forever.  I certainly can't see a big audience for it among today's moviegoers.  Parents:  there is a lot of cussing, but it's not gratuitous.  And there are a few mild sexual situations.  No nudity.  (Don't forget, the movie is in Spanish with English subtitles.  That might put some viewers off.)
