 Parr is best known for the theme song to the 80s brat-pack film St Elmo's fire, but this album shows he was much more than a one-hit wonder. If you are at all into 80s Rock FM style music, then you will love this CD. The other reviews sum it up pretty well - Parr's songs are a catchy but hard-driving blend of rock guitar, poppy synths and a great rock 'n roll voice. Comparable acts are Foreigner, Rick Springfield etc, but Parr has a grittier style both in sound and lyrics, giving his music a welcome harder edge, even on his more poppy numbers. Highlights from the album are the aptly named top 25 hit "Naughty Naughty" (featured in a Miami Vice episode), "She's Gonna To Love You To Death", and the timeless rock 'n roll of "Somebody Stole My Thunder", but the best song on the album is the superb hit single "Love Grammar" - this starts with a mellow synth melody and soft vocal, then suddenly ups the pace and bursts out into an absolutely killer hard-rocking chorus, showing off Parr's strong and characterful voice to best effect, with some great rock guitar in the background. Check out the Amazon samples above, although sadly the "Love Grammar" sample misses out the great chorus, so try and get an mp3 sample or something, I swear you'll want the album as soon as you hear it! It's great to see overlooked classic 80s rock albums like this being re-released. If you've got a single rocking bone in your body, you need this album in your collection - simple as that.
