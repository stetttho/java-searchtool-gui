 1986 was a classic year for metal, and "Reign in Blood" has massive impact, really pushing forward the boundaries of the genre in terms of heaviness and speed. I am sure many people will disagree with me on this, but listening to it now, there are some filler songs which are just too samey for it to be a 5 star album. That said, there are still some near-perfect thrash numbers here such as "Angel of Death", "Jesus Saves", or "Raining Blood". Ultimately, this is a great album that is burdened by its legendary reputation, and the myth isn't quite matched by the reality. Check out the more complex and original "South of Heaven" or the old school classic "Show No Mercy" for Slayer's best albums. Remember, each to his own - the world would be very boring if we all had exactly the same taste!
