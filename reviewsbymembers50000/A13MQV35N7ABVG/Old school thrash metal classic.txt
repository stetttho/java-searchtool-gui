 Recorded in one week and produced for peanuts, "Show No Mercy" went on to sell over half a million copies and, along with "Kill 'Em All", kick started the thrash revolution which transformed the metal scene in the 80s and led to some of the fastest, heaviest, most intense music ever made. Like all old-style classics, it might seem a bit primitive in places, and the sound is a bit thin for such a powerful sounding band, but there's no denying the quality of some of the songs here. All the classic ingredients which would go on to make Slayer the ultimate thrash band are present: Araya's screaming vocals, King and Hanneman's tight, aggressive riffing, the lunatic guitar solos, and Dave Lombardo's superb drumming. Standouts are "Black Magic", "Crionics", "Tormentor", and "Fight Till Death", but there is not a weak song on the album. If you listen to some of these songs performed live on "Decade of Aggression", with the band much more experienced and displaying superior musicianship, they sound much better than here and go to show the underlying quality and timelessness of the music they wrote back in 1983. Anyway, if you're a metal fan, you owe it to yourself to buy this album. Not Slayer's best, but a very good debut and a real groundbreaking album.
