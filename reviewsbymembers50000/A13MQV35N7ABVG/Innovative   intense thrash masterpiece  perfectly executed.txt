 After the huge impact of "Reign in Blood", everyone was expecting Slayer to come up with more of the same, but even quicker. Instead they surprised everyone by slowing down, and more than a few people (critics included) short-sightedly accused them of selling out and getting more commercial. Well if this is a commercial album then I'm a banana - 13 years on, when most 80s metal sounds dated, this album still sounds as fresh as ever. Slayer go back to their roots here, drawing on earlier metal like Venom and Sabbath, but adding plenty of musical complexity & originality, their own awesomely heavy sound, and the usual superb musicianship we've come to know and love. From the unmistakeable opening notes of "South of Heaven" to the haunting closing number "Spill the Blood", this record really hits home, and it hits hard. The frantic, chaotic guitar solos are still here and better than ever, Tom Araya's vocals are way ahead of his previous efforts, but the real highlight is Dave Lombardo's incredible drumming, probably the best I've heard on any album in any genre - "Live Undead" in particular has some incredible percussion (as well as being a classic and very original sounding thrash number in its own right). In fact, this is probably the only album I can think of where you could just listen to the drums alone and still enjoy yourself. "South of Heaven" shows that, while anyone can make a loud, fast, brutal album, there is no substitute for quality, originality, tightness, and (as another reviewer put it so well) PRECISION. From a great band operating at the height of their powers, this is definitely one of the best thrash albums ever made.
