 1. Sell your car, hand in your driver's license, and quit driving for good. 2. Never do any home improvements again. 3. Don't deliberately kill yourself. 4. Quit smoking. 5. Don't become an alcoholic. Following these 5 recommendations will increase your chances of survival about 1000 times more than following the advice in this book. What is the point in knowing how to evade a mountain lion or fight off a Great White Shark, when you are literally hundreds of times more likely to die in an automobile accident, commit suicide, die of lung cancer or liver cirrhosis, or die through an accident in the home (yes, believe it or not, home improvement/DIY accidents cause just as many deaths as car crashes). Therefore the advice in this book is a complete waste of time. Oh, but obviously I'm taking it too seriously, this is a "joke" book after all, isn't it? Sorry, but I had more fun when I had my tonsils removed. If you want humour, watch Monty Python or Spinal Tap. If you want survival tips, get "How to Survive" or some pseudo-military handbook. If you want to waste the price of a couple of good beers and a pizza, and spend 3 hours doing nothing remotely productive, buy this book.
