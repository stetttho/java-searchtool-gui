 In this classic essay, Bastiat discusses the proper role of government in society. He explains that all government wealth redistribution comes at the expense of the liberty and property of those who are forced to fund it. But this is unethical, since if it is wrong for an individual to forcibly take your property and give to someone else, thus it is equally wrong for an organisation of people to do the same. Secondly, large wealth transfers create an incentive to control them. Thus a government dedicated to redistributing wealth will be fought over, so the winning group can redistribute society's wealth as they choose. Given human nature, this will involve giving it to their supporters and taking it from everyone else. Instead of existing to protect the natural rights of everyone in society, the law will be repeatedly be perverted by various competing factions and used to loot the rest of us in turn. The law will be changed from a protector of justice and liberty, into a creator of conflict, a servant of vested interests and nepotism, and a destroyer of property rights and freedom. Furthermore, all government activity requires forcibly raised funds to operate. This means that one cannot help one social group without harming another. The law therefore cannot be an instrument of equality or "social justice" without infringing people's liberty, seizing their property, and eventually causing social conflict and corruption. Bastiat's suggested alternative is a system of law which limits itself solely to defending against infringements against one's person, property, or liberty. This is the only system which prevents injustice and "plunder", without at the same time promulgating it. It is therefore the only system compatible with freedom.
