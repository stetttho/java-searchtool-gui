 The book doesn't contain much explanation about how Steinhardt made his money: instead it spends most of its time telling us about personal events in his life. Like most people who buy books by significant speculators, I do so to learn about speculation and the markets, not to read a meandering monologue about every detail of their personal life. The trading sections are few and far between, and when they arrive they are brief and lacking in detail or explanation. In contrast with "Reminiscences of a Stock Operator", Soros' "Alchemy of Finance", and the "Market Wizards" books, "No Bull" is disappointingly lightweight and lacking in insight. The only 2 bits of interest for me were the mention of "Tony" and his legendary trades in the 1973-75 bear market and subsequent rally, and the period at the end of MS's career where he lost shedloads on European bonds - I was quite shocked to hear that he simply wasn't aware that everyone else was long those markets too. I give it 2 stars because even one lesson learned is worth many times more than whatever this book costs.
