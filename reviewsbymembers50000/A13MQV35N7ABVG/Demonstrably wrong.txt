 Apply the same logic to trade within nations (or between individuals) and you see how silly it is. Would Birmingham or New Orleans be better off if they became "self-reliant" and reduced trade with other cities? Would you be better off if you became self-reliant and made your own shoes & clothes, did your own plumbing, cured your own illnesses, and gathered your own food, rather than trading your labour in return for the services of a competent shoemaker, tailor, plumber, doctor and grocer? Of course not. You would become extremely poor and would be lucky not to starve to death within a few weeks. By definition, a trade only takes place if both buyer and seller expect to benefit. This principle does not change just because the number of trades is very large or they happen to cross international borders. Therefore prohibiting companies and individuals in 3rd world countries from trading with the west is equivalent to prohibiting them from improving their economic position. Read Bastiat's "Economic Fallacies", and you'll find that most of Hines' points were refuted over 150 years ago.
