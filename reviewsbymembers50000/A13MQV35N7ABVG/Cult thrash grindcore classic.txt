 This a really underappreciated classic. The band is very tight, playing extremely heavy grind metal, and the production gives them a great "dirty" guitar sound that sits perfectly with the music & lyrics on offer. But most importantly there are some real killer riffs and rhythms on display here: "Eternal War", "Lost Souls Domain" and especially the awesome "Drowned in Torment" are amongst the best thrash songs you'll hear anywhere. A must-have for thrash/death/grind fans anwwhere - if you like Entombed, Morbid Angel, Slayer etc then you should definitely buy this.
