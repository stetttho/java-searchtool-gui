 Finally, there is the re-issue of this soundtrack - as usual (for a cinevox record) with bonus tracks, this time 11 in a row, all of them alternate/film versions of previously released material, some of them  grouped as suites. Unfortunately, it is not a complete recording. Both the  Simon Boswell tracks and all of the Heavy Metal Songs are missing - but  this was to be expected for the latter at least, due to copyright  problems. It is a very eerie, very atmospheric soundtrack - but it works  best with the pictures of the film to go along. As a record, it tends to  repeat itself after a while, so it's not a CD "just to listen  to".  This is not supposed to imply the music was not good - quite the  contrary. But it loses a lot of its potency without the pictures. For  soundtrack collectors, this is an indespensible record - there are far too  many classic cues on it to miss it.
