 Coil, recently sometimes referred to as a "Dark Ambient" band, return with this reworked re-release of an ultra-limited vinyl record.  But the term "Dark Ambient" barely scratches the surface of their  multilayered, really sidereal soundscapes - and this record is no  exception. Ambient? Well, at least some of the songs (songs?) could be  considered ambient-y. Dark? Definitely. But that's not all. Their music  is real alchemy, this record being one of the most powerful releases they  did in the last years. And, as alchemy is about transformation,  "transform" is what this music can do to your mind - if you're  openminded enough to let it. This is more than music, it is more than art:   This is Magick.
