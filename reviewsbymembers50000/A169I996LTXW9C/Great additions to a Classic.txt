 Being one of the most progressive (yet easily enjoyable) soundtracks of the late '70ies, "Escape from New York" finally returns in an "updated" version.  The sound is much clearer, thanks to  digital remastering, and a plethora of new tracks have been added which  blend perfectly into the (probably) well-known material.  This record is  highly recommended for all soundtrack afficionados, particularly those with  a knack for John Carpenter, as it must be considered a milestone in his  musical development.  Even those who already own the older record will be  satisfied with this re-release, as the new material (some of it long  sought-after by real buffs...) just makes it a more complete piece of art -  and the new material alone is well worth the price of admission...
