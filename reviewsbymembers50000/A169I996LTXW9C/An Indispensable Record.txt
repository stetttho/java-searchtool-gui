 The soundtrack of Dario Argento's undisputed epitome of a giallo thriller has finally been re-released after years of absence on the european and american market. The new label it is on, Cinevox records, who are  establishing a new line of products here, really did some archive-digging  to add new material - and the result is 21(!) bonus tracks that have not  been included in the original album. Some of these tracks have been  released before, be it as a 12"-Single (the remix of the title tune,  which has been quite a hit in  Italy), be it as outtakes on diverse  soundtrack compilations. The rest is really new material - different  versions of tunes already known, unedited film-versions or differently  orchestrated cues, and even a sound effects suite, put as a last track on  the CD, which gives a fine finish to the hearing experience. Goblin, the  italian progressive rock band, had had a head start with this album:  Intriguingly crafted songs, some based on very weird rhythms, for instance  the title tune (which admittedly and recognizably influence John Carpenter  later in his compository style), and on the other hand a lullaby which, in  its simplicity, is turned into something extremely haunting, thanks to some  versions Goblin created. Originally, the film's soundtrack was supposed  to be composed by Jazz artist Giorgio Gaslini, but Dario Argento (being a  rock music fan) was not very happy with the end result, so he asked Goblin  to come up with new ideas, and the band included some snippets by G.  Gaslini, which gives the record a "jazzy edge" - but in Goblin  style. Even if you're not a film music collector, this is a record you  should not miss - it's just far too good. It stands for itself as a very  interesting album, and it has been influencial in more than one way one can  easily recognize.
