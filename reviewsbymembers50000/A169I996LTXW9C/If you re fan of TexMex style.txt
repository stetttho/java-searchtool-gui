 Tarantino is back - well, he isn't actually, but his "From Dusk till Dawn" has plenty of Tarantinisms - and so has the soundtrack. Unfortunately, this album is trying to jump the train of "Pulp  Fiction" all too obviously. Dialogue snippets between songs that  appear in the movie, some as source music, some as soundtrack - sound  familiar? And if you don't happen to be a BIG TexMex Fan, this album  isn't for you. Three stars just because of the last two tracks, real music  score this time, done beautifully (but all too short, just meagre one and  two minutes) in full orchestration. These two make the album interesting  for score fanatics - others beware.
