 Being the re-issue of a vinyl album long out of print, this CD is an interesting way to get to know the various forms of progressive industrial developed in the (late) 80ies. Collecting 10 songs of 10 (sometimes  extremely different) artists, this album still can (and should!) be  listened to "as a whole", as the different styles never clash in  an unpleasant way.  Some of the featured songs are in this form unavailable  on any other album, e.g. Coil's "The Wheel" (Track 07) [for  collectors: a different mix of this track has been included in the german  release of "Gold is the Metal..."]. Einstuerzende Neubauten's  "Wardrobe" (Track 10) is the classical album version, whilst  Cabaret Voltaire's "Product Patrol" has been slightly altered, so  the bass is a bit more prominent. For collectors, this item is "close  to a must" (hence 4 stars), for those interested in the history of  progressive (not necessarily aggressive, mind you) music, this is a highly  recommended compilation.
