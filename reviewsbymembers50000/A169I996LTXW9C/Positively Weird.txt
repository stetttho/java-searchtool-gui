 As another of the "Seasons"-Series, this is probably the weirdest - and possibly the most potent of the four releases. Unfortunately, the track listing on the Amazon page is stightly erroneous, so I take the liberty of correcting: 1. Bee Stings 2.  Glowworms/Waveforms 3. Summer Substructures 4. A Warning From The Sun  (for Fritz) This EP, with a running length of approx. 25 min, offers four  different kinds of music in four songs that could not be more various in  their respective styles: "Bee Stings" is almost conventional, a  combination of electronics and beautiful strings, whilst  "Glowworms/..." is close to ambient droning - which is not to say  it is not highly interesting. Even more multilayered than aforementioned  song is "Summer Substructures", that takes more than a bow  towards Schoenberg. If Coil ever did a song that really deserved the label  "sidereal", living up to both possible linguistic interpretations  of the word, this is it.  The last "tune" almost does not deserve  this title, as it is a very chaotic, almost (but not quite) unlistenable  collection of noise and shrieking vocals, making the listener more than  just a little bit uneasy - which in itself shows it's brilliance: When was  it the last time a song/tune/whatever really made you think whether you  could stand it any longer? (and NO, I don't mean Dancefloor!)
