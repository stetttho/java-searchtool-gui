 Combining old and new material, the former sometimes, but not always, slightly reworked, Coil scored the soundtrack to Derek Jarman's "The Angelic Conversation", which in itself is a fascinating, albeit far  too little known, piece of art. Combining the vivid imagery of the film  with the atmospheric, sometimes slightly eerie, but to a much greater  extend dreamy, ethereal music of coil, was a bold, but very rewarding step  to take.  But, the music, being as brilliant as it is, particularly the  re-worked snippets of "How to destroy Angels", works just as well  without the visual input, as a very important aspect of the film has been  retained for the record:  A female actor with a most beautiful voice  reciting sonnets of Shakespeare.  This combination can only be described as  "absolutely stunning", making the record a fascinating work - and  an album to really listen to.  It is not, as many other soundtracks are,  pleasant background music for everday life: This is something to  consciously enjoy, explore - and exhilarate with.
