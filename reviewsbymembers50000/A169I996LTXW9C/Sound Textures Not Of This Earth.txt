 Unlike claimed in the editorial review, this is NOT a re-release of the one-sided 12" EP released on L.A.Y.L.A.H. records in 1984. It is a reworked and expanded edition that brings the aforementioned piece of art  to new heights. Consisting of 7 tracks, it is a very dark sound collage  that paved the way for the ambient droning Coil later did with "Time  Machines" and the like, but is far more chaotic than their later  works. The first 5 tracks are new material, although some fragments are  easily recognizable as being reworked snippets of older releases. Still,  the result is both new music (?) and a very different atmosphere.  You  must be most familiar with the original release to notice its differences  to the reworked version "How To Destroy Angels 2", but if you  listen closely, and this is a must for this album in general, as it is not  considered to be "background music", you'll find the additions  and variations, which are very fitting and, in a manner of speaking, quite  potent. The last track, "Absolute Elsewhere", is taken from the  flip side of the aforementioned 1-sided LP - i.e. the backside of HTDA's  vinyl edition was unplayable (empty), whilst the CD "version" of  it is 1 second of silence. (If you think Coil were pulling your leg here,  you have not understood the alchemy of their music.) All in all, this is  a very mental record - with every possible linguistic interpretation of  this word included.
