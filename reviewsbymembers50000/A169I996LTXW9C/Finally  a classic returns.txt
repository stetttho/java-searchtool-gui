 When Dario Argento saw Emerson, Lake & Palmer live on stage, he was particularly impressed by Keith Emerson's performance and asked him to write the soundtrack for his new opus, "Inferno". The rest is  musical history. After many years without a CD release of this  masterpiece of modern film music writing, the italian label Cinevox  re-released it, and, as is policy at Cinevox's, added previously unreleased  material, this time in form of a 10+ min "Outtakes Suite" - which  finally includes some fine tunes previously dearly missed on the  album. For those who know the film: The impact of the soundtrack is not  in the least bit inhibited by the lack of visual cues, sometimes even  heightened, e.g. in Track #12, "Mark's discovery", which is an  extremely beautifully structured/layered track that almost gets lost in the  films vivid imagery. Afficionados of EL&P will be pleased to find  "Taxi Ride (Rome)" (#3), which is a version of G. Verdi's  "Va pensiero" (Nabucco) , absolutely on par with their other  Classical Re-inventions. (Interestingly, the fact that it is a "cover  version" isn't mentioned anywhere in the CD's booklet.) The sound  quality of the recording is extremely good, so that the whole range of the  orchestra Keith Emerson worked with can be wonderfully explored. What  more is to say? This is a must.  Period.
