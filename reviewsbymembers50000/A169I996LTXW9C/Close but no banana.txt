 Randy Miller tried to capture the spirit of Christopher Young who did the soundtracks to parts I and II, but he seldom gets straight to the point. He often quotes the original, but even these quotations appear to be slightly  weak, less pointed, less terror-inducing in comparison.  It's more of a  run-off-the-mill horror flick soundtrack, albeit done with a full  orchestra. It definitely is a good score to listen to, but not a _great  one_ by any means.  If you're unfamiliar with the music of the  Hellraiser-Tetralogy in general, you'd be ill-advised to start with this  one here.
