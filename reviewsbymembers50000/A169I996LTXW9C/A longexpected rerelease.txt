 Being first published in 1988, this album was sold out shortly afterwards - and it took 10 years to bring it back... Originally planned to become the announced "Dark Age of Love" album, "Gold is the Metal  with the Broadest Shoulders" turned out to be a follow-up to,  featuring outtakes from, their masterpiece "Horse RotorVator".  This time, the whole album seems fragmented: Some songs, particularly those  from the "Hellraiser"-Sessions, are extremely melodic (e.g.  "Cardinal Points", track 8), others straightfoward chaotic, e.g.  "Of Free Enterprise" (track 10) and "Metal in the Head"  (track 12), which are almost (but not quite) unlistenable.  So this album  is less programmatic than its predecessor, which dilutes its impact a bit  (hence only 4 stars). Nevertheless, it is a great piece of art, featuring  great pieces of music - and then some.
