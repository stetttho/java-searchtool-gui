 As contradictory as it seems, "Scary Trance" appears to be the best title to give to the whole set of "seasonal releases" (4) coil did in 1998+. As always, their music ("When you think of Coil,  do you think of music?") is hard to describe, particularly to those  unfamiliar with their works - and their way of "composing". It is  a weird blend of atmospheric drones, fragmented melodies and downright  scary soundbits and musical landscapes. For those unfamiliar with the set  of seasonal releases (comprising 4 CDs), this is probably the best starting  point.
