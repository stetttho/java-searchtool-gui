 This album offers a plethora of various (previously unreleased) outtakes, different versions and theme tracks from different films.  This in itself is an interesting collection, albeit with a few negative aspects: Many of  the outtakes and variations have later been included on the re-releases of  the various goblin soundtracks (e.g. "Profondo Rosso" and   "Suspiria").  One track ("Il Resvegno del Serpente") is  NOT a part of an original soundtrack but a "plain" Goblin track  from their debut LP "Roller" (though it has been used as part of  a soundtrack in the italian release of the film "Vampyr" later) -  still, it has a very different feel to it than the other tracks and thus  sticks out in an unpleasant way. Furthermore, since some variations (e.g.  tracks 3 and 4, "Deep Shadows", part 1 and 2,respectively) are  slightly repetitive, it can become a bit boring to listen to the complete  album in one go. That is not to say the featured material were not  interesting - far from it! However, the order the featured songs have been  arranged could be optimized - well, what's a programmable CD player for?
