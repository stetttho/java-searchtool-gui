 This record really is in a different style - both regarding the composer and the film's topic. Hardly anyone will say this film was his/her introduction to world literature's best loved vampire, so everyone will  have a certain expectation regarding both actor and atmosphere. And was has  got a stronger influence on the mood than the soundtrack? But wether you're  used to Bela Lugosi, entering to the classical tune of "Swan  Lake", or you're wont to Christopher Lee and the eerie sounds of the  Hammer studios, this one is a different approach to the topic. John  Williams handled this with utmost care: He neither gave too much grandeur,  nor did he try to recreate any of the old styles used in horror films. He  created something new for this film, easily recognizable as "John  Williams, all right" and still, very, very different from what has  gone before. There are very forceful pieces (e.g. "Main Title/Storm  Sequence", track  1)absolutely on par with the ones he's most famous  for (need I say which?), and some set in a completely different style:  "The Bat Attack" (track 7) for instance is very eerie, played  almost completely on a grand piano, and very much reminding of modern  composers of Eastern Europe. Easily recommendable even to those who  normally consider J.W.'s scores to be too "majestic", "full  of pathos" or too "martial", this is quite a different John  Williams than the one everyone is used to - but a very good one.
