 Plain and simple this album is fantastic.  I have now added one more band to my very short list of worth while musical groups out there today.  This band has the lyrical genius of King's X, a powerful rhythm section  reminiscent of Galactic Cowboys, and the freshness of Collective Soul.  I  can't really say anything else but you should get this fine piece of work  ..... and enjoy!
