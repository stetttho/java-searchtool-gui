 This album not only shows off the fine instrumental talents of this foursome, but it also is a better representation of Ty Tabor's thoughtprovoking lyrics.  The band also sounds much more comfortable with  each other, making for a little bit better album than their first release.   "Oh God" and "The Tower" are my favorite tunes on the  album.  Lastly, Ice Cycles includes over 15 minutes of instrumental tracks  that really rock!
