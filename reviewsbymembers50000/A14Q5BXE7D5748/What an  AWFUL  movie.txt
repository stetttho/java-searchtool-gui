 This was not only one of the worst sports movies I've ever saw, it was one of the worst movies I've ever saw.  The script was really bad, as was the movie making as a whole ... the absolute worse thing was the acting ... ughhhhh .... what was Gene Hackman thinking getting into this piece of trash.  Hackman was in one of the greatest sports movies ever, in Hoosiers, but I've lost a little bit of respect for him, getting involved in this horrible film.  What's even worse than this movie, is that it runs for 2 whole agonizing hours.All I can say is after watching this movie is, "I'll never get those 2 hours back again!"
