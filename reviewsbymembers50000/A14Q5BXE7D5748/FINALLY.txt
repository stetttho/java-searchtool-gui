 Finally Disney has released the best and funniest 2 movies in computer animation; Toy Story I and II.  Toy Story I is a really funny movie, but Toy Story II was even better; appealing more to the young at heart than the  first.  The Star Wars references in Toy Story II are hilarious.  Don't  hestitate on this DVD, as the extras included in the package make this the  DVD Box Set of the year!
