 I didn't hesitate picking this cd up, because I have always thought that Chris is the true backbone of YES.  However, after listen to this album, I have even more respect for Billy Sherwood as an all around musical talent.   There are some really cool tunes here.  'Conspiracy' reminds me a lot of  the days when YES rocked bigtime, back during the Rabin era.  I actually  enjoyed this album more than the last 2 YES albums.  There are a few  alternative versions of a couple of 90's YES tunes on the album, and while  I'm not going to say they're better than the versions that have appeared on  the YES albums, I will say they are just as impressive.  Other songs of  note are 'Days of Wonder' which is reminiscent of something from the YES  album 'Open Your Eyes'.  My current favorite track is 'Violet Purple Rose'  which sounds a little like 'Make It Easy' from the YES BoxSet 'Yes Years'  (origanally recorded for 90125) .... awesome bass here and throughout.   Billy and Chris definitely show their talents both instrumentally and  vocally on this gem.  YES solo album?   More like a YES album .... and a  great one at that!
