 This is the album that all KANSAS fans and all progrock fans have hoped and waited almost 20 years for ..... Livgren back writing and performing with KANSAS on an entire album once again.  I was a little worried, things  built up this big often disapoint.  Fortunately I was pleasantly surprised  by the best progressive album in years!  Right off the bat Icarus II sets  the stage, and gives all progrock fans a delightful glimpse of the great  things to come on this "instant classic" album!  Icarus II and  all of the tracks on StE are very complex tunes ..... there are no catchy  pop tunes here, just one masterpiece broken up into 10 long and nicely  crafted tracks!  Other tunes to note, other than Icarus II, are Myriad,  which has a Point of Know Return feel to it ...... Distant Vision, which  sounds like something from the Vinyl Confession lp ..... and Byzantium,  which in 2 words is beautifully chilling!  Violinist Robby Steinhardt sings  lead on a couple of tracks, one of them Grand Fun Alley rocks a lot like  the KANSAS classic Down the Road.  One of the nicest surprises was the song  Look at the Time, where Billy Greer takes the lead vocal chores .....  "man what a voice"!  Yes, all 5 KANSAS members are here that,  were there on the very first album .... plus one (who has been in place  since the mid 80's).  SOMEWHERE TO ELSEWHERE should really appeal to all  KANSAS fans everywhere, as well as, fans of the other great progrock groups  of the past and present (YES, GENESIS, ELP, and GLASSHAMMER).  This album  goes far beyond the 5 star rating that I gave it, but that's all AMAZON  allows!  Get it, and enjoy!
