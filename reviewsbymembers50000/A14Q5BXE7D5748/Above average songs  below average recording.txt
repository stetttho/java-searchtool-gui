 King's X has put yet another solid album out.  After just one or two listens, you ask the question, that I keep on asking myself, "why isn't this band more popular"?  Sure, all of us King's X fans know the  truth .... "this band is one of the BEST bands out there", but  this fact should be common knowledge among other music listeners. With that  said, I'll drop the bad news on you ..... this is a horrible recording.  There is WAY TOO MUCH low end, and not enough high end on the majority of  the cd; hurting songs like "Charlie Sheen" .... which is still an  awesome song. I also feel that this album is a bit weaker than the previous  2 releases by the band. Make note that the album does contain 2 instant  classic King's X songs, "Marsh Mellow Field", and "Move  Me".  There is MUCH more positives here than negatives, so one  shouldn't really hesitate in picking this cd up ..... your ears will thank  you for it!
