 This is a fantastic collection of Batman stories from the 60's.  It also has some neat tidbits of information along the way to help the novice Batman fan.  The book also included beautiful art work by many talented  artists, including Bob Kane himself.  This book is a nice book to add to an  existing or new collection of superhero fiction.
