 This is not only the best Star Wars movie ever, but this masterpiece is the best movie ever to cross the big screen.  Lucas very cleverly re-introduces the characters from the greatest fictional story of all time!  I grew up during the first run of the original trilogy and thought that  Empire Strikes Back was an unbeatable epic, but no movie has ever captured  my attention like the most recent Lucas film. May 2002 can't come soon  enough!
