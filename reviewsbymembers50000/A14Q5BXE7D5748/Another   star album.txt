 Glass Hammer is incredible, but also very underrated.  In time, they should be mentioned along with the other great progrock bands, such as, GENESIS, YES, ELP, and PINK FLOYD, but for now it seems that they'll just continue to put out one great release after another.  "On to Evermore" is a powerful album with great lyrics and exceptional instrumentation.  Progrock fans will get total satisfaction when listening to this well crafted album.
