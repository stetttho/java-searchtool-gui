 Though this book is now 20 years old, it deals with some disturbing issues plaguing modern man. It may be even more relevant today than 20 years ago. Shawn's down to earth attitudes perfectly offset Gregory's ramblings, though his views are as valid as Shawn's. The evocative yet hard-nosed, direct dialog of the two characters is amazing, and will have you devouring it in one or two sittings, as it did me. If you like tough, yet thoughtful issues in your reading, get "My Dinner with Andre" pronto.
