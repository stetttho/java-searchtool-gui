 I've owned this album for several years and am still pleased by its refreshing optimism and deft musicianship. This is truly an alternative to alternative. Instead of the anger and despair found in most heavy music, one finds affirmations of life and a thoughtfulness lacking on the Weekly Top 40. The most exhilirating tracks are "Take the Time", "Pull Me Under," and "Under a Glass Moon". "Another Day" and "Wait for Sleep" are soothing and positive even in their quiet pensiveness. This may just always stand as the Theater's best album, and in my scant experience of the progressive genre is only rivalled by Symphony X's "V" in pure quality of musicianship.
