 To me, Bergman is the best, and Wild Strawberries is his best. Strong statement considering how much I really love some of his other films. But unlike most of his later films, Wild Strawberries is redemptive, far from nihilistic. Isak undergoes a transformation that is touching and cathartic. This film is a powerful affirmation even today, maybe more so today. I am always moved when I view this ultimately tender film.
