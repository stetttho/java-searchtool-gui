 The Beauty in Darkness video collection is the greatest investment I've ever made as far as music video goes. Of volumes 1-3, volume 2 here is my favorite. These bands make music that is catchy, stirring, and SINCERE, the capitalized word being one that much mainstream music knows nothing about. Most of these bands are European gothic rock, my favorite genre, though there are one or two songs on the punk side and one ethereal number. Though the BinD Cd and video collections won't likely be a commercial success here in the states, they are well worth checking into for fans of underground metal of a gothic bent. There are one or two songs on here I don't care for, and a few I'm indifferent to, but the others are some of my all time favorite bands/videos. These favorites are videos by Evereve, In Flames, Darkseed, Atrocity, Secret Discovery, My Dying Bride ("For You" is my favorite MDB song ever) and the ever-epic Therion. Also of note are videos by Sentenced and Lacrimosa. If you are a fan of these bands or this genre, you should check into the Beauty in Darkness video collection, you won't find all these artists collected anywhere else. A great buy indeed. Now all we need is for .......... to release the video for BinD vol. 4. Rock on!
