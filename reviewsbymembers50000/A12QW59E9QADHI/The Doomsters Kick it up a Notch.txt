 Man, listening to a MDB opus saps the lifeblood away and leaves a listener almost catatonic. Except for maybe "Like Gods of the Sun." While there are a few melancholic, slothful moments on here reminiscent of "The angel and the dark river" or even "Swans", most of the albums riffs have been charged up, relatively speaking. There is even some lyrical affirmation in the form of "For You", perhaps the defining moment in MDB's repertoire. What grabbed me the most from the first listen was this albums sudden yet fluid riff changes, keeping things fresh and kicking. Nary a dull moment on the whole opus. Apparently a lot of thought and meticuluous craftsmanship went into the making of this splendid slab of jumpstarted doom. One of my top five favorite gothic/doom albums.
