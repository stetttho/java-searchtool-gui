 On first listen of this compilation a year ago, I was hooked, and have been since. I was already familiar with "Therein" and the mesmerizing "Aeode". Most of the other tracks pulled me in instantly, namely "only for the weak", "Stars" and "Walking in the air". In Flames' tune is insanely catchy, and Christina Scabbia and Tarja give angelic performances in their respective tracks. "In the Heat of the Night" is a nice cover with duelling female/clean male vocals, and Love Like Blood keep the Sisters of Mercy end of the spectrum alive on "Remember." Some of the other tunes are not as instantly accessible but prove perfect for those dark nights of the soul, examples being Pain's "Dark fields of Pain" and Saturnus' "Noir." Only skippable tracks are New World Orders awful clubmix and Lacrimosa's tune (but only because I don't know German). Take away the ill-suited growl vocals on Macbeth's "Forever..."  and you would have a pleasing atmo-metal dirge. Overall, though, about 3/4 of this album totally kicks.
