 This is the video that kicks off the greatest collection of music video I've ever come across, the Beauty in Darkness series. All fans of the gothic rock genre should check into it. I've given vol. 1 a mere 4 stars only because its a tad inferior to volume 2 and volume 3 (3 is not yet available on ......). But of course buy the thing! Viewers sick of the ......, mindless, processed cheese mentality of more popular music and videos will quickly warm to this collection of vids by bands that really rock with craftsmanship and emotion. What strikes me most about vol.1 is the 2 videos by Pyogenesis, catchy as anything numbers that put to shame the ............... video they have on vol.2. Some of the videos in this excellent collection are from Lacrimosa, Pyogenesis, "Whatever That Hurts" from Tiamat's amazing Wildhoney album, 2 doomy vids from celestial season's Solar Lovers Cd (the videos are really visually psychedelic), Therion, Crematory, and my personal fave on here, Sentenced's harrowing "Nepenthe." I had always imagined this song against a background of baroque/gothic architecture like old angel statues and ivy-covered gazebos, and darn it if that's exactly what isn't shown during the solo! The cobweb-infested black drumset is fitting too. Worth it for this video alone. Highly recommended. Now waiting on Volume 4 to be released on VHS.
