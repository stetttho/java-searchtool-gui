 After their sizzling debut, these Stockholm grungers return with a followup that is more concise, catchier but just as hardhitting as Horror Wrestling. I actually prefer this album over the debut, because where I liked almost all the songs on it, I like absolutely every song on this explosive grungefest. The main riff on "Alive" sticks in your head forevermore after first listen, and the closing track starts off with one of the darkest, most foreboding riffs since the heyday of Tony Iommi (did I hear that he is married to vocalist Maria?). The centerpiece, though, may ironically be "I Wish", with simultaneously the album's most mellow rhythm riff and soaring solo. The vocals on this song win the most yearning heartfelt award, also. But of course every song is worth a listen, then another, then another...
