 this is not only undeniably the worst music by Styx I've heard, but also the worst music anywhere! I mean, no wonder JY quit for six years and Shaw for eleven. The music is the cheesiest new wave shlock ever to "grace" vinyl, and the album is also lyrically inept (just listen to the stoooopid lyrics on "Heavy Metal Poisoning"). "Mr. Roboto" also received NO. 1 Trash video on MTV on a countdown several years ago, and one viewing will show you why. Fans walking out of a show of this horrific travesty--that is all the verdict you need for this waste of tape. Avoid like the plague--listen to their earlier music, it rocketh MUCH more!
