 It's really an injustice to rate this a mere 4 stars. But man, the lyrics on almost every song are depresso to the extreme. I expected some hazy gloom n' doom when I first listened to it, but instead it is overt and continuous anguish. Still well worth buying, though, because of the pure rocking craftmanship. Sudden time changes and tempo variations, whisper-to-slight grindcore vocals, and not to mention some of the catchiest, fist-pumping riffs from the land of the Vikes. If you can tune out the total negativity of the songs' themes, or if that is your mood, and you're ready to rock to it, buy this album ASAP! Matthias Lodmalm spells g-e-n-i-u-s.
