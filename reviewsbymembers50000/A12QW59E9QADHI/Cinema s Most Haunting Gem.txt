 While Cries and Whispers may be only my second favorite film--I can't decide which I like more, this film or Wild Strawberries--it is definitely the most haunting cinematic experience I've ever had. I watch this film on average once every week or two and it is as stunning at the 20th viewing as at the first. The ensemble performances by the four actresses, the matchless cinematography by Sven Nykvist, and the emotions evoked by Bergman's script make for a peerless film experience. One viewing of Cries and Whispers will up the ante in your film repertoire. Cannot possibly recommend this enough.
