 The title "The Quest for Insight" compelled me to purchase this video, since that subjects hits home personally. Emmanuel Swedenborg was a scholar, statesman, scientist of all fields, and later spiritualist, and all-around Renaissance man. He was Stockholm's da Vinci. Several religious experts add to the interesting narration of this extraordinary man, who lived in the 1700's. His energy and enthusiasm were unrivaled north of Italy. He authored texts on ALL fields of science, A-Z. Even more amazing is his transformation after undergoing a spiritual awakening. His intuitive visions of heaven and hell are particularly interesting; they partly inspired the visuals in the film What Dreams May Come. Swedenborg's message in this latter phase of his life was one of love, peace, and good works towards others. This video presents these visions and philosophies in an uplifting, optimistic context. I highly recommend this to anyone seeking knowledge, or better yet, affirmation.
