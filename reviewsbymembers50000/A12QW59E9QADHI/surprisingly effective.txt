 I bought this movie expecting some good campy laughs. And while a couple of visual effects were lowbudget, the suspense was actually valid. Some of the camera work was artsy for its time, and the music fit the mood. There was much dialog, but it wasn't too talky beacuse it was dead-on and realistic. The actors/actresses gave anything but campy performances; facial expressions and emotions were professionally portrayed. What an overlooked gem! Great "Midnite Movie" fun.
