 Though I give Fanny and Alexander only 4 stars, I can totally understand reviewers who give it 5 stars. I did so only because I prefer more "artsy" or "ambiguous" Bergman such as Persona or Cries and Whispers. But Fanny and Alexander is by far the best mainstream film I've ever seen, and this is Bergman's most accessible. I can't believe how thoughtful and thought-provoking this film and others like it are, in comparison to average Hollywood fodder. Even young Bertil Guve and Pernilla Allwin give stunning performances as the title characters, portraying emotion and expression as genuinely as any of the adult characters. I won't even begin to analyze the plot, the film being over 3 hrs. long; see it for yourself. I will just say that Fanny and Alexander is among filmdom's best. Kudos to the master for going out in style!
