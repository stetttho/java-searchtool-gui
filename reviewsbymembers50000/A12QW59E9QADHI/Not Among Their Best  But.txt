 Actually 3 1/2 to 4 stars. So it isn't among Maiden's best. But it isn't their worst either. While there are a few throwaway tracks, Afraid to Shoot Strangers, Wasting Love (poignant!), The Apparition, and Chains of Misery have spun in my player many times, and I have not tired of them. Weekend Warrior and the title track are also of note. Not up there with Piece of Mind, Powerslave, Somewhere in Time, etc, but a worthy addition to any diehard Maidenhead's collection. Cool album pictures too.
