 I cannot describe in words how this album makes me feel upon every listen. The only other music that gives me these feelings is Decoryah's own debut, "Wisdom Floats." Cannot possibly be labelled as any one kind of music. Fans of ethereal, "Elseworld" music such as Dead can Dance, as well as fans of New Age and gothic metal will equally be drawn to this unworldly release. The land of 1000 Lakes (Finland) can take pride in these, their most talented musical sons. Highly, highly recommended.
