 What can I say that hasn't already been said about this phenomenal album? 15 years old now and not aged a bit, just as relevent and amazing now as ever. Easily my favorite mainstream metal record. Fave track is "Orion." All other 7 tracks are a close second. Not as commercially successful (like I care) but actually quite superior to the Black Album, and miles above their material from '96 on. Even edges out "Kill 'em  All", "Lightning" and "Justice." THE landmark in speed/thrash metal. This mind-bending album cannot be recommended enough. Buy the thing and rock on!
