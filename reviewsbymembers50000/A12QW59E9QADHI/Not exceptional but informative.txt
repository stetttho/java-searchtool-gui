 This video was worth the purchase, though I was disappointed in it in some ways. While I enjoyed learning about the nation's economy, two largest cities, architecture, and so forth, it sorely lacked a colorful portraiture of the national chararcter. I have never been to Sweden, nowhere close to it, but from what I've always heard and read about it the people there seem to be honest, hardworking, charmingly shy people, the type of which there should be more of in the world. True, learning about the natural resources and the Laplanders was interesting, but the part that showed the different meats of the Smorgasborg, while informative, made me wish they would investigate national traits instead--the few interviews conducted gave the impression that these are a peaceful, loving, sweet people, in sharp contrast to their Viking ancestors. This is still worth a buy, though, for anyone interested in learning about this scenic, charming, and peaceloving nation.
