 Maiden is one of my very favorite mainstream metal bands, up there with old Metallica. As I type this I am listening to "Flight of Icarus" for the thousandth time, and am no less blown away than at first listen. I just got this album a few days ago, having only seen the videos to "Flight" and "Trooper." The whole album rocks as well. Some of Smith/Murray's most sky-straddling dual solos are on here. To me, "The Trooper" is Maiden's centerpiece, on this disc or any other. From opening blazer "Where Eagles Dare" to closing epic "To Tame a Land" this record is on fire, inspired, and inspirational to so many succeeding bands. The crushing production is a plus too. "Somewhere in Time" was my fave but now has been eclipsed by this disc as my favorite Maiden opus, though I recommend "Somewhere", "Number of the Beast", "Powerslave", and to a lesser extent, "Fear of the Dark" as well. Maiden were at their most focused in the 80's, though the 90's yielded occasional gems as well. Classic power metal at its best! Now to purchase the much praised return-to-form "Brave New World". Rock on Maidenheads!
