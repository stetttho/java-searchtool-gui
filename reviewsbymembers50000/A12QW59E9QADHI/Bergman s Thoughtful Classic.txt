 The quote on the video box says "An Ideal Introduction to a Thinking Person's Cinema." This is quite true. Rarely in film will a viewer be posed with such deep questions regarding the meaning of life, suffering, and God's existence. Max von Sydow gives an outstanding performance as the brooding knight who is plagued by doubts concerning God's existence and his own indifference, even while seeking to do one last noble deed during his reprieve from Death. Wonderful cinematography, too. I would say this is one of Bergman's five best.
