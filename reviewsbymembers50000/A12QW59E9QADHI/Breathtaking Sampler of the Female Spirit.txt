 I can't say much that the other reviewer from Australia hasn't said. Suffice to say Projekt has done it again, combining great songs from superb artists with lush artwork to create an all-around ethereal experience. These songs take one to different spheres, evoking the spirit of different nations while also raising the listener to higher emotional plateaus. All songs are worth a listen; my favorites are "Rajna", "Divine", "Overwhelmed Beneath Me" (which immerses you totally in its sheer femininity), and the crowning achievement, Lycia's "Baltica". Every listen of this track takes me to the shores of that great northern sea. If you enjoy the lighter side of goth, and particularly the astounding roster of Projekt artists, then I strongly recommend this topnotch release--it will take your breath away!
