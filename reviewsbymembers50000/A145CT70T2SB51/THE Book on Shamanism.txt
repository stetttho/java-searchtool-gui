 I cannot emphasize it enough, this is one of the most definitive books on shamanism available to the public at large. This book goes into extensive details about the practices and rites of Shamanism. The author writes about the indigenous religions of societies from North and South America, Africa, Australia, Indonesia, Southeast Asia, Siberia, Polynesia and Nepal. I strongly recommend this book.
