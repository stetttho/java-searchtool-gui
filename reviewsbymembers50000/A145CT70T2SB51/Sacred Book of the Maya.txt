 A common misconception is that the Native Americans did not have a written language. While it is true most Nations didn't, the fact is that the Zapotecs, Mayans and others in Mesoamerica did in fact have a great many books, though most of their sacred texts were lost to the fires of the Spanish conquistadors and missionaries. The Popol Vuh is a creation story and mythical history of the Quiche Maya, and one of their few books to survive. This first English translation of the book is still one of the best and certainly a great source for gaining an understanding of Mayan religion and belief. The book opens with a wonderful introduction that gives a background both of Mayan literature and of this book in particular, mentioning different authors, translators and copies through time. Its a wonderful introduction for a history of the Popol Vuh. It then goes to the translation itself, which includes the Mayan Creation story (which includes the Creators, and several creations and subsequent destructions of the world and mankind, a theme repeated amongst many other Native American Nations of Mexico and Central America) as well as the hero twins Hunahpu and Xblanque and their exploits against the Lords of Xibala (again, the theme of hero twins being repeated amongst many Nations in North and South America) and the kings of the Quiche Maya. Here we see divine right used as a justification for monarchy, a theme common the world over. This is a wonderful book, detailing Native American religions and one of the few such books that is not taken from the notes of outsiders. It gives terrific insights into Mayan culture both today and in pre-contact and colonial times. Its also pretty nice to learn about the early literary traditions of the Americas. I strongly recommend anyone with an interest in Native American cultures and history check out both this and other books in the Civilization of the American Indians series from the University of Oklahoma.
