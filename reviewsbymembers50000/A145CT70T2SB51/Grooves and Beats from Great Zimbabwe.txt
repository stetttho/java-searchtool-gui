 Although it doesn't recieve nearly as much attention as some of it's neighbors, Zimbabwe features a rich and vibrant musical heritage all its own. This CD, part of the extraoridinary Rough Guides series, gives a wonderful, if somewhat brief, overview of some of the countries musical styles. Big names, such as Thomas Mapfumo, the Bhundu Boys, the Four Brothers, Tuku (aka Oliver Mtukudzi) and Black Umfolosi appear on this CD, and their performances are very good. The lively beats so typical to African music are easily found, and the lyrics are very catchy. Even more interesting is the use of the Mbira, the thumb piano, which played a very important role in the culture of Great Zimbabwe, onto the tribal Shona people and even into modern day Zimbabwean music. The music is haunting and melodious, and deeply moving, especially if you are familar with the Mbira, or similar instruments found in other parts of Africa. There is a magnificent number performed by Stella Rambisai Chiweshe, and after hearing it you will understand why she is called the "Queen of the Mbira". There is also a performance by the Mbira Masters of Zimbabwe. Closing out the CD is a thirteen minute football match between the Tornados and Dynamos performed by the Real Sounds. Its a very unique departure from western music, but you'll probably enjoy it. Over all, this is a CD that is well worth buying.
