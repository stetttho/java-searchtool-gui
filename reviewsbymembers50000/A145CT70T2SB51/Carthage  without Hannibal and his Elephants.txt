 Amina, born in the historic city of Carthage, is one of most fascinating artists to emerge from Tunisia, and indeed north Africa in general, in recent years. Weaving together Arabic music and Euro-pop/Techno, she goes beyond more stereotypical musical styles such as Rai or al-Jeel in favor of something else. Something uniquely Amina. Her seductive voice, whether she sings in Arabic, French or English, is her trademark, and its enough to melt any man's heart. And at the same time, the music remains bouncy and danceable. This is accessable, and yet exotic, club music that sticks in your head for days at a time. Amina remains one of my favorite north African artists, and everyone should check her out.
