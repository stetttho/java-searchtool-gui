 I went to great lengths to track down this CD, on recommendations of one of my friends who actually is from Egypt, and let me tell you, it was well worth the time and effort I spent to find it. This CD is an excellent introduction to modern Egyptian pop music, namely Al-Jeel and Shaabi music. The CD is divided into two sections, one dedicated to Al-Jeel, which is a sort of techno-pop style, originating in the '80s, and melding Bedouin, Nubian, Lybian and Egyptian styles into something new, yet uniquely Egyptian. As an admited fan of Al-Jeel music, I was very pleased with the selections, which includes such greats as Amr Diab, Hanan, Ehab and Khedr, though I would have also included Hamid Shaeri, but oh well. C'est la vie. The second set is dedicated to Shaabi, which is the modernized music of the working class people of the cities, often with controversial lyrics. Again, the selections are excellent. Both the Al-Jeel and Shaabi selection are broken down into six selections each, so you get pretty good exposure to both. A word of caution though. As one reviewer commented, most of the songs on here are a bit dated. They are still excellent choices, mind you, but there are so many new releases, and new names, that this CD couldn't possibly reveal everything about Egyptian pop. Still, considering how hard it is to get a hold of Egyptian pop music in the United States, this might still be your best introduction. And if your already a fan, why not. Its still an excellent compilation.
