 After listening to the original "Thunderdrums" I went on a wild goose chase for this CD. Let me tell you, it was worth it. The first CD embodied the primordial passion of the drum, but this CD goes one step further! Fitzgerald has learned to adapt the musical influences of other cultures. What results may not always be the most authentic, but it does an excellent job of embodying the feeling of mystery and exoticism. "Beyond the Wall" seems to call upon the imagery of Imperial China, as well as the Mongols, Qipchaqs and other steppe nomads, while the ephemeral "Eyes of Allah" draws upon the cultures of the Middle East and Persia. "Wakan Tanka" calls to mind the days of the Native Americans on the Great Plains, and "Dawn Dance" seems to draw upon Pacific Islander music. Others, like "Aire Colombia", "The Passion", "My Island" and "The Great White Shame" are even more interesting in that they seem to combine aspects of African, Middle Eastern, Native American, Australian Aborigine and Pacific Islander influences. I am very impressed.
