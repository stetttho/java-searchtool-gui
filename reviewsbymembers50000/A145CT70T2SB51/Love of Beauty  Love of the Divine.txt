 This CD is absolutely one of my favorites. It is a collaboration between Loga Ramin Torkian (Axiom of Choice) and Azam Ali (Vas) which transcends generes. Elements of Qawwali and Persian classical music fuse seemlessly with New Age, electronica and Ali's hauntingly beautiful vocals. Drawn from a rich history of Farsi and Urdu poetry, this music is love for the divine in it's purest form. Like Sufism, it transcends language and religious denomination. It's pure love... dark, eerie and wonderful all at once. I LOVE this CD, and strongly recommend it for anyone who loves Middle Eastern or South Asian music, or wants to explore it.  Songs like Nahan, Allah Allahi and The Hunt stay with you long after you listen to this CD. If your a fan of Vas, Natacha Atlas, Dead Can Dance, or similar groups, you owe it to yourself to check this CD out. And if this is the fist such CD your listening to, then look for more CDs from Vas, Azam Ali and Axiom of Choice (as well as other Persian/Iranian artists out there). I promise, you won't be disappointed.
