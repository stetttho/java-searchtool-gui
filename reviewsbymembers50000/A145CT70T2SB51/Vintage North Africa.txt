 I strongly recommend this CD for anyone looking to find the roots of Rai and other forms of north African music. This CD is composed of various recordings made between 1925-1948, a period of time when northern African music largely consisted of Arab and Berber folk music with little foreign influences. The vast majority comes from Morocco, but there are selections from Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, the Sudan and Mali as well. I found one of the more interesting tracks was Saadaoudi, a recording of the Libyan zoukra (a reed-flute). Another track, Leila Kanat, embraces the ancient poetic traditions of the Sahara. Some of the Tunisian tracks, such as Hayarti Noumi Ouigardi and Aroubi Rasd Eddil (pts 1 and 2), impressed me. Tunisia has very strong musical traditions, easily rivalling those of Algeria, Morocco and Egypt, yet for the most part, Tunisian malouf (and other generes) has yet to become as widely heard in the west as, say Algerian rai or Egyptian al-jeel. These Tunisian tracks were extremely welcome. The Algerian songs too, were quite interesting. As I said, these songs are the very roots of rai music. If you like Khaled, Cheb Mami, Cheikha Remitti and so forth, you will love the tracks from Algeria. And finally, rounding out the CD are some other odds and ends. The most interesting being a Tuareg war chant from Timbuktu. I think that may have been the most unusual track on the entire CD. Overall, though, is an excellent selection of north African folk music. Check it out, especially if you like Rai.
