 Its kind of hard to come across even half-way decent books about groups like the Hashashyinn, Thuggee, Knights Templar and other "secret" societies. In part because so much [stuff] has been written of them in the past, and after a while it just becomes impossible to seperate truth from fiction. Nonetheless, Lewis does a decent job of presenting a history of the Assassins, or at least from what we can make of it. The most important thing to remember here is that the Assassins were not following mainstream Islam. Indeed, as the title suggest, they were following a very radical heresy only loosely connected to Islam. Sort of like the Inquisition and numerous cults in the modern era only nominally follow Christianity. Therefore, Lewis had to spend more time discussing the group's beliefs and formation than their activities. For the most part, he describes the Assassins, what they did, and their brief history, and leaves it at that. Over all, it's a quick decent read, but likely to be of interest to you only if you already have some interest in the Assassins or the time period. A casual reader may very well be left perplexed after reading this book however. In the end, all I can really say is that if you want a brief history of the Assassins, then by all means go out and get this book. It really is a nice book about them. If, however, you want information on real Islam, the Crusades, other secret societies, assassinations in general or some other topic, this book would be of limited use to you.
