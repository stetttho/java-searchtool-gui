 Another excellent CD from Mickey Hart's "The World" series, this one focuses in upon the Afro-Latin musical and religious traditions. Back in the height of the slave trade, a number of Africans of the Yoruba and Dahomey nations were transported across the Atlantic, where they continued to practice their religious traditions, giving rise to Voodoo, Candomble, Santeria, Obeah, Shango, Hoodoo and countles other religious traditions. This CD, filled with excellent historical recordings, explores the strong relation between the Afro-Latin religions and their musical traditions. Whats more, these same African-based rhythms would eventually give rise to various other forms of music, suc as Salsa, Rumba, Reggae, Rap, Jazz, the Blues, Rock 'n Roll, Gospel and countless others. Naturally, a complete survey of the region would never be able to fit onto a single CD, so this CD instead focuses upon Cuban Santeria, Brazilian Candomble, Haitian Voodoo and Shango of Trinidad. Its fascinating to see how these religions, themselves a meld of African, Native American and European influences, served to bridge cultural and musical gaps between groups. There are a number of invocations to various Orishas and Loas on this CD. I found it very appropriate that the CD started out with an invocation to Legba, the opener of the doorways in Voodoo, who is always invoked before any ceremony. In a way, this CD is a ceremony in and of itself, a spiritua journey through the Afro-Latin world. People unfamilar with these religions may also be interested in hearing the Ketu songs of Candomble, or the Itutu funeral song of Santeria. The one thing, however, I must say is that you must remember this music is sacred music, carrying a deep religious meaning with it. Please remember that when listenin to this music, and give it the respect it deserves.
