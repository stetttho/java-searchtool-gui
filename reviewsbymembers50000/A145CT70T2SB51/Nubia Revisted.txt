 This recently re-released CD, formerly available under the title "Escalay: the Water Wheel" features three of Hamza el-Din's greatest performances. Drawing firmly upon his lively and exotic Nubian background, Hamza weaves it together with his natural gift for playing the oud (an istrument of Arab rather than Nubian origin). This CD is unlike anything you have ever heard before. Although there are many similarities with other Middle Eastern and African styles (due to shared history and cultures from Egypt to Ethiopia) it is still unique and beautiful. Check it out.
