 One problem facing Western scholars with an interest in the indigenous Bon religion of Tibet is that there is a noticable lack of translations of Bon scriptures in the West. Indeed, there are very few Bon scriptures in translation at all, and those that do exist are often expensive and difficult to acquire. This book gives two translations of Bon scripture ("The Twelve Little Tantras" and "The View Which is Like the Lion's Roar") complete with corresponding and transliterated Zhang-Zhung text. Granted, we can safely assume that this is of little use to the casual reader (even those with a serious interest in shamanic traditions or Tibetan culture), and that a good scholar would be able to read Zhang-Zhung in its native script, but this is a small detail. Furthermore, the book is full of notes and commentary. Overall, I strongly recommend this book for anyone with a scholarly interest in Tibetan religion, especially those familar with Tibetan languages. Casual readers still will have to look about for a more generalized book about the Bon religion and its cultural traditions, but should find this book quite interesting as well.
