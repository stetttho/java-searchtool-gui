 Let me start out by saying that I have been a fan of DCD since I was in high school, I own all their recordings, and have seen them perform live. This CD is perhaps the greatest tribute that could be given to Lisa and Brendan, and I strongly suggest that anyone who likes Dead Can Dance go out and buy this CD. It's dark, haunting and beautiful, and it's put out by the Projekt label, which is really good at that sort of thing.  Some of the best bands step up to perform songs done by Dead Can Dance on this CD - Faith & the Muse, Black Tape for a Blue Girl, Mirabilis, Arcana, Rajna, Chandeen, Autumn's Grey Solace.... The artists clearly respect DCD and have a sensitive ear for their music. It's not copying, but rather a tribute, and it serves very well in that regard. From Rajna's "Cantara" to BTfaBG's "Fortune Presents Gifts Not According to the Books" to Arcana's "Engima of the Absolute", every single song on here is worth hearing. I have since bought Arcana's CD Le Serpent Rouge and several Rajna CDs, also available from Projekt. Trust me, if your a fan of DCD, you can't go wrong with this CD.
