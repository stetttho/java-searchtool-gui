 Following on the heels of Arabic Groove (easily one of the most played CDs in my collection), this CD draws upon techno-fusion tracts from India and Pakistan. If you've ever heard remixes of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, you will know just how moving and seductive this music can be. Its a wonderful romp through South Asian music. Bhangra legend Bally Sagoo has a moving number on the CD. However, the most interesting song comes from Yulduz Usmanova of Uzbekistan (which, granted drifts from the South Asian focus, but is deeply appreciated anyway). Her moving tract combines Uzbek folk music and western sensabilities to create a vivid and beautiful image of life on the steppes. Definately a keeper.
