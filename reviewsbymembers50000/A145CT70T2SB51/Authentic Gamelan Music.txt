 Yet another magnificent CD from Mickey Hart's "The World" series, this time focusing in upon historical recordings of Indonesian music. The most noticable music on here is, naturally, the Gamelan music. I love it. I bought this CD hoping to learn more about Southeast Asian classical music and I was not at all disappointed. In fact, this CD helped kindle my interest in Gamelan music. If you've never herd the beautiful sounds of Balinese Gamelan orchestras, this CD will really get you hooked. If your already a fan, then why haven't you bought this CD yet? I love it and you will too. Not that the only music on here is Gamelan. There are other styles as well, just not as well represented. One of the must unique of which is the Kecak or "monkey chant". I should also point out that the music here is all raditional, and in some cases vastly different from the modern music you'd here in Bali today. Also, a wide range of regions within Indonesia are represented (a great feat considering that Indonesia is such a large region).
