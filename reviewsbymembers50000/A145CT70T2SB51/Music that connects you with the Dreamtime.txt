 This music is some of the most beautiful and spiritual Aboriginal music I think I have ever heard. Its very modern and upbeat, but at the same time has a definate connection to the Aboriginal culture. I can't stress this CD enough. If you are into New Age or World Music, you owe it to yourself to check this CD out.
