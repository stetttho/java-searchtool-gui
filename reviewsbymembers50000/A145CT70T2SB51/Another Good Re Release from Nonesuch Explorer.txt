 This CD, originally released as "Kenya & Tanzania: Witchcraft and Ritual Music", has recently been re-released, and I couldn't be happier. While I would have liked to see the use of the word "witch" removed in favor of something less offensive (witchcraft is still very feared in much of Africa), this CD remains a wonderful addition to any collection of African music. Drawing from recordings of indigenous religious practices in Kenya and Tanzania, this CD provides an excellent anthology of tribal healing, rites of passage and ceremonies. And this is not modern either. The music here is an excellent survey of authentic tribal music, with a deep religious significance. Even if you cannot understand the lyrics, the music will reach out and touch your soul. After all, music is healing. Give this CD a shot.
