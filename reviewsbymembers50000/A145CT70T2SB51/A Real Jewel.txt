 Let me tell you, this is a real jewel. It is an excellent introduction to the contemporary music of Native America, or a great addition to your collection if your interested. One of the great things about this is that it takes Native American music from across both continents. Too often I've seen Native American music CDs that ignore Latin American Indians completely. This one is an excellent break from that and includes Native American musicians from almost every region, ranging from Alaska and Canada, into the United States, down to Mexico, into the Amazon and over to the Andes. The musicians on this album are all top notch. Among them, include legendary flutist Bill Miller, Marlui Miranda, who incorporates Amazonian tribal music with modern music, the hauntingly beautiful duo of Tudjaat and the Incan pan pipes of Bolivia Manta. Most of the songs, such as "Vale do Jauari", "Akua Tuta", "Nendaa - Go Back", and "Ni'bixi dxi Zina", have a wonderful ephemeral sound to them. Simply breath taking. I cannot over emphasize how wonderful this CD is.
