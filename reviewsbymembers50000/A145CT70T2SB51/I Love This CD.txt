 ... Every single song on this CD is excellent. It was for a benefit for the Honor the Earth Foundation to raise awareness about the Native American plight. The result is somewhat difficult to explain. Its not traditional Native American music, nor is it some New Agey pop music. Instead, its a hauntingly beautiful, ephemeral look at Native American culture through music. Any attempts to force it into a specific genere will fail automatically. Theres two excellent numbers by Ulali, complete with a really cool sounding drum. "Wise Users", "The Things We Do" and "Crazy Life" are all excellent and stick in your head after hearing them, while the lyrics to "The Future is a War", "Wounded Knee" and "Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee" really dig down deep. John Trundell's "Out of the Blue" and the "One Knee Gospel" are both hauntingly beautiful and "Creation Story" just sounds great. And then theres the epheemral sound to "4R Ancestors". However, the high point on this collection is Rusted Root's "Scattered". Much better than the version on Cruel Sun. In the end, I can only say "buy this CD NOW!"
