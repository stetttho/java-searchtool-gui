 Don't come to this CD expecting nganga, cannibalism and dark witchcaft. Nor should you come to this CD expecting contemporary African music (although you could see some of my other reviews for that). Instead, this CD is a survey of the religious and healing musical traditions in Kenya and Tanzania. Made at a time when many traditions were all but unknown to the outside world, the detailed linear notes do show some dating. For instance, I'm not sure the term "witch" or "witchdoctor" should even be used. Given the negative view of witches in African culture, the term shaman or priest might be more appropriate. None the less, the music here is still potent. This is real tribal music, focusing on healing traditions, as well as spirituality and rites of passage. Give this CD a look.
