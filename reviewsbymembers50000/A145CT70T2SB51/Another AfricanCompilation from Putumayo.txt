 This is an excellent collection of African music, gathered from across the continent, by Putumayo, one of the leading names in world music. Unlike many other African compilations, this one focuses primarily one Africa's vibrant, and yet, oft overlooked, aucoustic music traditions, and I must admit, even with my familiarity with African music, I was still blown away. The selections on here are pretty good, considering the sheer diversity of African musicians. Some of you may be familiar with artists like Tuku and Habib Koite, and needless to say, their contributions are excellent, nothing less than one would expect from artists of their integrity. We also get an attempt by Les Go to blend traditional Cote d'Ivorie music with moden pop, a reggae influenced number from Doctor King'esi, a folksy South African song from Aura Msimang, and a song by Seydu featuring the use of the Mbira (thumb piano). Towards the end of the CD, Putumayo seems to lean very heavily towards the traditions of Mali, which many of you should be familar with. Much of the music features an ephemeral, soulful aspect. However, theres no mistaking this music for anything but African.
