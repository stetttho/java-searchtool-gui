 Although Beborn Beton remains an obscure band, they nonetheless are extremely talented and make some of the greatest electronica-darkwave music around. All of their works have a dancey, ephemeral, dark quality about them that makes them easy to appreciate. This CD in particular stands out in my opinion as their greatest album. Aside from Another World, which has become one of their most familar songs in clubs across Europe and the US, there are many other great tracks on here. The dark song Game of Fools gives way perfectly to the fast paced Stranger, and Conspiracy is just an amazing song to listen to. The more mellow songs like Bittersweet and Angel One are likewise enjoyable. The song New Born King is also pretty fun. Just listen to the lyrics and you'll appreciate it, even if you find the idea of an extraterrestrial Jesus blasphemous. Deeper Than the Usual Feeling and it's Reprise (which closes out the CD) are equally enjoyable, if dark and emotionally charged. Overall, I cannot express how wonderful this CD is. Trust me, you shall enjoy it. And check out their other CDs while your at it. The only bad thing I would say about this CD is that it lacks Peach, one of my favorite songs. But *shrugs*. ANyway, this is a great CD!
