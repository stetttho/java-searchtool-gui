 Mahmoud Ahmed is perhps one of Ethiopia's most well known artists abroad. His CD, "Ere Mela Mela" gained something of a cult following in Ethiopia, and is still probably the greatest single CD covering Ethiopian music. This CD, part of the excellen Ethiopiques series, is a compilation album, drawing together some of his greatest hits over the years. However, don't come to this CD, or anything in the Ethiopiques series, expecting traditional Ethiopian church or tribal music. This CD, like the others in the series, deals with the brassy, urban jazz from the golden years of Ethiopia's recording industry. The songs on this CD are dancy and exotic, but at the same time not unfamilar to the west. Its Ethio-jazz! Listening to this CD, its easy to draw similarities between African and American music. However, if your a true fan of Mahmoud Ahmed, I recommend Ethiopiques vol. 7, which features an expanded and remastered version of Mahmoud Ahmed's legendary "Ere Mela Mela". Enjoy!
