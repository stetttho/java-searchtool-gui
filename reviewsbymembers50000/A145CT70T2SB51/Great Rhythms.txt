 This CD features Babatunde Olatunji at his best. Some people may be familar with Olatunji and his style, but this CD is very different from the music he usually performs. It is more primordial, spiritual and emotionally charged. The music on here is an invocation to the Orshas, the Yoruba Gods, who were trnspoted across the Atlantic where their followers formed the religions of Santeria, Candomble and the like. I found the invocation to Sango (Shango in the Carribean), the masculine Orisha of warfare, storms and fire, to be particularly moving. The emotion with which Olatunji performs on this CD is amazing. I am impressed with this CD. It is very moving, but I also must remind you that the music on this CD does hold considerable religious significance to the Yoruba people, and as such deserves a good deal of respect.
