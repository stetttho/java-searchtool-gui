 Famed Egyptologist Sir E.A. Wallis Budge, known for his translations of the Papyrus of Ani and other Egyptian works, also turned his attention southward to Nubia and Abyssinia, roughly the lands of southern Egypt, the Sudan and Ethiopia in the modern age. As could be expected, there is a strong connection between Nubia, Abyssinia and Egypt; for instance, the Nubians DID conquer Egypt at one point and the Coptic Church spread to Ethiopia. As such, Budge is an excellent person to write this book. The one comment I will make is that it is somewhat dated. Budge, while still quite admirable, displays some of the common failings of his day. Nonetheless, as this book was written during Ethiopia's historic years, I still recommend that anyone with an interest in Ethiopia (or all things Ethiopian) check this book out if possible. Its well worth the time to read.
