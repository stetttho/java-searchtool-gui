 While not quite on par with "Gedida", this is still a definate crowd pleaser. Theres a lot more of a western influence on this CD, in my opinion anyway. Natacha's style is still a definite mix though, combining both the sensabilities of western music and the stylistic elements of Egyptian/Arabic pop music. The result is uniquely Natacha Atlas, but appeals to both fans of western music and Arabic pop. If you listen to her, your hooked. Her beautiful, seductive voice just sort of drags you in. She is definately one of the most wonderful singers out there. Her songs "Amulet" and "Layli" are just so atmospheric and beautiful (check them out; you can listen to them here). She goes on to do mind-blowing songs lie "Sweeter Than Any Sweets", "Andeel" and "Y Albi Ehda". I cannot put into mere words the splendor which is her voice. Just give this CD a shot. Even if you have never heard Arabic pop music in the past, you might find yourself dancing along to her voice.
