 I really must admit that I enjoy reading Mickey Hart's works. They are very philosophical, showing how music and spirituality are connected together throughout time. In this book, he mixes his own thoughts and ideas with a variety of quotes about music and some nice clip art of music, dancing, instruments and musicians. The quotes are grouped together through chapters of related concepts, such as spirituality, the cosmos and society and span almost every source from traditional Chinese, Greek and Islamic traditions to Jerry Garcia, Ice-T, Bob Marley, Miles Davis, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Peter Gabriel and John Updike. Interesting figures such as Nietzsche, Tolstoy, Plato, Confucious, Einstein, Ishaq ibn Ibrahim, Rumi, Mircea Eliade, Ruth Inge-Heinz, Ayatollah Khomeini, Martin Luther, Inayat Khan, Mencious, Karl Marx and many more are quoted too. This isn't really deep reading, but it is very interesting and thought-provoking nonetheless. Every single quote will make you rethink the way you listen to music and what exactly it means to you. I think that any music fan should at least glance this book over.
