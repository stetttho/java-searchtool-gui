 Another gem from Canyon Record's archives, this collection features a compilation of social and ceremonial dances (Bear Dance, Sun Dance and War Dances; ) from the Ute Nation. Traditionally making their home in the southern Rockies and the great basin, the Ute were quick to adopt the "horse culture" of neighboring Plains Indians. This is even reflected in their pow wow music, which is performed in the northern style. Its really enjoyable and moving music. At least if you enjoy powwow music. If not, I still think you should listen to this to get a feel for what real Indian music sounds like. As with most authentic (read noncommercial) drums, the songs here are not given titles, just generes. Some of the songs, like the Bear Dances, are unique to the Ute. Others, like the Sun Dance, are general to most Plains Nations. I'm not sure I agree with the recording of such a holy ceremony, but that aside I still feel that this is probably one of the best northern drums I have in my CD collection, and I strongly recommend this to both fans of powwow music and students of Indian culture.
