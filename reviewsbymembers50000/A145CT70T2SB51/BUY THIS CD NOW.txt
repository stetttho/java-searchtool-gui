 This CD is perhaps the most beautiful and accessable CD of Middle Eastern music available in the west. I first heard this CD while with one of my Arabic friends, and I fell in love with it instantly. This CD covers a variety of styles, ranging from world fusion to Egyptian pop to Algerian Rai and almost everything in between. The name of this CD comes from the song "Desert Rose", which features Sting with Cheb Mami. A particularly haunting remix of this song is featured on this CD. There is a definate slant towards Rai on this CD. Aside from Cheb Mami, this CD also features superb selections from such legendary names as Khaled (THE King of Rai), Faudel, Rachid Taha, and another track from Cheb Mami. Theres also another western fusion, from Soraya, which I found to be particularly beautiful and moving. This CD also features two songs from two of the greatest female musicians of all time: Natacha Atlas' "Mon Amie La Rose" and Amina's "Dis Moi Pourquoi". Both of these women possess hauntingly beautiful voices, and both give excellent performances on this CD. Theres also an excellent song from the Trans-Global Underground. Rounding out this CD are some excellent selections of Arab Pop music. Hakim's "Esma Yalli" was particularly good, and prompted me to go out and buy his newest CD. Latifa's "Inchallah" was also very good. The other songs ("Chie Begam" by Andy, and "La Titnahad" by Kazem al Saher), were also very good. Over all, all of the songs on this CD are worth listening to repeatedly. This is such a great CD that I can't recommend it enough. Just go out and buy it, then buy the sequel.
