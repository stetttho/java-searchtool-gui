 This CD, part of the Library of Congress' Endangered Music Project, is one of the greatest wolrd music CDs anyone could get their hands on. I strongly recommend this CD to anyone interested in the Native Americans of Latin America, or the traditional African-American music of that region. The music includes songs from the Garifuna ("Black Caribs" of Belize), Choco Indians of Panama and Colombia, Shipibo of Peru, Ashaninka of Peru, Aluku of French Guiana, Wayana of Suriname and Maroons of Jamaica. Quite a diversity of cultures, ranging from Native Americans to the free descendants of African slaves brought over by the colonists. However, all these cultures have similar, and yet distinctly different, musical stylings. Almost all the music on this CD is "traditional", or at least in the sense that the influence from western culture is minimal to no-existant, so it will please purists. Alot of it cosists of drumming, especially with the Aluku and Maroons, who were influenced heavily by the African music of their ancestors. However, some of the more interesting songs on here include a shamanic healing song and a Garifuna grating song! This is a great CD. I've had mine for over a year and still listen to it frequently. Anyone interested in anthropology, musical history or Native American/Afro-Carribean culture should definately own a copy. Trust me you'll love it.
