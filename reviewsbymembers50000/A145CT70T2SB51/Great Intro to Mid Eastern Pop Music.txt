 If your looking for a great compulation of Egyptian pop music, this is the CD for you. This CD features sme good songs by some of the big names of Arabic pop music. My personal favorite on this album is Hamid el-Shaeri's "Tohgorny", but I also enjoyed Dania's "Yalla Ya Habibi", Walid Tawfic's "Acha'ak Azab" and the lyrics to Amr Diab's "Nour el-Ein". However, all of the songs on this CD are excellent. Most of them are somewhat more ephemeral, but at the same time hypnotic and dancey. The only way I can describe it is if you've heard Cairo pop music before. And if you haven't, then buy this CD now so you'll know what I'm talking about :-). And, even if you don't speak Arabic (or don't speak Arabic fluently), theres a little booklet with translations of the songs included. Oh, and one word of warning, following up on what one reviewer already said. Don't buy this CD expecting Rai. Rai is exlusively a North African/French phenomena (mainly Algerian and Moroccan). This CD deals with Middle Eastern Pop Music (which, incidently, is primarily Egyptian/Cairene). Comparing the two is like comparing American Rock music to Rap. They are two completly different generes.
