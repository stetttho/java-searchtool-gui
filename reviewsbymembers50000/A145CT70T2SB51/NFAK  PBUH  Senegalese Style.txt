 This collaberattion CD is a very odd one, and many people feel its somewhat akward. Nusrat's vocals are handled very differently and there are heavy synthesizers. However, despite these minor set backs, this is still an excellent CD, and it is perhaps a tribute to NFAK that he was able to salvage this album, for his voice remains just as moving and hypnotic as anywhere else. What I find most interesting about this CD is that there is a slight Senegalese pop influence to be felt in it. Especially on tracks #1 and #4. If you haven't heard Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, this is not an album to start with (unless of course you are a fan of Senegalese pop music; in which case you'll appreciate this). However, if you've heard enough of NFAK to understand this is not one of his typical works, then by all means try this.
