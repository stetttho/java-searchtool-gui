 This is not your stereotypical Arabic/North African CD. If you are used to North African music, you probably have heard Rai, al-Jeel, "bellydance" or something. Well, this CD will blow you away. The focus of it is Arab-western fusion, and is uniquely north African. You can't help but find yourself dancing to these tracks, and the remixes are especially cool. In fact, the whole CD radiates an aura of coolness. Check it out.
