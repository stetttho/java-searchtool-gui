 This is an excellent book, written by a legitimate anthropologist. During his stay in Mexico, Timothy Knab learned from an old curandera, a wise woman or healer of sorts, who springs from a tradition of fusing Native American shamanism of the Aztecs with the mysticism of the Catholic Church brought over by the Spaniards. This is an excellent book, showing the modern day Aztecs and their religious beliefs from the perspective of a westerner. An excellent read, even if you know almost nothing about the Aztecs.
