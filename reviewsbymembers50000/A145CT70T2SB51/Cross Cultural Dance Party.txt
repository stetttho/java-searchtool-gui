 Following up on his "Music for the Native Americans" CD Robertson made this wonderful CD. If you've heard his other CD, then you have a pretty good idea of what to expect. If not, then it can best be described as an ephemeral blend of Native American imagery and dancy pop/techno type stuff with lots of synthesizers and an ambient sound. All the songs on here are incredibly beautiful, from the modernized peyote chants of roadmen of the Native American Church on "Peyote Healing" to the haunting ambience of "Unbound" to the incredible voice of jailed AIM activist Leonard Peltier on "Sacrifice". Along with "Sound is Fading" which features the recorded voice of a girl who was murdered (along with her entire family) by racists, songs drawing upon Native American themes and imagery such as "Stomp Dance (Unity)", "Making Noise", "In the Blood" and "Rattlebone" round out the CD. The highlight of the CD, in my opinion at least, is the "Code of Handsome Lake". This is a moving song about a Prophet who revitalized the Six Nations of the Iroquois, againing showing the influence that Native American culture, history and beliefs had on this CD. It ultimately closes out with the track "Take Your Partner By the Hand", which sounds for all the world like a club remix of square dancing. Very... interesting. Certainly worth listening to at least once, even if it is pretty distinct from everything else on this CD. Ultimately I can say nothing more than that you must experience this cross cultural dance party for yourself.
