 When I first picked up this book, I was amazed. The author has done an excellent job of reconciling indigenous belief systems with modern science. In this book, he attempts to give us an idea of where man fits into the universe and what it means to be human. His defense of indigenous people from western exploitation is wonderful. From indigenous socieites he has taken the Shamanic trance state and uncovered universal archetypes like the serpent, which appear in societies throughout the world, from Australia to South America to Egypt and beyond. He then filters it through the lens of science to gain his own unique insight. In general, if you have an interest in Shamanism and Neo-Shamanism, then this work is definately worth the read.
