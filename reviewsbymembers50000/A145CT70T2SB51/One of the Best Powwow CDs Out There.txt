 This CD is yet another jewel from Mickey Hart's "The World" series, this time focusing upon powwow music. Despite the growing interest in Native American culture these days, there isn't alot of good, authentic Native American music. Of course, this might be expected given the wide diversity of Native American music styles, but there is one style tha tends to unite a great many groups: powwow music. Powwow music serves to bridge boundaries between nations and even between the past and present. It is perhaps one of the most representative forms for Native American music as a whole (or at least, in the United States and Canada). The music on this CD comes from the northern style, from the Honor the Earth powwow to be more specific. It is all authentic and was recorded on site. This is a great CD if you are inerested in learning about powwow music and provides a good point of reference. As other reviewers have said, it is not some gofy new agey CD, but actual powwow music.
