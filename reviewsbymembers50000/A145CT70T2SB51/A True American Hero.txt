 Manly Wade Wellman is perhaps one of the greatest sci-fi/fantasy/horror pulp writters in American literature. His stories drew upon a rich vein of southern folk lore from the Appalachias mixing Cherokee myths with Scots-Irish ballads. His character John (just named John) is a likable hero who wanders the mountains with his silver strung guitar, thwarting all manner of supernatural threats with his wits, common sense and knowledge of the old ballads. Along the way he ecnounters hoodoo men, witch-women, ghosts, raven-mockers, familars and all kinds of other horrors living in the backwoods. In this collection, all of the Silver John short stories are collected together (though there are five full length novels featuring the character, and Wellman liked to claim that two other short stories featured John before he got the guitar). Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Wellman's fiction is that it does draw upon uniquely American themes, and John is a very down-to-earth hero of the common people. As such, it really earns its place as something that represents the best ideals of American folk lore. Definately worth checking out, especially if your into Lovecraft, Shaver, Blackwood and the like. And if you like this collection, then check out some of the other anthologies of Wellman's work. Trust me, you'll like it.
