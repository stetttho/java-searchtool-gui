 If you have never heard Ethiopian music before, then you are in for a real treat with this CD. While it focuses on the music of one particular artist (the famous Mahmoud Ahmed, who bears the unique distinction of being perhaps the only Ethiopian artist to ever win widespread fame outside of his home country) it is still the best place to start exploring the music of Ethiopia. It is beautiful and exotic, and yet at the same time easily approachable (and appreciable) for westerners. You can detect a strong Middle-Eastern/North African feel to his music, as one would expect, but there is also a Jazzy feel to it. Even despite its age this music is pretty sleek and stylish. Just listen to the track "Ere Mela Mela" and you'll be blown away. This whole series, focusing on the musicians and styles of Ethiopia, is quite nice, and there is a further volume (number 6) exploring the music of Mahmoud Ahmed, but this CD stands head and shoulders above the rest. Check this one out first if at all possible.
