 This CD blew my breath away. The music on hear comes from many different people, languages, religions and cultures, all united by the vast Himalayan mountains. Traitional and contemporary music is featured on this CD, ranging from monastic traditions in Tibet to Ladakhi tribesmen to classical Indian music and more contemporary Chinese numbers. It really amazes me that so many different musical traditions could exist high in the mountains. If you are a fan of pan-Asian music, in particular Nepalese, Tibetan, Chinese, Indian, Ladakhi and so forth, then you will certainly appreciate this music. There is a definate slant towards more traditional forms of music, especially emphasizing the religious aspects of the music (for instance, Indian classical, tribal Ladakhi and Tibetan Buddhist monks). It may not be remixed or westernized, but it is still amazing. It reaches out and touches the spirit.
