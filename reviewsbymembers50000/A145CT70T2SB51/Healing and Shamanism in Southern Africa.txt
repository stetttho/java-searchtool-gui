 This nice little book gives a brief look at some of the many facets of Ngoma, a shamanistic healing cult (or rather cults, as the phenomena consists of numerous seperate movements) popular throughout much of southern Africa. More specifically, it looks at some of the political aspects of Ngoma. The concepts, beliefs and rituals of Ngoma are part of the greater whole of African culture, and the introduction does a good job giving a brief introduction to Ngoma, it's history and study of it by westerners. It then goes on to the different sections, covering Ngoma & gender in Zambia, the Mhondoro cult of Zimbabwe as social commentary, Ngoma in the Mdzimu Zionist churches of Zambia, Sangoma as shaman in Swaziland, ritualized scapegoating and the clash between Ngoma and born-again fundamentalist Christianity in Malawi. Throughout the book, the reader becomes aware of how deep and complex Ngoma is, consisting of ritual, healing, spirit possession and, most importantly, as a common link between the community. It is as much religion as it is a way of life, taking many forms throughout southern Africa, and has many parallels with Voudon, Santeria, Palo Mayombe, Candomble and other African religions transported to the Americas. This is pretty deep, involved reading aimed predominantly at anthropologists and other educated people, though certainly anyone should be able to read this and come away with a deeper understanding and respect for the healing shamanistic traditions of southern Africa.
