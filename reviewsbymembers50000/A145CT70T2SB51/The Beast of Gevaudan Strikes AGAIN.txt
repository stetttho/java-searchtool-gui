 From 1764 to 1769, something (for that is the only way to describe it) terrorized the countryside of southern France, killing about a hundred people. While its legacy lives on as one of the most well known (and frightening) werewolf stories of all times, exactly what happens remains a mystery. This movie does not seek to explain the events. Indeed, some artistic liberties are taken. Instead, it provides an exciting (and frightening) possible theory on the events which took place in Gevaudan. Whether or not things really went like this is up to debate, but the fact remains that this movie is easily one of the most enjoyable horror movies of our day. After seeing the French trailer for this movie, I was deeply saddened when I learned that no theatre near me was playing this movie. I had since been counting down the days until I could get my hands on the DVD, and I am so glad I did. The movie is both terrifying and wonderful. Sometimes it even makes you afraid to go out at night. This movie is a definite classic, especially with halloween right around the corner. If you have not seen this movie, go out and rent it right now! It is a true masterpiece.
