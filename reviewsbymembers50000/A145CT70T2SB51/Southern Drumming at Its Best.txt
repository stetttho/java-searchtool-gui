 I'm really glad that Canyon Records decided to take this collection out of its vaults and release it on CD. This collection of vintage social dances (Turkey Dances, Fish Dances, Bear Dances, Morning Dances and Bell Dances) of the Caddo features some old fashioned southern drumming at its best. Straddling the southern woodlands and southern plains, the Caddo developed a truely rich culture. Their music is especially deep and moving. This is really moving pow wow music here, and very unique too. Theres also a performance of the Caddo Flag Song. As with most real (ie noncommercial) powwow music, most of the songs don't actually have titles. But like I said, this is really good vintage southern drumming at its best. Heck, even my girlfriend said it was good and she doesn't care much for powwow music. I strongly recommend checking this CD out, especially if you have never heard a Caddo drum before.
