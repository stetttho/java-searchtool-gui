 This CD is nothing new. Don't get me wrong, it is an excellent CD with performances by some of my favorite artists. This is just a compilation of songs by various north African artists. It gives a very good overview of of North African music. The music of Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, Mauritania, Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia and so forth is incredibly wonderful and moving. Rai, al-Jeel, Chaabi, Raks Sharki and so forth are easily some of the best known generes of Arabic music, and all of these come from north Africa. And Beber music, performed by the original north Africans, is also becoming pretty mainstream. If you have heard it before, this CD might please you, but it probably wouldn't blow you away. However, if you haven't heard any music from north Africa, or even the Islamic world in general, then this CD is as good a starting place as any. It has good selections of well known artists from the region, and its pretty [inexpensive] too. Check it out.
