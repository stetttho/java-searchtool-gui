 Explaining Soukous is hard. Soukous are a style of African music, based off Rumba, that originated in the Congo and spread out across the rest of the continent. After hearing this CD, a wonderful compilation from the Rough Guides, you will definately understand why Soukous were popular enough to spread across Africa! This CD gives a great overview of Soukous, focusing on selections from the Congo. All the music on this CD is dancey and upbeat, like Soukous should be. Several big names, including Franco, Sam Mangwana, Koffi Olomide and Papa Wemba appear on this CD, giving classical performances. Indeed, I'd say that "Cooperation" is easily one of the most popular Soukous of all time. Old and new appear side by side on this CD. If you are unfamilar with Soukous, or even the music of the Congo in general, you should consider buying this CD. Its a magnificent introduction to Soukous. And even if you don't speak Lingala, you will find yourself addicted to this music.
