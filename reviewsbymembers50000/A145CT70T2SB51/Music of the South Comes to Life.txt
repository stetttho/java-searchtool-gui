 This CD, yet another excellent compilation from the Rough Guide series, focuses on the musical traditions of South Africa, which have become fairly popular in the west in recent years. As one would expect, there is a track featuring the a cappella sounds of Ladysmith Black Mambazo, and the heavenly voice of singer Miriam Makeba, but South African music is far more diverse than just that. There are such famous South African performers as the Soul Brothers, Boyoyo Boys and Mahlathini & the Mahotella Queens, who all give excellent performances on this CD. Reggae has its roots in African traditions, and this becomes more appearent after you hear the South African reggae stylings of Lucky Dube. Jazz also has its roots in the African continent, and this can be seen in such songs as "Jive Township", "Yaze Yangala", "Celebration" and "Groovin Jive No. 1". All of these, while uniquely African, feature a jazzy groove which cannot be denied. If you listen to this CD, you'll find yourself dancing along to it yourself after a while. Its contaigous. Over all, this is an excellent CD, giving some insight into the diverse world of South African music today.
