 Pretty nice compilation of powwow music put out by the Gathering of Nations. This volume focuses in on southern style drums (which, if your unfamilar with powwow music sound quite different from the northern drums). This album features some of the greatest drums, like Sizzortail, Rose Hill, Young Bird, Cedar Tree, Zotigh, Southern Boys and the Cozad family. Overall its a pretty nice compilation. Not a great CD, which is hardly suprising, but still a pretty decent fix if you want some powwow music to listen to. If you want more authentic powwow music, your best bet is still to go to a powwow and look around for some tapes. The Hinckley tape is a good southern drum compilation, as are tapes from most of the artists on this CD. Still, its a definate jumping place, especially for those who have never been to a powwow before or who haven't heard southern drums.
