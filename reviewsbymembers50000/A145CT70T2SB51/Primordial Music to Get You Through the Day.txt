 This is an excellent CD. The cover art may be a little misleading. Its not really Native American. Native American influenced, maybe, but its completely original and uniquely Fitzgerald, and at the same time its something else. Something deeper. Almost primordial. This music is some of the most emotionally charged pseudo-ethnic drumming I think I've ever heard. I love it. Just listen to it and let it take you on a wild ride through the jungles of Africa or wherever else you picture yourself. Primal and beautiful. If you like the music of Mickey Hart, you'll love this.
