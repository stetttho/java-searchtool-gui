 Pop singer Natacha Atlas is one of the best voices in Arabic pop music, both in Egypt and in the west. Because she sings in Arabic, English and French, her music is both beautiful and easily approachable to western ears. Although at times she does play up the stereotypes, making her music "more Egyptian", she is one of the most talented pop stars around. From the romantic opening song "Mon Amie la Rose" to the stunning tracks "Kifaya" (enough) and "One Brief Moment", she enthralls you, making you want to dance, listen and even sing along. This is probably her best CD, and I strongly recommend you check out her other works if you appreciate this. Aside from the aforementioned songs, I also am particularly fond of "Bastet", "The Righteous Path" and "Bilaadi" (My Country). Check her out, especially if your new to Arabic/Egyptian pop music. She is definately an easy introduction for westerners who may be unused to Egyptian music or the Arabic language.
