 This long out of print CD was put out by the Atlanta-based Changelings, who were rightly famous for their dark, ambient Gothic music tinged with Near Eastern flavour. Accompanied by violin, santoor, sitar and electronics, Regeana Morris provided haunting melismatic lyrics almost approaching the heavenly vocals of Lisa Gerrard from Dead Can Dance.  This CD, which is sadly still out of print as far as I know, had a good mix of purely instrumental numbers (such as the exotic Byzantium), and haunting vocal pieces (Johnny Ether's Great Escape, which is one of the best examples of melismatic singing in the English language). Middle Eastern elements are very strong on this particular CD. If you are into the dark ethereal or ambient music, especially with a strong Middle Eastern flavour (like, say, Dead Can Dance, Rajna, Vas or Niyaz), then you should definately try and get your hands on this CD.  For the record, the track list is as follows:  1. Terra Firma 2. Johnny Ether's Great Escape 3. For Endymion 4. Salome 5. Mirage 6. Dervish 7. Clockwork 8. Naiad 9. Cherchez la Femme 10. Stalingrad 11. Buono Reposo 12. Byzantium
