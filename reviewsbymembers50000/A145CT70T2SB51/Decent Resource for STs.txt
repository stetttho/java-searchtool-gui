 Either you love the Revised setting or you hated it and I'm really not interested in swaying anyones opinions one way or another. But I will say that I found quite a few useful resources for my games in this book, so its good enough for me. It starts off with a timeline of history from the Mage point of view, including the new plot devices in the Mage setting, such as the Avatar-Storm, the Technocracy's "victory" and the pogrom against the Crafts. It then goes on to explore the Crafts, giving some basic information on them and their fates. Most joined the Traditions, such as the Wu Lung allying with the Akashics, the Kopa Loei and Bata'a going with the Dreamspeakers and the Children of Knowledge being accepted into the Hermetics. Others, like the Hem-ka Sobk, had more mysterious fates. Full write ups for the surviving Crafts (the Ahl-i-Batin, Taftani, Sisters of Hippolyta and Knights Templar) are given. The book then closes out with two chapters, one on spirits and bygones, the other on Talismans, Fetishes, Charms, Familars and other Wonders. These are fairly detailed rules that were left out of the core rule book. In the end, I've found parts of the book useful. The material on the Crafts, especially the Ahl-i-Batin and Taftani, has been useful in my non-western games. The stuff on spirits and bygones is also pretty nifty, as are the various Wonders. But in the end, it really depends on how much (or little) you plan on using such material. There are other books out there (Book of Crafts, Lost Paths, Forged in Dragon's Fire, Infinite Tapestry, Bygone Bestiary, etc), or you could even use your imagination. So ultimately, just look over my review and think about whether or not it would be worth it before you buy this book.
