 This CD is quite ambitious. Africa is a huge continent, with incredibly diverse traditions. The differences between any given cultures and traditions in Africa can be incredible. And yet, this CD attempts to give a brief taste of Africa's best dance music, and it does a pretty good job. The first track, "Sina (Soumbouya)" from Salif Keita gives a pretty good idea of what to expect from this CD, dancey, soulful music from the heart of Africa. Cheik Lo's track, "Ndoga" was particularly upbeat and catchy. There were also excellent selections of Malian musical traditions, performed by Boubacar Traore and Rokia Traore. Habib Koite's song "Wassiye" was hauntingly beautiful and deeply soulful. However, the greatest song on the CD was Gadir Abdel Salim's "Bassama", a dancy, Mid-Eastern influenced song meaning peace, which I found particularly interesting given that there aren't many CDs available of Sudanese music. Overall, this is simply a great CD.
