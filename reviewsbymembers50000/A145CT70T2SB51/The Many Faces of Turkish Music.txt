 The Rough Guides series is a wonderful way to experience different styles of world music. Such is the case with this CD, but unlike most other CDs, which focused on specific regions or styles, this one had a vast array in front of it. Turkish music includes everything from Arabesk to Sufi mystical music to Anatolian folk music to Fasil (Gypsy music) to modern rock and metal. Theres a wide variety of different styles to Turkish music, so any attempt to make an overview has some difficulty ahead of it. Nonetheless, this is an excellent CD. The first track, "Gngrmemisler" by pop star Sezen Aksu is so beautiful it blew my mind. From there we are treated with more pop from Ebru Gndes, Sibel Can and Umit Sayin, plus an east-west fusion piece by Levent Yksel. Alongside this are classical performances by Omar Faruk Tekbilek and Kudsi Erguner, calling to mind the rites of the Dervishes and the courts of Ottoman Sultans. Outside of mainstream Turkish culture, track 8, 11 and 13 give performances by Lao Tayfa & Hsn Senlendirichi, Biro Topaloglu and Keman Cemal inarli; tracks which reflect the artists' Romani (Gypsy) and Laz heritage rather than that of the Turks. Even politically charged messages by Gurp Yorum show up on this CD, making it an excellent CD on Turkey in general. My only comment is that it they could have included some music from the Turkish Kurds, but then again, maybe that would be pushing things a little too far. Over all, its a great CD and a nice buy for anyone who appreciates Turkish or Middle Eastern music.
