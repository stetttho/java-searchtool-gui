 If you can get your hands on this long out-of-print book on the religions of Melanesia, do so because it is certainly worth it. One of the earliest ethnographies of the region, this book focuses in on Australian New Guinea (now Papua New Guinea; kinda suggests how much has changed since this book came out) and the New Hebrides. The introduction explains much about this region, and also makes a point of calling it "religion" as opposed to "mythology", "legends", "magic" or whatever. I strongly am in favor of recognizing indigenous religions so I found that to be excellent. From there, each chapter focuses in on a particular tribe or group of tribes. Tribes covered include the Huli (southern highlands), Siane (northern highlands), Kamano, Usurufa, Jate and Fore (all eastern highlands), the Mae Enga and Kayaka (western highlands), the Lakalai of New Britain, the Ngaing (Rai coast), Tangu (of the northern Madang district) and the islanders of South Pentecost and the New Hebredies. Each chapter exploes their myths, history, religious beliefs, ceremonies, deities and magical practices in fairly good detail. Strong patterns can be seen emerging between coastal groups and highland groups. As the book points out, with Christianity's arrival in Melanesia many of these beliefs have changed. Some have since died out, others changed and adopted Christian elements and still others have been preserved in tact as an act of defense against the religion of their colonial oppressors. Even today, this change continues. Most interesting is the rebirth of Melanesian culture in some areas where it has been long gone. In summary though, this book is a wonderful historical glimpse at some of the many religions of the South Pacific.
