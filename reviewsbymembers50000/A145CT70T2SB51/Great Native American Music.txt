 If your looking for some good powwow music, check this CD out. I love it. It provides a great overview of Native American music, focusing in upon songs designed to honor veterans and warriors. One song on this CD is even a wax cylander recording of a war song from Little Big Horn! However, the most interesting songs on here are those from more recent wars in which Native Americans fought and died; namely WWI, WWII and Desert Storm. The music on here honors the brave soldiers who gave their lives defending there homelands, whethe of Native American descent or not. All too often people forget that Native Americans have contributed to this country, and continue to do so even today. This CD honors those who's contributions have too long been ignored. It is a very beautiful and inspirational CD.
