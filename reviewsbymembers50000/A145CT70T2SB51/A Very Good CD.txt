 Its somewhat unfortunate that this CD has gotten so many bad reviews. It really is an excellent CD. It is all very authentic recordings of tradtional music. I get the feeling that alot of people came to this CD expecting belly dance or Rai type music. Now I am a huge fan of Rai music myself, but I also have a deep interest in traditional music as well. This CD didn't disappoint me. It is all very traditional music, with little modern or western impact on it. The great majority of the music on this CD focuses in on the music of Upper Egypt, with the accompanying Sudanese and Nubian influences. If you enjoy African (well, sub-saharan African) music, the you will certainly get a kick out of this CD. Its a side of Egypt that you rarely hear much of. The rest of the music goes further towards the Nile delta, but interestingly enough focuses in on the classical and folk music of that region, rather than the more "exotic" music that some people look for. However, the music of Upper Egypt was excellent and takes a prominent place in my mind whenever I think of this CD. If you have an interest in historical and cultural music, especially that of Africa buy this CD. It may very well represent the closest music to that of ancient Egypt outside of the Copts. However, if you are looking for belly dance music, you may be somewhat disappointed. I just wish I could find more music from around the Sudan...
