 This book does a wonderful job looking at the global tradition of Shamanism and its healing methods. After the introduction, it gives several brief profiles of 18 traditional Shaman from around the globe and their cultures. The range varies from traditional Tuvan shamanism to Voudon, the Native American Church, Ayahuasceros, a Tibetan Oracle and Hindu village healers and to more obscure practices such as Spiritual Baptists (aka "Shouters"), Nepalese Jhankri and a Kangsinmu (spirit possessed Korean shaman). Naturally, several Native American Nations are presented, including the Tarahumara and Huichol of northern Mexico, the Maya (Mesoamerica), Anishnabe (North America) and Kuna (Panama). And best of all, this book comes with a CD presenting excerpts from shamanic healings recorded in the field. This is a wonderful anthropologic introduction into just how truly global the traditions of shamanism truly are. Its only sad that the book couldn't go into more depth on each individual and their culture, or expand to look at other cultures (Hawai'ian Huna, Cuban Santeria, Mexican Curaderismo, Bedouin Sheikha, Jamaican Obeah, Chinese and Malay folk shaman, Siberian or Lappish shamanism or the medicine rites of the Australian Aborigines, Africans or Amazon Indians, for example). Just remember that many these songs are of a religious and healing nature. They are not meant to be edited, mimicked or altered. Show respect for the performances on this CD, just as you would any other religion.
