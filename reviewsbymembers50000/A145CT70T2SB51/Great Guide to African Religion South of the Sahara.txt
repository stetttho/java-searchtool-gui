 If you have ever wanted to know about the religions of Africa in general, this is the book for you. This is sort of the beginners guide to African religions and spirituality. Its worth noting that this book focuses on the religions native to Africa, but does give some brief mention of Islam and Christianity as well as the role that other religions play in Africa today. Mbiti certainly knows what he is talking about, and gives us a overviews of some of the common themes and ideas that are widespread in African religion, and the ceremonies and customs that are still present in Africa. And, as he points out, almost all African religions are monotheistic. However, the part which I liked the most was the section of African proverbs at the end. If you would like to learn more about African religion, I suggest that you look at this book.
