 Hamza el Din is one of the world's greatest musicians. Those familar with music from Africa and the Middle East may have heard similar sounds, but nothing quite approaches the traditional music of Nubia. The Nubians, who played a vital role in Egyptian history from pre-dynastic times into the Christian era, have long inhabited the lands in southern Egypt/northern Sudan for as long as anyone can remember, and cling fiercely to their proud history. Hamza el-Din embodies all that is great and ejoyable about Nubian music. Its lively and exotic, and yet at the same time easily approached. One thing to note here, the oud (on which Hamza is self-taught btw) is not a traditional Nubian instrument. It is an Arab instrument, but Hamza plays it in a uniquely Nubian way. If you appreciate the music of Africa and/or the Middle East, then check this CD out. Its well worth the buy, and is likely unlike anything you've ever heard.
