 While this book was aimed at the New Age audiance, it is an excellent introduction to classical Polynesian shamanism in Hawaii. There is alot of information on the lunar calendar, the various deities, holy places and objects, symbolism, the Menehune and other important aspects of Hawaiian spirituality. I strongly recommend that anyone with an interest in Hawaiian religion or Huna look at this book.
