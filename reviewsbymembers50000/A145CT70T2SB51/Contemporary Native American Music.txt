 This CD is beautiful. Theres a ephemeral, spiritual sound to it, yet at the same time its so very modern. I can't think of a good way to explain it, but the music is wonderful. Someof the songs, such as "Coyote Dance", "Ancestor Song" and "Twistd Hair", call to mind beautiful spiritual images in your head. The sound effects and lyrics on "Twisted Hair" in particular still stand out in my mind. Others, such as "Mahk Jchi", "Cherokee Morning Song" and "Akua Tuta", blend traditional Native American music stylings with modern rhythms for a breath taking effect. Many of these songs incorporate other Native American artists, such as Rita Coolidge and Kashtin. However, the most interesting songs on this CD are the ones that come from Robbie Robertson himself. The lyrics to "Ghost Dance", "It is a Good Day to Die" and "Skinwalker" are haunting and will almost certain stick in your mind long after you've finished listening to this CD. The sound effects and soft-spoken voices meld perfectly together with the powerful and moving lyrics to create a magnificent effect. This is one of my favorite Native American CDs and I simply can't recommend it enough, esecially for people unfamilar with contemporary Native American music.
