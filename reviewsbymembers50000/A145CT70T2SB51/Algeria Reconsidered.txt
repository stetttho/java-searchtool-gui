 Rachid Taha is easily one of my favorite Franco-Algerian artists in recent years. I fell in love with his song "Ya Rayah" and went out and bought this CD immediately afterwards. The haunting exoticism of the first track alone should be enough to get anyone to buy it, but theres far more to this CD than just that. In songs such as "Bent Sahra" and others, he weaves together his lyrics so well that it truely speaks to the heart. And the synthesized instrumentals are equally impressive. However, theres something more to Rachid Taha than this as well. Rachid Taha has an ecclectic style that, while certainly drawing on his Algerian background, goes far beyond Rai, East-West Fusions or anything else. Rachid Taha defies all attempts to pigeon hole him, and I think that is one thing to keep in mind with this album. Rachid Taha simply is a superb musician, and you'll be alot more comfortable listening to him than figuring out what he is like.
