 I've been in love with the Beowulf epic since I was young and I must say that this translation is by far and away the best I have ever read. Perhaps one of the greatest texts in the English language, this poem should be required reading for anyone in the western tradition. In addition to providing matching old Anglo-Saxon text (for those who can speak Anglo-Saxon; I can't), Heany puts the text into a clear, flowing English without the turn of the century ornamentation so-often used in translations. While I must admit that I do miss the flowery word play of older translations, this is certainly a more accessable and perhaps more accurate translation of the epic. Interestingly enough, reading through it I saw parallels with many shamanic motifs used in indigenous cultures. Perhaps Beowulf represents a shamanic hero of the Geats? After all, there was lots of cultural exchange amongst the peoples of the north and the Saami (Lapps) had a thriving shamanic tradition until recently. The introduction gives wonderful insight into the poem, its history and the proccess of translation, as well as providing plenty of notes alongside the text to help the reader get a clearer idea of the epic. In total, I must say that this is perhaps one of the best translations of this poem and I can do no better than to strongly suggest that anyone read this poem if they get a chance.
