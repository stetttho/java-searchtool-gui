 This remarkable little book is chock full of information on the magic, mysticism and religion of the Aztecs and Mayans of classical Mesoamerica. Gathering together archaeology, anthropological surveys and accounts from the Spanish conquistadors, this wonderful little book takes the reader on a merry romp through the cultures of ancient Mexico and occaisonal looks at modern Indian beliefs today. Theres tons of information about gods and demons, magic and witchcraft, shamanism, nagualism, the Aztec and Mayan calendars, astrology, Aztec holy texts, the Popol Vuh and even the philosophies of the region. Spence makes a point throughout the book of drawing comparisons between American and European mythologies, making it even more accessable to readers who may be aware of Greek, Roman and European beliefs but have little familarity with the more exotic traditions of Central America. Of course, some of his assumptions (such as the idea that a European presence must have penetrated Mexico at some point) are completely false and reflect the cultural bigotry of the time. Nonetheless, looking beyond such things this is a wonderful book for the more obscure occult beliefs of the Aztecs and Maya. Or at least a start. I certainly felt that each chapter gave a decent amount of information on the subject and I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in the magic and religion of the Native Americans of Mexico.
