 Surely you've heard Algerian music sometime in your life. Rai singers like Khaled, Cheb Mami and so forth are well known even in the States, thanks in part to Sting's "Desert Rose". But there is far more to Algerian music than Rai and other Arabic traditions. The Berbers, the original inhabitants of North Africa, still struggle for recognition and identity in their homelands, and while their music is not as well known as Rai, Berber music is no less moving than other forms of music. Djur Djura remains one of my favorite Berber musicians, and this CD is an excellent survey of her works. The subtle but lively music hints at joy, life and laughter and her voice is so seductive. Astute listeners will undoubtably notice similarities with Rai, but many differences as well. Even if you cannot speak Amazight, the lyrics are moving and alluring. This CD always makes me feel good, and is pretty dancey too.
