 When most people speak of Shamanism, they tend to speak of it as being something of the past. This book shows that indigenous religions are very much alive, and being practiced around the world. Half of this book goes into the proccess of defining what shamanism is and examining the initiation of shaman and the healing practices of shaman. The author is very knowledgable on Asian shamanism in particular from what I saw. The other half of the book, which particularly caught my eyes, details interviews and biographies of modern day shaman. We are given a look at various traditional shaman who practice in the modern world, including David Kaonohiokala Bray (a Hawai'ian Kahuna), Vusamazulu Credo Mutwa (a Zulu Sangoma), Usha Devi Rudola (an Indian mystic), the Dahli Lama's oracle and Max Beauvior (a Voudon Hougan). We also get a look at more unusual shaman, including TV entertainer shaman from Korea, three city shaman from Southeast Asia, a shaman/lawyer and a shaman/director. All of these interviews give some a great deal of insight to indigenous spirituality.
