 West Africa is famous for its great musicians. Indeed, many styles of music, such as the Blues, Jazz and Reggae, are believed to have their origins in the hereditary musician traditions of west Africa (particuarly the kingdom of Mali). Whether or not this is true, the music on this CD is particularly moving and beautiful. Another compilation in the Rough Guides series, this CD explores the musical traditions of the west African countries of Senegal and Gambia. Several big names, such as Baaba Maal, Youssou N'Dour, Ismael Lo and Cheikh Lo, all appear on this CD, with excellent contributions from each. However, there is more to this music than the big names, already familar to the west. The songs "Kairaba Jabi" and "Nguisstal" are both excellent examples of Sene-Gambian music, and the number done by Orchestra Baobab is wonderfully lively. Over all, this CD is an excellent compilation of Sene-Gambian pop music, showcasing a variety of styles and artists. Go with it!
