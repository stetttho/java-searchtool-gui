 Whoever came up with the idea of mixing techno dance beats with African pop music was a genius. Although I am quite familiar with African music, this was like nothing I have ever heard. It is a wonderful CD, and words alone cannot do it justice. It opens with Issa Bagayog's "Diarabi", which features the use of a kamae n'goni (a unique Afrian string instrument). The next song, "MAW Expensve" by Masters at Work is a remix of Nigeria's gret Fela Kuti. Following this, we are treated with excellent tracksfrom Bob Holroyd, Mabi Thobejane and Organic Grooves, all of whom perform excellent songs, which cannot be described or categorized easily. Bob Holyroyd "Waking the Spirits" was particularly interesting, with an excellent mix of vocals and percussion. Future Loop Foundation gives an excellent performance of "Freetown," which is particularly dancy. However, the final song, a remix of Les Go's "Dan Goa", is also particularly good, and leaves you wishing that the CD never ended. Ah well, thats why we can just play the CD over and over again. Overall, this is a terrific CD, which I strongly reommend to anyone, whether or not they are interested in African music or not.
