 I love Mickey Hart's "The World" series. Almost every CD in this series has been a wonderful addition to my collection, ranging from Mickey Hart's own efforts to create modern music which defies any known genere, to various ethnc artists feaured under the label, to historical recordings of indigenous cultures. This CD is one of the latter, focusing in on the T'boli natives of the Philippines, a region whose indigenous musical traditions have long been ignored. I had very high expectations for this CD when I ordered it, and I was not at all disappointed. There is a great deal of diversity in the instruments and styles presented here. All manner of stringed and wind instruments were used by the artists on this CD, many of which are similar to those found across Southeast Asia. And, of course, there are also a number of gongs and percussion instruments, many reminiscent of Indonesian Gamelan. Other vocal foms of music on this CD focused in on the shamanic and poetic traditions of the T'boli. I really love this CD. The music is very beautiful and exotic, and yet so familar. The music is uniquely Southeast Asian.
