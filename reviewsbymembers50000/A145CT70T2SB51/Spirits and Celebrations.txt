 I'm kind of mad this book is out-of-print since I read it once at a library and haven't been able to find it since. This book is filled with anecdotes and spiritual quests, as well as a large selection of spiritual traditions celebrated throughout the world. This book gives you a brief glimpse at various indigenous holidays throughout the world. Worth picking up if you find it by some miracle.
