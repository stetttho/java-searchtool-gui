 Another excellent CD by pop star Natacha Atlas, this one again combines Egyptian pop music with western styles to make something that both westerners and fans of Arabic music can appreciate. This album definately shows some of the influence that the Trans-Global Underground had on Natacha, but it is still uniquely her. Her voice is so seductive and wonderful that nobody could listen to her music and be unmoved. If you like Arabic music (well at least Arabic pop music), then this CD will definately be right up your alley. Perhaps the most interesting thing on here is her cover of "I Put a Spell on You". It was sort of out-of-style for Natacha, but it was still pretty sensual so its definately worth listening to. The vast majority of this CD is in Arabic and French, but you'll still appreciate her singing even if you don't know what shes saying. Its music that works without needing words.
