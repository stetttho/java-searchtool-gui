 In 1974, I went to a movie theatre in Boston to see the film on which this video is based. It was my first exposure to Jimi Hendrix performing, after listening to him for years. I was completely messmerised, as was the entire  audience. It seemed as if we were all at an actual concert. This is a great  Hendrix video, especially for those who have never seen him perform, only  heard him. I sincerely hope that it becomes available again.
