 Randy Young's book is perhaps the best way I have found to learn about wavelet theory. It is very direct, simple and easy to understand. The core of the subject is presented without all of the complications of a more detailed presentation. I would recommend reading this short book carefully before undertaking any study of wavelets if you have an Electrical Engineering background.
