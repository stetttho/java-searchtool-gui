 I have just about every Hendrix recording that I could get my hands on for the last 29 years. This album is just about the best. There is uncut previously unreleased material that the Hendrix family was kind enough to  provide us, his long time fans who crave the sound of his music even to  this day. The cuts Jam back at the House, Woodstock Improv, and Villanova  Junction are like nothing anyone has ever heard from any other artist. This  is an absolute must for anyone who loves the sound of the electric guitar  in all its glory.
