 This is a convenient,inexpensive, high quality, easy to clean up cooking unit with a great instruction and recipe book included. More recipes are on the NESCO website as well.  I do not know how to cook. If it weren't for my wife, I would have starved by now. When my son was small, and my wife was sick, he would beg her to get better so he wouldn't have to eat my cooking, which he likened to rubber chicken.  But a few years ago, my wife's aunt gave us a 6 Quart NESCO COOKWELL roaster and voila! I can cook meals that even my son would enjoy. This is probably the gift for anyone living on their own for the first time, like a college student, since it is extremely easy to prepare and cook healthful, delicious meals EVERY TIME.  If you follow instructions in the enclosed recipe booklet, you can't make a bad meal! My favorite is the lemon pepper chicken with linguine. The best part is that the COOKWELL roaster pan insert is removable, is used to serve the food and cleans up really easily. The electrical heating part never sees soap and water, since it only serves to surround the cookwell roasting pan insert with a "circle of heat". This is not a crock pot, although you can set it up as such. Cooking times are usually 45 minutes to an hour and around 350 degrees. EVERY student going away to college should have one of these. They are easily stored, cleaned and provide inexpensive and healthy meals. And even a lousy cook like myself becomes a gormet chef. You can use the recipes and instructions provided in the booklet that comes with the cookwell or if you are more experienced, like my wife, anything is possible. THIS IS A WINNER!
