 July 11, 1999: At last, we can see the mezzmerising performance of Jimi Hendrix at Woodstock in 1969, without interruption, in its entirety, and in full glory since it is uncut. His "Woodstock Improv", Villanova Junction" which until now was only available on audio, can be seen and we get the full impact of how much Hendrix dominated the entire rock and roll world in his time. The video is long overdue. Too many of his documentaries are spoiled with interruptions by people being interviewed and saying how great he was.. we all know how great he was, now we can watch his entire spectacular performance with no interruptions. The sound quality and image quality are superb thanks to the efforts and generosity of the Hendrix family who have made this and all of their other releases a labor of love. Anyone who loves Hendrix or the electric guitar should have this video. Sept 3,2002: Just to set the record straight, this DVD apparently doesn't contain the entire Hendrix performance. It does, however contain all of the songs (in their entirety, unabridged), that over the years we got in bits and pieces through albums, movies and so forth. I guess I would have to say it is the most complete version of his performance at Woodstock  yet produced - I have never seen or heard all of these songs together in any other album or movie. So, I was in error in proclaiming it was his entire performance. Sorry for any confusion, in my enthusiasm for this treasure.
