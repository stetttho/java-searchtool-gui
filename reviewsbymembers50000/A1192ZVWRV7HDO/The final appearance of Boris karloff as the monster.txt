 Although Frankenstein, and Bride of Frankenstein are great films, the Son of Frankenstein was the first to point out that the monster was immortal, and was constructed to have awesome power. In addition, the monster has a  tender relationship with Basil Rathbone's little boy, and points out that  only the predjudice of adults led to his troubles in fitting in with  humans. This is actually my favorite of the Karloff trio. Karloff's monster  looks and acts more like his first treatment (waxen and mute) and thereby  more mysterious. Karloff had put on some weight and looked more powerful  and scary that ever. Bela Lugosi gave the performance of his career. The  last good Frankenstein movie. Boris Karloff is the only one to achieve  greatness in this character.
