 This is a moving spectacular movie about a man (Victor Mature) who, because he thinks his lovely, innocent girlfriend (Debra Paget) has been killed by gladiators, turns his back on the teachings of Christ, who he  loved, for vengeance. He struggles through this and redeems himself and  finds that Jesus does indeed live within him. The performance of Jay  Robinson as Caligula is unprecedented in its impact, and Victure mature is  superb. And Debra Paget is absolutely beautiful, perfectly cast for her  role. A truly wonderful movie for believers and those who wish they could  believe in the promise of the Savoir in spite of a  world of misery and  evil. The story is timeless.
