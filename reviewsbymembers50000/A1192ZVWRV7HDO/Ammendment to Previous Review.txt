 In my review, I mistakenly said that the video  contained the entire performance of Jimi Hendrix  at Woodstock. In reality, there is 57 minutes of  his performance. The 57 minutes is extraordinary as I have said, but I  believe that there is about one hour more of material that exists that is  not presented. Perhaps it will be released at a future  date, but what is  on the tape is absolutely priceless, and of course I still recommend it for  anyone who loves Hendrix, rock and roll, and incredible musical talent.
