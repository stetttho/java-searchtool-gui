 This book is one of the very few mathematical, engineering, physics texts that I have come across in my 37 year career that stands out as a classic to be. I read the entire book and because it is so good, it is one of the few that I actually retained.  The book SAVES TIME. It saves time because you can learn the material without second guessing what the author is trying to say, because he wrote the book to TEACH you the material, not so you could stand in awe at his skill.  Because he took this topic and made it understandable in a way that so few books of its type do, his skill is evident in his clarity. Anyone who can teach a subject like this in a book, with no classroom  instruction knows his subject cold. This is a winner. Big time.  I want to personally thank the author for taking the time and pains to write his book for me and countless others who stumble around in the world of physics, mathematics and engineering trying to get a grasp on our massive field. His contribution shines.
