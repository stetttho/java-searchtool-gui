 I really love this movie. Minnie Driver is excellent as a young shy girl, with a failing heart, raised by her grandfather, played wonderfully by Caroll O'Connor (his last performance before his sad death), and three other older gentlemen who together run an Irish/Italian restaurant where Minnie works. David Ducuvnoy is a victim of tragedy when his loving wife is accidentally killed in a car crash. She is a heart donor. I will leave the rest of the story for you to see.  The music, the atmosphere, Dean Martin singing, the whole thing works and works on you. Great wonderful movie.
