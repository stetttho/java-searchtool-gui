 I bought this cd after hearing and seeing Natasha perform on an internet download. She is as talented as she is beautiful. I dont ordinarily like this kind of music, but I got the CD and kept playing it while driving to work. Her music is fresh, vibrant and captivating. All the songs are very easy to listen to. To have an album with all songs that are tops it rare.  I recommend this CD to anyone who loves hearing a beautiful voice surrounded by great music and lyrics.
