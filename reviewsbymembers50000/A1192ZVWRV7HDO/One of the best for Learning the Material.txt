 I  used Ken Castleman's first edition in 1979 that same year to get a  thorough and fast mastery of digital image processing. The book is highly  recommended, because I feel that if a book is easy to read and gets the job  done of educating the reader as quickly as possible, and it is actually a  pleasure to go through, then it is a winner. This book is one of the rare  technical books I can recommend this way.  The price tag of 105 is hefty,  but many books today are outlandishly priced. Even so, if the budget allows  only one or two Digital Imaging texts, this would be one I would definitely  pick.
