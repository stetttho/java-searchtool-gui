 In the mid 60's, I was told by a good friend about a group of black brothers from Mississippi that had an enrapturing vocal harmony and a sound that was enchanting in its energy and soulfullness. I went to see them at  the Club 47 in Cambridge Mass and then again at the Unicorn in Boston. I  was immediately a fan. This album comes from their old Vault recording (I  still have it) and the sound quality is primitive, but regardless, all of  the excitement of seeing them perform is in the album. People Get Ready is  the lead song on the album, but Call Me and  Your Old Lady are absolutely  fantastic. It is hard to describe how their music makes you feel, so you  have to see (hear) for yourself. But you will get a feel for the electric  excitement that these men gave their audience. I think these are live  recordings if I remember correctly and that adds to the enjoyment. You will  not be sorry if you get this album, and then you will be hooked and want  the others, if they ever become available on cd or tape. The "Time Has  Come Today" album is more representative of their later stuff, but  People Get Ready is their roots. WOrds? Extremely soulful funky balls out  blues with extraordinary harmony that you cant find anywhere else then or  now.
