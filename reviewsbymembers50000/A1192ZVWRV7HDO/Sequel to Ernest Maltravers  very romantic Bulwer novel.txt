 Ernest Maltravers and Alice or the Mysteries is a two part series written around 1834 and 1835 by Edward Lord Lytton Bulwer, an author popular in his time but eclipsed by Dickens and his contemporaries. This is a remarkably  tender story of a wealthy aristocratic young man Ernest Maltravers, who  meets, becomes a guardian for and falls in love with a poor innocent and  uneducated young beautiful girl Alice. Her father happens to be a very bad  apple from whom she flees, after he tries to rob and murder Maltravers, who  stops at their cottage when he is lost. Alice warns Ernest of his peril and  he escapes. Her father beats her and she runs away and finds Ernest and  lives with him. He cares for her and hires a tutor for her and falls in  love with her. She does not know his name, and he has to leave for a while  since his father is dying. During the time Ernest is gone her father and a  crony rob houses and rob Ernest's house and kidnaps ALice. Ernest returns  and is broken hearted to find her gone without a trace. The books then tell  of the next 18 years from then as they go through life and try to find each  other again. Neither one ever finds a love that they shared with anyone  else. I wont tell you if they find each other again. Buy the books and read  and enjoy Bulwer's enchanting prose and his outstanding story. This would  make a great movie!
