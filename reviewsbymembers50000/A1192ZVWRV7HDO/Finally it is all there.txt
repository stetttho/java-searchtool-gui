 A few years ago, I reviewed the Hendrix Woodstock DVD released, I think in 99. I thought mistakenly at the time that it was complete. I had to retract that statement. Now the Hendrix family has released the full performance, or at least everything that exists on film on his performance at that landmark Woodstock festival. There are 2 DVDs, one with the complete filmed version, that the promoters were able to get on such short notice. This is the completion of what we already had. The second DVD is an actual taped real time video that someone had taken with a camera and kept for 35 years until the family got him to release it with this set. Now everything Hendrix did that was recorded is available.  The quality of the first (filmed) DVD is fine, that of the second is spotty (it was mostly in black and white) supplemented with clips from the filmed version where the video had dropouts. The video version has the only clip of "Hear my Train Coming" - the film guys were reloading at that time.  This is of great historical value, and all Hendrix fans will want to own it, simply because it has the whole thing.  Of course I never get tired of watching Hendrix play his music. Watching him play the guitar is as good as listening to him, because his visual performance is a separate entertainment in its own right.  I highly recommend this.
