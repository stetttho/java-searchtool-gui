 I picked up David M Prescott's Cancer- the Misguided Cell at a flea market. I have minimal background in genetics, genomics, and biology, but I do want to understand it in light of the fact that the Human genome is now  almost completed by a company called Celera Genomics. This is going to be  the greatest scientific achievement of all time, and I want to understand  something about DNA, genetics and in particular cancer, since that is the  biggest target of the genomics work. This little book is the best I have  ever read It goes through DNA, RNA, proteins, and what happens or what goes  wrong when cancer strikes and organism. The book is not a popular braod  brush treatment with platitudes and fluff. It will teach you to understand  how cells divide, how RNA replicates a cell, the inside of the cell and how  proteins work. If I can understand these things from this book anyone can,  with a little effort. The diagrams are consise and uncluttered and show  each concept clearly, which is often not the case in books of this type.  Jargon is used to a minimum and clearly defined and explained before it is  used. It is truly a tutorial. If anyone wants to understand this important  field that will affect all of us who breathe, I heartily recommend this  book. I hope my review spurs a demand for it to be reprinted. It is  important and needed. I also recommended it on the Motley Fool (Fool.com)  Celera message board to all.
