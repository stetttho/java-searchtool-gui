 It is a real shame that this book is unavailable. Of all the books I used as an undergraduate Electrical ENgineering student, this was the most valuable. It is clear, interesting, and reads like you are being personally  tutored by the author. I actually did almost all the problems in the book,  more than 30 years ago. The material is still relevant today, as the  subject hasnt changed in all these years. The book provides a wonderfully  thouough foundation for all engineering students. I hope someone like Dover  or IEEE Press republishes it.
