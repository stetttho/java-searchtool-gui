 I bought this book because I needed to know the material for my work. The material and its extent are good, the only problem I am having is one that is common today. It was written by people who do not have English as their first language. What would make the book alot easier to read and less confusing is the employment of a good English speaking editor to polish the presentation of the ideas. The subject is not so simple that one can forgive arbitrariness in usage of words or phrases to explain the ideas. It is frustrating because I really need to know this material, for my job, and I do not need the extra load of trying to guess what the authors meant to say. The book is important and deserves a good editing job.
