 This book is incredibly confusing.  It takes a subject that can be written about very directly and clear, one in fact that's not all that complex (programming a simple Pic micro).  Unfortunately this book was written as though by a complete beginner.  The book severely lacks an understanding of the hardware and the connection of the microcrontroller to electronics theory couldn't be more vague.  The programmer with this board called 'el cheapo' makes a racist epithet in its name.  Furthermore, the PCB for this programmer is so poorly designed and fabricated you might as well build a different programmer from scratch or based on an open-source design.  This thing was a nightmare to use and build.  This is a beginner's book -- and when you're learning you need a good teacher and you need some foundations.  This book serves the purpose of neither.
