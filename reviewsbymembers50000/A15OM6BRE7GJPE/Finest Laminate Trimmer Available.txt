  The Hitachi is the finest laminate trimmer available period.  It is Hitachi quality, always pretty darn good.  Cheaper than just about any other router on the market (and it's a PROFESSIONAL tool).  The Hitachi also comes with a money, time, and energy saving pin router guide built in that is fully adjustable.  No more buying ball bearing router bits.  It also does bevels.
