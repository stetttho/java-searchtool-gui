  I have been using this router for about a year.  It works fine, it's a good shape, simple, and the two collet sizes are a nice feature.  It is the noisiest tool in my shop, and in my neighborhood. When I bought my router, within the first few weeks, I noticed a defect with the tool.  The baseplate screws came from the factory with a bad tapping job.  The screws came loose and fell out repeatedly during use, which prompted me to get it the router base replaced or repaired.  DeWalt told me to go to an authorized dealer to get it fixed.  The dealer called the company and then told me to buy a new base.   The product was still under warranty and with the original sales receipt and neither DeWalt nor the dealer would honor the warranty.   It's an ok tool, apart from the defect (which I had to repair myself).  Unfortunately DeWalt did not stand behind their product warranty.
