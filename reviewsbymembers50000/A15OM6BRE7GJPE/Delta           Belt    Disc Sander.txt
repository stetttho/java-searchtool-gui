 What you get with this tool is a 4x36 belt sander and a 6" aluminum disc sander.  The disc sander plate on my machine was so badly warped that I just threw it out.  So you are basically getting this machine for the belt sander. This is a fair compromise, except that there is a flaw in the design that prevents one from fully using the 4x36" belt size.  The clamping boss that holds the sander table and drum turnarounds extends above the surface of the table (like 1-1/4").  This means you cannot sand large flat areas over about 7 inches deep.  You must saw off the boss and remount the entire table to utilize the machine like you had planned when you bought a stationary belt sander of this size. When you do so, you realize through the screws that won't unscrew (and which you drill out one after another) that the machine was not meant to be serviced. The drive belt pulley on the primary drum is plastic.  Mine is warped, so the belt only stays on with excessive belt tension....  The motor is not sealed, has no overload protection, is clearly underpowered, and its body casting is from some other machine design, bought by Delta's procurement people....  This is too bad since it means you cannot replace the motor. The included sanding belt is as poorly made as I have seen, so plan to get something better.  This all said, after rebuilding, the machine works.  I don't exactly trust the plastic drive-belt pulley, nor do I like resetting my 40 Amp shop breaker when the machine bogs down.  This is an overpriced tool that was not thoughtfully designed or carefully manufactured.  This machine proves that Delta is more of a marketing company than a tool company--they got me to buy the thing, and for this I am regretful.
