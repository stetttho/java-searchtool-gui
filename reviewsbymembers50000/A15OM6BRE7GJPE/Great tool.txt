 This tool is a real powerhouse screwgun.  I've only been through aboout 15 pounds of screws so far.  However, when driving #10-3's into framing lumber or when drivine 1-1/4" 'rock screws, this tool is perfectly happy.  The speed takes a little technique to handle, but when it comes, you realize just how much more effecient you become when building.  The nose-cap is designed to pop-off for removing screws.  I've found this to be very helpful in the unusual case that I have to un-do something.  The tool is very durable and it works circles around any battery powered tool.  Also, it's lighter than most screwguns so you can handle it all day without problem.
