 Proulx does a great job of explaining a hybrid cabinet style--how it works and how to build it ... with an attention to the brass tacks.  This book is a general guide for all kinds of cabinet making.  Particularly it describes a half euro/half US cabinet style.  Simple boxes with euro hinges, doors of many varieties, drawer construction, tooling, assembly and installation are all covered.  It serves as an all-in-one guide to making cabinets _as_ as professional with close attention to adjustability, versatility, and modularity.  Highly recommended if you are interested in how to build your own kitchen cabinets. Proulx teaches a conventionalized form of cabinet design, but it's simple and it works, which is very hard to argue with.
