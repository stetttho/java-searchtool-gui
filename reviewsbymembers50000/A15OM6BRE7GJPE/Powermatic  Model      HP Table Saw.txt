 The Powermatic 66 is a wonderfully built tool that has both finish details and thoughtfulness of design that make it far superior to any other tool in or out of its class.  The table arrives perfectly flat.  Blade tilt has stops that are set to within 0.002" from the factory (0 deg. and 45 deg.).  You can adjust these if you need to. The blade guard functions wonderfully and is very simple to adjust and use.  It is easily removed and offers surprisingly good visibility.  No matter what the gripes are about the blade guard, I think Powermatic should be commended for trying to offer something more substantial and functional than any other manufacturer's stock guard.  The guard alone is worth the price difference to the near competitors.  A lost finger would also make up the price difference if you opted for a machine with an unusable guard. The miter gauge is very solid and stable.  The motor is a Baldor industrial TEFC that runs ever so quietly.  My saw developed a quiet rattling after a couple weeks of use.  The Powermatic tech support was brilliant in diagnosing the noise and talking me through its adjustment.  They will give you a direct number to a person who knows the machine inside and out and they are available and patient in helping you.  They'll send you parts under warranty, if they were ever needed, instead of making you go through the hassle of taking the machine to a dealer or service center. A stable, quiet, powerful and massive machine with not a single flaw.
