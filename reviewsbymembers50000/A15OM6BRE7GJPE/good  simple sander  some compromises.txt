 This is the 2"x48" Kalamazoo belt sander.  It's made of sheared, folded and welded steel.  It is of medium quality and medium power.  I have this sander and have been running it for about 6 months.  The thing works great when you want to do a lot of consistent grinding -- as the setup of the machine is somewhat cumbersome.  For instance, the same bolt that adjusts the platen position also adjust the position of the guard.  You'll find you need either four (4) hands or some tricks to adjust _only_ the platen but not the guard as well.  This is a real design compromise done in favor of saving the cost of a few bolts and a few extra punch-outs.  The only other complaint I have is that the platen doesn't appear to be hardened.  My machine has concave sections worn into the platen in the areas I use most frequently for grinding.  Count on fabricating (and heat treating) your own platen if you want to make nice flat grinds with this machine.  Perhaps there is a backer plate material that can be used.  Also, the platen is painted, so plan on breathing the paint dust for the first few weeks you use the machine.  Otherwise, this is a great tool that uses the cheap 2x48 belts that come in every imagineable grit and material.  I love the tool, I hate the corner cutting.  --chicago, il
