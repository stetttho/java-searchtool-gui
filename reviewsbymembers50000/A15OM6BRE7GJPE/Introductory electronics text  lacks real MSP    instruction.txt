 I've worked through this book thoroughly after purchasing it thru Amazon.    It is an elementary electronics text that is somehow quite dense.  It serves as a somewhat abstract text on a lot of basic electronics circuits.  It has the feel of a boilerplate electronics course -- things that seem to be cut and pasted out of other electronics textbooks.  So for this, the information it useful, but I already have several textbooks that are both more thorough and more expertly and clearly written.  Texas Instruments (TI) recommends this book as the best reference guide to using their MSP430 microcontrollers.  Unfortunately, all of the info included in this book is available online, excepting a very simple example project--a digital thermometer.  Caution: NO LINUX.  The book describes using the MSP430 only with a proprietary programming system--and at that the information on this proprietary system is actually out of date.  It has been replaced with newer versions.  People interested in this book need to know that the info on the MSP430 microcontroller is extremely topical.  There is very little to help you get oriented on a first design--and the text insists that you have no choice over your development platform--this is especially unfortunate since there are several development environments, including MSPGCC (which is totally free and very powerful) and low cost, effective compilers like imagecraft.  The MSP430 reference sections of this book are redundent with other versions available online, and are in some ways less straightforward than the device datasheets.  For example, over 50 pages are dedicated to an instruction set summary -- something obviously provided by the manufacturer.  Tis is a basic electronics book with one MSP430 project.  If you don't need an electronics tutorial, and if you don't want to use IAR's out of date software, then you'll probably want to stay away from this textbook.
