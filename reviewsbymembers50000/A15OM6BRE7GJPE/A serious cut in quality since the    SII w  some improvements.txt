 The 30 series of scientific calculators from HP are the best in the world -- but this new one (the HP 33s) has some serious quality problems.  First -- and most irritating -- is the screen.  The 32-sII had an LCD that was very flat, matte finish, and which could be viewed in any kind of lighting.  The screen on the 33s has a strong shadow under all of the digits.  It's very difficult to read the screen from an angle because of this.  The overall build quality has gone down from the 32-sII to the 33s.  There is a less robust body and the molded parts have a poor finish.  It works well for me despite these issues -- the 2-line screen shwos the Y register which is a cool improvement.  Also there is a GREAT "ENG" key which puts a number into scientific notation either up or down (e.g. .00000423 becomes 4.23 E-6 ... you hit ENG again and it gives it to you as 4230 E-9 ... this makes switch from Pico-Farads to Micro-Farads and back very easy.  The screen is the worst part, and it makes me scream to try to use it on an airplane with a single light over my seat.  It really is hard to read.
