 This is book number 7 out of 8 in an amazing series by author, June Lund Shiplett.  This saga (starting with book 1) follows one woman (Loedicia Aldrich Locke Chapman) and her descendants.   This particular book follows Lizette, granddaughter of Loedicia.  Seeking revenge the death of his father  (whom he belives was killed because of Lizette's husband, Bain), pirate, Sancho de Cordoba, kidnaps Lizette.  Bain searches for his wife, but believes her to be pregnant with Sancho's child. Bain is also tempted by Sancho's sister, Elena.  Will Bain and Lizette get back together?  Will anyone find Lizette on the pirate's hidden island?   Shiplett makes these characters so real -- they have flaws, bad hair days, gain weight and make mistakes.  Not your average blonde haired, blue eyed wimpy heroine who gets saves by the big handsome, over-bulked stupid guy.  These women think for themselves and can take care of themselves, thank you very much. I'm really not a big reader of romances in general, but I love this series of books.  I think I pull them out about once a year and reread them all the way through.  It's truly amazing how Shiplett manages to weave history, family, action and romance thru this series. This is a can't miss series and you will only wish that Ms. Shiplett had written more.
