 This is book number 6 out of 8 in an amazing series by author, June Lund Shiplett.  This saga (starting with book 1) follows one woman and her descendants.  This particular book is split in half following two stories -- that of Cole and Heather, and Lizette and Bain (grandchildren of Loedicia from book 1). I'm really not a big reader of romances in general, but I love this series of books.  I think I pull them out about once a year and reread them all the way through.  It's truly amazing how Shiplett manages to weave history, family, action and romance thru this series. This is a can't miss series and you will only wish that Ms. Shiplett had written more.
