 Join Lonely Planet host, Ian Wright, as he back packs his way around New York City.  Starting out at the Statue of Liberty, Ian takes on Manhattan.  He get lessons in New York attitude from a cab driver.  Ian joins up with a basketball game,  rollerblades in Central Park, and hits the town in the Village. Moving out of downtown Manhattan, Ian heads over to Harlem, the Bronx, Brooklyn, and finally ends up at Coney Island.  He tops off the trip to NYC with a helicopter ride over Manhattan. Personally this is a lot like my first trip to NYC where I stayed away from the tourist activities and did weird stuff like grocery shop at Zabars.  Ian's trip is really a different take on New York and might inspire new ideas for your next trip. Also note that the VHS tapes of Lonely Planet episodes contain a couple more minutes of footage than the episodes that air on television.
