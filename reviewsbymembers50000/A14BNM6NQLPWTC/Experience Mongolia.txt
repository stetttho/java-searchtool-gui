 Join wacky Ian Wright in Mongolia (not your average tourist destination). Ian begins in Bejing and travels by train to Ulaan Baatar, Mongolia (the capitol and also referred to as UB).  Ian experienes what UB is like now, after the pull out of the Soviet Union.  He then travels to  Karakorum where Ghengis Khan ruled in the 13th century.  Somewher out on the plains, Ian experiences Mongolian throat singing and he eats Marmot (still known to carry the Bubonic plague).  From there, Ian heads for the Gobi desert and then hops a plane back to UB.  An amazing journey. Also note that the VHS tapes of Lonely Planet episodes contain a couple more minutes of footage than the episodes that air on television.
