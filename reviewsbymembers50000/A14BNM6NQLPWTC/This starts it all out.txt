 This is book number 1 out of 8 in an amazing series by author, June Lund Shiplett.  This saga (starting with book 1) follows one woman (Loedicia Aldrich) and her descendants.   This particular book starts it all out with rebellious, Loedicia, who is newly arrived to the American colonies.  She is promised (by her vindictive aunt) to wed a nasty, evil man, Lord Varrick.  Instead Loedicia runs away -- only to find herself in the arms of Varrick's cousin, Quinn. After thinking Quinn has died in an attack by indians, Dicia reunites with Roth (whom she met while in Boston). I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but reading these books is like connecting with your great-great-grandparents. Shiplett makes these characters so real -- they have flaws, bad hair days, gain weight and make mistakes.  Not your average blonde haired, blue eyed wimpy heroine who gets saves by the big handsome, over-bulked stupid guy.  These women think for themselves and can take care of themselves, thank you very much. I'm really not a big reader of romances in general, but I love this series of books.  I think I pull them out about once a year and reread them all the way through.  It's truly amazing how Shiplett manages to weave history, family, action and romance thru this series. This is a can't miss series and you will only wish that Ms. Shiplett had written more.
