 Lonely Planet host, Justine Shapiro, visits four provinces in South West China: Guangxi, Guizhou, Yunnan and Sichuan In recent times, China has only been to visitors since the 1980s, and this is an opportunity to see a part of the world that has been closed to most travelers.  Justine begins in Guangxi and bicycles out to see Moon Hill -- a place that the  Chinese consider to be one of the most beautiful in the world.  On her return to the city of Yangshuo, she ventured into local markets where dinner consists of snake & dog. Hopping a plane into Guizhou province, Justin visits with a tribe where the women wear ox horns in their hair to represent strength.  Also while in Guizhou, she the wonder of Huangguoshu waterfall - the largest waterfall in Asia. Moving on to Chengdu, Justine isn't feeling that great (hmmm, maybe it was the dog?)  So she visits a local hospital for some acupuncture.  Justine is very skeptical that this will work, but amazingly she does feel better after her treatment.  While in Chengdu, Justine goes to the Giant Panda Research Center and even holds a baby panda. And Justine ends her trip to South West China with a horseback ride thru the Ximending mountain range. Also note that the VHS tapes of Lonely Planet episodes contain a couple more minutes of footage than the episodes that air on television.
