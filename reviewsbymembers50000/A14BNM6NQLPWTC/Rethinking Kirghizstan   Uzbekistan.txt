 My memory of this episode of Lonely Planet was pretty fuzzy.  But following the events of September 11th, I wanted to see this because (other than the Pakistan episode), it's the closest Lonely Planet ep to Afghanistan. Okay so maybe there was a good reason that my memory was sort of fuzzy on this one.  Honestly, it's really similar to the episode in Mongolia which also features Ian Wright, but it was still worth revisiting to see how the people of the former Soviet Bloc region are living. This episode isn't so much about the tourism and the sites you'd want to visit, but maybe more of a reminder of how people survive with very little and how much we honestly have in our lives.
