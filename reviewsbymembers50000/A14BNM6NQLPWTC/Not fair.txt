 This is one of the most amazing historical fiction books I've ever come across. As a student of Briitsh history, I loved recognizing that Abbey somehow found an opening to insert a couple of fictional characters into a fascinating moment in history (in theory it shouldn't seem so easy, but it works very, very well).  Can you imagine being in the court of all six of Henry VIII's Queens?  Cool!   From what I've been able to piece together, Anne Merton Abbey was a pseudomyn for a pair of writers who have also written as Valerie Vayle, Janice Young Brooks, Jean Brooks-Janowiak and Janet Brooks. Currently one of them writes under the name of Jill Churchill. It's really a loss to the reader that they never followed up on the promise of a sequel to this book, or even with another non-related historical fiction.
