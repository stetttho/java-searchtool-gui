 Wow, oh wow.  This is perhaps one of the best episodes of Lonely Planet.  Justine explores South India, and gives the viewers a chance to really see what it's like.  She starts her journey in Madras (in South East India) and eats lunch in restaurant where 3,000 people eat each day.  Justine  goes to the cinema to experience one of the local films, and later she watches a Hindu parade.  Moving west, Justine ends up in an elephant sanctuary in Goa whenre she helps bathe the elephants. Justine then takes a boat thru some waterways -- for something like pennies a day, and ends up in an Ashram where she get a hug from a mothr figure/guru.  And she finally ends up on an island off of the western coast of India.  The beaches look amazing.  This episode has been voted as the viewer's #1 favorite on the Travel Channel. Also note that the VHS tapes of Lonely Planet episodes contain a couple more minutes of footage than the episodes that air on television.
