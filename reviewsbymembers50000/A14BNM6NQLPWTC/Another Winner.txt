 This is book 3 of 8 in the Winds series by June Lund Shiplett. This book follows Loedicia on her journey to return to her 2nd husband, Roth.  She is forced to make a cross country trip from New Orleans to South Carolina (in 1794).  This is so real and visceral, you really understand how difficult of a journey it would have been. The second half of the book is about Dicia's daughter, Rebel, and her loveless marriage to Brandon, a duke.  Brandon is the ambitious governor of Grenada, and Rebel is pregnant -- only she's carrying the child of her French-Indian lover, Beau. These are really an amazing series of books, and I don't usually read historical romances.  Pick all of these up and you've got a great read.
