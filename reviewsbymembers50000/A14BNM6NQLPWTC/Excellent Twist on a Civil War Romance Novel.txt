 This book is not related to any of June Lund Shiplett's wind books.  It stands alone. The story follows Union spy/entertainer Jeanine Gray and her move to Texas to stay in the home of Griff Heywood.  Jeanine must keep the secret of her Union activies from Griff, whom she begins to love, and from the town's people who supported the Confederacy during the war. Shiplett makes these characters so real -- they have flaws, bad hair days, gain weight and make mistakes.  Not your average blonde haired, blue eyed wimpy heroine who gets saves by the big handsome, over-bulked stupid guy.  These women think for themselves and can take care of themselves, thank you very much. I'm really not a big reader of romances in general, but I love this series of books.  I think I pull them out about once a year and reread them all the way through.  It's truly amazing how Shiplett manages to weave history, family, action and romance thru this series. This is a can't miss series and you will only wish that Ms. Shiplett had written more.
