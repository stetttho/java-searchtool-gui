 This is another amazing entry in the Lonely Planet television show.  Justine returns to South Africa (where she lived as a child).  Justine arrives in Capetown, South Africa and travels out to Robben Island -- where Nelson Mandela was jailed.  While there she speaks with a man who was imprisoned in a the cell located directly across from Nelson Mandela's. Justine & the Lonely Planet crew show amazing sensitivity to racial issues and history of South Africa especially while visiting Durban, formerly a white dominated area and now a racial diverse township. Justine also travels to the east to the country of Lethoso and witnesses a rites of puberty ceremony for young boys.  From Lethoso, Justine travels to Kruger National park where she sees the "big five": buffalo, elephant, leopard, lion, & rhino This very personal journey for Justine ends in Soweto as she is able to connect with the woman who took care of her when she was a child. Also note that the VHS tapes of Lonely Planet episodes contain a couple more minutes of footage than the episodes that air on television.
