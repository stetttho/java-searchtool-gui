 Why bother with a book that has incorrect information.  Mr. Garebian didn't bother to read most of the articles he cites in his bibliography or he simply didn't do the research.  In GYPSY, there are four songs, which were new written for the musical, and the rest are "trunk" songs (pulled from Styne's repertoire).  It's a fairly well known fact which ones are "trunk" sings & which ones aren't, and Mr. Garebian gets it wrong, wrong, wrong.   It's really too bad.  The idea for the book is a nice one, but it's so poorly executed you wouldn't want to rely on any fact in this book without checking and rechecking it against other sources.
