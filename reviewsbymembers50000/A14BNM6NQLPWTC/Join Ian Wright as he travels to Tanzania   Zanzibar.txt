 Lonely Planet is an amazing travel series that airs on internationally including on the Travel Channel in the US. This is probably not one of my favorite Lonely Planet episodes.  For some reason, it always tends to put me to sleep.  Maybe it's that Tanzania & Zanzibar are fairly inaccessible for a US citizen (due to the Embassy bombings).  Sure it's cool to see a place that's completely and utterly foreign to your way of life, but it's sort of hard to fantasize about traveling there.  If nothing else Tanzania & Zanzibar is a great lesson in geography and civics.  Chances are you'l learn more about the people of East Africa from a Lonely Planet episode than you would on any tour or in a class.  And besides that, Ian's always enjoyable. Also note that the VHS tapes of Lonely Planet episodes contain a couple more minutes of footage than the episodes that air on television.
