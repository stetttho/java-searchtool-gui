 This is book number 5 out of 8 in an amazing series by author, June Lund Shiplett.  This saga (starting with book 1) follows one woman and her descendants.  This particular book interweaves two stories -- the forbidden romance of cousins Cole and Heather, and the love triangle of Lizette and Bain and (Bains' brother) Stuart.  Shiplett makes these characters so real -- they have flaws, bad hair days, gain weight and make mistakes.  Not your average blonde haired, blue eyed wimpy heroine who gets saves by the big handsome, over-bulked stupid guy.  These women think for themselves and can take care of themselves, thank you very much. I'm really not a big reader of romances in general, but I love this series of books.  I think I pull them out about once a year and reread them all the way through.  It's truly amazing how Shiplett manages to weave history, family, action and romance thru this series. This is a can't miss series and you will only wish that Ms. Shiplett had written more.
