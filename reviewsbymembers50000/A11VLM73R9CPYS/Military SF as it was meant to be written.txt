 Cook writes in an over-the-top, yet intimate way about his intensely manifested characters.  My favorite sentence of all time is in the first paragraph of this book, "Night fell like a sadist's boot."  The designer of a troop transport is described as "a closet Torquemada."  These quotes are still in my head 3 years after my last (third) reading of this book.  He captures all the stench, abrasiveness and fungus of living in a closed container with a military crew.  And if you like this one, try and find "The Dragon Never Sleeps", his other military SF stand-alone novel.  Based on his excellent writing and devoted fan-base, I would expect to see more of his books still in print.
