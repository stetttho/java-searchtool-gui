 Tenon jig, forget it.  Featherboard, nope.  Accurate miter gage, negative.  Any accesories to make this saw do more than ripping, out of the question.  Documentation of the non-standard miter slot, non-existent.  Don't buy this saw unless you are looking for a plain old plywood cutter.  It does that pretty good though. ------------------- An update - Still using this saw, still cursing the fence and MITER SLOT.  Recently I've found the arbor to be way short for dadoing.  Maximum dado width is 3/8".  List price of $550?  Are they joking?  You can buy a Grizzly cabinet saw for a little more than that.  Seriously, all you can do with this saw is basic ripping.
