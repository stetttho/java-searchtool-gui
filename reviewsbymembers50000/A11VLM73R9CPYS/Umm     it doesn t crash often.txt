 I was a big fan of Quicken 5 years ago, but this version is abysmal.  Features that are advertised on the box, but "discontinued", a user interface that takes some time to get used to, and a serious bug that I can't get anyone at Quicken to respond to.  I created a 401k account, added two mutual funds, gave them both initial balances, then corrected the balances when I found my account information.  The problem is that the updated amounts are correct in the register, but are not correct in any other reports.  I can't get it to refresh the data in the reports without deleting the account.  I give up.  Going to try to find a copy of Quicken from the mid 90's.
