 I bought this with the sole purpose of cannibalizing it for the quartz rods.  They are REALLY expensive, assuming you can find them separately.  Made a kicking paint stripper with them, from directions found at "My Paint Stripper".  I doubt Holmes cares WHY we buy these.  For the intended purpose they're kind of ... not good.  As sources of parts, you can't find em cheaper even on EBay.
