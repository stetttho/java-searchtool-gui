 Received mine and have been setting it up for a while now.    Electrics - Ran 220V from the dryer outlet, probably violating code.  Don't try this yourself unless you understand what single phase means.  The unit comes with bare wires ready to be hard-wired.  Was unable to find a 220V extension cord, so made one myself.  20 amp wire and NEMA connectors.  Breakage in Transit - The unit had tipped over in shipment.  I noticed a ding in the fan cover.  Actually, I noticed a loud racket when I tried turning the blade by hand.  The fan was rubbing the shroud.  A little work with a hammer and pliers fixed that.  But I didn't know that there was a related problem until I tried to set the blade to 90 degrees.  Stuck my head inside to see what the problem was and found ... a three once chunk of cast iron that had snapped off the flange that holds one of the main trunnion shafts.  This was the point that gave out when the whole unit fell on the motor.  Thank goodness I hadn't turned it on yet.  The blade had a good chance of rotating into the table when I tilted it.  Cleaning -  Removing the preservative is actually easy, once you find the right solvent.  Instructions call for a degreaser or citrus based cleanser.  I had a "Clean Off" between a degreaser, an orange-based cleanser and Goof Off.  the first two didn't even make a dent.  Goof Off removed it very effectively, but have a lot of ventilation if you use it.  Support - Grizzly is sending me a new flange and says I will have no problem replacing the broken piece.  Very good interaction with them.  I was worried I would have to ship the whole unit back.  Getting it into the basement almost gave me a hernia.    Will update this after I get to actually cut wood.
