 After finishing the last page I was also feeling a bit emotional, like the other reviewers.  I had to go back and read the last 100 pages again to really fix it in my brain.  And I decided the the ending was incredibly ... appropriate.  Mysteries are solved, justice is meted, and rewards are bestowed.    Cook's writing style is comparable to Cherryh, or Faulkner.  They all narrate from the viewpoint of the characters.  Actions that occur outside the view of the main characters is not described.  When a character departs the Company, you may never hear about them for several books, if at all.  And the switch from narrator to narrator is sometimes difficult to follow, particularly when someone is magically viewing something happening in another part of the world.  Cook sometimes gives us a couple of pages before telling us who is talking.  So, if you've read the other books, this is more of the same.  Excellent as ever.
