 After reading the reviews here I was hesitant to purchase this, but it worked flawlessly.  The only downside is the cleanup, which is timeconsuming.  The people that had trouble operating this sprayer (forgetting to tighten hoses, etc) are too inept to be allowed to operate anything more complicated than a doorknob.  Spray pattern was perfect.  Assembly was quick.  Operation was beyond expectations.  I had 1200' of 6' fence to paint, half of it picket.  With a roller it would have taken me a week.  Three hours with the Paint Crew.  Wife thought 80 feet were blotchy so I put on a second coat - 9 minutes.  Was using semi-solid stain and threw in some Flowtrol.  In batches without flowtrol there was a tendency to consume more paint and cause runs.  I rented a pro machine ($78/day) and had problems with the tip causing uneven spray patterns.  The pro machine also was difficult to purge of the previous paint.  I ended up with a half pint of the previous user's white flowing out of the machine and into 5 gallons of my Evergreen.  That mistake cost more than the equipment rental.  Now I have my own machine, it didn't cost much, works great, and hasn't broken yet.
