 For such a popular brand, getting any Delta product serviced is a pain.  I live in the DC area and it's a 2 hour round trip to drop it off and 2 hours to pick it up.    DON'T LOSE THE CHUCK KEY!  It's a different diameter to any of the others you have lying around, and you have to call Delta to get a replacement.  I had to grind down a different key as an interim replacement.  Besides all that, its a fine machine for the money.  I've even used the mortising attachment a few times.  But with a 12" drill press, you'll only get a 2 1/2" mortise.  So, if you will be doing basic light drilling, this is your drill press.
