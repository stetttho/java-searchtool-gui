 I've had 4 other GPS, including a very early military model in the Navy.  This is by far the best I've used.  Really loved being able to throw out all the maps in the car.  On the negative side - Magellan went cheap on the map data.  There are very good map databases out there, complete and frequently updated.  This is not one of them.  It tries to route me through streets that were dead-ended years ago.   But my real issue is with the Points of Interest.  Businesses come and go over the years.  Magellan doesn't seem to really care.  And the custom POIs that are supposedly available online?  Traffic cameras, school zones etc are very well mapped IN EUROPE.  I've found no downloadable data sets for the US besides zip codes.  Routing is quirky.  It rarely sends me out and back on the same streets.  It always tries to get me onto a major highway as soon as possible.  This results in me going to a destination on one highway, then on minor streets.  On the return trip it puts me on a different highway, then on minor streets.  Neither of which were the fastest route.  Minor streets straight through would have been much quicker.  The ability to create detours is very strange.  You select a rectangular area encompassing multiple roads, rather than picking sections of a road.
