 Initial setup was nice, particularly compared to D-Link, (the tech decided the D-Link was broken).  But I came home from vacation and its not sending out a signal anymore.  The WAP11 connects to the LAN fine, but none of the laptops are getting any signalfrom it.  Tech support was laughably inept.  Now I've figured out the reset button doesn't actually do anything.  They want me to upgrade firmware a third time.  DSL Reports.com says there's a problem with the latest firmware.  I wish I could buy one of these things and it would just work.
