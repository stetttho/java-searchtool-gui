 I'm new to Paul Auster's brand of literature.  I started with Timbuktu which I thought was brilliantly written.  The Brookyn Follies takes the reader on one helluva of ride that is supposedly the main characters last hurrah in life.  The story lines are fast and furious.  You name the subject, this book has got it -- sex, cults, murder, homosexuals.  I've gotta give Mr. Auster credit. He kept me interested until the very end.  Maybe I missed it but without spoiling it -- I was disappointed with the ending.  If you are looking for something different to read -- I highly recommend this book and all of Paul Austers novels.  He writes no other.  His creativity and imagination are unbelievable.
