 This is a fun loving and poignant look at a true sports broad-casting pioneer.  Steve Stone provides the reader with a honest and open perspective of Harry Caray.  He is very insightful and does an outstanding job capturing the real Harry Caray.  Mr. Stone doesn't shy away from Harry's flamboyant lifestyle nor his opinionated personality.  All in all, Mr. Stone puts the reader totally in touch with Harry "Holy Cow" Caray.  Where's Harry is easy to read and you'll be guaranteed to be laughing out loud (or get a lump in your throat).  I personally loved the story about Harry and Elvis -- long live both of them.
