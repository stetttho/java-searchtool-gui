 Love him or hate -- you've got to respect Charles Barkley.  This book is written in true Barkley fashion -- To The Point.  He takes on subjects that too few athletes or men of prominence are afraid to tackle.  The book is exactly what I expected -- providing his opinions on today hottest topics.  It is easy to read.  The reader feels like Sir Charles and he/she are having a cocktail and talking.  If you aren't prepared the answer, don't ask Barkley the question.  One thing is for sure -- Charles calls it the way He see it.
