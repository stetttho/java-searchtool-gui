 I stumbled upon this book in the bookstore and was hesitant in buying it.  Afterall, what kind of book is this for a mid 40's sports junkie?  I've got to tell you, Marley & Me is exactly what I needed.  It's about an adventure with mans best friend -- his dog and the development of life itself.  From getting married, to choosing a puppy, to having kids, to career changes to watching your "best friend" get old.  Marley & Me touches on all of this with the dog being the subject.  Marley & Me is a fun and fast reading novel.  It is easy to read and expertly captures the emotions of the dog owners.  If you looking for some light reading reading this holiday season and a book guaranteed to put a smile on your face and possibly a tear in your eye -- then read Marley & Me.  It surely makes me appreciate my two cocker spaniels that much more.
