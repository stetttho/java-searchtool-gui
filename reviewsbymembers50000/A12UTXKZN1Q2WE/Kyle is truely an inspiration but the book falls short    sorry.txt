 I hate to be a downer because Kyle's story is unbelievable.  Thanks to a VERY STRONG support system (parents and coaches), Kyle has made the most from incredible odds.  Here is why I gave No Excuses 3 stars.  The book focuses 75% on his wrestling.  As a reader, I wanted to read more about his everyday life such as eating or tying his shoes, interaction with teachers and friends and etc.  It would have been nice for him to address what his daily struggles are and how he gets around them.  I applaude Kyle and hope the future is very bright for him.  The end of the book give Frequently Asked Question and he gives answers to them.  I wish Kyle would have expanded on some of the questions and answers.  There is only so much wrestling I can read about.
