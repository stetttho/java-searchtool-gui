 If you like Phil Mickelson or if you like a feel good story -- then I strongly recommend that you read this book.  Phil not only takes the reader through his final 18 holes at Augusta but also the foundation that he was provided as a child.  The book is very easy and a quick read.  Surrounded by supportive family and friends, Phil makes it a point not to take any of that for granted.  Unlike so many professional athletes, Phil is grounded and humble.  It is impossible not to cheer for Phil Mickelson.  Of course, I am terribly biased as I am a huge Phil Mickelson fan.  I am a die-hard sports fan and am seldom moved by accomplishments.  However, I must say I wore out my family room carpet as he played the back 9 on Sunday at Augusta.  Enjoy the book golf fans because I know I did.
