 I do not read much fiction.  But I have to tell you, after reading Paranoia I will be much more inclined to reading more (especially anything written by Mr. Finder).  Outstanding character development, superb story-line and very easy to read.  This book has everything:  corporate spying, a slight love triangle and LOTS of twists and turns.  The reader is kept on edge, which is great -- a real page turner!!!!  My wife and I both loved it -- in fact she just bought every book written by Joseph Finder.  Try it, you'll love it!!!!!!!
