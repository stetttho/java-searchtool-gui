 Slim and None is very easy to read.  The chapters are short.  There are not many characters so it's easy to follow.  The plot is simple -- a golfer at the end of his career is trying to win a major championship.  The reader is taken through the twists and turns as each major unfolds.  I found myself laughing out loud several times.  If you want a book to read at the beach or in the bathroom -- this is your book.  Nothing comprehensive about Slim and None.  I must say -- the ending stinks!!!!  I really thought Dan Jenkins could have put more time into it as the book abruptly ends.  I might give Dead Solid Perfect a try because I've gotta believe Mr. Jenkins has more to offer than this.  His columns in Golf Digest are priceless.  Save your money or buy a used copy -- it's not worth $20.
