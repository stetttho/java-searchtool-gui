 Don't ask me why I read this book because I have no answers.  Perhaps being in my mid 40's led me so undiscover some of my deepest feelings.  After reading The Five People You Meet In Heaven, I stumbled onto the literary works of Richard Paul Evans.  Let me cut the chase.  I read this book in one day.  I can't explain why I couldn't put it down.  Mr. Evans does an outstanding job of character development.  Most fiction books one tends to get lost in too many characters, A Perfect Day is very easy to read.  The book is about his writing of A Perfect Day.  Superb execution of the thought process and quite easy to relate to if one is put in that position.  I'll admit the ending is somewhat disappointing.  Quite frankly, I thought Mr. Evans could have expanded on it a bit more.  But this book still deserves an unprecedented 5 Stars because its story fulfilled me in every sense.  A Perfect Day is a love story, a mystery, imaginative and passion all confined into 288 pages.  A Perfect Day is reading A Perfect Day.
