 After reading Tuesdays With Morrie by Mitch Albom, I found myself wanting more of the same type of novel and with that I stumbled upon My Twice-Lived Life.  Being in my mid-40's, my mind set has started to wander about what lies ahead.  Mr. Murray has done a tremendous job capturing not only his life but thought process.  It's very easy to read, as the sub title chapter are carefully arranged. His sense of humor is comforting as he puts everything into proper prospective.  Anyone looking for answers about aging should read this masterpiece.  I loved every page and know I'll reread this treasured novel again and again.  I can't wait to give it to my mother-in-law to read.
