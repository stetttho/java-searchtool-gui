 Let me say that I do not read much fiction.  It was my wife who insisted I give this a try.  Most fiction novels tend to have too many characters and plots.  Not so in this case.  Gimenez does a masterful job with superb character development and a plot that is easy (yet intriguing) to keep the reader interested.  It's one of those rare to find novels that is easy to read in a short periods of time.  The last 100 pages are real page turners.  So much so, that I was hoping for train delays so I could keep reading.  Perhaps the best part of the book is the epilogue.  Here, Gimenez neatly ties up all questions that are going through your head.  Outstanding fiction novel!!!!  5 Stars doesn't do jest.  I can't wait for Mark Gimenez next novel -- he will be hard pressed to top this one.
