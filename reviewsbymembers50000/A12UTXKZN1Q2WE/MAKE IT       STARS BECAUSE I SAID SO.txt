 There is no denying that Stone Cold is one the most colorful characters in the history of wrestling entertainment.  This book was slightly above average.  Its easy to read but I'll be honest, it just didn't provide me with the insight that I was looking for. The Stone Cold Truth is an autobiography that goes into detail of the many decent people in the wrestling business that Steve Williams has encountered.  His failed marriages are a result of the profession that he has chosen and the man that he is -- neither are wrong.  I read the book, I liked it. But I didn't love it and I wouldn't read it again because there is just nothing special about it.  If you love Stone Cold Steve Austin -- this is the book for you.  If you want real insight into wrestling entertainment seek elsewhere.
