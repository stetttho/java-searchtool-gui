 High Crimes captures the reader from the very first chapter.  The plot is simple -- happy marriage until a past secret is revealed and then all hell breaks loose.  Military politics, courtroom drama and an ending that will totally shock the reader.  Limited characters make this easy to read.  I love the short chapters because it makes it easy to follow.  I read Joseph Finder's Paranoia, which is another great book.  This is fiction at its very best!!!!!!!!!!!!!
