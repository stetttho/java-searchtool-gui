 It doesn't need to be the holiday season to enjoy this gem of a book.  I read it on the airplane and I can honestly tell you, I lied to my wife. I told her my allergies were bothering me.  In reality the lovely words found in the The Christmas Shoes drove me to tears (lots of tears).  The character development makes this book easy to read.  The two story lines are simple to follow.  The Christmas Shoes is a real page turner.  The epilogue in this book is the best epilogue I've ever read.  My wish is that Donna VanLiere would write more, I can't wait to read the sequal to The Christmas Shoes -- The Christmas Blessing.  Bottom Line -- Read the Book (with a box of tissues)!!!!!!!!!!!
