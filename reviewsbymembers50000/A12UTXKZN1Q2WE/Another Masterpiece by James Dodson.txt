 One need not look any further than the magical pages of The Dewsweepers (or Final Rounds) to understand why those of us play this beautiful game.  The Dewsweepers takes the reader to far greater places than the golf course (freudian slip).  Instead, it is a journey into life's unexpected twists and turns -- yet always returning to peace and tranquil feeling that only golf provides.  It reminds all -- that Friendship is more important than breaking 80.  Like Final Rounds, The Dewsweepers is eloquently written.  The diversity of characters can be a bit confusing but all in all it is a very good read.  I'd really rate this 4 1/2 Stars, falling just short of Final Rounds.
