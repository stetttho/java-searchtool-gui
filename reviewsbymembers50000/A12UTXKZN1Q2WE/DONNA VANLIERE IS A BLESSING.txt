 Once again, Donna VanLiere has written another masterpiece.  The sequel to The Christmas Shoes certainly exceeded my expectations.  Mrs. VanLiere continues the daily saga of Nathan Andrews -- a young man looking for his place in the world.  What the reader finds in The Christmas Blessing is an easy to read page-turner with great characters.  The story line is simple (but not insulting) and easy to follow.  Mrs. VanLiere has been truly blessed with creativity and her ability to bring a things together and produce a superior novel.  My only question to Mrs. VanLiere:  When is your next novel???????
