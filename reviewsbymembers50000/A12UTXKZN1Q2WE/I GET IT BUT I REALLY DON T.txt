 As a marathoner in my mid-40's, I bought this book with great anticipation.  Dean takes the reader on a journey through countless miles but somehow the "marathons" stop short.  In all honesty, I have survived 186 pages of this extra ordinary mans expose'.  What I have been left with is an egotistical, self-serving man on a quest for God knows what.  It's one race after another.  Never does he tell about his recovery period or a summary of the physical abuse he puts himself through.  Dean is rare and God knows he doesn't lack confidence or an ego.  Sorry Dean -- I expected so much more!!!!!
