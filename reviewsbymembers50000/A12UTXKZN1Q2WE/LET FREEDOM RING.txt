 The Gulf Between Us is a real page turner. Col. Acree's  captivity experience is extremely detailed and precise. Truly unbelievable and very terrifying.  Mrs. Acree does an outstanding job providing the spouses perspective. This book covers it all before, during and perhaps the best part to the book -- the aftermath.  The lastings effects of a prisoner of war are perhaps the most noteworthy.  This really is a most compelling story.  I am grateful to the Acree's for sharing a most tumultuous time of their lives.  A Gulf Between Us is a must read for every military family or someone who wants the real story -- no fabrication here!!
