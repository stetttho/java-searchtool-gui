 I'm a casual wrestling fan having watched it on and off for the last thirty years.  "In the Pit" is a VERY easy read with  insight in the world of wrestling but mostly its about him.  I have a great deal of respect for Rowdy Piper because its clear he didn't compromise his integrity!!!!  His story goes into great detail about the extensive good times, the bond between fellow athletes and quick  behind the scenes look (i.e. lack of health benefits and how controlling the promoters are) -- which I wish he would have expanding on.  Yet the story is very compelling and revealing, as his stories are positively hysterical.  The book is entertaining but it does to jump around a bit.  It is indeed written in true in Rowdy fashion, its as if he and I were sitting in bar and him recounting his roller coaster life.  After I put I down, I was left with two thoughts -- 1) God Bless His Wife Kitty and 2) I hope he writes another book soon.
