 I think Terry Frei did a fantastic recounting events of something that happened 60 years ago.  Clearly Mr. Frei did a thorough job researching all the events and the many characters he references.  As for the reader, he/she is taken on a journey about teenagers turning into young men during one of the most difficult times in American history.  Frei goes into great detail about the Wisconsin Badger roster and characters that make it up.  At times, it does get confusing but I honestly don't see how Frei could have singled anyone out -- except for perhaps Dave Schreiner.  I will admit I skipped some of the middle of book when the author gives a recap of all the Badger games from 1942.  The second half of the book (about the war) is very well done.  In fact, the second half of the book is a real page tuner.  All in all, it is a good book about some fine people that I would have loved to have met.
