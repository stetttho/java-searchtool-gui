 I'll admit it, I'm a golf nut.  I even belong to the golf nuts society.  I just can't get enough golf!!!  At the same time, I am tired of reading about instructions and golf getaways and etc.  I want to know what goes on inside the minds of the golfers I watch week after week.  Who's Your Caddy gives you that and so much more.  This book takes the reader on a pleasant journey through the personalities of such greats as Jack Nickalas and Tommy Armour and provides a candid look at other well knowns like David Duvall, John Daly, Casey Martin and Tom Lehman.  Perhaps the most intriguing chapters are those of the Blind Golfer, Jill McGill and Donald Trump.  Rick Reilly has done a spectacular job getting inside the minds and provides the reader with an indepth look and what so many call -- Golf Robots.  Its a fun and easy read.  Guaranteed to please anyone who loves the game!!!!!!!!
