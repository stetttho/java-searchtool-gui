 "Golf Nuts" is a book about people who share a common passion.  Head Nut #0001 - Ronald Garland goes into grave detail about how he established the "Golf Nuts Society" and some of the unique characters that belong to this growing organization.  This is a great book if you know someone who is obssessed with the game of golf.  Its very easy to read.  The sample test in the back of the book to see if you should be committed is hysterical, the glossary and world records will leave the reader in stitches because only those searching for the "secret" will understand.  I loved the book so much that I joined the "Golf Nuts Society" -- #3177.
