 Like so many, I long awaited the follow up to Tuesdays With Morrie.  Mitch Albom has done it again.  "Five People...." is a beautiful fable that is easy to read with its messages very easy to comprehend.  Mitch's character development captures the reader in a way no other writer can.  He is masterful at describing the clouds and color and the true meaning of both.  Bottom Line -- Read The Book.  I finished it in one afternoon.  If you are looking for a book that gives one mans version of the after-life than this is your book.  I've got to tell you -- Mitch Albom has become my favorite author!!!!!!!  And for those of you who haven't read Tuesdays With Morrie by Mitch Albom -- SHAME ON YOU.
