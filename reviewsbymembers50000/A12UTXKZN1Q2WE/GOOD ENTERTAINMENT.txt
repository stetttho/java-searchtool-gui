 This book will not challenge our fine literary works of years past.  GOLDBERG provided me exactly what I was looking for - insight to one of most entertaining characters that I've seen in years.  Let's face it, pro wrestling is entertainment.  GOLDBERG so happens one character in the land of make believe.  The book is a delightful read and full of insight.  The writing style is consistent with the character, which I found very refreshing.  GOLDBERG is a fun and easy fun -- a nice weekend escape.
