 Glory Denied captivated me in a way I never thought possible.  I am not an avid reader but I read this book in one weekend.  Quite simply, I could not put it down.  Glory Denied is beautifully written -- articulate and thorough.  It is totally understandable why this story took 16 years to write.  This was a story that needed to be told. Tom Philpott does an outstanding job not only capturing the veterans perspective but the thought process of their respective families.  The harsh reality of the Vietnam War is truly compelling and devastating.  Glory Denied is an emotional roller coaster.  If you read one book this year (or in your lifetime), read Glory Denied.  I promise you, you will not denied a story of lifetime.  Unbelievable!
