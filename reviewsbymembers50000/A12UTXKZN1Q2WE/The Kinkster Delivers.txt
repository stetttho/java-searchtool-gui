 After seeing Kinky Friedman on Larry King Live, I decided to read one of his books.  'Scuse Me While I Whip This Out' seemed like a good place to start.  The book is a quick and easy read full of annedotes and lots of stories that only those bold enough can put into print.  I enjoyed his very dry humor and wit.  The chapter on Joseph Heller was particularly noteworthy since very few have been able to pin down this literary legend.  If you looking for something different and are open enough to read another point of view, then I strongly recommend this book.  The creativity that Kinky Friedman provides is worth the price of the book.  A strong 4 stars.  Now I am about to that on his latest book.
