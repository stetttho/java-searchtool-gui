 Texas Hold'em is Kinky Friedman at his best.  Full of annedotes and commentary.  No subject is off limits.  I must admit, if you are from Texas (which I am not) you will surely get more laughs then a Yankee.  Kinky takes the reader on a variety of rides through his mind, refusing to stop even when the trails become muddy.  The book is so good, you will have to reread it just to make sure you got all it.  Texas Hold em' is easy to read -- whether on a horse or on a train or sitting in a recliner.  Nothing complicated, just a bunch of a essays that make the book very difficult to put down.  I hope this isn't the last we've heard from the Kinkster.
