 To put it mildly, this book failed to live up to my expectations.  I really was hoping to gain some insight on the PGA Tour, not a story about two lost souls who are trying to find themselves.  I don't even understand the title.  Where is the Blood (obviously neither wants success bad enough), Sweat (the guy rarely practiced, unless you count lifting a beer can) and Tees (that's exactly what I was: T-E-A-S-E-D).
