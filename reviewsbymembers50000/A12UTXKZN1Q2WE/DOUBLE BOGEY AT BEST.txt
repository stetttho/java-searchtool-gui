 Final Rounds was my first mystery in years.  Being a golf addict, I was hoping this book could keep my interest.  Final Rounds is a very easy read and the characters are clearly defined.  Regretfully, Mr. Bernhardt resorted to old cliches with very little originality.  The concept of the book is great.  The lead character, Mr. Cross is predictable and its a real shame especially with his personality (big shot golfer, lots of talent, ladies man and etc.).  The ending is totally unpredictable and had nothing to really do with the story.  It's almost as if the last 60 pages were quickly written to end the nightmare.  I really expected so much more and was very disappointed.  The fact that I finished the more is more of an accomplishment than this literary work.  Better luck next time!
