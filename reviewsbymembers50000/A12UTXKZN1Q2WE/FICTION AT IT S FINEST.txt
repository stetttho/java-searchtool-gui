 I'm not much of a fiction reader.  I only read this because I enjoyed Mr. Reilly's recent works -- Who's Your Caddy?  Missing Links is an entertaining novel about six golfing buddies, all with distinct personalities.  The character development done by Mr. Reilly is nothing short of spectacular.  There are enough twists and turns in the book to keep the reader turning the pages.  At the same time, there aren't so many characters that you're wondering who is who.  It's a shame the book had to end, rather abruptly I might add.  You don't have to like golf to enjoy this book.  Highly Recommended for Everybody!!!!!!!
