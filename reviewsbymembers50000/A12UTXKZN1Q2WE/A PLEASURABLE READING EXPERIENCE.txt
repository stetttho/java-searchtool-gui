 I make my living as a Collections Manager, so I was very intrigued by the title.  What we have here is a young man looking for direction in his life.  He finds it in an expected place, a job with the IRS.  As a Revenue Officer (tax collector), Yancey discovers success and personal growth.  The stories and his personal development is an interesting transformation.  The book is very easy to read and enjoyable.  The characters in the book are outstanding.  Anyone who thrives in the bureaucratic world can certainly relate to all of them.  Very good book, not a masterpiece but more than enough to keep you turning the pages.
