 Timbuktu is my first Paul Auster novel and surely won't be my last.  I applaude this insightful look at man's best friend.  The character development and creativity of Mr. Bones is truly remarkable.  This is an easy to read book but one with lots of messages.  Somehow, Auster masterfully puts you in the mind of a dog and takes the reader for a journey that's to be remembered long after the book is completed.  If you love dogs or better yet love top quality literature, this is the book for you.  I can't wait to get to the bookstore and check out more of Paul Auster.  Consider me a new fan Mr. Auster!!!!!
