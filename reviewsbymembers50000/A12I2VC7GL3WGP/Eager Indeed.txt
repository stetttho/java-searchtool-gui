 The first season of Starsky and Hutch was the best one.  This season had incorporated some humor (in the form of Huggy Bear) and was a fair buddy-cop show.  Later seasons lost the humor and the stars both wanted to not be buddy-buddy, and so the show developed into something less than what it was originally. In any case, the first season DVD is something worth purchasing and has my recommendation.
