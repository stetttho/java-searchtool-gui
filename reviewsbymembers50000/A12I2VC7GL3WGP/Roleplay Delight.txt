 The synopsis of this product is that there is a small halfling town beset by an unknown menace.  The small adventure that is linked to the village is fine and serves as a decent first or second level task.  The write-up of the village and its inhabitants is the strongest reason to invest in this product.  The adult citizens are given a brief synopsis, allowing for roleplay with the player characters.  There are a few other small tidbits for the characters to interact with around the village, such as a boy who is strangely hovering over a well; a halfling adult who has found a magic ring that he covets.  It took me several readings to thoroughly grasp this product though.  The inclusion of some other classes seemed out-of-place for an adventure setting, and the space spent on how a DM can track reputation to play a part in roleplaying are both venues better suited to a campaign setting, rather than an adventure module.  Perhaps that is why the cost of the product is higher than the average module currently on the market.  In any case, I would have preferred a price at or below ten dollars and saved the extra money for something of my own choosing than upon reading someone else's version of a cavalier PC.  In summary, a decent product, especially if you want to interact with a town setting.  The review is downgraded because of the higher price due to inclusion of material better suited to a campaign than for an adventure.
