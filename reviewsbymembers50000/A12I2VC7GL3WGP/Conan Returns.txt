 As the review pasted on the cover's front panel written by UPN-TV, "Non-stop, rock-solid action!"  It is essentially a return to the fun days of Conan the Barbarian and incorporates numerous action sequences to bring forth the plot of stopping the world's greatest swordsman from further dominanting the earth.  As the savage tribes fall one by one to this conquering enemy, they hire a small team of assassins led by The Rock, to exterminate the swordsman.  Due to a betrayal, he turns the table and The Rock is suddenly thrust alone to confront the enemy.  Alone that is, until he steals away the swordsman's ace, the Sorceress.  All-in-all, a fun movie, light on plot, heavy on action.
