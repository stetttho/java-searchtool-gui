 Although the title is Dungeons and Dragons, the movie retains very little of the game it has derived its name from.  Attempting to make an epic story through the inclusion of the powerful dragons, the plot quickly devolved into nonsense.  The hero of the story, played by Justin Whalen who should have stuck with the Superman television show, is gifted by the fey with a superior sword midway through the film, but continues to lose every sword fight he gets into.  His bumbling sidekick, played comedically by Marlon Wayans, is enjoyable but dies all too soon to suit mood of the movie.  Their pairing makes it difficult to imagine them as the heroes of a film trying to be epic in its storyline.  Aside from the over-the-top acting from Jeremy Irons and the little-used apprentice mage love-interest, none of the other characters makes an impact in the story.  The dwarven and elven companions to the group never even get one swing in during the entire movie, making their inclusion even more preposterous as they become more liability to their scenes than a benefit.   The best way to approach this film is to not expect too much, roll with the lack of reasonable plotline, and simply enjoy what it does deliver.  A somewhat humorous spoof of fantasy movies done poorly.
