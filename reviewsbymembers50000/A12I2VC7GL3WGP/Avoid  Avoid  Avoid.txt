 If you enjoy cartoons ... avoid this product!  If you enjoy sci-fi ... avoid this product!  If you enjoy sci-fi cartoons ... avoid this product!  While I understand a good review should detail parts of the product, I nearly had to stab myself in the eye to get to the end of the cartoons in order to end my misery.  As such I refuse to expend the effort to go into great detail for such a shameless titling as "The Greatest Sci-Fi Cartoons of All Time" ... argh.
