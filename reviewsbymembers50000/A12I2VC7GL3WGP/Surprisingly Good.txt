 A month after beginning the module, my group is still talking about it.  My friends have stated that the mystery and role playing aspects in this module led to intense discussions regarding moral choices and decisions. Unlike a dungeon crawl, this module is a bit more openended after the party eventually arrives to the village, and as the DM, it provided me with some opportunities to spur thought about exactly what the group was really accomplishing.  Since my group never follows the delineated path anyhow, and muck around with things unforeseen by module creators, this was the type of storyline that allowed them to excel at their craft.
