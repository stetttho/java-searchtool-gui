 Transporter has several surprises that puts it above others of its ilk such as Steven Segal films.  By following a strict set of rules, Frank Martin (played by Jason Statham) has an impeccable reputation in the underworld as a transporter of illegal goods.  When his latest client double-crosses him, Frank takes the war directly to him starting off a series of events that leads to the destruction of Frank's home and the effort to thwart his adversary's human slave trade.  Shu Qi stars as the romantic lead, complicating the normally uncomplicated Frank Martin's life.  I would have given this movie five stars if it hadn't had so many unbelievable events occur.  There just happens to be two sets of air tanks and fins kept beneath Frank's home; a man who associates with no one and keeps life uncomplicated will be ready for someone to join him in an underwater swim?  While I have no idea how much money a slave trader makes when hauling 400 Chinamen around, I have serious doubts he could readily afford to pay over 20 well-dressed thugs for hugely long fight scenes, and still have enough left over to split it with a Chinese partner.  Nitpicking aside, The Transporter is a fun and intriguing movie well worth picking up for those that enjoy the genre.
