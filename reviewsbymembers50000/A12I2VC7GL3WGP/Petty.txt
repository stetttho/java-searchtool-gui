 Paris Hilton and Nicole Ritchie do one thing well ... demonstrate the pettiness that pervades America's youths.  The FOX series is nothing more than a meandering tale of two females who are completely "anti-lady" as they connive, cheat and steal from the folks who open up their homes, workplaces, and lives to the pair. In a continuous fit of irresponsibility, the series shows the females breaking curfew, showing up late to work, and getting fired from more than one job.  In their unladylike personalities, the females regularly insult their hosts, both directly to their faces and behind their backs.  In an ultimate crime of nonhumor, Paris Hilton and Nicole Ritchie actually debate about stealing, then choose to steal regardless of its consequences, and when confronted by the owner of the credit card they criminally used, they laughed behind his back for their deceit. Mr. and Mrs. Hiltons and Ritchies, you've done a miserable job of bringing up two young women.  You should be ashamed.  Please, birth no more children into this world if you cannot present them with even a modicum of worldliness.
