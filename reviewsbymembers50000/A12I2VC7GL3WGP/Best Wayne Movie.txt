 John Wayne has made a slew of fantastic movies; this is one of them.  His portrayal of a young gunslinger, Quirt Evans, rescued by a Quaker family was dead-on.  The inclusion of Gail Russell as the doe-eyed Quaker farmgirl was what made the movie better than most Wayne flicks.  The character of Penelope Worth accurately portrayed a young country gal unused to the gunslinger's criminal elements, yet able to steer his heart towards her.  The final showdown scene illustrated her connection with the gunman which led to a romantic conclusion.
