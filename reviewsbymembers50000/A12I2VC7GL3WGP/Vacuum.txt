 The idea of the film is intriguing, and is what brought me to purchase it, but the viewing of it left me feeling like I've been chewing the air in a vacuum.  The film is mindless drivel, and while that can be overcome with an aire of fun, this movie did not support it enough times to be worthy of purchase.  Since the replay value is quite low, my advice is to save your money.  If you really must spend it, invest in Enron instead.
