 I have no doubt that Christopher Rice has talent but you wouldn't know it much from this novel.  It's so boring.  Nothing happens.  I actually managed to get half way through the book and was so bored with it, I just stopped. NOTHING HAPPENS...Certainly if it did, it was someplace after the middle of the book!
