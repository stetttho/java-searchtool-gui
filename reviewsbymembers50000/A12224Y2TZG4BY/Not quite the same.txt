 Let me first say, I'm a huge Carpenters fan and have been since they first burst on the scene in the late 60's, early 70's.  Having said that and knowing there may be other older fans of theirs out their seeking to get their beloved Carpenters Christmas Portrait on CD in order to replace their album or tape, this is not the same album you bought all those years ago.  This is the combination of The Christmas Portait album and the Old Fashioned Christmas with a few songs missing.  I have the same problem with this New Version of a Christmas Portrait that I did when I first purchased Old Fashioned Christmas and that is, I do not simply want to wait eight minutes to hear Karen start singing.  This version comes across as being a bit over-produced because of this.  It was obvious after my first listen of Old Fashioned Christmas that it was "left overs" from the Christmas Portrait album. I realize Richard was trying to get the best of both worlds when he combined the two but I'm uncertain why he chose to leave out the jazz version of Santa Clause is coming to town, particularly since it is their second best known Christmas song.  Having said all that, this is not a bad purchase but I prefer the original Christmas Portrait and my album is far superior in the sense of the original order and context of the songs.  For those who agree, it would be best to buy the more expensive Christmas Collection to get the albums combined in one purchase but not mixed together instead of this version with the sum of both parts combined as one.
