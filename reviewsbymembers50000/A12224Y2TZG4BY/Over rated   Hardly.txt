 Norah Jones is one of the best artists to come around in a long time.  If you like Bonnie Raitt, you may very well enjoy Norah. Monotone voice as stated by past reviewers?  Her range may be somewhat limited but she is a good vocalist nonetheless.  As far as vocals, it's so annoying that there are so very few good "singers" these days anyway.  Buy this album, it deserved every award it got.
