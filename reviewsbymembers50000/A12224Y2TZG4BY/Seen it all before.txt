 Robert De Niro plays a psychologist who's wife commits suicide.  He and his daughter played by Dakota Fanning move to upstate New York.  It doesn't take long for weird things to start happening.  For a psychologist I found it odd that De Niro's character seemed to have little insight into his daughter's psychological issues and seemed at a loss with how to deal with her apparent imaginary friend.  Little things like that make films less believeable.  Quite frankly Dakota Fanning's talent is the only reason to watch this film.  You're likely to be disappointed and very unsurprised at the so-called twist at the end of the film.
