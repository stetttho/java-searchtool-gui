 Another predictable, boring, and totally unbelievable, overblown, pointless Hollywood production.  Do we really need to see Al Pacino in another meaningless "mentor" film?  I don't think so.  One week his recruit is a bartender and voila, the next he's in the CIA...WOW!  Can you believe that one?  Avoid unless you like bad spy films.
