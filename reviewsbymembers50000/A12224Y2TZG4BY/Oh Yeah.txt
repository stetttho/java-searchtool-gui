 If you are like me and an old fan of Heart since the 70's but have been disappointed with their over-produced 90's era, then look no further!  This album is arguably just as good or better than their offerings in the 70's.  There are acoustical as well as electric rock offerings here that will not disappoint.  The band has never sounded better in this line-up.  The only disappointment, and a minor one indeed, is that Ann only sings on this offering but it doesn't matter.  Nancy takes front and center here with vocals and various instrumentation.  The album is wonderfully crafted and even the CD is packaged beautifully.  I would recommend this to any old Heart fan who longs for their earlier edgy sound as well as any new, curious fan.  It is no wonder that Heart deserves a high place in the rock world rarely reserved for the female artist and were sometimes called the "female" Led Zeppelin...true or not, this CD is a classic offering!
