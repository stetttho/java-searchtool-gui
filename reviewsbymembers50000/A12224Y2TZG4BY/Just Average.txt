 I hate to agree with Richard, but a lot of this album certainly doesn't do Karen justice.  True, it doesn't sound like the Carpenters but then again IT'S A SOLO ALBUM.  Poor Karen.  First everyone tried to get her to quit playing the drums (did anyone attempt to have Richard removed from playing the piano?) and then she got her first solo album shelved - with her marriage on the rocks, attempting to recover from anorexia nervosa (does anyone see the sad irony in her choice of My Body Keeps Changing My Mind?) and Richard in detox, Karen needed to work and this is what she came up with.  Some of these songs are real clunkers.  What was she thinking when she came up with Still Crazy after all these years?  However songs like If I had you truly showed the talent that Karen had to display and she will always be, in my mind, the greatest female singer who ever lived.  I'm sorry that Phil Ramone as her producer, didn't do a better job in helping Karen select better material for her solo project and that it was shelved.  I'm certain that A & M had far worse albums that should have been kept out of the public view.  I recommend this album only to true Carpenters fans; for someone wanting something OTHER THAN a greatest hits album, The Close to You, Song for You and Carpenters (the tan album) are better and more worthy listens.  Karen may have been in the forefront, both were great musicians, but Richard was the mastermind when it came to The Carpenters "sound".
