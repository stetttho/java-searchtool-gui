 It's true some of these songs could be left out to make a single album, and many reviewers have said that; however, if you read enough of the reviews, you will see some discrepencies between reviewers on which ones should have been kept on the album and the ones that should have been discarded.  I suggest you just listen to it yourself and enjoy it.  It's not the best of the Beatles.  In my opinion, Revolver is but I think you will find some songs you will like.
