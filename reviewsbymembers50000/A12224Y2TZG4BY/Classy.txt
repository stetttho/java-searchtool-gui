 Wow, it's hard to believe that this album was done in the late 70's because it sounds like it could have been recorded day before yesterday.  A great combination of soul, sultry ballads and even child-like songs of innocence and even some light jazz. I just can't say enough good things about this album.  I don't believe Rickie Lee has done a better album than this one.  Some words more talked rather than being sung and you feel and believe every word.  This album will stir many emotions within and has done so for me since I bought it years back.
