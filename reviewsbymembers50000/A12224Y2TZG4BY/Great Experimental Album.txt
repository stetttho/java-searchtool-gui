 If you like the flaming lips, you will like this.  Very 60'ish sound.  A Long Day should have never been included on this or it should have been stuck as a 30 second intro into another song.  36 minutes of drones is way too much and makes me wonder did they not have several more musical sounding songs to add to this disc.  Other than that, you will not be disappointed!
