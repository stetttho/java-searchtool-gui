 It's always surprises me when someone decides to attempt to be avante garde by doing a film but doing it "play" style....and this isn't even done well.  If I want to go see a play, I will go see a play.  I wanted to see a film....This was poorly done...Who wants to see a barebones play done on film anyway?  There are hardly any props besides that.  I enjoy films that are "different" but this one bored me to tears.
