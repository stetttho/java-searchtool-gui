 Done before Fatal Attraction and done better by Eastwood.  Unfortunately, this film has not withstood the test of time as well as Fatal Atraction albeit the 70's slang, clothing, music, etc. Still, one feels much more sympathetic with Eastwood's character then Michael Douglas because he doesn't have a wife and child in tow. I remember seeing this when it first came out as well as another great film that Eastwood starred in:  The Beguiled.   Play Misty for Me is a great thriller for a Saturday evening.  Check it out!
