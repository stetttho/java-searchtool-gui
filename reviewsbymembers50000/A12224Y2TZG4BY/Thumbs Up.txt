 Not quite as good as American Splendor:  The Life and Times of Harvey Pekar but still very good and should not be missed.  I cannot help but relate to Harvey because the similarities in where he used to work (I used to work in the medical records department of a hospital) his love of comics and jazz and his friends who are loveable but quirky.  This is definitely not for those who are only into super hero oriented comics.  This is day to day scenerios that happen to any ordinary person but Harvey tells his stories in an extraordinary way.
