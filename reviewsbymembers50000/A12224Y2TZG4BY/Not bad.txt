 This disc isn't as bad as what some would have you believe and not as good as others seem to feel it is either.  I doubt that Morrissey will ever put out another work as good as Your Arsenal but I wouldn't expect that either...the lyrics here are clever as usual and there's nothing 'anti-American' in America is not the world...It just speaks the truth...How can an acknowledgement that there have never been any black, female or gay presidents be anything but the truth?  The very fact that this song turned some fans off is nothing but an acknowledgement that what is written is the truth. Unfortunately, in my opinion, the weakness here is the music.  There's just nothing that stands out as far as the tunes. In any case, I think it's an o.k. album if you're already a fan but this is not the place to start if you're curious about Morrissey's work.
