 Well, I liked this film but it seems that most people who did not went to the theatre thinking it was a comedy.  Why?  Because that's how it was advertised.  All the amusing scenes were used in order to get mainstream audiences to attend it and boy, were they all pissed off when they found out it was a drama - and a drama that makes you think as well!  If you're not sure what sort of movie you're going to see according to the ads, go see a film like dumb and dumberer then it will be obvious.  I blame most of the bad reviews on hollywood trying to hoodwink the audience to attend this film.  I figured out the ploy however when in the local listings it was catagorized as a "drama", therefore, that's what I expected. So all that aside, this is a good film but it is a bit weak and slow in some parts but if you wait it out, it does have a message and it is highly entertaining!
