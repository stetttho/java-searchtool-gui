 One evening years ago while listening to Public Radio, Mr. Talbot was interviewed about his book and I sat and listened transfixed to what he had to say.  The story that most stuck in my mind was the story of the hypnotism of a man where the hypnotist stood behind a subject with a watch and asked the gentleman to tell him what he had in his hand and the man told him he had a watch.  I immediately went out and bought this book and though it's in the science section, it may very well be in the paranormal section.  An interesting and intriguing read!  Highly recommended for concepts such as the paranormal and the brain's power to heal the body and mind.
