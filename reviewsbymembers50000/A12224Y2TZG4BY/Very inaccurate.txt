 I cannot believe all the positive reviews of this film!  Mark Rydell did a very poor job of portraying "The Real" James Dean...Any real James Dean fan can point out countless inaccuracies in this film and some of it is not just inaccurate, it was MADE UP!  I've read scads of Jimmy's biographies and have a pretty good idea that Rydell took a good deal of the bad stuff about Jimmy.  I thought he made him look like a real heel and ignored the more positive aspects of his personality.  A more accurate film of Jimmy's life is the Michael Brandon portrayal of him that was based on Bill Bast's fifties biography.
