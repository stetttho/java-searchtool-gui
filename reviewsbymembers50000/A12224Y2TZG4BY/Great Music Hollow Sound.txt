 No, A lighter shade of Pale is NOT on the debut album of Procol Harum and it wasn't on the original disc to begin with.  You'll have to get the remastered version that includes extra tracks for that.  I do, however, agree that this is not a good remix and the sound is flat and hollow.  It is an excellent introduction, however, to a great group.  You might want to spend more money and get the box set.
