 Once again Warner Brothers Takes a good film and doesn't bother trying to find a good master copy in order to do a decent transfer.  What is it with them?  It's bad enough that they have cheap cardboard covers let alone not even bothering trying to at least have decent copies. This is a good film and deserved better treatment. SHAME ON WARNER BROTHERS AND THEIR CHEAP TREATMENT OF GOOD FILMS!
