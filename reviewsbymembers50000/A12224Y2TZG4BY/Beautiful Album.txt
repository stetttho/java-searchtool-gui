 Patti's best since Gone Again in my opinion.  Beautiful interwoven music and poetic-like lyrics.  Patti's intriguing and spell-binding at her best here and never boring at her worst.  I can't find a bad song on this set actually.  I won't comment on any political statements.  You can judge that for yourself.  The band is tight here as well and it's nice to hear actual music with melody and introspective words.  If you're an old fan you will love it and if you're new to Patti, this would be a good place to start.
