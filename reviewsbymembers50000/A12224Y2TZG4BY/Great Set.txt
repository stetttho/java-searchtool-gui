 Great set!  The other reviewer, Bud, has no idea what he's talking about.  Since when does a singer have to actually write songs in order to express emotion or to tap into a raw power that someone else has written?  You don't have to invent the wheel to know how to drive the car. This is a great re-mastered set for those wanting a clear and pristine sound along with some previously unreleased material.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it has no great booklet with pictures and more history to go with it.  Janis Rocks On!
