 Arggggg!  What a load of manure this disc is!  I like The Cure but I can barely handle listening to this disc for more than 2 minutes.  Robert Smith's screaming and shouting and there's no melodic songs on here at all.  The only thing worse than listening to this disc is looking at the shoddy cover art.  Maybe some will find the artwork of children "cute" but I think something more substantial could have been chosen for the bloody cover.  Avoid unless you enjoy listening to the sound of fingernails scratching a chalkboard.
