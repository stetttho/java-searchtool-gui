 This film gets my vote as one of the worst films I've ever seen in my entire life and that's saying a lot.  I've not read the book so I'm sure whatever was done here was not Stephen King's fault!  What is Morgan Freeman doing in this moronic piece of crap?  I cannot believe, at this juncture, that this film has three stars on Amazon.com!!!!  If I could give it less than one star, I would!  Avoid avoid avoid!
