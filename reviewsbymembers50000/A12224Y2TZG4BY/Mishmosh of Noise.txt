 Absolute [junk].  This could have been a good album if more songs like Walkin' on the Sun were on it.  Some of the intros are great until the actual songs start like Padrino for example and then they unleash a barrel of noisy, monotonous [junk] that's supposed to be music but bears little resemblance.  Don't waste your money on this one!
