 In the 80's after Windham Hill's success with New Age, Narada came and originally had some fine acoustical acts.  Things certainly have changed in the new age genre.  It's a shame that most "new age" music is not as it once was - contemporary instrumental music consisting mostly of acoustical music.  Now every Tom, Dick and Harry buys a synthesizer and calls it new age.  Old 80's Windham Hill and Narada were once prime examples of how lovely the "new age" genre could be.  Narada is not the same any longer (neither is Windham Hill under the direction now of someone other than its founder/guitarist William Ackerman).  Disc one is good in the sense that you get that old Narada sound but disc two is all flamenco and if you're not into that, you won't like this set.  I would save my money and buy one of the other Narada Collections if that is the case.
