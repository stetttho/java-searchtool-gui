 I'm not sure if the last reviewer (Lawrence) was aware, but Virginia Wolfe was not part of this film.  The lady who pointed out to Lytton that Carrington was a girl was Vanessa Bell.  Virginia Wolfe never had children. I had to view this film more than once to appreciate it.  After all, I felt it should be called 'Lytton' instead of 'Carrington.'  This is probably because this film was based on Lytton's biography and not Carrington's. In fact, Carrington had many affairs according to an interview with Emma Thompson and some were with women but of course, there wasn't time to put all that on film. Lytton and Carrington were definitely an odd couple and this is an odd but very interesting film!
