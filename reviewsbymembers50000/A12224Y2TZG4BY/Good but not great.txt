 This film came out about the same time as the Sixth Sense but it's not as good...It's still a watchable and enjoyable film though...I give it three stars because it insults your intelligence; i.e., you are supposed to believe that Kevin Bacon's character has psychic abilities; he knows a girl was murdered yet he hasn't a clue where the girl's body is and tears the house up and down trying to locate it?  His abilities must be very limited and the audience is supposed to just enjoy the ride and ignore the impossible!
