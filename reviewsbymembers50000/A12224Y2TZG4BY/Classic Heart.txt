 I must say I disagree with Jon Wiederhorn's introductory review of this Heart work.  This album is much more accessable than their debut effort and clearly reveals their Zeppelin influences with heavy mandolin/acoustic guitar plays.  The other reviewer who liked Dream of the Archer and said he did not like Sylvan Song seems unaware that Sylvan Song is the lead in or introduction of Dream of the Archer.  I'm uncertain how you can dislike one and prefer the other.  No more is it clear that this is a 70's album when one hears Ann play the flute.  As much as I enjoy their new work Jupiters Darling, I miss hearing that wonderful flute sound!  To me this is the best album that Heart released and it's too bad there's not more music out there like this today.  Pick up the newly remastered version of this today and enjoy a couple of extra tunes as well.
