 Like other reviewers, reading this book made me envious of Tom Neale's fulfilled fantasy of living and surviving alone on a beautiful tropical island.  Actually, it took him an incredible amount of hard work to get to that point, and even more work, determination, and creativity to provide for all his needs from the limited stores he brought with him and what the island itself offered.  He ingeniously found ways to build, cook, raise animals, hunt, and eat.  Tom enjoyed the challenge of survival, yet his physical toughness was sometimes severely tested in battling the elements.  I lived every beautiful and frustrating moment with him (in my imagination, of course).  One reviewer mentioned that Tom must have married and had two kids because the reviewer had just ordered one of his books about his sailing adventures, but that is a different Tom Neale that is currently living.  The Tom Neale of An Island to Myself passed away quite a few years ago, and I'm pretty sure he remained a bachelor.  Fun book!
