 For the last several years my summer school has included art every day for students whose ages range from 6-13.  This book has an excellent selection of art projects that are appropriate for all these ages.  Everything is made using construction paper, scissors and glue, which are readily available in the school supply room, are inexpensive and easy to work with.  The projects turn out bright and colorful.  My class has just completed a lively mural of a pond habitat after making fun frogs, fish, turtles and other aquatic creatures and plants, using ideas from the book. I love the instructions and lay-out of the book.  The steps and resulting project are clearly shown in large drawings with minimal text, so it just takes a few minutes to read through each project. Some of the projects feature geometrical designs and patterns, which allow substantial room for creativity, some fold and curve paper to make them  three dimensional.  There is a good variety of themes including animals, seasons, nature, a still life, a robot, and a couple of cultural items.  Although I haven't done it yet, the Panamanian mola looks like it will turn out stunning. If I want to stick to using paper, glue and scissors for my art classes, this book will give us plenty of fun and attractive projects to do for several weeks.  Parents will also find it a great source for young artists at home.
