 In Child of the Morning, I learned about the incredible Hatshepsut.  In Gedge's interpretation of this period of history, Hatshepsut was the darling of her father, Pharaoh Thothmes.  He fed her self-esteem and she learned at his feet how to rule a kingdom.  Eventually she came to see herself as a capable ruler, and when her father died, she was given this opportunity.  She filled in as ruler until her brother was old enough to reign, and proved her ability to rule with wisdom.  During her reign she took on the masculine dress of a pharaoh, and in private, she had a discreet affair with the architect Senmut, who with Hatshepsut's influence, rose to a great position of power at her side. With dignity, Hatshepsut struggled to maintain her reign, because not everyone agreed with having a woman to lead them.  Hatshepsut knew she was in danger from those who plotted against her, and eventually tragedy befell her.  From archaeological evidence, we know that an attempt was made to erase all signs that Egypt had had a woman pharaoh, but enough survived that we know something about her. It's very likely that Gedge does not have the history completely correct.  Other fiction about Hatshepsut presents the story differently, and not only that, non-fiction history books about her disagree on the relationships between her and other members of the royal family, and how Hatshepsut came to power and died.  Gedge's interpretation is as good as anyone's.  I love this as well as Gedge's other books because she creates a visual image of the time and place that it is so vivid, you can see, hear, taste, and smell it...you are transported to ancient Egypt.
