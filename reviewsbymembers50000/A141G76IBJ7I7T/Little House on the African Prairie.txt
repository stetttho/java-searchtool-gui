 This movie series, based on the book of the same name by Elspeth Huxley, gives us a glimpse of the settling of the English in Africa during the early 1900s.  If for nothing else, I liked the series for gaining insight about that period.   Elspeth was there as a child and was lucky to see Africa and live in proximity to that fantastic wildlife, however, the movie shows us that their sentiment for the animals was not necessarily to protect them.  They were into big game hunting, and showing off animal head tropies on their walls.  The wild animals were either for sport or were a nuisance, and although I know that's the way they thought then, I still didn't enjoy watching the casual way they hunted and killed animals in the movie.  This is one of the reasons I don't recommend it for children, in addition to the fact that one of the married women has an affair, and the plot moves slowly in places.  Otherwise, the movie is pleasant and interesting, kind of like a Little House on the Prairie in Africa.  The end of the movie left me suddenly hanging, and I wish they'd do a sequel to it based on the book sequel.
