 This is a slender book with 10 art projects that replicate mosaic for kids.  The projects include: a greeting card decorated with paper "tiles";  an African mask; a picture of a knight made with silver-toned washers, bolts, etc; a fabric shoebag decorated with a felt "tile" design; an Egyptian necklace with painted macaroni mosaic; mosaic cookies; a clay pot covered with painted eggshells.  The very-clear photos show the projects from start to finish.  The finished projects are shown by children, but look quite professional as if they were done by adults, however, older children should be able to follow the instructions with good results.  Younger children would definitely need help.
