 Green Flash beckoned me to read it because it takes place in Zihuatanejo, Mexico, a tropical, sunny, ocean community where I have vacationed a few times.  It was fun to be able to accurately visualize and "relive" being in the locations described. As I began reading, the somewhat unsophisticated style of writing was obvious.  Time is spent on some unnecessary details; the sentence structure and vocabulary, other than nautical terms, is fairly ordinary.  There are some glaring editorial oversights: misplaced punctuation, incorrect word usage, such as "passed" instead of "past", and spelling errors. In spite of that, I found Green Flash to be entertaining.  It's a quick read and easy to follow, partly because of its uncomplicated style.  The mystery itself was enticing.  After Jessie and Neal discovered a woman's body floating in the ocean, they distastefully tied it up to their boat to haul it to shore.  They had removed the video camera from the body, and had been ordered to turn it in to authorities as evidence, without opening it or disturbing the film.  As they prepare to take it to Mexico City, they become involved with several of the members of the seafaring community, who create the cast of suspect characters. It's during their journey to get the camera to Mexico City, that all the excitement takes place.  Seemingly unrelated acts of violence and sabotage keep happening to them and the friends that accompany them. Will they make it to Mexico City, and what will the film reveal?  Who is attacking them, and why?  Who toppled the unfortunate Jennifer over the side of her boat, letting her drown? I give credit to the author who has used her own ocean-going experiences to create this story, which I believe is her first.  It was a fun and entertaining mystery.
