 If it weren't for movies based on books today, many of us would never become acquainted with classic literature. Silas Marner is a gem of a movie, obviously based on a classic, and after seeing it, I understand why the book is required reading in many English classes. I myself have never read the book, and therefore appreciate becoming acquainted with it through this movie.  The setting appears to be in the 1600-1700s England. Silas Marner is wrongly accused of murder and is exiled from his community. When he arrives in another village, he becomes the mysterious weaver of fine cloth, who lives alone and rarely speaks to anyone. The squire from whom he rents his cottage meanwhile, is providing for his opium-addicted wife that he has secretly married. He keeps her and their baby daughter hidden from the public in a tiny apartment in the village. Struggling to the squire's mansion one night to reveal her existence to his family, the woman dies in the snow, and Silas Marner finds the toddler in his cottage. Immediately he takes to her, and convinces people he should adopt her. The following part of the movie of his developing relationship with this adorable little acress is precious.  Marner lives frugally, raising the child, but when she is 16, the squire steps in, and Marner and his daughter must make a decision that will test their relationship. There is a subplot concerning the squire's wayward brother whose actions affect all their lives, forcing all the characters to a turning point. Ben Kingsley's acting is excellent as he goes through the different periods of his life, and the movie does a fine job of portraying the era. The movie, like the book, may not be top-draw, but like the book, it also deserves classic status.
