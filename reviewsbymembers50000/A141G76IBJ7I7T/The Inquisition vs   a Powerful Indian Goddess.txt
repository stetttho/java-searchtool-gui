 In the 1500s the Inquisition was going strong, with its persecutors going after anyone who wasn't strictly confined to the doctrines of the Catholic church.  This generally included Jews, Protestants and suspected witches, but in "Goa" there's a twist on that idea.  This time the hounds of God are on the trail of a mysterious person that is producing a magical substance...the blood of an Indian goddess that supposedly can raise the dead.  To the church, the mysterious goddess must be the incarnation of evil, and anyone who uses her blood for magic must be punished  However, there is a secret mission on behalf of one of "God's men"...to gain control of the secret of the blood and use it for his own purposes.   Normally I read historical fiction to learn about history, but I enjoyed this sidetrip into a little fantasy, which also included some danger and suspense.  The author had a great idea here, however, I think the she did herself a disservice by not combining the three shorts books of the trilogy into one bigger, more impressive book.  Goa is followed by "Bijapur: Blood of the Goddess", and then "Bhagavati".
