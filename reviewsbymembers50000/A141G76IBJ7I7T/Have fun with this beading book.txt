 I have quite a few beading books and this one is a welcome addition to my collection.  Even though it was published in 1995, most of the jewelry pieces still look stylish.  This author wastes no time talking about bead types and their histories.  A short introduction lets us know that she is a bead addict like many of us, and then she jumps into a few pages of the basics about materials and techniques.  They are not extensive, so a beginner may have trouble using the skimpy instructions to get started in jewelry making, and may want to get help from an experienced beader.  But these pretty pieces are enough to inspire.  There's a nice variety of strung-bead necklaces and earrings, some with wirework connecting the beads.  The colors and the mixtures of beads are what really stand out in this artistic collection.  Styles range from simple to elegant, light and fun to heavy and with ethnic charm.  A couple of projects use coiled wire in interesting ways, and though I myself don't use them, there are a few attractive pins for hair and clothing. Half of the book is taken up with projects made by weaving beads with needle and thread.  I have not tried them yet, but the instructions look clear and easy enough to follow.  There are many beautiful and artistic pieces here, too.  Some examples include a luscious lavendar and yellow jasper stone encased in a weaving of similarly colored seed beads, a pair of quartz crystal earrings, held in place at the top in a sheathing of seed beads, and quite a few bracelets and purse-shaped pendants made with woven seed beads, some done on a bead loom.  They are all beautiful, in my opinion. The last few pages show how to make your own beads of paper, fabric, and polymer clay, and these clay beads are pretty and creative.  There are a lot of ideas here, and beaders should find several that will make this book worth adding to their collection.
