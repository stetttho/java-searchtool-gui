 This exquisite film places romance, danger, emotional and political turmoil on a backdrop of beautiful photography.  Catherine Deneuve plays a perfect role as Eliane, a single, powerful woman in charge of a plantation in what was then Indochina, and soon to be Viet Nam.  The orphaned Asian baby girl she adopts grows up to fall in love with Jean Babtiste, the same man that Eliane is having an affair with. This point feels somewhat like a soap opera, but the movie quickly launches into so much more, with many plot elements that lead daughter Camille on a desperate and dangerous journey to follow Jean to a remote mlitary outpost.   When Camille witnesses an atrocity against a friend, she kills a Frenchman, and she and Jean become refugees.  They are caught in the events of political chaos, surrounded by an uprising against the French, and surging Communism.  Matters are complicated when Camille gives birth, and the family is torn asunder. I won't give away any more of the plot, but there is much more that happens.  The movie's history lesson, as well as its emotional charge and colorful scenery in that Asian land, kept me glued to the screen.
