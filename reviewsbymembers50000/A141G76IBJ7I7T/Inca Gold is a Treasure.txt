 I love stories that take me around the world to new and unusual locations, and to different periods of history.  In this book, we begin with some mysterious strangers in 1532, on a journey along the coast of South America to hide their vast treasure from invaders.  Then we move to 1578, when Sir Francis Drake captures Inca treasure, but a tidal wave washes it to shore where it settles deep into the jungle, hidden until the present time, when the treasure becomes the object of illegal dealers smuggling artifacts. Enter our hero, Dirk Pitt, who stumbles across the path of these dangerous criminals just after he has saved a group of archaeologists from drowning while diving into the dark depths of an ancient sacrificial pool.  From there, the excitement never stops! In a contest with the smugglers, we plunge through the South American jungle, and journey north to American Indian territory in the southwest deserts of the United States.  We get trapped underground, rushing through miles of a raging subterranean river, gasping for air with danger and death a constant threat!  Dirk is challenged to bear up and hang on through incredible physical hardships.  Realistically, no one could survive all these dangers and injuries, but miraculously, thanks to our ability to suspend belief, Dirk Pitt does, and we get to go on these wild adventures with him! As an intelligent adult it's almost embarrassing to rate this a 5, seeing that so many other adult reviewers consider this book to be material for juveniles!  So, please forgive my enchantment with this book...it was a crazy ride, and a great interlude in my normal diet of historical fiction.
