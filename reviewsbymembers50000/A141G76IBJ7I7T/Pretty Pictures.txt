 The very first impression I get when opening this book is "what pretty, artistic photos!"  I think the beautiful photography steals the show in this book, which is meant to be an instructional book.  The jewelry is also very nice, and probably looks even better because of the photographer's eye for arrangement, angle, lighting, soft focus, etc.   I definitely find inspiration in this book for creating the jewelry shown, and I like the variety of styles which look quite contemporary; not outdated.  But I, even as an experienced beader, was a little thwarted by the very photos that I also praise!  The fact that they are soft-focus, faded at the edges, and do not show the details of all parts of the jewelry, left me with questions regarding the finished look of the piece, or construction details.  I can certainly figure it out, but I can't imagine a beginner would.   All the instructions are written, and there are no diagrams, which are so important for beginners.  Some of the terminology for jewelry components or methods are not explained, so a beginner would need to refer to other sources.  It's because of this lack of clarity I give the book a 4.  For experienced beaders, I do recommend this book for additional inspiration in a beader's library.
