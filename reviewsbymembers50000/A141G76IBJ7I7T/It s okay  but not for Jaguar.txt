 This review is based on my attempt to connect this scanner with Mac OX 10.2 (Jaguar). The included software are the scanner driver, Canon toolbox (both necessary for the scanner to work), Photostudio (an image editing program), and Omnipage, which is OCR software. I installed all the software on system 9.2 of my new I-Mac, and it ran fine there; it did a decent photo scan, though it was fairly slow, and Omnipage did a decent job with a scanned document. The Lide30 is one of the few scanners that currently claims to support OS 10 native, but here's what happened. I restarted the computer in 10.2 and from Canon's support site downloaded the driver and Toolbox for OS 10, but then I discovered that neither Photostudio nor Omnipage had been updated for OS 10. When I tried to scan a document, sure the scanner could run in 10, but it then had to switch to Classic to use Omnipage. I then tried to scan a photo, but it couldn't make a connection with the driver until I turned off Classic and restarted in 10.2. What a hassle! The next test came when scanning a 4x6 photo on highest resolution (1200 dpi) from 10.2. My system is beefed up with plenty of RAM, but it took 20 minutes to scan! I had programmed the scanner to open this photo in Photoshop Elements (the instructions say you need Photoshop 7 to use the scanner in System 10). Elements did read and open it, but it took about another 15 minutes to do so. I have used Elements to open other large files, but it never before has taken more than a few seconds. Strange. Because of these difficulties, I decided to return the scanner.  For users of all other platforms this scanner could very well rate higher than the "3" I gave it, especially considering its comparatively low price.
