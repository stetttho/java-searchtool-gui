 This commemorative book, published in 1992, certainly does its job of commemorating the movie Casablanca.  It's a slender book with tons of photos of the actors, sets, and posters from the movie, and packed with everything you seemingly would want to know about it.   You find out about what led to Casablanca's production, its inspiration, how the actors were chosen, the history occurring at the time that helped it along, the quarrels on set, the difficulties with budget and timing, the process for coming up with the ending of the movie.  You learn about the director's accent and odd way of speaking that sometimes confused everyone.  (When he asked for a "poodle" and such a dog was brought, he angrily tried to clarify that what he wanted was a "puddle". )  You learn about Bogart's standoffishness to Ingrid Bergman, and Peter Lorre's continual playing of practical jokes on the cast.  There's a bio about each actor, and how the movie affected his or her career, and a listing of movies that were intended copies or spinoffs.  This is a great book if you love Casablanca, its actors, or want to know about moviemaking of that era.
