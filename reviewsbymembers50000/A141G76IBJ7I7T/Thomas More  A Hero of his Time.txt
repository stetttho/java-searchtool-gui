 A narrator can make or break a book on tape.  Clifford Norgate reads with clarity and depth of feeling, carrying to the listener the emotions and personality of each of the characters.  He especially brings Sir Thomas More alive, emphasizing what a great man he is portrayed to be by author Jean Plaidy.   What a good education I received about Thomas More, whose name I had only vaguely heard of.  Through this book I came to care about him and his family, who loved and respected one another so much.  Thomas More was held in high esteem by all who knew him.  His daughters, whom he encouraged to be educated because he believed women had a mind equal to a man's, adored him.  However, his daughter Margaret questioned him when More criticized the German Martin Luther for his teachings against Catholicism, for More had always seemed so accepting of the beliefs of others. In spite of that dark period during his attack on Luther, More was a good and moral man.  When he refused to approve of the King declaring himself the head of the church, and of the King's divorce of his wife in order to remarry a woman who would bear a son, More became a marked man.  The king was determined to win More's public support or let him die.  Once imprisoned, More had to  make a decision to live for his family or go against his beliefs and willingly die. The reader/listener is carried along with the emotional tide of these events, and taken back in time to experience with this family their joys and sorrows for the sake of this good man.
