 I sympathize with the author's idea of creating a book of photos and art that would show readers of her novel, The Far Pavilions, the images that inspired it.  The novel is a classic set in India, but this picture book did not particularly help me visualize the scenes from the book.  I think my own imagination, prior knowledge of India, and previous browsing of books and magazines portraying India created all the mental images I needed to interpret the novel.  However, some people may really enjoy what the author compiled from her own files, which include both color and black and white photos and paintings of landscape and people.  None of them are recent of course, the book having been published in 1979, and some of the images dating back as far as the 1800s.
