 The Girl in Vermeer's painting truly comes to life in this book.  She is not anyone famous; just a simple Dutch Protestant girl who finds herself in service as a maid in Vermeer's Catholic household.  The girl, Griet, is only there out of financial necessity, and with inexperienced innocence and cautious skepticism she observes differences in Catholic customs and art.  For her, all those paintings in the Catholic church are unnecessary...Protestants are content with how they imagine God to be.   Gradually she becomes more comfortable, and comes to secretly love Vermeer, rejecting the butcher's son's proposals for marriage, though she allows his physical advances.  She realizes she must be foolish rejecting the security the butcher can offer, but she can't resist being close to Vermeer and helping him in his studio. She is amazed when Vermeer decides to paint her, but he insists she pierce her ears and sneak his wife's pearl earrings for the painting.  Questioning the morality of this, Griet does it for him, which eventually brings distress to the household, and changes in Griet's life. Generally I like real historical personages brought into historical fiction, but I felt a little embarrassed for Vermeer, for his suggested character flaws: dishonest with his wife; being too engrossed in his work to care much about his family; demanding that Griet succumb to his wishes.  Who knows, maybe he was even worse than that, but it seemed a little unfair to portray him that way. Nevertheless, it is a well-told story, simple, yet rich in detail.  In the taped version, Ruth Ann Phimister's voice and intonation is very believable, as if Griet herself is telling the story.
