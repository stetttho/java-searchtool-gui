 Connie Sheerin's particular artistic style shows through in these projects which for the most part have a gift-shop, feminine, country-home look. They are very pretty, with other materials besides tiles incorporated into her pieces. Dressing up her pots, vases, pitchers, frames, shelves, etc., are marble "jewels", shells, dried flowers, and painted plaster figurines such as angels, fruits and vegetables. These give her creations a look distinctive from other mosaic books, and require different steps to complete, in particular preparing the figurines for use.  There are also a few very nice projects, such as backsplashes, that rely solely on tiles. There is no preparatory instruction on how to cut tiles, so it is assumed you already know how to use your cutting tools. However, these projects do not focus on cut tiles. Many of them use the objects mentioned above with pre-cut square and round tiles, and many broken pieces of plates, glass, and tiles. The author's work is very professional and the projects are lovely. I especially like the frame of broken glass, but my taste for a classic mosaic look with more traditional tile designs, leads me to rely more on other mosaic books for inspiration.
