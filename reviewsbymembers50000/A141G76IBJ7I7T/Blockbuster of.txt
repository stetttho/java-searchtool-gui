 This was the first complete silent movie I have ever seen, and it was  fascinating to observe and ponder its making 88 years ago.   Considering the limited technology in movie-making then, this movie was and is a masterpiece.  It has incredible scenery and/or sets, and the costuming reflecting the ancient Carthaginian and Roman cultures is well-done, although I can see the influence of the styles of 1914 in clothing, hair, and makeup. The melodramatic acting is corny at times, but it gave rise to discussion in my family about how exaggeration was needed in silent movies to compensate for the lack of speech, which in modern movies carries a lot of weight in creating the story.  The written interludes with dialogue and narration were not frequent, and therefore not tiresome, however, I often found it hard to follow the plot, which has as much to do with my unfamiliarity of the history of the period, as to uncertainty about what the acting was portraying.  Nevertheless, I kept my eyes glued to the screen, following the little Roman girl Cabiria, sold to the Carthaginians to serve as a ceremonial sacrifice, later rescued to serve in the palace, and all the ensuing events surrounding her as the tides of war surge between Rome and Carthage.   I discovered this movie after watching the movie, "Good Morning Babylon" which is about two young Italian  men who go to America to find work, and end up meeting the film producer, D.W. Griffith.  Griffith has just viewed "Cabiria" and is so overwhelmed, he throws away his current film to create one called "Intolerance" which he vows to make as good as Cabiria.  In Intolerance he tries to recreate an elephant statue he had seen in Cabiria, and so while watching Cabiria, I was looking for and found those elephant statues.  This historical chain of movies, from Cabiria, to Intolerance, to Good Morning Babylon, is an interesting study in itself.
