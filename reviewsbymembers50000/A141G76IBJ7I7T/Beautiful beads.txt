 This book has some nice features for bead enthusiasts.  About a third of the book shows closeup photos of the beads produced throughout the world, with extensive information about the various materials and methods used for creating them.   Following this is a section using clear line drawings of findings such as clasps, wires, and tools, with explanations of how they are used.  Line drawings are also used to show techniques, especially a variety of ways to finish the ends with clasps and knots.  For me, this is the most valuable part of the book for learning techniques new to me.  The directions are mostly good, but there are some that are difficult to follow just by reading.  It works better to get everything you need and just start following the instructions step by step until you figure it out.  My previous beading experience helped me understand the instructions better. The last section of the book has an assortment of projects making necklace and earring sets, with line drawings, photos and written instructions.  The designs are beautiful but too extravagant for me, and being published a few years ago, a little outdated in style.  However, the techniques shown can be used to redesign and create pieces suited to one's tastes.
