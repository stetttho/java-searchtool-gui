 For beaders like me, the practical part of jewelry-making... the findings ... doesn't seem that exciting, but this book gives the subject some pizazz.  First of all, the book is attractive, with photos and diagrams filling at least half of every page.  Next, it's informative, starting with a little section on the history of how clasps and other jewelry parts were created and used since ancient times. A little section describes the different types of seed beads and which ones are best to use in various projects. A few tools are described, along with their uses.  There is a nice section, which to me was the most useful, on how to create your own earwires, bails and clasps, and how to create some basic "squiggles" and other shapes out of wire, using a jig.  These wire shapes can be used in earring findings and clasps.  One section describes how different types of clasps work in their inner parts, and then describes how to attach them.    Quite a large part of the book is spent on using seed beads to create loop clasps, do different types of stitching, such as a peyote stitch, and how to finish a project that has been seed-beaded.  The photos used as examples show beautiful projects in-process, and the final part, the gallery, also has a selection of gorgeous projects... no directions in the gallery, but intended for inspiration.  Depending on the beader's needs and interests, this book can be somewhat to very helpful, but I would consider it a good addition to the avid beader's library.
