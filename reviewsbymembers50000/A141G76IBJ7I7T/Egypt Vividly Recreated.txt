 I LOVE Pauline Gedge's books about Egypt (as well as her other books).  "Illusions" opens with the main character, Thu, a woman who has been banished to live alone in the desert, serving the priests in a temple there, because of an accusation that she attempted to kill Pharaoh when she lived at court.  Thu wishes desperately to send a message to Pharaoh explaining what really happened, but she is never given the opportunity, until one day a young court officer arrives, and agrees to help her.  Discovering that this is his mother, he helps her plot revenge on the group of people who set her up for the crime which caused her exile.  In the process of intrigue, Thu does not always act wisely, and her character is not always admirable.  Thus, though she is the heroine of the story, Thu is not necessarily lovable, but she is definitely fascinating.  The plot is complex, involving all the characters that surround Pharaoh.  The scenery, the buildings, the poorer sections of the city, the clothing, the feasts...everything... is so vividly described, that I am caught up in these images.  This feeling of being transported there is reason enough to read Gedge's books, but combined with the drama and suspense, they are unforgettable.
