 The beautiful wall plaque on the cover of this book was what sold me on it, but disappointingly for me, it's probably only one of two or three projects in the book I would be interested in doing.  There are photos of incredible work others have done such as pool bottoms, floors, kitchen cupboards, an outdoor monument, fountain, grottoe, patios, pillars.  They make your mouth water, but there are no directions for them...not that most of us would attempt them anyway!  The projects for us mortals are spaced in between these grandiose artworks and include a casket notable for its artistic design, some jewelry items, frames, a beautiful birdbath, pots, a small shelf.  One important factor in keeping me from trying any of these is that although the instructions are adequate, they are not very inviting to read due to their tiny print size, and the photographs could be larger and reveal more of the process.  This would not be my first choice in a mosaic book, but I'd still be tempted by that gorgeous wall plaque!
