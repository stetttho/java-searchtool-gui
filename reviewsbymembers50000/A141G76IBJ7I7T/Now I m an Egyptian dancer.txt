 The best way for me to review this CD is to describe how it affected me... The first song "Ayouh" annoyed me after a while with the constantly quavering voice of the singer, and in the next the woman's voice was too piercing for me, so I advanced to the third selection, "Khayef Aqpool" which was pleasant and soulful with rich voice and instrumentation. Song number four (Kunt Fein) was smooth and passionate, and inspired me to sway and twist around the house, and number five, "Hebeena", was quite lively with a bouncing rhythm, and really got me moving. The remaining songs are a little more subdued, but they are richly textured with many contrasting and intertwining sounds: voice, clapping, and a variety of Arabic instruments blending and taking turns in the spotlight. The selections are from a variety of authentic Arabic recordings, and although not all of them appeal to me, most carry me away to Arabic lands, and provide a great alternate listening experience in my collection of world music.
