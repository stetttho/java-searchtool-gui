 When my adolescent daughters asked for a funny book for our family read-aloud, I chose this one, and boy did I regret it!  It actually started out funny, and we did have some good laughs over Elvis' insecurities and problems with clothes and girls.  But quickly the story degenerated when Elvis continually was disrespectful towards his mother, and all he could think and talk about was girls... in a rather gross way.  It was the first book we ever had to stop reading because of its offensive nature.  I do not like to be negative about any book, but sorry to say, this one was a thumbs down.
