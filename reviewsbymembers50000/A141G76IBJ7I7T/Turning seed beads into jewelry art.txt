 This is a jewelry making book for those who love to work with seed beads.  Each chapter teaches a beading method and then follows with several projects utilizing that method.   The first method is the Back Stitch Technique in which beads are sewn onto a surface into a design, or sewn around the edge of a cabochon (a stone that is rounded and polished on one side, and flat on the other).  These designs are then made into necklaces, earrings and pins.  Using the Netting Technique, Brick Stitch, and Peyote Stitch, beads are sewn together with needle and thread into lacy designs, or to encase a cabochon, or fringed pouch amulets, or fringed tube-style necklaces.  Last is a chapter on using a loom to weave beads into amulets and earrings.   Everything in this book is beautiful and classy, but will appeal to a certain taste.  To me they suggest a Native American look.  I envision seeing such pieces sold in boutiques at fairly high prices, being that they require closely detailed work and a lot of time. The instructions are clearly explained and illustrated, and are necessarily very detailed.  One needs to be prepared to take the time to follow them closely.  However, there is an assumption that you already are familiar with regular jewelry finishing techniques, such as how to end with crimps and clasps.  The typical instructions for finishing only say something like: "String a crimping bead....close the crimping bead with crimping pliers and trim off the excess tiger tail" or "use round-nose pliers to make a loop in the head pin.  Attach ear wires."   I think this is an excellent book for those with patience and a taste for this kind of look.
