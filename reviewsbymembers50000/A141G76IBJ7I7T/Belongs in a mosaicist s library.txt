 This book, as it's title suggests, is more of an encyclopedia than a project book.  I would not recommend it to a beginner because it doesn't take you through a number of projects step by step as many mosaic books do.  But I HIGHLY recommend this book for someone who has started doing mosaic and wants to increase skills and knowledge.  I learned a lot about design, in particular:  using colors effectively, including the grout colors, and how to place tiles in the design and in the background in directions that affect the flow of the design.  An eye-opening section showed common mistakes, which if one studies before starting a project, can be avoided.  There are a few projects that are given to demonstrate certain techniques, and there are photos of many incredibly beautiful works.  The patterns are not given for them, so you'd have to attempt to draw them yourself, or let them serve as inspiration.  The materials and equipment section is very extensive and helpful.  This is a great book you would study to become a better mosaicist, but not use as a project guide.
