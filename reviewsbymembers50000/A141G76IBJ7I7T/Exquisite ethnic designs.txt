 Oh my gosh, what beautiful jewelry pieces!  This is the best jewelry book by Sara Withers that I have yet seen.  The title lives up to its name because the beads used and the designs all have an exotic, ethnic look.  Each chapter focuses on designs representing a particular culture, i.e., Native American, Europe, Middle East, Far East, and Africa, the pieces having an updated, sophisticated look.   There is a good beginning section with explanations and illustrations for basic jewelry-making techniques such as wirework, threading, finishing, and a beginner may be able to get started with these, although I always think it's extremely helpful to see it done in person first.  In addition to the basic techniques, each piece is shown in full color double-page photography so you can see the details, and each piece has its own instructions.  The layout of instructions is done differently than most bead books:  each step of the instructions has an arrow connecting it to the part of the jewelry piece it is referring to, and this is helpful, but being scattered about the page, your eyes have to roam around to find step 1, step 2, etc. The designs are on the complex side; most of them require multiple strands of thread and therefore are more time-consuming than simple one-stranded necklaces.  However, the results are attention-getting.  Be prepared for requests from people who see them to buy your creations!
