 This is a sweet and poignant movie about an interracial relationship. Whites barely enter the picture in this one though; the forbidden relationship is between a black (Denzel Washington) and Indian Mina (Sarita Choudhury), both beautiful people and with onscreen chemistry between them. It's interesting that before their romance, members of each family agreed that Indians and Blacks needed to stick together, because "anyone who isn't white in America is colored", yet after the romance was discovered, Mina's father discourged her, saying that she needed to stick with "her own kind".  The theme of racism is brought to fore right at the beginning of the movie, with the banishment of Mina's Indian family from Uganda, a reminder that racism exists in many parts of the world. The family finds safety and economic opportunity in America, yet they never feel quite at home, or quite accepted in American society.  However, we also are reminded in the film that as slow as America has been to change in accepting minorities, and even more, interracial relationships, change is occurring. When the couple finds a way to go forward in their life and their relationship, they must make a decision that affects their families. The movie, though it has many delightful moments, shows us that overcoming racial barriers is still a bittersweet process.
