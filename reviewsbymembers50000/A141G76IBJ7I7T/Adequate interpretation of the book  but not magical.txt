 I can't say that this film, based on a popular book for young readers is particularly impressive.  It's the story of two friends who enjoy an imaginary world together in the woods, a place they call "Terabithia" , and whose special friendship ends in tragedy, (reminding me of the more recent movie, "My Girl").  This is a plot with a lot of potential to make a good movie, but to me, some of the acting seemed shallow, and the plot, as interpreted by the movie, lacked depth and detail.  The relationship between the two best friends is not fully developed, so there isn't much of an "emotional charge" to draw you in.   In spite of these negatives, the film is entertaining enough to keep some children's attention, or for family-time viewing and discussion. I think the best use of the film would be to show it to children at home or at school as a supplement to the book, and for this, it would serve its purpose adequately. It  may be time to do a higher quality remake of this movie.
