 I was interested in this book because many of my students have immigrated from Mexico as the main character, Esperanza, and her family did.  Although her story took place about a generation ago, the difficulties she encountered in the U.S. were similar to those faced by immigrants today.  But Esperanza had been raised wealthy, and was not prepared for hard work, poor living conditions, and a shortage of food and clothing.  Esperanza's hardships shape her into a mature and wise young woman.  For those of us who take our bountiful life for granted, this story gives us, both young and older readers, food for thought... about personal sacrifice, sharing, forgiveness, loyalty, compassion and justice.     In the taped version, narrator Trini Alvarado has the perfect voice... smooth and easy to listen to, with realistic inflection, and genuine Spanish pronunciation.  Her youthful voice brings Esperanza to life.
