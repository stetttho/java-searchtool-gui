 I did a lot of shopping around before deciding on this sleekly-designed just-what-I-wanted toaster.  I wanted the long opening to fit the long slices of bread, which traditional toasters don't accommodate, and I wanted it to easily toast bagels without having to crush them into the slot.  I wanted it simple but elegant in design, white and unobtrusive on my kitchen counter, and I wanted it to be electronic, with a button that slides down smoothly and pops up easily.  I wanted to be able to control the toasting darkness with a visual, uncomplicated control.  I got everything I wanted with a lower price than other toasters of a similar quality and design, plus some bonus extras, like a defroster, a one-slice control, and a few other useful buttons.  Its sleek design sits against the back of the countertop, not taking up valuable space more forward on the counter where I do my other kitchen counter work.  I have no problem with it tipping over as one other reviewer stated.  I waited a long time to find this toaster, and I am very happy with my choice!
