 This is the best TV I could find in its price range!  I have never had a JVC product before; I thought I should go with a big name like Sony or Panasonic, but JVC has impressed me with this beautiful TV.  I  went from a 25 inch TV to this 32 inch, and the picture looks quite large, and is easy to see, and its color and picture clarity are exceptional!  Although it would have been fun to have one of the large flat screen TVs, I did not want to spend that much, and I am very happy with this TV's quality, style and features.  One of its selling features was its PIP (picture in picture).  No other TV I looked at in its size and price range had this, and it's something I had wanted for a long time.  Its sleek design does not overpower my room, and looks great in the oak entertainment center I found to go with it.  I am very pleased.
