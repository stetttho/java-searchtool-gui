 This biography  made me wish to meet the famous Hannibal.  The research is well done and now I have a good understanding of the role Hannibal played in this period of history.  The only reason I gave this book a 4 is because it was a little on the dry side.  That may be due to the reader's voice as I listened to the cassette, or because there just wasn't enough "heart and soul" in the telling of the history.  That is, I learned tons about Hannibal's military movements, strategies, battles, etc., but a very minute amount about his character and feelings.  This is probably not the author's fault, however, because he refers to the ancient sources as not passing down much about Hannibal's character for us to draw from. It wasn't until the last chapter or two that I felt I was starting to get to know Hannibal as a man, with references about his wit, humor, and his sly ability to sneak away unnoticed as he was hounded by the Romans.  At the end, we are treated to a few of his quotes which give us a little glimpse into his personality.  At that point I began wishing I knew more about him, felt a certain empathy with him, and wondered if by the end of his life, he felt he had thrown it away in a useless cause.  The author reflects on this a bit, and concludes that even if Hannibal and Carthage had won this war against the Romans, it really wouldn't have changed history that much, rather it would only have slowed the Romans down for a little while. I agreed with that conclusion, and not only felt sorry for Hannibal, but sorry for the human mind that causes us to slaughter one another for .... what? In spite of the occasional dryness of the telling, I was fascinated by the information presented about Hannibal's career and the political and military setting of the nations involved.  I appreciate having this knowledge.
