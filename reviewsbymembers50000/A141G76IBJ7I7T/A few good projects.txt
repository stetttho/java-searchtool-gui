 My summer school program includes a lot of art projects, and this book is one of my resources for ideas.  This is one of those books that although it has instructions for a number of art projects, there are just a few that I use, though repeatedly.  The lessons are designed for young primary students, but many projects are open-ended, allowing for a range of skill levels.  There are drawing lessons for drawing a house, bike, train, castle, landscape, etc.  The lessons I have used most include one for water resist, creative construction paper insects and totem pole, a symmetrical radial design, and a repeated tile-type design.  Pretty good resource for an art teacher's library.
