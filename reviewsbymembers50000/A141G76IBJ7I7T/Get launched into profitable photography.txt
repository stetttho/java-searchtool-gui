 For the photographer who wants to find a way to market his or her photography, this great little book will save a tremendous amount of time and energy that one might spend in trying to figure out how to get started. This is not a book that tells you specific companies to go to in order to sell your work, for that you'll need to obtain photography marketing catalogs. Fortunately this book supplies you with names of some of those resources so you can begin your search for clients.  "Photo Submission" guides you in many important legal aspects of starting your business, things I either wouldn't have thought of, or that I might have learned through trial and error. For example, you learn how to obtain releases from people who serve as subjects in photos, and what to look for in a contract with a client. The author includes how to submit photos in various forms, including loose photos, bound, and on CD, plus gives suggestions for artistic, appealing presentation of these portfolios. There are also important guidelines on how to charge a fair price for your work. One of the most helpful parts of this book is that it is full of templates of letters, contracts, and other forms that you can copy.  You may have more questions to ask after going through this book, and you'll have to do your own research on finding clients, but this book has the potential to build your knowledge of legalities as well as a sense of confidence and professionalism.
