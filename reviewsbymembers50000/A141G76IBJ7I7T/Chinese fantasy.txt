 The beautiful cover of Silk Road enticed me with its Chinese maiden nestled on a dragon holding a pearl and with its subtitle: A Novel of Eighth-Century China. Being mostly interested in historical fiction set in far-off lands, I ventured into this historical fantasy. The book, consisting of over 400 pages, has a full and complex plot, but it was just too much strangeness for me, though others may find it to their taste.  The story begins in a celestial palace where the gods have a bowl of multicolored marbles. One of them, a green pearl, speaks, saying it wishes to go to earth to learn the languages of humans. The Celestial Undersecretary is given the task of watching over "Greenpearl" who is then born on earth as a general's daughter.  One day Greenpearl is kidnapped by Tibetans and sold to traders, and then she begins life as a courtesan, meanwhile journeying on the Silk Road. Greenpearl encounters monks, people of the steppes, a magician, a ghost. The intervention of the gods affects her life and everyone she is involved with. Bits and pieces of Chinese lore are interspersed in the chapters: a guidebook to a magical mountain, historical narratives, legends of the Tang told by a marketplace storyteller.  There was some beautiful imagery in the book, but all in all, the story was rather confusing to me, and I didn't have the motivation to sort it out and make sense out of who's who, what's real or otherwordly, and what's symbolic. People who like fantasy may find this book more enjoyable than I did...better for me to stick to historical fiction.
