 I agree with other reviewers that this shape of book is not the easiest to read, but I flattened my copy and put a weight on it to hold it open while working... no big deal.  It's what's inside that counts!    The 30 exquisite purse and bag designs in the book, shown in full color photographs, are contributed by different artists, and each is extremely unique in its design and method.  Several of the purses are knitted, and some are crocheted.  Some have strands of beads couched onto fabric.  Some are created with peyote stitch or on a bead loom, then sewn together.  One is sewn onto a metal purse frame.  One I partricularly like has strands of beads glued (using special sticky tape) onto a purchased tote in a gorgeous design.  Some are large and shopping-baggish, and others are small amulet bags or clutches.  Every one of them is gorgeous, and you will not find anything like them in any store, unless it is an expensive boutique.  They look like collectors' items.  There are no quick and easy projects here.  They require time, commitment to read through the instructions and follow them step by step, and skill with the hands.  The written instructions are fairly easy to understand, but experienced crafters will follow them more easily.  There are illustrations, but a few more would be helpful.    The last section of the book shows how to do all the different stitches and techniques used in the projects, but for knitted bags, you will already need to know how to knit.  Hand and machine sewing skills are required for some of the projects.
