 For the person who loves working with seed beads in close, detailed hand work, there are a lot of techniques to try in this book.  Most of the projects involve some type of sewing beads together to create beautiful tapestries for home decoration.  There are pieces to be framed and hung, coasters, small bead weavings for decorating other surfaces, such as small boxes.  There are projects for decorating lamps with beads and accessories such as small purses and a scissors case.  Some projects require you to knit with very small knitting needles, incorporating the beads into the knitting.  One project escapes from seed beads momentarily to show how to do wirework to make jewelry items. There are quite a few stitching techniques used, such as brick, square, ladder, and peyote stitch.  The instructions are very good, with large drawings showing the beads and the direction of thread passed through them.  One nice touch is that instructions are provided for a small practice piece for some of the techniques.   The projects are beautiful and delicate pieces of art for patient crafters, and for those who have never done this type of work before, there's a lot to learn.
