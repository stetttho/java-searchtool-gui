 I give credit to the author for covering such a range of jewelry making techniques; there is much to learn here for anyone who wants to go beyond stringing beads. The book can certainly broaden one's knowledge of all the different methods and tools that can be used to make jewelry, and the dedicated jeweler will find much to refer to. The only fault I find with the book is that it covers each technique in too short a space.  This list will give a better idea of what is covered in the book, and will help you know if this is the type of craft you'd like to pursue:  1. Laminated paper tiara (laminated with iron) 2. Earrings made with a stack of hole punched paper discs! 3. Papier-mache beads 4. Felt beads made from raw sheep fleece and dyed 5. Annealing metal 6. Saw piercing, drilling, filing, soldering (showing diagrams of tools and techniques) 7. Wire pulled through a draw plate 8. Forging wire 9. Making jump rings and simple chain 10. Knitting wire 11.
