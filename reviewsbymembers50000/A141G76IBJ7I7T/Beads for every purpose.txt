 This is a book for people who love beads so much, they want to use them on everything!  The range of projects include jewelry made from a variety of techniques: stringing, knotting, connecting beads with wirework to other beads and to other jewelry findings such as spacer bars.  The styles of necklaces and earrings are quite varied and include multi-stranded chokers,  a tasseled necklace, dangly charm-style jewelry, and beaded rosette earrings and necklace. There is a beaded watchband, woven bead bracelet, pendant, and belt.  There's an assortment of items decorated with sewn-on beads, including a hat, camisole, pincushion, pillow, and vest.   Two glued-beads projects include a harlequin mask and a pretty picture frame.  A variety of other projects complete this list of choices. The instructions are quite thorough and include easy-to-see drawings.  Some previous experience with jewelry-making or sewing would be helpful, however.
