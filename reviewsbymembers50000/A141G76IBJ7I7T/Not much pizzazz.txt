 Maybe because this book was first published in 1988 the designs don't appeal to me, or maybe the photography is kind of flat, but I can't find anything in this book that inspires me, except for one choker done with red beads on red cord that would be cute for my daughter.  What I look for in bead books is beautiful designs I can get ideas from.  What the book does have going for it is extensive information about the composition and production of all kinds of beads: stone, glass, metal, horn, coral, etc.  There's a chronological chart which lists when and from where beads were introduced.  Extensive information is given regarding materials, tools, bead and thread sizes, and necklace lengths.  A few pages instruct on how to make beads from different materials such as wood, modeling clay, papier mache, and playdough.  Most of the book focuses on basic instructions for beading projects with good line drawing diagrams.  Finally when you get to the projects, there are very few of them, and since they're not all that inspiring, you may have to use your imagination to mentally replace the beads and findings with some that are more appealing.  Interpersed through the book are gallery photos of jewelry items without instructions, but even these don't give me many ideas.  The instructional section of this book may be helpful in some beaders' library, but personally I'd rather get a book with both good instructions and great projects.
