 I have acquired quite a few mosaic books and written reviews for them on Amazon, and although all of them are useful to some extent, this mosaic book has really impressed me!  There are many photos of absolutely gorgeous mosaic designs which follow a more traditional style, using only tiles and not other objects such as rocks, shells, marbles, etc., like you find in some mosaic books.  The designs are exquisite in color and workmanship as well.  There are many "gallery" items which are examples of professional work, and there are quite a few featured projects with a form of instructions called "Method Tips" which, rather than giving explicit step-by-step instructions, give instructions with advice, suggestions and options for color, materials, positioning, etc.  Because of this, and because the designs are rather sophisticated and complex, this is not a mosaic book for beginners.  However, truly motivated beginners could get started trying out a couple of the simpler projects.   Besides the gorgeous designs, this book is impressive in its extensive teaching about design, light, color, contrast, background, and several methods of laying mosaic.  I get the feeling I'm in the hands of a skillful and professional mosaicist, and that this is a book to be studied to gain useful insight for building my own skills.  These are not designs for someone to quickly throw together; rather this book is an excellent resource for serious mosaicists.
