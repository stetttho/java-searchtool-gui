 This book is great for those who love metal jewelry (no beads or gems involved), and who have a lot of patience for learning an intricate craft.    The wire jewelry in this book is completely different from the type of wire jewelry made on a jig (wrapping wire around pegs to form curlicue designs, etc.)  This book teaches you to use various gauges of wire to make chain or chain mail, which is then used to make necklaces, bracelets, earrings, etc.  This is no ordinary chain... it is quite complex and many techniques are shown to create assorted patterns.  In some projects, the wire is "knitted" or braided by hand around another object used as a mandrel (such as knitting needles or an Allen wrench).  Brief instructions are given for making a wooden drawplate. This has holes bored into it, and is used to pull the finished chain through it to smooth out the chain.  Other types of chain are made by various patterns of joining jump rings.  For these you can use purchased jump rings, or instructions are also given for making your own jump rings.    The designs are quite complex, and therefore the illustrated diagrams show a lot of detail, with many interconnected wires passing in various directions.  At first glance, it looks overwhelming, but if you have the patience to do all the prepatory work, then sit down with the book in front of you and follow the instructions and diagrams step by step, you can work your way through the designs and come up with something to be proud of.    Be aware that a certain amount of investment in tools is needed, such as flat and needle nose pliers, a vise, a drawplate, some kind of mandrel, knitting needles, and crochet hooks; and for making jump rings: a hand drill, hacksaw, and clamp.    This is a very good book for those interested in this unique craft.
