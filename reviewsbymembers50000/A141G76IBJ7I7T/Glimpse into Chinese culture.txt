 I was absorbed in this film because of my fascination with cultures different from my own.  We see a small portion of Chinese culture in the late 1800s...the interior scenes of a Shanghai brothel with its "flower" ladies. I studied the clothing, the hair styles, the mannerisms, the interactions between men and women, modes of expressing feelings, the household decor...and learned from it.  This is not a fast-paced movie; no intimate acts are portrayed, in fact, I found it to have a languid feeling, with a lot of time spent with the men and women eating, gossiping, manipulating one another, smoking opium, and repeatedly playing a favorite game that looks like "paper, scissors, rock".     Yet I found this glimpse into this portion of society fascinating...women who probably lived a pampered and sheltered life compared to the masses of Chinese women at the time, yet hoping for someone to love and rescue them from their form of slavery, and upper class Chinese men who seem to have nothing else to do but hang out with the flower ladies, and chum with other male clients.  I was interested in their social courtesies, the emotional maneuvering of the women upon the men, and the tenderness shown by one of the Chinese men towards his "flower lady", contradictory to the idea of Chinese women being subservient.  Because this movie was made in China, I assume the sociology of the movie must have some accuracy, and therefore, it was for me a cultural lesson.
