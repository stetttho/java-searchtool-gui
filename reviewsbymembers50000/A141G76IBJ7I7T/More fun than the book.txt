 Before watching this movie, I listened to the recorded book version, which was a little difficult to follow at times due in part to the reader's voice and partly to the dryness of some of the narrative.  The movie made it more entertaining, snipping out the tedious details, and getting right to the main events.  Of course, the book is meant to be more educational, a non-fictional account of an amazingly planned and executed train robbery, and the enigmatic disappearance of the mastermind once he was caught.  The movie fulfills its duty in outlining the events, but makes it fun with entertaining characters and lively scenes.  The three main characters: Sean Connery, (the mastermind), Donald Sutherland, (his sidekick), and Leslie Anne Down (Connery's girlfriend and accomplice) so delightfully play their roles, that you root for their successful conniving and contriving.  This is a great movie for people who love to compare movies with the books they are made from.
