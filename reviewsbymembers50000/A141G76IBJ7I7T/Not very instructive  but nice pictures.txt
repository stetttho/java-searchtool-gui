 I agree with another reviewer that some of the projects shown in this book look rather sloppy, like a beginner's work might look.  It seems the author got off easy, providing minimal guidance in equipment and materials, and only giving instructions for 6 simple projects.  They include two terra-cotta pieces, a frame (without instructions for attaching a backing), a switchplate, tiny framed "party favor" pictures (worthless in my opinion), covered jar lids, (so-so but easy).   The next larger section of the book is filled with photos of finished projects, including little boxes, frames, pots, vases, and tabletops.  They are accompanied by brief comments of techniques or materials used to create them, but no instructions.  The book finishes with a few pages of line-drawn design patterns, which seem unnecessary since it is easy to see and reproduce the designs by looking at the photos of the finished projects themselves. The only reason I gave this book a four is for its many photos of projects, and though without instructions, they are for the most part are attractive.  I would not recommend it for a beginner, even though the projects are fairly simple, because it is lacking in instruction.  Its best use is for browsing and sparking ideas.
