 What I really notice about this book is its wide assortment of large and nicely photographed projects, from simple to complex, easy to difficult, from earrings to bookmarks.  The projects are also pretty and elegant in my opinion, and the workmanship looks professional.   There are a few projects a beginner could do without much difficulty, such as gluing beads to a wooden form, or stringing beads on an elastic cord for making bracelets.  Many other projects would be difficult for a beginner to follow without prior experience.  For those with some background knowledge and experience, I think the instructions and the colored diagrams showing threading techniques are clear and easy to follow.   The more advanced projects, among others, include weaving beads on a loom to make a bookmark, threading beads into a beautiful celtic knot design for making a necklace and squared-needle weaving to make a pretty beaded pouch that can also be hung from a necklace.  As one reviewer complained, there are a few holes in the instructions, with the assumption you already know how to do basic techniques such as "using round-nosed pliers, form a loop in end of head pin".   For this reason, this is not truly a book for beginners.  For a person who knows the basics, this book has lots of ideas and projects from which to choose.  Since it is difficult to follow instructions in any book for detailed work such as this, I recommend taking a class first and then buying this book for building skills and getting inspiration.
