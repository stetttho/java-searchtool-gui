 When the young Courteney brothers sneak off into the fields surrounding their house to experiment with the forbidden gun, Sean accidentally shoots his brother Garrick's leg, which results in its amputation.  This is the foundation for their shaky relationship and which affects their children in succeeding Courteney family books.   Sean forever after feels guilty and tries to take protective responsibility for his brother, but Garrick, always feeling like the loser, develops bitterness towards Sean.  When Sean rejects the advances of Garrick's wife, in retaliation she tells Garrick that Sean forced himself upon her, and Garrick's hatred is cemented. Sean abandons his brother and his home to seek other adventures. He develops friends and jealous enemies during his business ventures in gold mining.  He becomes wealthy, but after losing it all, takes to the bush with his best friend, where they encounter danger with nature.  Sean experiences it all: savage battle, wealth, poverty, danger, victory, injustice, sickness, romance, profound love and profound sadness.  He pushes himself through all his adventures with fortitude, wit and charm.  He's as sly as a fox and as gentle as a lamb.   After reading this book, I was hooked on Wilbur Smith, and went on to read the next two books: The Sound of Thunder, and A Sparrow Falls, which continue the Courteney saga.  There are others in the series which I plan to get soon.  I feel confident I won't be disappointed!
