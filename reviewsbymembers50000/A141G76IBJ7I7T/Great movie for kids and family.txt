 This movie is based on the book of the same name which I have not read, so I can't compare it to the book.  However, seeing the movie makes me want to recommend the book to children.  Caddie Woodlawn is a tomboy in the pioneer days of Wisconsin.  Her lively spirit, and her red hair and pigtails remind me of Pippi Longstocking, though they don't stick out at the sides like Pippi's do, and Caddie is a "real" person, not a fantasy. When Caddie's "proper" Boston cousin, Annabelle, comes to stay with the family, Caddie resists her mother's instructions to follow  Annabell's example in etiquette and manners, and instead plays fairly harmless jokes on her.  But Caddie really does have a heart of gold and a sense of justice.  She's appalled at the treatment of her neighbors toward two half-breed children in the community, and secretly buys them shoes.  Along with her father, she insists on keeping peace with the nearby Dakota Indians.   Caddie must deal with such emotional and common childhood issues as the loss of her dog, being bullied, jealousy over her brother's love interest, and sticking up for what she believes is right.  At the expense of being punished or disapproved, she does the right thing, and in the end, she is the one who saves the community from a violent confrontation with the Dakotas. I think the acting was very well done, with a wide variety of characterization  and emotions.  It's a wonderful movie for kids and family.
