 Of my several bead books, this is one of my favorites. The instructions are very clear, and the same techniques are used repeatedly for most of the jewelry pieces, for example, stringing the beads on thread, and using calottes to finish the ends. There are a few other techniques also, and I did pick up a few new ones for my own use, for example, how to work with leather thong in jewelry -- braiding it and finishing the ends with findings I hadn't used before.  But what makes me keep this book constantly on hand is its many pictures of jewelry, featuring mostly necklaces with a broad range of bead types. There are a lot of beautiful pieces for giving me ideas for bead combinations, color arrangements, and patterns. The earring section also has some very attractive and easy to make earring styles. Though published several years ago, these designs do not look outdated at all. I see that this book is not currently published and the sellers who have it are selling it at quite a high price, but it could very well be worth it for someone wanting to have a source of ideas.
