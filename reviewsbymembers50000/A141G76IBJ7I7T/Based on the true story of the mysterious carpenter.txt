 I read this book to my daughters because it is based on the fascinating, true story of a staircase that was built mysteriously and miraculously in the Loretto Chapel of Santa Fe.  According to history, the nuns were praying for a staircase to be built to the upper level, and a mysterious stranger came, built it, and left quietly without payment. The staircase can still be seen and it is a wonder in design.   The book adds the girl Lizzie to the story, a Methodist thrust into a Catholic school.  When the other girls cause a stink about the mysterious carpenter, and plot to get rid of him, Lizzie defends him and thereby becomes the outsider in the group.  The way she is treated is quite unfair, but she tries to react without resorting to the same spiteful tactics of the other girls.  I enjoyed reading aloud with the nasty intonation of Lizzie's rival, but my daughters thought for their ages, the girls behaved quite immaturely.  I agree with one of the young reviewers that stabbing the kitten in the eye was unpleasant to read, but otherwise, I enjoyed this story very much as Lizzie's conflicts were resolved in the midst of the mysterious carpenter's visit.
