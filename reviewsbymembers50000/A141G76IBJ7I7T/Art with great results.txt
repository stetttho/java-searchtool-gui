 Teachers and parents, don't miss this art resource for your kids!  The author has done a wonderful job of compiling a variety of activities using a variety of materials, at a range of skill levels.  I have completed a few of these projects with students aged 6-16, and they have turned out great.  The materials are easily obtained, the projects generally uncomplicated, and the instructions clearly illustrated and easy to follow.   Projects include designs and pictures made with paint, glue, string, sand, cut-out paper shapes, markers, foil, beans, macaroni, glitter, plants, fabric.  Techniques include drawing, experimenting with shape, line, texture and color, contrasting shapes and colors, stamping, splatter and spin, weaving, shadowboxes, 3-D sculptures of various materials, crayon resist, sponge painting.  Not only can all these projects keep your kids being creative, they really turn out attractive.  I have several art books for children by this same publisher and they are all excellent.
