 I have looked at a lot of jewelry making books and reviewed a few on Amazon.  Not all of the jewelry designs in this book appeal to me, but I have to say that this is the very best book I've seen for beginners.  Other books say they are for beginners, but are still difficult to follow without having some prior experience.  The processes used for constructing these mostly attractive necklaces, earrings and bracelets are clearly evident in large, close-up photos and provide the beginner with all the basic techniques.  Once you've learned the techniques from this book, you should be able to graduate to other, more difficult jewelry-making books.  Just take this book with you to the local bead store, point out the materials you need, and they'll help you find them and you'll be ready to create!
