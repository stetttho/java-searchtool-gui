 So far, every mosaic book I have collected has something to offer.  This one has a few notable characteristics.  The section on tools and equipment is more complete and detailed than other mosaic books I have seen.  Beginning mosaic books usually suggest some kind of spatula, a tile nipper, and glass cutter.  Quite a few other tools are suggested and described here, as well as what they are for.  Although I feel daunted about buying and using so many different tools, it is helpful to know what I can look for if a particular project requires something different. The projects are fairly simple, but unique.  For example, there is a lamp base covered with broken plates and cups, including the cup handles which protrude from the lamp!  There is an irregular-shaped plaque, formed by pouring concrete into a polystyrene foam that you design, and then covered with an ancient Roman-simulated design.  There is a mirror frame which is jig-sawed into an interesting shape, and this project alone is for me worth the price of the book. There are projects with very clear instructions for using both the direct and indirect method of applying tesserae.   What I particularly like is that the instructions include how to finish the projects, such as how to put the back on the mirror, what hardware to use, and how to apply it.  The other mosaic books I have seen so far only tell how to make the mosaic part, and leave the finishing steps up to you. Finally, there are many photos of incredible projects (such as an entire facade of a house) made by professional mosaicists, which the beginner would not attempt, but from which beginners and experienced alike can find inspiration.
