 As much as I wanted to like this book, I know it is one that I will forget quickly.  The author's idea was good: a Hungarian male named Morath living in Paris in 1938 becomes drawn into secretive schemes to support the Eastern European countries against Hitler.  He makes skirmishes into Nazi occupied territory, risking his life to rescue people trapped behind the lines.  This book  could have been good if it had been fleshed out with more detail, more explanations of events and relationships among characters, and with more complete transitions between events.  It always seemed to have holes in the storyline, so just when I thought I was beginning to understand what was going on, I'd get lost again.  I had to make a lot of assumptions about why the characters were doing the things they did, and what happened between events to make sense out of the sequence. To help me understand, I stopped about a third of the way through to do some research on the actual history that occurred in this region on the brink of World War II.  It did help, but the sketchiness of the story kept me from getting fully involved in the plot or the characters, and kept me from forming good mental images.  It's the ability of a story to create pictures in your mind that makes it memorable.  The book is rather short - 239 pages, and certainly could have been plumped up to make a more complete and satisfying story.
