 Though getting off to a somewhat slow start, Atticus drew me in deeper and deeper as it went along. Atticus, the father of a somewhat troubled son, goes to Mexico when hearing of his son's suicide there.  Atticus is an amazing man and father...in most ways, ordinary, yet in his quiet agony over his son's death, and after seeing the body with the face half blown off with a gunshot, Atticus has a spark of awareness and intuition that there is something wrong...it looks like a murder.  He quietly pokes around to find clues that will help him discover the truth of what happened to his son.  He discovers small connections to his son's death, he sees fleeting glimpses of mysterious people, and is knocked over by a stranger in his son's house.  A slow yet suspenseful tension builds, until a sudden twist in the story takes us to the son's point of view, and then we discover the truth.   Yet this is not all there is to this story...or the character of Atticus. More and more we see a wonderful, caring father, and can relate to all the range of emotions between father and son... the pulling away of the son from parents, yet the loving ties that Atticus never lets snap.  His efforts towards his son are compared in a gentle but impactful way with the faithful father to the prodigal son, and so this story not only draws you in with its quiet suspense, but with its ability to touch the emotions and experiences most of us can relate to.
