 This is the second book of the "Blood of the Goddess" series, following "Goa".  "Goa" was a great introduction to the trilogy, in which a tradesman is seeking the powdered blood of an Indian goddess, which is said to have the power to bring the dead back to life.  His plans become complicated, and he is put into danger when he crosses paths with Inquisition officials, who view such things as witchcraft, and punishable by death.  In "Bijapur" the tradesman is forced by  the Inquisitors to lead them to the source of this magical powder somewhere near Bijapur, India...  Competing with them to arrive at this source are a group of "Mohammedans", and danger and betrayal lurk from every side during this cross-country journey where no one is sure who his enemies are.  "Bijapur" is a fine middle section to the trilogy, though the least memorable of the three books, the last being "Bhagavati", in which those who survive reach their destination.
