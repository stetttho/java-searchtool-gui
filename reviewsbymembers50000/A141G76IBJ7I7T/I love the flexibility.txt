 I have purchased several small lamps to use in doing close work and for photography of small objects.  None of the lamps worked well because the light is not strong enough, and the light doesn't cover a large enough work area.  I purchased this Daylight lamp because it is BIG!  It is a huge improvement over the Ott Lite I was using.   The Ott Lite was the type in which the light turns on when you flip up the arm containing the bulb. The Ott Lite bulb is only about 6" long, and I had to have my work directly under its small pool of not-very-bright light.  The Ott Lite bulb also is only 10" above the work surface. The Daylight bulb is 8" long, and is raised 23" above the work surface.  The light is significantly brighter, and creates a much larger pool of light to work under.  It's a huge improvement.    The  magnifying glass of the Daylight lamp is easily removable if you don't need it.  The lamp has a very long flexible stem which I love.  I can bend and twist that lamp in all directions, which allows me to turn my attention to other objects on the work surface, and is really helpful with lighting angles for closeup photography, though I do need to bend the lamp close to the object in order to get a good photo (without using the camera flash). The color of the light is "clean", not yellow like regular house lighting. Though I need to invest in better photographic lighting, this lamp is filling in adequately until that time.    I haven't seen any other lamps of this type that have had such flexibility.  I rated it a 4, because I still would like to have a lamp with even stronger light.
