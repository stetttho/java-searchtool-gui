 Bagamoyo has enough going on that it's a book you can sink your teeth into. At the turn of the century, Englishman Richard and his African friend Luke search for adventure and fortune in Nairobi.  They find themselves in the railroad camp of Tsavo and encounter the man-eating lions that drag away some of the workers.  Eventually they arrive at a mission run by an American missionary, Ida,  and her African friend Grace, and they form into two romantic couples.  Meanwhile, Richard's uncle Montague is on his own mission, wandering through Africa trying to find a way to remove a curse which kills people he loves.  This is the story of the pioneers who settled Africa and find the beautiful, the strange, the mystical, and the danger from animals and nature.  The book brings into focus the effect that the railroad had on the native tribes, and the reaction to the settlers by the Mau-Mau cult that vowed to retaliate.  Bagamoyo takes us into the historical setting of the European settlement of Africa, and the adventure, romance, and tragedies of two couples... one black and one white.  I wouldn't call it a classic, but I give it a 5 for good, satisfying reading.
