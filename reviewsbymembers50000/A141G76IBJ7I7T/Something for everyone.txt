 As the author states: this is a book for "earring addicts".  A little prior knowledge on how to use jewelry tools for forming and attaching loops to the earring wires may be necessary because these basic skills aren't well-explained.  The instructions rely mostly on step-by-step explanations, and a photo of the finished piece, rather than diagrams.  I like this book because I have gotten lots of good ideas from it.  In particular I like the section showing several designs for coiled wire and bead earrings.  I'm also interested in some made with seed beads woven together in interesting designs, including a dangling birdhouse.  Not having prior experience with weaving beads, the instructions may be a little difficult to follow, but I still am willing to try.  Fortunately, these woven designs do have diagrams. There are instructions for making earrings from all kinds of materials, including polymer clay, fused fabric that has a mosaic look, sheet metal formed into interesting shapes, gourds, and many other materials.  Some of these materials require tools beyond traditional jewelry tools to work with, such as a jigsaw, metal file, and sewing machine.  Although I think a few of the designs have a tacky out-dated look, the majority look quite boutiquish.  For crafty earring lovers, there should be at least a few pieces here to inspire.
