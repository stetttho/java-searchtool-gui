 I work on beaded jewelry, and bought this little lamp to help me see the bead colors more clearly in the evening hours. The light definitely fulfills its claims to make colors vivid and true, and it does make it possible for me to find and match colors accurately. Its portability is nice, and I like how the top arm with the bulb inside folds down to make it compact, and how the light automatically turns on when you raise the arm. The problem I have with the lamp is that the objects I want to see distinctly must be placed on the work surface directly under the bulb. The brightest part of the light only covers about a foot and a half diameter, and beyond that the light is too dim to make a difference. To take advantage of the light, I must keep my beads in a small space under the lamp, which is about 14 inches above the tabletop. It could be improved if they made this lamp with a larger visible work area.
