 The cover of this book shows a good sampling of the pretty projects you'll find inside.  The book starts with a short section showing photos of tools, threads, and findings typically used in jewelry-making.  It's followed by a very good section showing basic jewelry-making techniques, including one of the best diagrams I've ever seen for making wire-wrapped loops, a simple but basic requirement for general jewelry work.  Other techniques include using different stitches to join seed beads for the projects in the book. The projects give the beginning jewelry maker a good introduction to many different techniques and styles of jewelry, some very simple with basic stringing of beads to more time-consuming, though not too difficult, sewing and netting of seed bead necklaces.  A cute, simple new style includes beads knotted onto ribbon, and there's an attractive wire-worked necklace.   Though I think the instructions are good for beginners, this is great for experienced beaders also, because there are ideas I haven't seen in other beading books for design, bead combinations, and even techniques.  Something new for me was a necklace of wire-wrapped bead sections linked together with lots of jump rings to form a netted design.  I am also inspired by her grapevine necklace, the lemon bead necklace, and a beautiful blue right-angle weave choker.  The only necklace that makes me say, "hmm", is a necklace incorporating a child's baby teeth; I need to think about that one.
