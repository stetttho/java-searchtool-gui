 This is a very slender book, only 34 pages of photos and instructions.  Seven pages of colored photos, including the cover, show an average of six projects per page, making a good number of projects to choose from.  All of the designs use seed beads and other small beads strung on thread, with simple clasps added to the ends.  Instructions are not included on how to add clasps, so you'll need to learn how to do that from another source.   The designs include a wonderful variety of necklaces, bracelets and earrings, ranging from sweet and delicate to large, complex, and dramatic.  The cover photo gives a good idea of the variety of projects inside, and even if you just find a few that you want to do, it would be worth the low price of the book.   The instructions are okay.  They are written in paragraph form, which makes it difficult to find your place again when returning to read them.  I'd prefer the instructions written as Step 1, Step 2, etc. to make them easier to read, but the drawn diagrams showing how the thread passes through the beads are very good; they are large and easy to follow. One little problem is that none of the instructions tell you on which page to find the photo of the corresponding project, so you have to look through the book to find it.  To solve this, on each instruction page I wrote the page number on which to find the appropiate photo.  Otherwise, I think this is a very good investment for people who like the intricate work with seed beads.
