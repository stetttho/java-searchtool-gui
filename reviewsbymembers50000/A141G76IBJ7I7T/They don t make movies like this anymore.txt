 Ever since Casablanca, this movie made in its wake was considered a disappointment, but I enjoyed it just as much, if not better!  I'm not a particular Bogart fan, but I really liked him in this movie...his role befits him: hardened, determined, yet with deep passion in spite of his steely exterior.  During the film, his life takes several turns: as a newspaper printer, a hard labor prisoner, a refuge on a French military ship, and a hero for France.  He loves his wife, and he loves his country, and in spite of the injustice he suffered in France, he vows to fight against the Nazis to save her.   The first few minutes of the film in which there is a lot of talk is somewhat dull, but then we are launched into the telling of the adventures and dangers of sentenced men escaping from French Guyana in a little boat provided by another older prisoner, who gives up his own escape to allow the few younger men the room in the boat, and a chance to fight for France.  There is plenty of adventure, and some sweet romance which our hero has with his wife, and a touching ending.   Is the movie unrealistic? Is it melodramatic?  Is it wartime propaganda?  Maybe to some people, but I loved it!
