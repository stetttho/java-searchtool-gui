 Orson Welles plays a role in this movie that is different from any I've seen him in before.  As the proper English Captain Hart who ferries the boat to Hong Kong, he is continually pestered by an obnoxious drunk who lives on the boat, because without his papers, he is not allowed to land anywhere.  The drunk, Conrad, constantly creates havoc among the passengers, and Hart continually tries to get rid of him, but when storm and pirates threaten the safety of the boat and the passengers, the two join forces, and the drunk manages to gain some respect for his efforts. Some of the acting seemed somewhat stereotypical, especially the brutish Chinese pirate, a big, dumb, mean hulk who grunts choppy English.  His role was a little laughable to me, as well as the pretty young woman with the group of Chinese children on the boat, who heroically (or stupidly) steps forward to chide the brute and his gang of immoral pirates, which in real life would call dangerous attention to herself.   In spite of that, I consider this movie as one to be enjoyed as a film classic, one that combines the rollicking antics of the drunk, a little romance, some humorous moments, the adventure of a storm at sea, and confrontation with pirates.
