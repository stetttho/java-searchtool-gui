 These exquisite quilts made of fabric and silk flowers, and embellished with glistening threads and beads, are a delight to the eye, a focal point in decor, and a conversation piece!  If you like fabric and flowers, here's the way to combine them, using your sewing skills, deft hands, and an eye for design.  The abundant, beautifully photographed quilt designs in the book will certainly get you started, whether to copy one, or to use as inspiration for creating your own designs.  The author's experience with teaching classes on this technique comes through in the thorough, yet easy to understand instructions.  There are some supplies the author mentions that I had never heard of, so the list of resources, including some web addresses, is helpful.  The price of the book seems a little high, but if you make only one of these fabric masterpieces, it will be worth it!
