 I just finished reading this book to my adolescent daughters to increase their awareness of the conflict in the Holy Land.  The entire story takes place in an Israeli hospital, where Samir is the only Palestinian boy in the children's ward.  As he waits for his operation to be performed by an American doctor, he observes the funny antics, the emotional traumas and the interactions of the other children in the room.  Although the story deals with a serious subject... Samir reflects on the difficulties his family is going through due to his brother's death in the streets, and the chaos, uncertainty, and fear resulting from the Israeli-Palestinian fighting... there are many light moments that had us laughing.  As the book progresses towards the end though, it becomes more serious as the children deal with their individual problems. Although we were losing our enthusiasm for the story as the funny parts faded, Yonatan takes Samir on a "trip to Mars" where there is some interesting, poetical imagery, and the story ends in a hopeful, upbeat mood.
