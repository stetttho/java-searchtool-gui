 This is a beautifully done jewelry-making book.  The pages are nicely organized and uncluttered with large, colorful photographs and drawings that clearly show details of the jewelry pieces.  There are a few items I don't care for, but most are very pretty with wonderful color and texture combinations, in a variety of styles. This is not a complete beading book however, for example, as one reviewer mentions, there are no instructions for knotted bead jewelry.  Rather, the author focuses on a few techniques, with a few projects given for each technique:  wirework (brooch, stickpin, a beautiful "cleopatra" necklace, and a wire-wrapped rock bracelet); bead stringing (choker, three pretty necklaces of different designs, beaded watch strap, and an Indian-look fringed bead necklace); sewing beads onto a surface (brooch, pin, necklace); woven beadwork (daisy chain necklace, diamond shaped earrings, bracelet, peyote stitch pouch necklace...all made with seed beads); polymer clay beads (which includes instructions for making the beads, some in the shape of flowers).   My only complaint is that there are only a few projects for each technique.  Yet, some of them are so very pretty that I decided the low price of the book justified its purchase.   Note for beginners: There is not a techniques section; instead the techniques are taught within each project's instructions, so a beginner should start at the front, where the most basic techniques are taught, and work her way through the book.  Although the instructions are mostly clearly explained and illustrated, a little prior experience with jewelry findings (such as clasps), and doing some wirework may be helpful.
