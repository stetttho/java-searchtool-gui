 There is a really nice range of projects in this book, from simple in design and technique to complex and unique.  A couple of the candleholders look like something I could buy in Bi-Mart for a few dollars, however, they'd be great practice items for the beginner.  Few of the items use the typical square-shaped tiles, rather there are a lot of broken tiles and ceramics used, along with glass marbles, metallic beads, rocks, and ceramic pieces such as roses and birds, which give the projects a more unstructured look. The introductory pages in the beginning of the book are very nicely laid out and informative.  They clearly show what kinds of materials and tools are used, and how to work with them.  The pages on mixing and coloring grout I think are especially helpful.  Project instructions are also clear and easy to read and include finishing instructions as needed (such as for hanging).  There are several galleries of projects (without instructions) that can serve as a resource for ideas after mastering the basic skills. The objects covered include the usual picture frames, vases,  and tabletops, but they are all unique enough from other mosaic books to make this book worth keeping in your library for an idea resource.  New ideas for me include covering two different ceiling light covers and concrete garden decorations.  The concrete turtle covered with tiles and glass gems is a cute example.  There's a gorgeous vase with a floral and geometric design, using a stained glass which shimmers with many colors, and a broken-tile covered chair that would certainly be the center of attention.   This book has enough variety and quantity of projects in addition to what I've mentioned, that it should be a welcome addition to a mosaicist's library.
