 This is a basic, but excellent book for beginning and more advanced mosaicists.  Every page is colorful, well laid out, and easy to scan for information.  Photos of necessary tools, safety equipment and materials are accompanied with good descriptions and/or explanations.  There are very good photos showing how to cut and arrange various shapes of tiles.    Every project is beautiful, and ranges from easy to very advanced.  Easy projects include a sparkly Byzantine box,  a pottery piece, pencil box, mirror, frame, wall plaques.  Becoming increasingly larger or more complex are a vase, candlesticks, table top, backsplash with mirror, giant wall hangings, covered door and a bathroom ceiling!    A notable feature of the book is that several of the designs show a variety of alternate color combinations, which help with the planning of your particular project.  This book is very inspiring, and gets the creative juices going.
