 I know Dav Pilkey has written a lot of funny books which can make both kids and adults laugh, but I consider his Dragon series to be the best, and of those, A Friend for Dragon is tops!  I have returned to this book many times to read to school children, and they are glued to the gullible dragon who falls for the trick that an apple is alive and can speak.  We laugh as Dragon tries to communicate with his best friend, the apple, and worry when the apple is bitten into and finally dies.  Dragon goes through a grieving process, but the story ends on an upbeat, optimistic tone, and we are all touched by the sweet humor and poignancy of this story. This is one of my all-time favorite children's books.
