 In "Vagabond", Thomas of Hookton is the expert longbowman hero that we follow on his quest of the Holy Grail.  Actually, as in the first book, "The Archer's Tale", Thomas is not all that interested in the Grail; he'd just rather be an archer; however, he keeps getting sucked into its pursuit by others who hound him about it.  These others are generally cruel and hateful characters whose interest in the Grail is to obtain political or religious power, or monetary fortune.  They are a threat to Thomas and have all done evil to him and his friends,thereby becoming enemies upon whom Thomas must seek revenge.  Thomas is a hero to admire, not because he is particularly charismatic, but because he is humble, honorable, clever, and skilled.  He is caught in dangerous times and situations, and carries out his duties for England and his friends as best he can.   This sequel was not as exciting as the first book, but the battle scenes in both books are fascinating, vivid, and gory.  Author Cornwell bases these on actual historical battles.  This book opens with the Battle of Neville's Cross in which the confident Scots, invading England while England is busy battling in France, nevertheless are slaughtered.  The amazing battle of La Roche Derrien in France is the ending scene, in which all but one of Thomas' enemies is vanquished, but the Grail is still undiscovered. This lets us know that another sequel will follow.  I have learned a lot about this era of the famous longbow archers and of the 1000 year war between England and France, and Thomas' personal adventures in this period make me eager to continue reading whatever sequels are coming.
