 This book has good instructions for creating and decorating beads made of wood and instructions for a variety of jewelry construction techniques.  Constructions include stringing beads, connecting beads with wire pieces, and various methods for finishing the ends.  The most useful instructions for me are on coiling wire decoratively to join beads, and wrapping beads with wire to "cage" them.  However, the majority of jewelry designs in this book aren't very inspiring and look somewhat outdated.  The best use for this book is if you can get it at a lower price than most jewelry books, use the instructions but create your own designs.
