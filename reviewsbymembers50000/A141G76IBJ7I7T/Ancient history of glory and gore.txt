 It has to be hard to write about a time as ancient as 700 B.C., but Nicholas Guild successfully transports us to the land and people of Assyria in this epic historical novel.  I haven't done any research on this culture.  I don't know what the people believed, or with whom they battled, or how they dressed, but Guild has painted here a credible picture of this setting in substantial detail.   Tiglath Ashur is King Sennacherib's favorite son because of his heroism in battle.  Sennacherb wishes Tiglath to succeed him as king, but when the priests interpret a goat's entrails, Tiglath's less capable brother, Esarhaddon, is designated as the future king instead.  In countless cases of history, brothers, fathers, cousins, etc. kill one another to claim the throne, but honorable Tiglath remains loyal to his brother and to the god's wishes.  He does so at a price, however, losing the woman he loves and possibly the superiority of his country if placed in the hands of his incompetent brother.      Each of the characters in this book has a distinct personality and role to fulfill.  There is Kephalos, Tiglath's roly-poly, loyal and entrepreneurial slave.  Shaditu, Tiglath's royal sister, is an immoral seductress.  The Lady Naqia, Esarhaddon's mother, is cunning and conspiratorial.  All the characters are enmeshed in intrigue, politics, love, and revenge, and within this scenario, Tiglath searches for his own destiny.  As honorable as Tiglath tries to be, he also is caught up in a culture which kept control of the surrounding lands through bloody battles, and horrifically gory punishments of its enemies.   With its journeys through far-away lands, its intrigue, passion, and details of battle, this book kept me entertained through its 550 pages, and I look forward to reading its sequel, Blood Star.
