 I got this book for my teenage daughter who learned basic macrame from a book.  This book expands her techniques and gives her many more design options. It begins with a section showing different types of knots with diagrams on how to make them.  The drawings are good, but because of all the threads intertwining, you have to be a person with patience to study the diagrams and follow them step by step.  The next section has quite a number of jewelry designs using all the different types of knots and incorporating beads.  The instructions are as good as they can be, with a large, clear photo, a list of materials, a list of the knots used, written instructions and a diagram that shows how the necklace (or bracelet, etc.) is laid out... that is, where all the knots and beads are along the strand.  Even the beginner's "Simplicity Choker" is attractive, and more advanced designs are quite unusual, including scallopped edges, split strands, pendants, and beads placed in a flower shape.  Very nice!  I admit my daughter can sit for hours doing this, but she has had a lot of fun and pride in her work.
