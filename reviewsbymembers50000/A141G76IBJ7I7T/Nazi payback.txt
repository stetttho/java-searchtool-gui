 The reader, Steve Hodson, does a nice job of creating mood for this story, but the story itself was rather unexciting and predictable.  Anna Woltman is a woman, who although German, wants to kill Nazis for their atrocities in general, and for killing her husband, in particular.  She takes gunshooting lessons in preparation, and falls for her trainer, who then becomes involved in her quest.  There are some cat and mouse games between the hunter and the hunted, and a little danger involved, but there is not a great sense of suspense.  Anna, who seems rather cold and remote, doesn't manage to invoke an emotional connection in the reader, who probably only cheers her on because of the evil the Nazis did.
