 The four chaplains who gave their lives selflessly to prevent others from dying certainly deserve for their story to be known, however, I would like to have seen equal voice given to their four different faiths. The story seems to be told more from the viewpoint of fundamental Christianity, and the character and beliefs of the chaplains of other faiths, Judaism, for example, seem neglected.   What I found important in the chaplains' story was the comraderie and unity among them, in spite of their different faiths.  This mutual respect is a great lesson for teaching the importance of loving one another, and I imagine made a positive impact on the men they served, although this was not emphasized in the book.  When the greatest test of all came, and the soldiers found themselves in the water, all of the chaplains, no matter what their religion, showed their commitment to God and man by making the lives of their fellow soldiers more important than their own.  This is the emotional high point of the story, as we envision the fear of men facing death, and see the faith of the chaplains stand firm.  We wonder what we would have done in the same situation, and we are left with a lesson that life is fleeting and to consider our lives in the context of the eternal.
