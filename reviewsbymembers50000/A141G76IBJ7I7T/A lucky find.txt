 Fifteen years ago, I followed a Jane Fonda challenge video for an hour and a half every day.  With passing years, I have become a walker, but in my cold climate, that only works in the summer.  I have no room for a treadmill, so this video has become the perfect choice for me to keep in shape during the cold part of the year.  The movements are easy but change frequently enough to keep me from getting bored, and the short, but invigorating routine is easy to fit into my busy day.  True, Leslie yaks most of the time, but at least she doesn't have an irritating voice.  I especially appreciate that all the members of the exercise team look like real people with an assortment of body types, and not like cookie-cutter models!
