 This is a short book, only 64 pages, with large print and lots of photos, so it is quick to read.  Although I think the book could be longer, I still give it 5 stars because any book that makes people, especially the younger generation, aware of what happened during the Holocaust is an important contribution.  The book is designed to inform teens as it relates the stories of several people who were teenagers at the time they were in hiding during WWII.  Because the stories are short, young people who might not ordinarily take the time to read historical text, will find it easy to become generally informed about what these survivors went through, and the circumstances of their persecution by the Nazis.   Each of the biographies in this book tells a unique story...some teens were hidden in private houses, often moving from place to place, and one 12-year-old girl survived in the forest, eating insects and raw rats.  Once she had hidden in a haystack with other refugees, but they were discovered and attacked by anti-Jews who stabbed the haystack with pitchforks.  When all was quiet, she climbed out and found the others' mutilated bodies lying on the ground.   The book ends with updates about those teens' lives today. This book and the other seven in the series (Teen Witnesses to the Holocaust) would be useful for a quick study on the Holocaust.
