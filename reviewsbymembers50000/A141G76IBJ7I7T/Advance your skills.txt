 This book is for the beader who doesn't want to stop at just putting beads together, but who now wants to make the beads themselves, and to try some creative new techniques for jewelry-making.  For people who have time to make their own beads, there are instructions for beads of clay, wire, metal sheeting, meltable plastic, and paper.  The photos show very professional results, and the jewelry made with these beads look like what you might see in a jewelry boutique.   Other projects in the book include jewelry made with knotted hemp and beads, and some interesting uses of wire.  A few necklaces are made with beads joined by stitching or on a loom.  A final section has projects for decorating your home with beads and wirework, such as vases, clothing accessories, a frame, and windchime.   These projects are for the serious-minded beader who has time to dedicate to expanding their skills with beads.  The instructions are very good and close-up photos show the steps clearly.
