 I love stories of survival and adventure, which I expected Curve of the World to be.  I give this book 4 stars because the quality of the writing is good, and I was drawn to continue reading to find out what happened after the Coke executive became lost in the Congo jungle.  He became very ill and was on the brink of death very quickly in his ordeal which seems a likely scenario if this happened to "real" people under such circumstances.  His survival has more to do with luck in finding some dirty water to drink and a few roots to eat, and being discovered and helped by a young boy rather than to any wit and cunning or survival skills. What I found disappointing about the book was that it focused half on his survival story, and half on his relationship with his wife, and so it became more of a psychological drama of relationships rather than an adventure.  I suppose this is the author's intention, but it wasn't exactly what I was looking for.  I guess I'm better off getting back to reading non-fiction stories of real people surviving in real situations of adversity.  There are plenty of such books out there.
