 This is an absolutely bare-bones biography of Florence Nightingale.  It's written for early readers to learn a little about this famous nurse, with nine pages of  very simple text and nine pages of photos.  Because the text is so limited to the basic details of her life, it is rather dry and uninspiring.  The book can provide an introduction to Nightingale, but should be enhanced with some discussion or other resources.  An animated film called "Florence Nightingale" from the "Animated Hero Classics" (Nest Entertainment, Inc.) is helpful in giving children a better picture of this woman who accomplished so much in the field of health care.
