 Poor Gary Boone, nicknamed Goon by the kids at school who consider him a nerd, struggles to be accepted. His favorite pastime is telling jokes, but it doesn't help him win friends. When a school talent show is announced, he decides that it can be an outlet for his jokes, but wonders if his jokes are funny enough. Finally he puts together a routine he is proud of, but is uncertain about how it'll go over.  The jokes in this book are not real funny, and it's a disappointment compared to Louis Sachar's wildly funny and clever Wayside School series, but this book has a nice message about finding one's identity that many kids could probably relate to.
