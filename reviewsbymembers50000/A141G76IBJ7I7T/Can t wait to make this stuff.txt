 This bead book is like an encyclopedia and gallery in one.  I love looking through its wonderful photos of beads and jewelry, and it has added to my store of techniques and design ideas.  A large section is dedicated to close-up photos of many types of beads with references to their history and cultural background.  It makes me more knowledgeable about what I'm getting when I shop for beads.   The next section has a wonderful display of jewelry, mostly necklaces and earrings, in all kinds of styles, materials, colors -- from light and delicate to chunky and bold.  I've gotten a lot of ideas from these to copy or create my own designs.   A section at the end explains various jewelry-making techniques with closeup photos and adequate written instructions.  I think just a little prior experience would be helpful in following these fairly simple techniques.  There are a couple more pages that clearly show a few methods for sewing beads onto fabric.  This is a bead book I will keep returning to for browsing and inspiration.
