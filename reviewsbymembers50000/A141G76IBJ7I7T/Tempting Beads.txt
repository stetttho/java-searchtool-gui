 Fire Mountain knows how to win customers by sending this catalog out free.  Many other bead catalogs charge for them.  The catalog is packed full of everything you need for beading in full color, easy-to-see photos.  The prices are good, but the best prices are available when you buy a greater quantity of an item.  The company is wonderful to deal with, with great customer service, and has an easy return policy.  Shipping is done immediately upon receiving your order and is nicely packed.  I actually took a tour of their enormous warehouse which is extremely orderly and efficient.  Browsing through the catalog will make you drool over all the possibilities, and then you can hop online for easy ordering on their online catalog.  Great stuff!
