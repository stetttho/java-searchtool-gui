 What the players on the popular survival shows go through is nothing compared to what the author of this book went through to survive in the Amazon jungle! Yossi Ghinsberg set out with three other men to experience a real jungle, and for sure, encountered incredible plant and animal life. But it didn't stop there. When the foursome split into two groups, Yossi and his companion then became separated when Yossi was swept away down the powerful Tuichi River. At that point, Yossi was on his own, and narrates his awesome struggle for survival...to find food and shelter, and to combat such things as the fungus that was eating his feet, jaguars, fireants, termites that carpeted his body and bored into it, and steep, slippery cliffs. Whew! I am reading the book a second time, this time to my teenage children, to give them an appreciation for what true suffering is, and to help them realize that humans can, with motivation and determination, endure and overcome great obstacles. When we start complaining about our daily irritations, this is the kind of book we need to read to help us consider our blessings.
