 Jim Gallen has written an excellent review and summary of Soldiers of the Faith, so I refer perusers to his review to obtain information about the book's contents.  I listened to the recorded version whose narrator, who reads in a somewhat monotone fashion, does a fine job at pacing the reading to give the listener time to digest all the information that is packed into this book.   I gave this book a 5 because, having read other non-fiction about the Crusades, this in comparison was quite digestible for a novice student of the Crusades.   The lengthy period of history, the thousands of people who participated in the Crusades, and all the conflicting thoughts, ambitions, and motivations of the time made the Crusades so much more involved and convoluted than I could have imagined before beginning this study.  "Soldiers" does not try to cover it all in depth, but focuses on the more interesting and necessary aspects of the Crusades to give us a broad understanding of the purpose and results of this campaign. Interspersed with some of the drier accounting of dates and places are gory battle details, treatment of prisoners, and the role of women on the Crusades and at home, sometimes related with a tongue-in-cheek humor. This book increased my knowledge of this terrible time in human history, and kept me engaged throughout.
