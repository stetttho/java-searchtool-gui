 I always gobble up Clive Cussler's books because they so full of adventure, action and humor, and they take place in locations all over the world, above and below water.    Blue Gold was far less adventurous and nail-biting than Cussler's other books I've read so far (my favorite being Inca), but it was still plenty entertaining, and filled all my quiet spots during summer vacation.  I found many of the scenes fascinating and intriguing, such as the discovery of an American woman who had become a tribal "goddess" among a primitive South American tribe, and how she created contraptions and improvements in her village due to her own technical expertise.  There was an exciting boat race, underwater laboratories, and I dare not give away any more.  Yes, it is all highly unlikely, and in fact reminded me of Indiana Jones-style adventure, but I didn't care.  It was fun!
