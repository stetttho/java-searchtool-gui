 This is a book of real beading techniques, using authentic beading supplies to introduce the world of beads and jewelry-making to young teens.  There are lots of projects to choose from, including necklaces, earrings, bracelets, rings, headbands, ponytail holder, hair clips, etc.  Most of the projects use seed beads, but many other beads can be used, too.  Techniques show beading on jewelry wire, memory wire, and thread, and the use of standard supplies and tools such as crimp beads, clasps, pliers, and wire cutters.   There is only one true-life photo that shows the finished jewelry, and it's on the cover in color.  However, in the photo, the teen model is wearing a ton of jewelry, and the details and styles cannot be seen.  The same photo is shown enlarged on the first page of the book in black and white, but still does not give a clear idea of the finished products.  The book would be so much more motivating if the projects were shown in color photographs.  The black and white illustrated instructions are pretty good, simple and easy enough to follow, but the drawings result in a cartoon-like look, as if this is not an art, but "crafts for kids".   For girls (or boys) who are really interested in learning the art of jewelry beading, the book is really a great start.  The book itself is not "pretty" or motivating, so the young beader will need to be able to envision the end product and follow the instructions and diagrams carefully.
