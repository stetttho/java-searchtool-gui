 Most of my own beaded jewelry uses seed beads purely as spacers, but this book has inspired me to make jewelry that features seed beads  as the principal component.  These are no ordinary seed bead creations... they are truly unique and beautiful, and as the title suggests, they look like delicate fantasies in jewel tones.    Part of what makes these pieces so beautiful is the blending of seed beads with crystals, or small faceted beads.  The author shows you how to combine seed beads and crystals, and thread them together into many different floral, geometric, and medallion shapes.  These shapes are exquisite accents that turn ordinary seed bead jewelry into eye-catching art.  These pretty shapes are blended into necklaces, bracelets, eyeglass holders, cell phone leashes and more.  Especially unique and new to me are the little beaded rings that are as lovely and sparkly as gemstone rings.  There are also brooches, hair ornaments, earrings, and miniature beaded purses, and everything is photographed in brilliant color.  The diagrams are in color, and the instructions are generally easy to follow, with a supplementary section in the back that gives basic weaving instructions and finishing techniques.  I can't wait to try almost everything in this book!
