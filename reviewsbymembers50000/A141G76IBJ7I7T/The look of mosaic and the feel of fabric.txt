 My new interest in mosaic attracted me to this book because I also sew.  The lovely designs include mostly floral, fruit, and animal motifs.  The patterns provided in the book are traced, then used to cut out your fabric pieces.  Each design is formed of many pieces as if they are broken mosaic tiles, and put together like a puzzle.  Dark lines of stitching separate each piece giving the design its mosaic appearance.  The authors use bright jewel-like colors of fabric which give the designs more of a stained-glass window look.  If printed or calico fabrics are used, the design takes on a more country quilt look.  All the designs can be adapted to a variety of projects, such as pillows, wall hangings, or framed artwork.  Fun projects for fabric crafters.
