 While young Corban is off in the hills, the Vikings come and slaughter the inhabitants of his village, but kidnap his twin sister, Mav. Enraged and desperate when he comes across the bodies of the rest of his family, Corban begins a journey to find Mav, who has second sight. She is being held by the Lady of Hedeby, a witch-queen who wants to use Mavs power to serve her own purposes for political domination of the regions of the North Sea. Corban faces several obstacles on his journey, including a riveting storm at sea and attacks by thieves. In the town of Jorvik, he becomes involved with one of its oppressed families who lives under a mound of matted vegetation, just high enough to sit up inside. Three young girls care for their blind and senile father in this hovel, along with a few goats. The description of this place put me right there with this family; I could imagine the horrible stench inside from unwashed sweaty bodies, rotting vegetation, and goats in such close quarters.  Later, as the story reaches its climax, Corban finds himself in a dangerous predicament, which puts both his life and his sisters in danger, and the story picks up speed as events take an unexpected turn. I found the era interesting, a time when Christianity was new and many clung to beliefs in the gods, such as Thor. But there is some fantasy and magic in the plot, which didnt appeal to me. I prefer historical fiction that is more factual, because I want to know how it really was. Yet, I did enjoy Corbans adventures and meetings with interesting people. Many historical novels focus on the powerful and wealthy, and their luxurious way of life, but the characters in this book are poor and filthy, scrounging for food, and not particularly lovely, an interesting change from glamorous characters. Though I found the writing style somewhat simplistic, as if written for younger readers, its shorter length is just right for a quick and entertaining romp into the past.
