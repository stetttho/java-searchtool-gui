 Mr. Destiny is not only fun entertainment, it deals with the question every person asks at some time in their life:  How would my life be different now if only I had....?  James Belushi charmingly plays the man who lost his job, and finds himself wishing he could change his past and start over.  He finds his chance to do just that after a little magical intervention by Mr. Destiny (Michael Caine).  With just one change in his past...from losing the big baseball game, to winning it, Belushi's life takes a different path.  Suddenly plopped into his new life, with a different wife and a different job, he encounters many troublesome adventures...humorous for the viewer, but disastrous for Belushi.  Just at the point of hopelessness, Mr. Destiny intervenes again, but I won't give away anymore  of the plot here.  I loved Belushi's character... in spite of his troubles, he confronts all situations with grace and humor.  The movie is sweet, funny, and even carries an encouraging message:  Don't regret the past, but go forward and make the best of what you've got!
