 This is a nicely done, attractively animated film about Florence Nightingale.  Her life is not one that would necessarily fascinate children because it may be difficult for them to understand the concepts associated with the social, political, and cultural issues surrounding Nightingale's work, and the historical setting --the Crimean War-- is probably unfamiliar to them as well as to many adults.  However, for anyone who would like their children to know about this important woman and her contribution to healthcare and humanitarianism, this is a good way to start.  The images give a good idea of the clothing, buildings, and ships of the time, and show how Florence's efforts were slow to be received in a male-dominant culture.  Older children could probably understand the concepts well, but younger children would still need some discussion to clarify the message and issues.
