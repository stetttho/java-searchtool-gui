 I loved this book of great adventure!  The story begins with the escapades of two young cousins in France, in the tunnels under Paris, which is besieged by the Prussians.  When Paul's father is imprisoned, the boys make a daring attempt to rescue him, floating on a raft between high guarded walls around the city.  In their Catholic school, Moussa, who is half Arabic, experiences racism, which gets  him into fights. Sister Godrick persecutes him for the amulet he wears, a symbol of his heritage.  When other injustices and danger befall Moussa, in particular at the hands of a lascivious bishop, their lives take different paths.  Moussa flees to join his nomadic Tuareg relatives in the Sahara, and Paul joins a French expedition to the Sahara.  Unknowingly, they end up on opposing sides. The story has great scenes of narrow escapes, including one from Paris in a hot air balloon, from underground tunnels in the desert, and from battles with Arabic warriors.  There is the suspense of wondering if and when the cousins will ever meet up safely and in friendship again.  This is an adventurous historical fiction that is on my all-times favorites list!
