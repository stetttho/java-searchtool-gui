 The instructions for the mosaic projects in this book are not as thorough as some other mosaic books, and the text and step-by-step photos are a little small for my taste, being that I like them to be easily visible at a safe distance from the project I'm working on.  However, the instructions are adequate for beginners, and there are certainly a variety of fairly easy, pretty project ideas.  There's a nice mosaic-encrusted wine bottle, a lamp that includes undetailed instructions for its wiring, a charming chest of 5 mini-drawers, a lovely clock face, a couple of mirrors that nicely show how to attach the mirror as well as the mosaics, an attractive partially-covered flower pot, some small ceramic square tiles decorated with several different mosaic designs that can be used for a variety of decorative purposes, and other projects.  This is a fairly good book for a person getting started, but serves better as one to add to your collection as a resource for ideas.
