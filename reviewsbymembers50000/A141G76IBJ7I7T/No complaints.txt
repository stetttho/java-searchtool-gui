 I bought this little card reader for using a compact flash card that came with my first digital camera.  At first, I had been loading directly from the camera into a software program which places the photos in an on-screen album.  That process seemed too slow; and I really didn't want everything in an album.  The reader is so much faster and easier.  You put the card in the reader's slot, plug the USB cord into the computer, and an icon of a disk appears on screen.  Click on the icon, and in the window that opens there are several folders.  A couple of the folders have items in them that seem to be informational or for functionality, and which I leave untouched, but other folders are created for storing your photos when you use your camera.  Click on these folders to display a window full of small images of your photos, (you can click on them to enlarge them). It is easy to remove any of them to the trash if I don't like them, or to move them into other folders on my hard drive, a disk, an album, or wherever I want to store them.  Or I can immediately open them with a photo imaging program, (I usually use Photoshop Elements).   When I got this little gadget, it immediately made the process of loading my photos onto the computer much better for me.  I've had it for several months, and it's been completely reliable.
