 Other reviews have compared The Golden Compass to the Harry Potter books.  I agree that these books compare well in literary finesse, complexity of plot, and interest value.  They are both wonderful fantasies, and both settings occur in a world parallel to England, yet they are really very different! For me, Harry Potter is lighter in mood; the scary beings are more cartoonish in feeling, making them entertaining and "delightfully scary".  The Golden Compass has a darker feeling, with intimidating characters with mysterious, sinister plans.  There are kidnappings of children, battles with gore and bloodshed, and even children die.   This is not to say that one series is better than the other; just to note the differences.  I personally favor Harry Potter, and enjoyed its lightheartedness, but I thoroughly have enjoyed The Golden Compass, and so have my two young teenagers I've been reading it to.  In fact, they prefer it to Potter for its greater sophistication.  For them, HP was too childish.   The Golden Compass has its light and funny moments, but seems to carry a commentary about religion and the forces of good and evil... a dark fantasy.  Yet I've mostly savored it for its rich vocabulary, letting it create for me fantastic visual images of ponderous old buildings and crypts in London, icy northern strongholds where experiments are carried out on children and their daemons, where talking, armored bears live, and hordes of raven-shaped witches fly overhead.  It's potential material for the next great fantasy movie.
