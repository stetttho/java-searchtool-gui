 I have used this book repeatedly for art lessons for children.  My students have compiled a portfolio of these projects.  First children learn about primary and secondary colors on the color wheel.  They experiment with mixing colors to create gradations of colors, and making them lighter and darker. After these basic lessons, they create a variety of interesting and fun projects emphasizing the use of color.  The projects are easy to do with a minimum of basic materials: water colors or acrylic paints, glue,  colored construction paper, and markers. Lessons include repetition and arrangements of shapes made with cut-out shapes, stamping and rubbings.  Children experiment with straight and curved-line designs.  With a little extra teacher and student imagination, we have turned out some very attractive and impressive projects.
