 This is a nice historical account of the explorer Balboa, whose name I probably wouldn't have heard of it I weren't familiar with Balboa Beach, California.  Fortunately, Californians can be fairly proud to have a place named after this explorer, because he was one of the more compassionate of the Spaniards who generally slaughtered every Indian they encountered. This book is appropriate for children from about 3rd through 8th grade, although I certainly learned a lot reading it.  The first part is a little hard to follow because there are many facts given rapidly, making it difficult to make connections between events and people.  As the account progresses, it becomes more lively and interesting, not sparing children from the cruelties and gruesome disasters of Spanish expeditions.  In favor of this book are its many photos of the landscape Balboa traversed, and portraits of historical figures.  The lack of a modern map, however, made it difficult to follow Balboa's journeys.
