 I chose this book because the intriguing title led me to believe I would learn about an ancient ruin or buildling, the civilization that created it., and the activities that took place there that made it "holy".  The book went in a completely different direction, however, than what I expected.   The "holy place" is a region around the village of Rennes-le-Chateau in France, and what makes it holy is that the churches, castles and ruins of the area are all aligned in complex geometrical patterns, and the high points of land surrounding the area are situated in the shape of a pentagon.  The building sites are on points that form an arrangement of pentagons, stars, circles, and grids.  Most of the book describes and illustrates these geographic and geometric relationships, which, although interesting, becomes rather tedious.   I was pretty well convinced of this "sacred geometry", but I really wanted to know who created the site and why.  There is a suggestion that ancient people had more knowledge and skills than we acknowledge today, and that a secret society may have been involved in the site's creation. Unfortunately, because of lack of proof, the author had no conclusion about this, therefore, we are left hanging, having to wait until further discoveries are made, perhaps by archaeologists who can some day uncover more definitive proof.
