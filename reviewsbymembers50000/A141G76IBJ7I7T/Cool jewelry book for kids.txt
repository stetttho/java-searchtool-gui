 The snappy, fun, and bright beaded jewelry in this book will motivate crafty adolescents to try their hand at making these pieces. The materials are easy to acquire where there are beading supplies, and the instructions are very well illustrated and easy to follow. The techniques are fairly simple, mostly using needle and thread. One of the pieces shows how to finish the ends by using a crimp bead next to the clasps, but all the others are finished by tying the ends in a knot around the clasps, and then sealed with clear nail polish.  This repetition of technique keeps the process simple and eliminates the tools generally used in jewelry-making. Some kids might want some help, but once started, they should sail along making these coiled bracelets, strung bracelets and anklets, and earrings. There are also clear illustrations for making a bead loom, and for showing how to weave the beads on the loom to make Indian-look woven bracelets.
