 I can do nothing but gush and rave about this book!  Where has this author gone, and will there be more?  Nicholas Guild has an amazing mastery of storytelling and language, as in this sequel to the wonderful novel, The Assyrian, he brings to life an ancient and admirable hero in the land of Assyria, about 700 B.C.   Tiglath Ashur, a prince who should have been king, detours through life at the whim and design of the god Ashur.  Tiglath is noble, brave, wise, a disciplined commander of armies who can mete destruction or mercy as justice requires.  His journey through life takes him to the heights of victory, and to the depths of banishment.  He always looks to the god and his signs to guide him as he escapes assassins and takes deadly treks through scorching desert, labyrinthine swamps, and squares off with enemies who set traps for him in unexpected places.  Tiglath has fascinating companions, too: Kephalos, his loyal and cunning servant; Enkidu, his mute giant of a bodyguard, and Selana, his feisty Greek wife.  Not only does the plot of this book take you on a great ride of adventure and human emotion, but it is told eloquently, in language with rich metaphors and detail.   Of course I had to find out more information about this historical period of Assyria, around the time of Tiglath's father, King Sennacherib.  What I found online was sketchy compared to the novel, but with that skeleton of historical records, the author has built an incredibly imaginative and satisfying story, about 1400 pages between the two books.  I greatly enjoyed the first: The Assyrian, but Blood Star was even better, and to cap it off, it ended perfectly.
