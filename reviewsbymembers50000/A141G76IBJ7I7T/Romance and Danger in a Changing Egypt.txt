 I think it's amazing that Noel Barber as a journalist and non-fiction writer can also write such beautiful and engaging fiction.  Sakkara is full of romance, danger, political turmoil, emotional conflicts, and suspense.   British diplomat in Egypt Mark Holt and Egyptian Serena Sirry are secretly in love, yet circumstances constantly interfere in their forbidden relationship.  Mark and Serena and their families struggle to survive Egypt's upheaval as it is torn apart by the poor leadership of the womanizing and gluttonous King Farouk, the invasion of Nazi troops, and the revolutionary havoc created by political dissidents.  This is an exciting and passionate 500-page historical fiction saga, and definitely worth snatching up if you can find it.
