 Rannulf Fitzwilliam is a Templar Knight who is in the Holy Land to serve the Holy Cross during the latter part of the Crusades.  Rannulf used to live a wild, sinful life, and in order to repent from it, he has made vows to abstain from women, and to never harm another Christian.  Struggling to contain his wild nature, he confronts relationships and situations with a hard, grim, stoicism.  He is not particularly friendly or charming, and many of the other characters don't like him, either because he seems gruff and unknightly, or they are intimidated by his strength that threatens to usurp their important positions.  The character of Rannulf permeates the entire book; the story seems to drag at times, bogged down in a tense grimness.  Yet, because of that, the reader feels the reality of the times.  The people of the Holy Land, facing attack and death by Saladin's army, must have lived such a life, solemn and dark in the face of their destruction.   There are other interesting characters that contrast with Rannulf.  The young Christian king of Jerusalem is rotting away with leprosy, yet he admirably endures this suffering to the end in order defend his city.  His beautiful sister Sybilla is a forceful, independent woman, scheming to take her rightful place as queen when he dies, yet also desiring to serve and to save Jerusalem.  She is Rannulf's greatest temptation to break his vows.  Stephen, the red-haired knight has a secret and sinful affair with Ali, the nephew of Saladin. The story ends with a heart-wrenching battle scene at the Battle of Hattin, in which, as history tells us, the Christians were disastrously defeated.  The ending is grim, but powerful, and the reader realizes that this is a realistic immersion into a solemn period of history.  The story is carried off with a subdued elegance of style.
