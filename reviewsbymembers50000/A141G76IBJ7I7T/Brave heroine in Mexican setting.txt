 This is not an "action-packed" movie, rather it has a more subdued suspense, and that's why I liked it.  The main character, Mitch, a woman who is trying to recover from the death of her two children, finds herself in a life and death situation with a network of criminals while traveling with her brother in Mexico.  When her brother suddenly disappears, she sets out to find him.  Her ongoing grief and despair over her children is what actually give her an edge when she faces her would-be killers.  For one thing, she really doesn't care if she dies, yet she really does want to find her brother who has gone missing in this underground world, because he is the only person she has left. Her combination of bravery, determination, and yet a willingness to die is just enough to confound her attackers, and I had a sense of respect for her character.   The Mexican man who helps Mitch find her way around is very likable, and gives a good contrast to the grimness of the other characters and tense situations.  The setting in Mexican locales is interesting...and although they whiz by quicky, there are shots of a quaint village scene, a marketplace, winding streets, a long desert road, along with the harsher scenes of bar life, and the hovels made of tin and cardboard that serve as houses.  Other than the movie ending rather abruptly, without a great sense of closure, I found it to be satisfying entertainment,
