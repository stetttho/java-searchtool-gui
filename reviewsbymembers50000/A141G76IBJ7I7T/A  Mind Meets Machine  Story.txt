 I listened to the unadbridged taped version of this book, and though I wavered between giving it a 3 or a 4, I decided on the 4 because it kept my attention, unlike many books on tape I listen to.  This is a "mind meets machine" story, and reminded me of the movie "Frequency", in which Dennis Quad hears his long-dead father over the radio, and "Matrix" in which the minds of people are living in cyberspace.  In this story, Scott's son Tyler has a terrible head injury, and Tyler lies in a coma, as the doctors attempt a never-before-tried procedure to salvage Tyler's mind with the assistance of a computer which seems to take over Tyler's life force. Rather than dwelling on the plot, I'll comment that for me, the story was interesting, though rather predictable.  What I really missed was the point of view of Tyler, the son.  I wanted to know where his mind was throughout the story.  To me, that would have been more interesting, to know what he was thinking and "doing" in the netherworld as he watched the adults dealing with his situation; but Tyler remained "silent" throughout the story. The reader did an acceptable job, and for the most part was easy to listen to, except when trying to give expression and voice to some of the characters.  In trying to sound like the women characters, his voice took on a whiny, simpering tone, and some of the doctors and scientists took on an overly "diabolical" or "nerdy" tone.  These interpretations were somewhat annoying. My final comment is that yes, the taped version was entertaining enough to keep me listening, but I'm glad I only listened as I went about my work, and didn't spend precious time dedicated to reading the book.
