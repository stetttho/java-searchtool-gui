 I like this jewelry book a lot!  The title and cover suggest the idea that it's a book about beads, but this is a book of jewelry projects made with beads.  I find it to be a great collection of eye-catching designs, from pretty and delicate, to subdued, and bold.  There are a variety of necklace and choker shapes, both single and multi-stranded, using all different kinds of beads: pastel flowers, ethnic-look clay and pipe beads, pearls, glass, seed beads and more.  I find most of the designs inspiring, or easy to adapt to my taste.  None are extremely difficult or time-consuming.  Other projects include a bead curtain and items decorated with beads: a hat, a shirt collar, frame, curtain tiebacks.   Also appealing about this book is the clean, well organized layout of the pages.  Each project has several photos showing the steps, and the finished pieces are displayed in large, beautiful photographs.  This book is a mainstay in my bead jewelry book collection.
