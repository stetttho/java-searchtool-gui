 If you love Ingrid Bergman, here is a book full of beautifully done professional photos of her.  These 99 photos are taken as far back as 1935, when Ingrid was starting as an actress in Sweden, and up to 1970 during her filming of "Walk in the Spring Rain".  Though all photos are in black and white, they shine with her luminescence and her peaches and cream beauty.  The book's focus is the photos, but there is an introduction that gives a short, but interesting biography of her career.  This is a good book for a Bergman collector or a Hollywood legend movie buff.
