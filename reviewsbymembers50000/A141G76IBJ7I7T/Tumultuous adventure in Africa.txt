 A Sparrow Falls is the third of Wilbur Smith's books I've read in the Courtney family series.  Each has its own flavor; each one is delightful and hard to put down, but A Sparrow Falls was a real demonstration of a powerful writer taking his readers on a turbulent, tumbling ride on a river of adventure and emotion!   Smith's protagonists draw you in with their magnetic personalities and complicated problems to confront.  The antagonists, the crude diabolical bad guys, are truly despicable.  In this book, there is a seemingly impossible task in which the "good guys" must preserve a large African land area in its natural state, and to shield the wildlife which has rapidly been disappearing.  Sections of the book which deal with the cruel maiming and killing of animals are hard to read, yet you know it has happened and continues today.  We witness the bloody mutiny of the Marxist-led strikers, and atrocious deeds committed by greedy, evil people.  The ending of the book is rather jarring and sad, and should not be given away in a review, but the ending works, and I closed the book with a "Wow!".   Yet Smith balances these intense scenes with humorous interludes, and equally intense romance and beauty.  When he describes the African landscape, the sky, and animals, you are there, standing on a high peak, absorbing a flaming pink sunrise, or squatting down, admiring a tiny and delicate sunbird flitting among the flowers.   The Courtney family books, though written in the '70s and '80s are as appealing as any recently written adventure stories...they are timeless.  I am eager to get my hands on any other books written by Wilbur Smith!
