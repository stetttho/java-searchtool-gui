 I was a young adult when Ingrid died and I was not aware of her fame and reputation as a film star.  I saw her occasionally in old movies and was fascinated by her glowing beauty and talent.  I was appalled by her appearance in her role as Golda Meir; she had changed so much, but now I know why.  Spoto's biography about Ingrid revealed her intimately -- from her childhood to her death, throughout her marriages and affairs, the successes of her career, and relationships with friends and family.  I didn't know that she had been banned from America for her "sins", and I didn't know she had other children besides Isabella Rosselini.  In spite of her foibles, Ingrid still seems like a great woman, thanks to the passionate -- and compassionate -- telling of her life story by Spoto.  The audio version of the book was completely compelling to listen to, enhanced by the reader, C.M. Herbert, whose voice had a quality similar to Ingrid's, and therefore made Ingrid come even more to life.
