 Because of his experience in flying in icy weather conditions, ordinary good-guy American Owen Hart is asked to serve as pilot for a German team on an expedition to Antarctica.  Thinking he can keep himself uninvolved emotionally and politically, little does Hart know what he's getting himself into! To begin with, he falls for the girlfriend of the fiendish Nazi Drexler, immediately setting himself up for problems.  When they land on the Antacticic island, which landscape the author incredibly describes, they come across the wreck of a ship with dead bodies.  When it is discovered that these sailors died of some bacteria on the island, a race begins to find an antidote to save themselves from death by the same bacteria.   Searching the island, Hart and his love interest, biologist Greta, end up in an underground spring, where they experience romance, and then danger.  Now that Drexler is suspicious about his girlfriend and Hart, he has diabolical schemes for getting rid of him.  Hart and Greta battle the Nazis at an increasing pace as danger and horrific death threatens from all angles: treks and falls through ice, deadly bacteria, Nazi weapons and deception.  Increasingly, Hart must become the hero to protect himself and Greta, and ultimately the world, which  could be terribly threatened by the Nazis if they get their hands on that bacteria and turn it into a biological weapon! The vivid and unusual setting descriptions, incorporation of elements based on real historical events, diabolical bad guys you love to hate, variety of dangers faced, and several close escapes all added up to great fun!
