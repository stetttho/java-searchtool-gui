 Heavy historian buffs may rate this book as a 5, because it is packed with all kinds of information one might never imagine about the Crusades.  It certainly deserves credit for all the research that had to go into compiling the essays in this book which cover such areas as the music, poetry, art, architecture of the times, as well as the prevailing thought of the times, both Christian and Muslim.   I gave it a 4 because it didn't meet my own personal expectations.  I wanted to know more about the Crusades, but delineated in a different way to make it easier to digest, perhaps in more readable chapters explaining succeeding Crusades: their journeys, missions, and results.  I did glean useful information and insight, primarily that the Crusades were much more involved than what we generally perceive today as a simple-minded holy war against the infidel Muslims.  I was surprised that the Crusades were also against heretics within Europe, and that there were some critics of the time who opposed killing for the sake of God.  However, this book was overwhelming in its details about people, places, dates, and yet I am still left wanting to know...what exactly happened?
