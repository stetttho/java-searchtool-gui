 This is the last book of the trilogy "Blood of the Goddess", and the one with the most action and suspense.  Thomas Chinnery, a trader, has made a bargain with the Inquisition who has arrested him, that he will be freed if he leads them to the source of the magical powdered blood, which can bring the dead back to life.  Chinnery only pretends to know how to find it in order to save his life, but he also wishes to obtain the blood to revive the murdered Aditi, whom he loves.  This expedition, as well as an expedition of Moghuls, are headed for Bhagavati, the city of the goddess Mahadevi.   During the journey, no one can be trusted, but arriving in Bhagavati, the expeditions face their greatest danger in a magnificent palace, which is infused with an atmosphere of cold beauty and dark magic.  Mahadevi exercises her power to turn men into stone (like Medusa), but Thomas escapes within the walls of the palace.  The struggle between Chinnery and Father Gonscao, who wishes to destroy this place, this goddess, continues here.   Although this is not my usual genre of reading material, I found the series, especially this last book, quite enjoyable, and in particular, the palace of the Mahadevi has left a memorable visual impression.
