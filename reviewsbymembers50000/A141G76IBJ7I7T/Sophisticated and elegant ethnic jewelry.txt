 This book spends comparatively more time discussing types of beads, their history, where they are from, how they are made than it does on jewelry projects.  Included are maps showing where many kinds of beads originate.   Whether or not the information is inaccurate, as one reviewer states it is, doesn't matter to me; I'm more interested in the projects, which are mostly necklaces.  The jewelry pieces are designed to represent all the parts of the world the beads come from, so there are very authentic looking designs representing Venice, Africa, Bohemia, Czechoslovakia, Morocco, Ethiopia, India, and other cultures.  The beautiful, large photos show a great assortment of designs to choose from with different looks, though many of them have a look that is natural and earthy, yet sophisticated and stylish.  To me they are attractive and serve for great inspiration.   Already having jewelry skills, I can look at the pictures and  make them without reading the instructions, but for those who need them, the instructions and diagrams are generally good.  The main problem with the instructions is that they are printed in a small font in gray instead of black, so they are difficult to see.
