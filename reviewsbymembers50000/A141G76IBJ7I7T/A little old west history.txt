 I liked this film because to me it was different than most westerns which feature gunslinging, tobacco-chewing tough guys.  There's a bit of history included here, and an interesting combination of it at that.  At the end of the Civil War, soldier of the north, John Wayne, and soldier of the south, Rock Hudson, meet up in Mexican territory, they and their followers still holding resentment and distrust for each other.  When the Southerners are trapped and held prisoner by Mexican revolutionaries, the Yanks come to their rescue, bringing 2000 wild horses for ransom, though they had spent the last few years catching them for profit.  They have to fight their way through French soldiers who try to block them because the horses will be used by the Mexicans in their war effort against the French.  The acting is not exceptional, but the characters do have some charm.  My interest in this film is for the glimpse into its historical setting.
