 This tiny book accomplishes its task of guiding a FrontPage beginner through the steps of using the basic components of the program. Quick to read instructions are accompanied by lots of photo illustrations to show you how to insert text, tables, grahics and forms, and then explains how to publish your site to a web, (but unfortunately not how to make corrections once it's online). You can follow along on your computer to learn the basics in a very short time, but since the author has you open a new page each time you practice using one of the components, you don't get a feel for how to design and arrange a page with multiple items or how to move things around on the page. For this, and other unanswered questions, I need to get a more extensive book. Once learning the basics, this book may be handy to keep around as a quick reference in case you forget how to do something.
