 Some reviewers say this is a book for beginning scrapbookers, and since I am one, I find this book not disappointing at all!  So far it's the only scrapbooking book I have, but I did compare it with others before buying it.  I chose it because it is packed with photos of completed scrapbook pages, offering an incredible assortment of ideas.  I find the general instructions at the beginning of the book quite understandable, and at this point, I feel I can get started without further ado.  I doubt I'll make exact copies of the ideas presented, but they certainly give me a base to go on.  There are four women scrapbookers who contributed to this book, and each has her own style and offers her own advice and suggestions.  I'd say, advanced scrapbookers, I don't know if this book is for you, but beginners....go for it!
