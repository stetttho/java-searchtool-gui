 Who would have thought that a book written in the 1800s could be so appealing today?  Doing a little internet research, I have found that G.A. Henty lived from 1832-1902, and the books he wrote were historical fiction "for boys".  He was called "The Prince of Story-Tellers" and "The Boy's Own Historian", which certainly may have been true, but I'm an adult female who loved this tale!  The style of writing sounds a little formal and old-fashioned, but it actually helps create a feeling of antiquity, appropriate for its ancient setting during the Punic Wars. The fictional and lovable hero, Marchus, a relative of the famous Hannibal, accompanies him on the Carthaginian campaign against Rome.  I learned so much about Hannibal through this book, yet the majority of the plot involves other adventures that Marchus gets into.  He has near escapes from bears, wolves, lions, treacherous tribesmen.  In two instances, he escapes with the help of an elephant, and a raft in the subterranean reservoir of Carthage.  This was fun stuff, and I am so impressed that this book I found, that is so old it doesn't even have a publication date in it, could be so delightful.  Someone could make a great movie out of this!
