 The impression this CD gives me is of musicians who care deeply about the didgeridoo and its ties to the aboriginal culture and to nature.  There is no effort to make it flamboyant and appealing to the "mass market", but rather is an understated gift to those who appreciate its simplicity.  The six songs in the approximate 45 minutes of music prominently feature the sound of didgeridoos, but it is enhanced by naturally compatible sounds of sticks, a bit of vocal chanting, and nature sounds such as birds and other animals, thunder and rain.  Although the continual "throaty" sound of the didgeridoo can be grating to me if I'm tired or distracted, at the right times it  creates a meditative ambience of oneness with nature.
