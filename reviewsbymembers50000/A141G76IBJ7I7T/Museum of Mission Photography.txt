 This book features superb photography of the historic Catholic missions built in the southwest states and California.  The beautiful photographs, many of them full-page, are of exterior and interior views of the missions, as well as closeups of architectural and artistic details.  A short written history accompanies each featured mission, and although there are some mentions of the historical personages and events connected with the missions, most of the histories refer to the physical aspects of the missions such as their construction, remodeling, etc.  This is a great coffee-table or armchair traveler book, but one will need to look elsewhere for a serious study about mission history.
