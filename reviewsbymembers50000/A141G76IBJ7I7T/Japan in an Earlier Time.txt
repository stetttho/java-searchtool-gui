 This is a wonderful book that takes the reader into the depths of Japanese culture and relationships at the turn of the century.  Japan is leaving behind the world of the samurai and the shogun, and cautiously opening up to the influence of the politics and values of the west.   Kenichi Yamamoto is a samurai who ignores his wife, Lady Masa, as he pursues his mistress, Osen.  But Kenichi and Masa have a son, Renzo, around whom the story revolves. Renzo is confronted by the changes in Japan, which previously had sealed itself off to all outside influence.  Though he must perform his traditional duties to family, he experiences life in London and Paris, becomes an art dealer, and befriends westerners in his country. The interactions in the relationships among the characters are poignant and strange, as they should be to readers of a foreign place and time.  The author creates a wonderful picture with these characters-their customs, thoughts, feelings, and dress.  You can easily visualize the houses they live in, and the various locations from a coastal seaport to the stinky streets of Tokyo.  This book added to my knowledge and understanding  of Japan.
