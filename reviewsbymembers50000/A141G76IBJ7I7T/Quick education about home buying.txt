 I looked over a stack of books about how to buy a home, and chose this one because it was the shortest!  Since I made up my mind to buy a home, I wanted to do it now, and I wanted to equip myself with knowledge fast!  Everything is here in a concise step-by-step format for the process of planning expenses, finding and evaluating a home, dealing with the seller and the real estate agent or broker (never knew there was a difference in them before), making an offer and a contract, getting a loan, going to escrow and closing.  Many terms I only had a vague understanding of before are much clearer (and in case I forget, there's a glossary of terms in the back of the book), and I have a good idea of how to proceed and what I'll be encountering.  Having this knowledge makes me feel as I step into this venture that I will be in control of what I'm doing, and not be at the mercy of sellers or agents.   The author really knows her subject, and I'm grateful for this book.
