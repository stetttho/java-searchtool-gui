 Psi Spies is a short and get-to-the-point book introducing the reader to the topic of remote-viewing. The author's approach is to first prepare the reader with the history of the development of scientific studies of psychic ability in Russia and the U.S., and to show that there is much validity in "psi". From there, he shows how the government, particularly the military, became interested in the use of psychic ability through the technique of remote viewing for use in spying.  The importance of Marrs' book is that he covers all this territory with an extensive array of peoples' names, dates, agency names, and places. He is very thorough in this investigation which, in a subject such as this, is necessary to overcome the reader's skepticism. Having read "Alien Agenda" by Marrs, and having heard him speak several times in radio interviews, I highly respect his intelligence and his analysis of enigmatic topics, and this book is no exception. In this book, Marrs does not present many examples of what the remote viewers, or psi spies, "saw" in their journeys into the psi dimension, his is a more analytical approach to the topic. For first-hand accounts by psi spies themselves, I highly recommend these two fascinating books: Mind Trek, by Joseph McMoneagle, and Psychic Warrior, by David Morehouse. If Marrs has convinced you that remote reviewing is "real", what those two remote viewers have "seen" will blow you away.
