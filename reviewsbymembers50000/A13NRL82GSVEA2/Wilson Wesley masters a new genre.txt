 I have always enjoyed Ms. Wilson Wesley as a mystery author, and was very excited to see her tackle a new genre.  I was not disappointed!  The novel was good cover to cover, and was tastefully done.  I especially enjoyed  reading a tale about a mature relationship.  I am recommending it to my  book club.
