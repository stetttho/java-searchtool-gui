 I had no idea what to expect when I ordered this book.  However, since it was winner of this year's Pulitzer Prize for fiction I said "what the hell."  I was not disappointed.  Although, it was a strange bird, it was very entertaining and well worth the 21 hours I spent listening to it.  If you enjoy a wild ride, (in the tradition of Wally Lamb's "I Know This Much is True") this book is for you.
