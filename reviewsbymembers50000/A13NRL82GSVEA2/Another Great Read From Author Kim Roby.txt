 I enjoyed reading "Casting the First Stone."  It is a very fast and fun read!   I felt that I personally knew many of the characters.  Although the subject matter is very controversial, Ms. Roby made it very  entertaining without losing sight of the seriousness of the issue.  Ms.  Roby does a fantastic job of capturing what is whispered about in the pews  of many churches today.
