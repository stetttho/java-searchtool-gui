 Every now and then a literary work comes along that is magical.  "A Sunday in June" is such a novel.  While being a work of speculative fiction, the book manages to address some tough and very real subjects.   The taboos within these pages tend to be in the closets of many families.  Without giving too much away, I can tell you that it evokes quite a few emotions (so get out your tissues.)  It is a very fast and enjoyable read and is highly recommended.
