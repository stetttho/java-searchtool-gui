 Reading "Aint't No River" was a beautiful love-learning  experience that I will not forget.  The novel is undoubtedly  fiction; however, the spiritual insight is clearly based on  scripture.  We spend our lives trying to climb the direction we perceive as  up.   "Ain't No River" reminds us about the real things in life  that are important; God, family, friends, truth, and trust.   Sharon Ewell Foster's newest novel inspires, touches and  teachers.  "Ain't No River" is beautifully written and  reaffirms Ms. Foster's place among the literary elite.
