 'In Spite Of' is a great debut novel by author Victor McGlothin. It really was refreshing to read a novel written from a 'straight black male' perspective. The novel has something for everyone, if you enjoy a good  book, this is a must read! I enjoyed 'In Spite Of' and I anxiously await  Mr. McGlothin's next novel 'Autumn Leaves.'
