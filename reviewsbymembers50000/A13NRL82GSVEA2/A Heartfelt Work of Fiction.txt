 I listened to the Unabridged Audio version of "47", narrated by the late, great Ossie Davis. It was a wonderful experience.  The story although aimed toward young teen audiences, is not too simple for adults to enjoy.  This story is a heartfelt introduction to slavery for today's youth (to whom many this history is forgotten.)  Kudos to Mr. Mosley for taking on such a tough subject; and for the foresight to aim it to a young audience.  On another note, Ossie Davis did an outstanding job with the narrative; I will always treasure this as one of his great works of art.  -- P. Walker-Williams, PageTurner.net
