 Brandon Massey takes his place among the literary greats of macabre with his sophomore novel ?Dark Corner.?   Set in Mason?s Corner, Mississippi, this novel captures the serenity of small town life...until all hell breaks loose.   Massey cleverly fuses African American folklore with vampires and southern charm.  The mysteries of ?Dark Corner? will enthrall you until the very last page; but be forewarned, you might want to leave your night-light on. --Pamela Walker-Williams, PageTurner.net
