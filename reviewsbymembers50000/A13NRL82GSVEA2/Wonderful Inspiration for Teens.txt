 This book was the monthly selection for our teen outreach group, and they all thoroughly enjoyed it!  Not many authors can capture the attention of our youth along with giving them a positive message, by this author did.  I commend Yolanda Callegari Brooks for both her writing style and her community conscience.  Her book was well written and of good substance.  I look forward to more works by this talented author.  I highly recommend this book for teen reading.
