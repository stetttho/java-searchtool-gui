 I was a little skeptical about buying this DVD at first because the movie hadn't come to the theaters yet.   However, it was really a great screen adaptation.  Kirk Cameron did a great job (and so did the other actors.)  Be warned:  the music/soundtrack was a little loud and distracting at times.  All in all, it was worth the money.
