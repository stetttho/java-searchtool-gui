 The message of this movie transcends both time and age.    When this movie was first release, I took my young son to see it.  He thoroughly enjoyed it, and it presented him with many questions about our country and race relations.  I now have it on both Video and DVD.  My son is now a young adult and this continues to be one of his favorite movies, and mine too!  It is a classic.
