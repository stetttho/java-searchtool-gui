 I was eagerly awaiting Steve Cole's new CD as I have thoroughly enjoyed his previous work.  I heard the title cut on our local jazz station and immediately went out to purchase it.  Whereas, the title cut is reminiscent of the Steve Cole I love, many of the other tunes had more of a "folk" or "country western" flair.  The smooth jazz cuts sounded much like the generic easy listening music CDs you find at Target like "Smooth Sax" or "Coffee Break."  Don't get me wrong, I like some of those CDs, but I really expected more.  It is an OK CD, but if you are new to Steve Cole, don't judge him on this CD alone.  Try "NY LA" or "Between Us"... Now that's what I'm talking about!!!
