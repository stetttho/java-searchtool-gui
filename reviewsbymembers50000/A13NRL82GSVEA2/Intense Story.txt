 It took me a little while to understand the dialogue of the main character Precious Jones.  Once I established the rhythm of the dialect, the story was awesome.  This story made me cry.   I realize that it is a work of  fiction, however, I also realize that this is someone's life story.  This  is a very deep novel, not one for light reading.  It is an excellent book.
