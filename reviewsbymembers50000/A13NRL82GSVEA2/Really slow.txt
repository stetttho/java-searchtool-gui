 Let me start by saying I love Bill Murray and I thought he did an excellent job in a REALLY SLOW movie.  Perhaps the filmmaker was trying to show us how boring and sad some people's lives are, if that was the intent, then the film was a success.  I kept waiting on something interesting or exciting to happen, and before I knew it the film was over.  If you are really bored, and want to see a film about someone's life that is worst than yours, then this is your movie.
