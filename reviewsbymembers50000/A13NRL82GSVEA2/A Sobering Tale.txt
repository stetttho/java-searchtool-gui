 What defines spousal abuse?  Infidelity? Verbal Assault? Physical Battery?  These issues are explored in Nancey Flowers newest novel "Shattered Vessels."  Ms. Flowers enthralls the reader into the lives of India, Wanita, and Sandy, all apparently intelligent women whose lives are somehow strained by abusive relationships.   The novel is more than a commentary on domestic violence; readers are drawn into some very disturbing situations and at times will find themselves uncomfortable, wondering, "What would I do?"  Ms. Flowers does an excellent job tackling a very serious subject.  "Shattered Vessels" will be long celebrated as a story of triumph over one of societies greatest flaws, Domestic Violence.
