 Victor McGlothin has shown us that his great writing is not a fluke!  Autumn Leaves is the second McGlothin novel that I have read, and it is a good story with a lot of different angles.  It tells a story about love,  friendship, betrayal, and the main focus the aids virus.  I recommend it  highly.
