 One more thing- Micheal Stipe's lyrics, usually inaudible or cryptic or both, are actually relatively straightforward this time around. One exception is "Orange Crush"- I didn't realize what that one was about until someone told me it was about Agent Orange. Once I knew, it made sense(?) Still, it doesn't seem to be the most effective possible critique of the use of Agent Orange, although "Follow me/don't follow me" and "We are agents of the free" are good lines. My favourite lyrics on this album are "You are the Everything", and "The Wrong Child"- not terribly ambiguous, but very evocative. The fact that they are both vignettes from childhood might partly explain their power and appeal.
