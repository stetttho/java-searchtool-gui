 This is NOT "The Clash" as it came out in England- deemed "too crude" for America, that version was available only as an import until recently. But this version, released in 1979 is still an excellent, raw, loud, yet often melodic album, and a great depiction of the Clash as an unarguably punk band. I'm not surprised CBS released "Remote Control" as a single, since it's quite catchy- the Clash however objected to its release as a single, as Joe Strummer yells on "Complete Control", the song that follows "Remote Control" on this album. "Complete Control" is also really melodic- and it was produced by legendary reggae producer Lee "Scratch" Perry- not that it shows really. "Clash City Rockers" is also great, although it sounds rather a lot like the Who's "I Can't Explain". Other highlights include "Carrear Opportunities","I Fought the Law", "Janie Jones" and "White Man in Hammersmith Palais", which features a reggae rhythm. These songs are great to sing along to (if you can make out what Strummer is singing)
