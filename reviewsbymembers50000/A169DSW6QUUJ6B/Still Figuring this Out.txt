 Maybe I'll like this album better after a few listens, but a lot of the stuff on it I just don't get. I do really like "Rock the Casbah", but I already knew that one. It's good to be able to play it now though. "Should I Stay or Should I Go" is actually not as annoying as I first thought- it has a sort of crude rock'n'roll charm to it. This album is disappointing when compared with albums like "The Clash" and "London Calling", but then those are tough acts for any band to follow.
