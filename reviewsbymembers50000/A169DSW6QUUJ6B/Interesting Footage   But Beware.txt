 This video basically consists of two Pink Floyd jams recorded in January of 1967, over footage from the recording session as well as various psychedelic happenings in London in 1966 and 1967.  There is visual footage of the Floyd playing at UFO, but disappointingly no audio footage. It's good enough, but since I already had the two Floyd tracks on CD and I had seen footage of "Underground" London before it was not a great revelation. What annoyed me, though, was that although this video was sold from a U.S. web site, it was not formatted to play on North American video players. In fact, this is imported from the UK, something which is not apparent from the product description. Therefore, if you buy this, be prepared to spend additional funds getting this video transferred to the North American video format, as I did.
