 As the Amazon.com reviewer said, it is hard to overrate this material. But let me try. Ah, now this is stuff to set your toes tapping, your feet moving across the floor, your arms waving about in the air- you may look a tad eccentric (to be kind) but who cares when you've got music like this playing? These aren't antiquated pieces meant for ponderous historical analysis and the museum, these are filled with life and the joy that Louis Armstrong could communicate by his trumpet playing and his unique singing. Yes, this music makes me feel alive! Quite an achievement as I've been dead for seventy-two years. I understand that during that time musical tastes have changed somewhat. Some would say "evolved". Well, why not? But although this music sounds thouroughly of its time (this was the time when jazz as an improvisatory art form was born), it is also, to invoke yet another cliche, timeless.
