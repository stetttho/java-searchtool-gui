 This was a transitional album for REM- not only were they making the change from indie-label artists (with IRS) to major label artists, but they were also in the process of changing their sound. For the first time, we hear mandolin as the lead instrument on the songs "You Are the Everything", "The Wrong Child", and "Hairshirt"- three of the album's best and most poignant songs. In the midst of all this change, however, we end up with a rather uneven album- some great songs, some pretty good songs, and a couple that are not so good. "Document" had been a hard rocking, sometimes harsh sounding album. Here they maintained some of the high noise level while adding on some catchy hooks and pretty harmonies on "Bubble gum heavy metal" songs like "Get Up" (the first REM song with clear Beach Boys influence, plus music boxes for a bridge!), "Orange Crush" (a great rocking tune, sounds a bit like U2) and, less interestingly, "I Rembember California". The album ends on an upbeat note with an untitled song which is quite catchy.
