 Pink Floyd, or "The Pink Floyd" as they were then known, first made a name for themselves by with their freaky, far out, free form improvisations of electronic music. The closest thing you get to that on "Piper at the Gates of Dawn" is "Interstellar Overdrive", however even that consists of two performances, one overdubbed on the other. Here you get a better sense of what they must have sounded like live. It may take some getting used to, however if you like the version of "Interstellar Overdrive" on "Piper", you'll probably also like this version- cut live and without overdubs and running sixteen minutes long. "Nick's Boogie" I find is not quite as interesting- more a series of effects than a musical mystery tour like "Interstellar Overdrive". While this type of music made Pink Floyd popular at London psychedelic clubs such as UFO, it was not going to result in hit singles or even hit albums in all likelihood. As it happened, Syd Barrett, whose unpredictable effects-laden guitar playing led the Floyd along their improvisations, also had a knack for writing catchy psychedelic ditties of the sort that defined Floyd's first singles and most of the album "Piper at the Gates of Dawn". However that album and their hit singles bore so little relation to what they tended to do live that when they toured the UK in 1967, most audiences were utterly unprepared for, and appalled by, what they heard. So it's not surprising that these tracks weren't released at the time. Still, it's good that they were recorded and that we can hear them now and enjoy the Pink Floyd at their most far out and experimental.
