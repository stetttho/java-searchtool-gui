 When I heard, back in '87, that George Harrison was releasing a new album, I was skeptical, since the recent track record of ex-Beatles albums were spotty at best. Was in for a surprise when I bought it though! The thing that attracted me about the album (and I think this was largely co-producer Jeff Lynne's doing)was that it sounded both of its time (the late '80s, with all the synthesisers) and of another time (the late '60s). And Harrison had some great songs too. Standouts include "Just For Today" (I believe Elton John was on piano for that track), a hushed, emotional piece; "Someplace Else", another emortional piece with powerful slide playing by Harrison "This is Love", which features more beatiful slide playing by him and expressed the sunnier side of his worldview (for the darker side, tune in to "The Devil's Radio", a full blooded rocker augumented by Eric Clapton if I'm not mistaken); and "The Wreck of Hespherus", a rocker on which Harrison cheerfully admits he's getting older but he can still "rock as good as Gibralter".Why then, one wonders, did he not release any albums after this? We waited so long, George- and now you're gone. Rest in peace.
