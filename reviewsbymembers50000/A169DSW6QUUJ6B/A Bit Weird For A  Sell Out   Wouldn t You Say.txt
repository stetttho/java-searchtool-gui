 Three-and-a-half stars, actually....This is a flawed album...but not because it's a 'sell-out'. This album is best known for its two hit singles- "Rock the Casbah", and "Should I Stay or Should I Go"- the latter a rather obviously simple, cliched song but fun for all that- and "Rock the Casbah" is better. This isn't t6hat much of a departure- The Clash always made pop songs- even if many of them were political pop songs executed in a somewhat harsh, raw manner. But anyway, because of these singles, and the fact that this is the only Clash record to make the US Top 10, this is widely called their 'sellout album'. And there are a couple of other tracks that sound 'commercial', I suppose- like "Overpowered by Funk"- not one of their best to be sure. But many of these tracks- like "Red Angel Dragnet" and "Death is a Star"- are pretty weird. I'm getting into them more now. The Clash here don't sound much like the early Clash, apart from the first two tracks. Think a sort of electro-funk with surf-guitar, interspersed with strange droning tracks, some with spoken word vocals. Clearly their expiriments with different styles were continuing.
