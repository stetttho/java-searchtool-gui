 The sound of this album is very similar to`Shoot Out the Lights`, only now Thompson has added a brass band and other zydeco touches. The songs are generally top-notch, and while many deliver the gloom and/or vitriol we`ve come to expect from Thompson, there a couple of lighter moments, including `Two Left Feet`. Like on `Shoot out the Lights`, the electric guitar playing is mesmerising. This was his last great album with producer Joe Boyd- the next, ?cross a Crowded Room` has its moments, but it also has less enjoyable moments. And, for those who for whatever reason hate Michell Froom`s production work on later RT albums, the production style here will likely be more to their liking.
