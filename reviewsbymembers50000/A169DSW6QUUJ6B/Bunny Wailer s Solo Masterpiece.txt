 When people think of the Wailers, they tend to think of Bob Marley. Hell, when they think of reggae music they tend to think of Marley. But here fellow foundation Wailer Bunny Wailer (aka Neville Livingston) shows that he too was a songwriter of note. Many of these songs had been done before by Bunny and the Wailers: "Dreamland", on which fellow Wailers Peter Tosh and Bob Marley lend backing vocals, is the most perfectly realized version of a song first recorded at Studio One in 1966, when Bunny first got a chance to shine with Marley away for a few months with his mother in the States, and also recorded with Lee "Scratch" Perry in 1971; "This Train"-  also recorded by the Wailers ten years before but again, is beautifully realized here; and "Reincarnated Souls", which was originally to be the title song of what became the Wailers' "Burnin'" album. "Blackheart Man", "Bide Up" and "Fig Tree" are also highlights- although there really isn't a bad song on this. Among the Wailers' recordings, only the Lee Perry- produced Wailers recordings and Marley's "Natty Dread" rival this for near perfection.
