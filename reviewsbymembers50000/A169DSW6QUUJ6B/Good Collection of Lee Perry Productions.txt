 When I saw this in the store, I was intrigued because it contained a number of tracks that I'd read about in the liner notes of other Lee Perry collections, but didn't actually appear on these collections. Songs like "Return of Django" (Perry and the Upstters' first big international hit), and Junior Byles' "Place Called Africa" and "Beat Down Babylon". Also noteworthy is a Junior Murvin song that doesn't appear on his "Police and Thieves" album. The sound quality is a bit disappointing though-- at least one of the tracks seems to be have mastered off a faded, dusty vinyl copy! Also, do we really need another collection with Bob Marley and the Wailers' "Duppy Conquerer" and "Small Axe" on them (great though those songs are). Still, there's a lot to treasure here, although fans of Perry's more bizarre effects laden stuff might be disappointed.
