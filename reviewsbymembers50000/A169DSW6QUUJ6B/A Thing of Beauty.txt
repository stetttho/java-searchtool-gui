 The first sound you hear on this disc is George saying "Give me plenty of that guitar", and very prominent indeedj is Harrison's wonderful guitar playing, especially his slide playing. Although there a couple of fairly pedestrian songs here, most are excellent, allowing his guitar to soar. Highlights include the sprightly "Any Road" (which sounds like a Travelling Wilburys song) and his wonderful uke-driven version of "Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea"; and the majestic "Rising Sun" and the transcendent instrumental "Marwa Blues", in which he out-does David Gilmour and Pink Floyd. "Struck Inside A Cloud" is a sad song that holds out hope in its sheer beauty. The album closes with the title song, which decries the materialism and status-seeking of the world and presents God as the way out of that mess- it's a rocking song that turns into Indian music and finally into a Hindu chant-it's similar in many ways to his earlier song "Living in the Material World". This may be George's best album, although it's hard to top "All Things Must Pass". It does surpass his last, fine album "Cloud Nine" though- although it's nowhere near as commercial.
