 First the sad ending. Syd Barrett was going to pieces, and was replaced by David Gilmour in Pink Floyd while this album was being made. His "Jugband Blues" ends the album, and it is as mad is its creator was- at turns disconnected ("And I'm grateful to you for making it clear that I'm not here"..."and I'm wondering who could be writing this song") exuberant (the brass middle bit), then fractured and confusing, and finally sad as Syd, accompanied by his own accoustic guitar, sings "And what exactly is a dream? And what exactly is a joke?"  Syd is also featured on slide guitar in Rick Wright's "Remember a Day", which was recorded during the "Piper at the Gates of Dawn" sessions, and he contributed some guitar work on a couple of other tracks, but most of the rest of "Saucerful" shows the new post-Syd Floyd trying to get by without him. Rather a tall order, one might think, since up to the time of his departure from the Floyd Syd had written most of their material. However, Rick Wright contributes a couple of songs here- the aforementioned "Remember A Day" and "See Saw"- which are nice, hazy songs (although their composer later said he thought them an embarrassment, and their lyrics do leave a lot to be desired). Roger Waters contributes three, including the standout "Let there Be More Light" with a blistering Dave Gilmour guitar solo at the end, "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun" (which is OK but nothing special) and "Corporal Clegg", which is a pretty good novelty number featuring kazoos in the chorus! The long instrumental suite that starts side 2, "A Saucerful of Secrets", is mostly dull or annoying noise to me (and is the main reason why this album gets only three stars), although the fine organ-led "requiem" at the end does partially redeem it. The live version on "Ummagumma" is far superior though! Finally, I do really love the cover art- the first album cover by Hipgnosis I believe!
