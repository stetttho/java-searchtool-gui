 First, a confession- I only began following REM after "Losing My Religion" and "Out of Time" catapulted REM to international stardom. I did get their "Eponomynous" compilation to sample their earlier fare (the beautiful "Talk About the Passion" represents "Murmur" on that album), but it was not until I lived briefly in Bangkok where I could get cassettes for cheap that I bought all the earlier REM albums. Like many good albums, I failed to appreciate it on the first listen, but gradually I came to love it.  REM's first recordings "Radio Free Europe", and the EP "Chronic Town" indicated that here was a band that was fairly straightforward and rocking (though not very loudly, and with jangly rather than noisy guitars) in its musical approach (its lyrical and vocal approach being more obfuscatory). However this is not the case for the band's first LP, "Murmur", which is a rather textured album, with its layered guitar tracks and pianos. Although "Radio Free Europe" is an uptempo number, we then have moody (but wonderfully moody) songs like "Pilgrimage" ("Pilgramage has gained momentum") that suddenly lurch into memorable choruses and "Perfect Circle",one of my favorite REM songs, even though the lyrics provide only hazy pictures to hint at what the song might be about. "Catapult" is another uptempo number- it's good enough but not one of the album's gems. Better are "Shaking Through" (nice harmonies and jangly guitars), and the moody "9-9". "West of the Fields" is a good closer but again it doesn't move me like some of the other songs here do. Still, a very good album, well worth buying.
