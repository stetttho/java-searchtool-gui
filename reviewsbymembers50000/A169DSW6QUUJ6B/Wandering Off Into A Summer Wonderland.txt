 I've been a fan of REM since 1991, and I like all their albums. However, this album is quite unlike other, "classic" REM albums such as "Life's Rich Pageant", "Out of Time" and "Automatic for the People". Who would have thought from listening to those albums that REM would come up with an album with clear Brian Wilson influences? Listen to tracks like "Summer Turns to High" and "Beach Ball" in particular and you'll see what I mean. While the songcraft that makes REM great remains, it takes on new forms here, forms that may not be pleasing to all fans of the "old" REM. Like its predecessor "Up", "Reveal" sees REM using synthesisers to colour the songs to an extent not heard on earlier REM albums. Unlike "Up", it does not have any almost Floyd-like atmospheric tracks like "Suspicion" , "You're In the Air" and "Parakeet". Instead it features songs that soar, like "The Lifting" and "I've Been High", gentle bittersweet songs like "She Just Wants to Be" and "I'll Take the Rain", and gently disturbing songs like "Disappear" and "Saturn Return". The song here most reminiscent of earlier REM is "Imitation of Life" . I found "Reveal"to be a great summer album in the summer of 2001. During heat waves I loved listening to "Summer Turns to High" with its lines "Mercury is rising still/set the fan on high".
