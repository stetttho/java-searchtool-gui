 "Underwater Moonlight" is album where the Soft Boys finally got it right- and brilliantly so. Although the loud guitar attack that starts out "I Want to Destroy You" may initially suggest punk or at least "new wave", the issue is complicated by the cleverness of Kimberly Rew's guitar playing and of the vocal harmonies- and by Robyn Hitchcock's songs. Although Hitchcock may have shared some of the punks' views about the state of the world, that shows clearly only on "I Want to Destroy You", and more obliquely on some of the others. Generally, though Hitchcock sings about what he's been singing about ever since- bizarre forms of life in nature as well as more mundane ones, like prawns, and how the ickiness of life oozes through our human relationships (thesis statement anyone?). Hitchcock's musical influences include Syd Barrett's Pink Floyd and the Beatles, as well as British folk rock from the end of '60s on, so for example we are treated to sound of a sitar in "Positive Vibrations", and in fact the music, for all the loudness of the duelling electric guitars, is more aptly described as "retrodelic"  (Hitchcock's word) than as anything approaching punk. The original 10 tracks of the album are great, and the 9 "outtakes" are almost as good, including a cover of Syd Barrett's "Vegetable Man" (the original being available only on bootleg), and a "new" "outtake" track not available on the previous Ryko issue, the catchy "He's a Reptile".  The second disk is of, for the most part, more historical interest than musical interest, however songs like "Alien" and "Wang Dang Pig" are actually good songs that never made it out of rehearsal, showing that Hitchcock was on something of a songwriting roll in 1979-80.
