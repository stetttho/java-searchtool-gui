 This album has a more earthy feel than its predecessor, "Catch a Fire", which had many lead guitar, keyboards and synthesiser overdubs added in England to make it more "listener friendly" for the American and British rock audiences. I really like the sound of "Burnin'", especially the early-seventies wah-wah guitar that was probably played by Peter Tosh. Although the album is famous for the Bob Marley song "I Shot the Sheriff", this is actually credited to the Wailers rather than to "Bob Marley and the Wailers", likely at the insistence of the two other "foundation" Wailers, Neville (Bunny) Livingston and Peter Tosh. And indeed, this album showcases the songwriting talents of all three. Two of my favourite songs on it ("Hallelujah Time" and "Pass it On" were written not by Marley but by Livingston (though credited to "Jean Watt"). Peter Tosh, meanwhile, not only co-wrote the rousing call-to-arms "Get Up, Stand Up", which starts off the album, but also wrote and sang the fine "One Foundation". Marley's songs do still dominate the album (which ends with a wonderful rendition of the traditional rasta hymn "Rastaman Chant"), and it seems that all the songs recorded but left off the album (and now included on the new "expanded" album) were Tosh and Livingston compositions- could this have had something to do with their subsequent departure from the Wailers? Anyway, Marley's compositions include not only the aforementioned "I Shot the Sheriff" and the incendiary "Burnin' and Lootin'", but also some remakes of earlier songs (e.g. "Put it On"; "Small Axe"; "Duppy Conquerer") that aren't nearly as good as the earlier, Lee Perry produced versions (although the sound quality is better here).
