 Originally I got to know this album because my brother bought it, mainly to hear the Soft Boys' version of Syd Barret's "Vegetable Man" (the original is available only in bootleg form). "Underwater Moonlight" was the album on which the songwriting talent of Robyn Hitchcock came to fruition, producing not only the incredible songs on the album itself, and the outtakes, but also even some of the songs that never made it out of rehearsal but are contained on the second disk "...And How it Got There". Songs like "Alien" and Wang Dang Pig" show Hitchcock was on a songwriting roll in late '79 - early '80. Another revelation was the fun and catchy "He's A Reptile", which wasn't on the earlier CD version. It's too bad the Soft Boys broke up after this album- though on the other hand if they had stayed together, Hitchcock wouldn't have gone on to produce albums like the sublime (but very differant) "I Often Dream of Trains".
