 In my view, though Peter Tosh composed some great songs, they don't seem to be captured well enough on his studio recordings, even "Equal Rights". When I want to enjoy Tosh at his best, I turn to "Captured Live" and to this recording. Instrumentally, this is simply amazing- great songs performed by a great band. The only slighty weak point here is the vocals- Tosh's own vocals are quite good, but the backing vocals don't match the harmonies of the Wailers (before or after Tosh's departure).
