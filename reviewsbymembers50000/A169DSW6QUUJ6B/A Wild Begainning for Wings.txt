 This album introduces Paul McCartney's band Wings, which would go on to be a multiplatinum selling, stadium filling act by 1976. Their begainnings  were considerably more modest- they started out by taking a pickup truck, literally 'going on the road', and finding a place to play at every town. This, their debut album, is likewise a modest undertaking in comparison with later Wings albums, and also in comparison with "Imagine", a John Lennon album released around the same time. It was also a modest seller, and is considered by many to be one of McCartney's worst albums. It does sound rather hastily put together, and they perhaps went into the studio too quickly. It seems as though McCartney had a shortage of good songs at the time- on the original album there are only six, plus one quasi-reggae cover and one, "Bip Bop", that is very dull indeed- one of the worst McCartney songs I've ever heard. (However, the short instrumental interlude that's said to be based on 'Bip Bop' is fine.)  That said, what you get here that you don't get in better known, better loved McCartney  and Wings albums is the sound of a band just getting together and playing. The playing and singing isn't perfect, but it's mostly great to listen to nonetheless. The raving  opener "Mumbo Jumbo" features some vintage McCartney screams, while "Wild Life" is an enigmatic slow jam melancholy blues of a waltz. "Some People Never Know", "Tommorrow" and "Dear Friend" are just lovely.
