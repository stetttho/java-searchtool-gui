 I bought this album in 1991, mainly because "Losing My Religion" was on the radio, and not only was it a radio hit, it was actually a great song! I liked the album from the first, although there were parts (like "Endgame","Belong" and "Texarkana") where the vocals and/or strings seemed a bit overly sweet to me. But I like them now. But I've never really warmed much to "Me in Honey". Not that it's bad, but it's not very interesting, musically. But although "Shiny Happy People"'s lyrics may be off-putting to some, they're nice enough to me, and it sure is catchy. Better though are "Low", with its moody organ, and "Half a World Away" a harpsichord-driven number that is simply one of REM's best. I have also grown to love "Near Wild Heaven". "Country Feedback" is a great track too, with more moody organ and loud guitar making a fine backdrop to the exasperated lyrics.
