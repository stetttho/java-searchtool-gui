 Make no mistake about it, this album has some great songs on it, however there are a couple that I just don't like at all. Those are "Lightnin' Hopkins" and "Oddfellows Local 151", in which REM take their desire to do hard, harsh, brash rock just a little too far (where are the tunes for one thing?). But I just skip over those songs now. The best known songs "The One I Love" (who's cooly described as "a simple prop to occupy my time" if I hear Stipe correctly); "It's the End the World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine)" (a rapid-fire stream of consciousness list of names and phrases culminating in the song title, with great guitar playing to boot); and "Finest Worksong" (a rousing, hard rocking call to arms) are all good, but then there are also lesser known gems like "Welcome to the Occupation" and the great cutting political march "Exuming McCarthy"; the fun "Strange" and, for a bit of relatively quiet beauty amidst the clamour (unfortunately sandwiched between the two songs on this album I don't care for)you get "King of Birds". Alright, make it three and three quarters stars then.
