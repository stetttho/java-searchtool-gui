 For this album, the renowned psychedelic band the Grateful Dead took some country, some folk, a bit of blues, and fashioned some great tunes. Its execution is fairly laid back, which is typical of the group, but less typical are the consciseness of the tracks. I'm not a great fan of the Dead, but I really do like this album.
