 It took me a while to really like this album, but after a few plays I got hooked. Why? Well, this albums has classics like "Try Not to Breathe", "The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite", "Everybody Hurts", "Sweetness follows" (which for some reason reminds of Joni Mitchell's "Both Sides Now", but is much more, well, selpulchral), "Monty Got a Raw Deal", "Man on the Moon"- and then to cap it all, the gorgeous "Nightswimming" and "Find the River"). Also, "Ignoreland" is a good rockin' rant, although I can't make out all the words, "Drive" is a song that starts and ends quietly but builds up to powerful climaxes along the way, aided by the strings- the string arrangements, by the way, are exquisite. A lot of these songs feature organ, which I like a lot. I even got used to Peter Buck's feedback solos after a while. To me, this is the classic REM album- although in my opinion they have yet to release a bad album. This is also one of my favourite albums, period.
