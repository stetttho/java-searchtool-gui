 While in parts this album sounds "Floydian", David Gilmour here actually resists the temptation to "sound like Floyd" and allows his own talents, including the melodicism and the musicianship he brought to Pink Floyd, to shine in this solo effort. Actually after a few listens I find this to be almost as good as "classic" Floyd albums such as "Animals" and "The Wall"- and although it is not as ambitious or as literate as those works, it is also more instantly accessible and enjoyable. Even the much maligned "Blue Light" is decent, while songs like "Murder" and "Love on the Air" have great melodies and great guitar solos too. This album is also better than the records "his" Pink Floyd lineup would subsequently record. While Gilmour certainly contibuted much to the Floyd and shows it well here, he seems to do better when not trying to do his version of a Floyd record. Unfortunately, since this record does not appear under the "Pink Floyd" label, it was (and is) overlooked.
