 Actually, it is not quite true to state that "This was where it all started for Burning Spear"- Burning Spear actually started recording for Studio One some years before. But this probably was the first Burning Spear album, and the first time Burning Spear's music was widely heard outside Jamaica (I'm guessing). I first heard this CD playing in a store- by that time it had reached the "Garvey's Ghost" part. I was impressed by the quality of the music. Later on, after I bought it, I still liked the "Garvey's Ghost" album a lot but the vocals took time to grow on me. These are not clever reggae pop tunes like those crafted by Bob Marley and for this reason are probably not as easily accessible as Marley's songs, but if you really like reggae I believe repeated listening will reveal the glory of these tracks.
