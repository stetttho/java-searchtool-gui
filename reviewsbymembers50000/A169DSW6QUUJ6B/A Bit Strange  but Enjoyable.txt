 My first introduction to the songs of John Entwistle, like for most, was through his Who songs. Songs like "Boris the Spider", "Whiskey Man", "Silas Stingy" and "My Wife" showed his dark sense of humour, his ability to make the bass the lead instrument, and his ability in not only creating but also playing horn arrangements. These attributes are also evident in the solo offerings showcased here. We also see how much Entwhistle contributed to the Who's assault- even though he stood aside while the others smashed things on stage. I actually don't miss the Who that much when I hear these tracks, because so much of the Who's approach is there. Most of the tracks are quite good, although the quality begins to drop off towards the end. Actually, 12 of the 18 songs (and those 12 are the best ones) come from just two albums, released in 1971 and 1972 respectively. Makes you wonder why his songwriting energy flagged after that initial burst of creativity, and he decided to write strange pastiches of '50s rock songs in '73 and '75, then Entwistle fans had to wait until '81 and '86 for further albums. The highlights here include "What are We Doing Here", in which Entwistle reminds me of Pete Townshend singing a sad accoustic number, "You're Mine" (a rather haunting song), and "Who Cares?", a rollicking celebration of irresponsibility. All in all, if you like what Entwistle brought to the Who, and appreciate his Who songs, you'll probably like this. If you already own his first two solo albums, you have to ask yourself whether it's worth it to get six more songs which aren't as good as the songs from those two albums.
