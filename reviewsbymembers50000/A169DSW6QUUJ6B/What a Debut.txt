 WARNING: This is definately NOT the mid-to-late seventies model Pink Floyd that so many of us have come to know (and in some cases, love), although there are some similarities in terms of the instrumental styles- the droning organ, the bass, elements of the guitar style and so on.  The main differance here is Syd Barrett. He wrote or co-wrote all but one of the tracks on this album, and is lead vocalist and lead guitarist. He even dominates Roger Waters' "Take Up Thy Stethescope and Walk" with his wild guitar playing.  When I first heard this album, I had already bought "Relics", which was my introduction to the pre-Dark Side Floyd. I had loved the Syd-penned singles "Arnold Layne" and "See Emily Play", as well as "Bike", which ends this album, and I had even gotten used to "Interstellar Overdrive", a long unstructured psychedelic jam. Still, I wasn't fully prepared for this album. Much of it seemed strange and discordant at first listen. But it soon grew on me and today it is still one of my favourite albums. The songs and the psychedelic effects are just magical to me. "Bike" in particular is a wonderful nursery-rhyme song with great sound effects. How tragic though that the drug use that inspired much of this musical magic wreaked such havoc with Syd Barret's psyche. Months after this album was released Barret was kicked out of the band because his psychological condition had made him impossible to work with. Those who like this album may also want to check out Barrett's solo albums, for although those albums are quite different from this one (being far rougher and more basic in their arrangements and execution), they too show his songwriting genius.
