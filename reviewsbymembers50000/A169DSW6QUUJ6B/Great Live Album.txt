 I often have a problem with live concert albums by rock bands. Generally, they are done before large audiences that tend to be somewhat noisy, so the bands tend to go for the obvious and the loud rather than the subtle, and playing often sounds sloppy compared to what is achieved in the studio. In this case however, we have the Who- certainly, in 1970, in contention for the title of the world's greatest rock'n'roll band- and probably the best live act. The assault of the rhythm section- Keith Moon on drums on John Entwistle on bass, combined with Townsend's loud guitar riffing and soloing and Daltry's bluesy yawp- all made the Who a force to be reckoned with.  Along with the loudly obvious, the Who actually go for the subtle too here.  Not only do they play rockers like "Heaven and Hell" (a concert opener at the time, written by John Entwistle), "Young Man Blues", and "My Generation", but we also hear "Tatoo", one of the highlights of the "Who Sells Out", the high harmonies of "I'm a Boy", and a rendition of the "mini-opera" "A Quick One While He's Away" that far surpasses the original.  All in all an enjoyable album, best played loud.
