 After the the relatively quiet strums and hums of their previous two albums, including their masterpiece "Automatic for the People", REM opts for loud fuzz, bang, and clatter. Even so, amidst the noise the sublime melodies and harmonies that make "Automatic" such a pleasure to listen to somehow crop up here as well. Even the loud "Let Me In" has a beautiful organ background. "Star 69" is simply a great rock song. "King of Comedy" has a great melody and hooks, and it rocks. "Crush With Eyeliner" is a funny song, with Stipe declaring "I'm In-fat-u-ated"! and "I'm the real thing". The one quiet song on the album, "Tongue", seems like a takeoff on Smokey Robinson, but it's great- Micheal Stipe sings falsetto, and I'm just in-fat-u-ated by that organ sound!
