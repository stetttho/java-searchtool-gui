 "Natty Dread" was the first album of the revamped Bob Marley and the Wailers following the departure of foundation Wailers Peter Tosh and Bunny "Wailer" Livingston. It is also to my mind the best of the Wailers albums (although to be fair I haven't heard all of "Exodus") but while Marley would go on to write classic songs like "Jammin'", "Waiting in Vain" and "Redemption Song", I don't think any of his subsequent albums equal this- they're good but just a bit too polished and slick. This reggae, on the other hand, rocks hard, especially on "Them Belly Full (But We Hungry); "Talking Blues", "Rebel Music", "So Jah Seh", "Revolution", and the cover tune. The album kicks off in style with a glorious remake of the 1971 Wailers hit (in Jamaica) "Lively Up Yourself", and also includes a fine remake of their 1966 song "Bend Down Low". And, of course, this album also has the touching "No Woman No Cry", although I prefer the live version that appears on "Legend".
