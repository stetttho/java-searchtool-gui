 As a fan of Monty Python, Beyond the Fringe, and Peter Cook, I enjoyed this tape, although one wishes the sound and picture quality were better. Among other things, you get Cook cast as a mass, mass murderer in a sketch that is a combination of differant Monty Python TV sketches, you get to see John Cleese and Micheal corpsing as they do the Dead Parrot sketch, and you see Cook doing his miner monologue and later on talking to a very disinterested man who's trying to read his newspaper about subjects such as intestines. Not being a Dame Edna fan I don't particularly like "her" bit. But this is a minor complaint. What really annoys me is the editing. Most of the skits are truncated, as we are switched from what's going on on stage to what's happening behind the scenes. While some of the behind the scenes stuff is interesting, it interrupts the flow of the onstage comedy.
