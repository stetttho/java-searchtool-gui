 "Armed Forces" was the album that threatened to his breakthrough to massive commercial success- the ABBA-influenced "Oliver's Army" just screamed 'hit single' and if that wasn't enough, there were other classic tunes such as the incredibly melodic "Accidents Will Happen" and Nick Lowe's song "What's So Funny 'Bout Peace Love and Understanding". Most of the album, in fact, marries the then trendy 'New Wave' style with Costello's pop songcraft in such a way as to transcend that musical style. If "This Year's Model" was Costello's 'rythm record' of the era, then this was his 'melody record'. But while the album did- just-reach the US top 10, Costello's drunken taunts about Ray Charles one night during a slanging match with Stephen Stills resulted in his American record company backing off promotion of the album. I should note here that I don't yet have the CD reissue, though I hope to get it at one point. However, another review has noted an apparent 'skip' (repeating the word 'action') in the middle of the song "Chemistry Class". Whatever flaw this is, it's not a manufacturing flaw of the CD, because my used vinyl copy also has it. In fact, up to the time I read his review, I had thought it was a manufacturing defect of the record. Perhaps it is a flaw of the source copy of the recording used earlier to master the record and more recently to master the CD.
