 This album sounds somewhat like vintage mid-'70s (pre-Animals) Floyd. This time Wright and Mason were there as musical particpants from the start, and Wright composed music for a Floyd album for the first time in nearly 20 years, and Wright's influence in particular helps make this a far more pleasurable listening experience than the previous Floyd album, "A Momentary Lapse of Reason". That said, most of the songs here are rather pedestrian, redeemed mainly by the Floydian arrangements, and the bite of Roger Waters' lyrics and album concepts is certainly missed. When this came out, a reviewer called it "Lite Side of the Moon", and while this album is pleasant to listen to I think that is not an inaccurate description. Still, I bought it and like it well enough.
