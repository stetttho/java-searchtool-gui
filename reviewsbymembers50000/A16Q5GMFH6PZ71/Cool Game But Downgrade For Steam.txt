 I don't really have to much to add to what has already been said about this game. The graphics are the best I have ever seen in a game. Water ripples, shadows, dappled sunlight incredible. As others have mentioned if you are running an older system you may experience lag or have to run the game at below optimal settings to play it. The game has alot of fun features in it as well. I really loved crashing, er I mean driving, the dune buggy. Game play is somewhat linear and the story is just kind of a backdrop for killing zombies and blowing stuff up. Yeah, I thought the ending was anticlimatic too and it doesn't provide any closure except that there will probably be a Half Life 3. Then again Half Life for me isin't really about the story. I find old games like the Thief series and Deus Ex more character immersive by comparison. This game is alot of fun though and that expensive graphics card finally has to earn its keep. What I did want to add by writing a review is my objection to the Steam concept/component of this game. It not only made installation a hassle but it felt irritating and invasive. I was annoyed that nothing was mentioned about this in the description of the product. A few times when I played something glitched with the Steam registration and I had to reregister. It bothers me enough that now that I know this trend is out there I will be more aware of it in the future and avoid by games that employ this technology. Oh, and thanks to the reviewers who mentioned Far Cry, I will be checking it out.
