 This actually more of a comedy than horror flick, albeit dark comedy. I think that is an important point for first time viewers to know, I could see being disappointed if you expected to be scared or feel in suspense when watching it. With that caveat though, it is indeed a very gory comedy. Still, I can't imagine anyone who has seen more than a couple horror films being too overly grossed out. The gore is so over the top and campy. By the end we were rolling our eyes at the fake blood. I could imagine the guys standing just off camera hurling the buckets of fake blood everywhere. It is just so ridiculous I can't imagine getting too nauseated by it or at all frightened. It reminds me of the blood and violence of the Kill Bill movies. Some of the scenes did get me in a gross out sort of way. The ear in the soup at the dinner table and when the mother ate the nurse's dog are two scenes that come to mind. Even then though it was a laughing at the same time we were exclaiming, "Oh, that is so gross!" kind of reaction. It is these moments that Peter Jackson's and Fran Walsh's creativity shines and it is these moments that make this movie a zombie gem. If you have seen Evil Dead and enjoyed that then this movie might be one you would like to check out as well.
