 This is an entertaining card game for two players. A fair amount of strategy can be employed in how the players use their infuence cards. The object is to control more political allies than your opponent. You can play two influence cards face up for your opponent to see or one face down per turn. Obviously keeping your opponent uncertain about your strength is important and faking them out comes into play as well. A philosopher card can also throw the results into turmoil when it is deployed. Strategy also comes into play through the use of action cards whose order and when to use is controlled by the player. The game is somewhat complicated to explain briefly and our first two or three times playing was learning the rules but after those first few games play became smooth. The game is perfect for when you want to play something that doesn't take too long. Our longest game has been about 40 minutes. The game doesn't teach you anything about the time period other than the titles of some of the political members/players of the time period so if that is what you are looking for this is the wrong item. The illustrations on the cards are very well done though and lend an element of atmosphere of the period to the game.
