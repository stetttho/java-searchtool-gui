 I bought this book as something fun and interactive to do with my husband. I give it two stars because it is something to get you talking and discussing feelings and opinions even if you disagree with the book. That beats just sitting on the couch watching tv. Otherwise though we both felt this book wasn't very revealing and often missed the mark for us entirely. For example, in one question it asks you to describe how you would feel standing in the open door of a flying airplane getting ready to parachute for the first time. In the answer section it says your response indicates how you feel when you are about to have sex with someone for the first time. Okay, how many people wouldn't answer that question with words like nervous anticipation or exhilaration? Both of us did at any rate. Not very revealing. My friend said terrified because she is afraid of heights but she completely rejected the idea that she experiences terror at the prospect of sex. I would imagine alot of people might describe themselves as being fearful of parchuting out of an airplane but not necessarily be quaking with fear in bed.     There were also a lot of questions that seemed to be geared to tapping into your subconcious feelings but for us concrete life experience seemed to skew the results. For instance, in one scenerio you are suppose to be searching for gems and it asks you to describe the size and type of gem you searched for. The answer key says the gem you described is a symbol of your sense of self worth. My husband had described a small not very valuable type of mineral but only because the question brought back happy memories of looking for this on hikes with his father as a child. We both felt that this sort of thing came up rather often for us.
