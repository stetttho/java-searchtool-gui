 If you are planning a SCUBA diving trip to the Maldives I would recommend this book for some useful information and eye candy in preparing an amazing underwater experience. I also recommend it because the photographs have been taken since the El Nino damage to the reefs so they portray a realistic view of what you will encounter. While the reef damage is unfortunate and visible, the Maldives are still an amazing for the variety of life that you can experience; whale sharks, mantas, hammerheads, napoleon fish, etc... can all be found in various location in the Maldives. Once, in the Maldives though, I would rely on the advice of the locals and the local dive shops. These people know which sites are best under the current conditions and where the sorts of things you would like to experience are to be found at that moment. So the book is not really a necessity, more something to wet your appetite for the trip. My experience included diving with a whale shark, being surrounded by giant mantas that swam in circles around me, seeing many sharks, and a very friendly sea turtle that seemed to think my camera might be an edible treat!
