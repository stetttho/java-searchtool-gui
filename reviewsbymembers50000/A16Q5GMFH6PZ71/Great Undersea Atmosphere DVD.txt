 I own a few background/atmosphere type DVDs and this one is the one I reach for the most. After watching it straight through for a couple of times I enjoy it now in the background when I am cooking or sometimes reading. It is not a movie, no plot, dialog, etc.. For me it brings back pleasant memories of diving vacations and the accompanying music is very pleasant and light. The music to me fits beautifully with the amazing and professional underwater footage. There is a great variety of undersea life depicted in the footage and you can choose to watch with subtitles that identify what you are seeing. The DVD can also be played straight through, on continuous loop, or by selecting individual segments. I especially love the segments with the dolphins surfing and the sea lions playing, I find it hard to be in a bad mood when watching these segments.
