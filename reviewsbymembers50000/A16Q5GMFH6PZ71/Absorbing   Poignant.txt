 This movie transported me to another time and culture. I felt as though I were an invisible presence given the priveledge of observing the lives and events portrayed in the movie. Iguchi's quiet and modest heroism in loving and caring for his family and living with dignity and honor despite what hardships life threw at him were inspirational and moving. Don't watch this expecting an action movie though. The movie is paced slowly and the emphasis is not on the fighting aspects of samauri life. I think it is the pacing though that adds to the feeling of authenticity and being there as the characters' lives unfold. Other reviews have gone into specifics about the DVD features and other details so I won't reiterate here. I did want to add my five star endorsement to the group though. This is a beautiful movie.
