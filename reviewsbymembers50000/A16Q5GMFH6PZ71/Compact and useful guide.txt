 I used this guidebook on a recent trip to Europe to explore Vienna. I recommend it for its compact size and many convenient maps. I really like the Fodor's travel guides and usually use one of their country guides to learn more about where I am going and where I would like to visit. Those can be a little unwieldy to tote around a city though. These Baedeker's city guides (also put out by Fodor's) are perfect for that though. The pages of my guide were made of a sturdier than regular book material that repelled having gluewien spilled on them. Using the many maps included I managed to navigate my way around the city and various attractions fairly easily. A separate large fold out city map also came with the guide. My only negative comment is that the hotel and restaurant information is by no means inclusive or detailed. I usually have my accomodations all planned before I go and find places to eat either through recommendations or exploration so these things don't matter as much to me. Expanding this information would also undermine the guide's convenient size. If you are planning a trip to visit a foreign country I would recommend getting the larger country guide and then maybe one or more of the smaller city guides for the major cities you plan to spend any time exploring.
