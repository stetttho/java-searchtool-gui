 This is another movie I would rate 3 1/2 stars if it were an option. I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it, particularly the parts where James Garner and Gena Rowlands portray the older Noah and Allie. I was extremely moved by their performance of a couple facing the end of thier lifelong romance. He as devoted to her as ever. The earlier years of them falling in love didn't really gel for me though, I think in part because the story involved just about every love story cliche that could be employed. Too overblown and contrived feeling for me and I don't regard myself as cynical and I have been fortunate enough in life to find my own Noah. Also, I did have a little bit of a hard time with the ending although I understand we as the audience are expected to make a leap of faith in believing they could will this to happen through the strength of their love, as per the conversation they have just before falling asleep.
