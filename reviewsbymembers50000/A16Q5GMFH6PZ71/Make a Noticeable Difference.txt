 I purchased these as a Christmas present for my husband because he has become interested in learning about wine and because both he and the glasses were made in Austria. They arrived undamaged and were well packaged. I read in a review that there have been problems with breakage and inadequate packaging. Hopefully, Amazon has corrected this problem. The glasses are beautiful and HUGE. I don't know a lot about wine and I overfilled them the first time we used them. I learned you should only pour in about the same amount a normal size glass would hold. Each glass could hold a third of a bottle though! The size, my husband tells me, is part of the design to enhance the characteristics of the wine. The large bowl increases the surface area exposed to air in order to improve aeration and the tall sides act to concentrate the scent and direct it toward your nose. I poured some of the wine in one of our old glasses for comparison and there was a big difference in the scent of the wine. In the Riedel glass I noticed the scent the moment I lifted the glass to my face and in our old glass I barely detected any scent at all. The wine tasted much smoother to me from the Riedel glass. Since the senses of smell and taste are closely linked I think that alone makes a big difference when using these glasses. I have also read that the Riedel glasses are designed to direct the wine toward specific areas of your mouth so that makes a difference as well.  I am a little concerned about breakage. We aren't the most gentle on glassware ourselves and I don't think we have ever had people over without at least one glass of wine getting knocked over. The glasses are very tall and the stems and sides are made of thin glass. I doubt they will survive getting knocked over but we will see. In the meantime they do make a lovely presentation on the table.
