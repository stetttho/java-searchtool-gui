 This is a very cute top with alot of pretty details. I think the fit through the chest runs a bit small though. I am a size 6 with a 34C bust and I purchased a medium. It was extremely tight through the chest and although I could button it the fabric puckered between the buttons across the chest. It also caused an unflattering compressed look across my chest. The lacing up the back is ornamental and does not allow you to customize the fit. I will have to return it as it fit with room to spare through shoulders and arms so a large will obviously be too big through these areas. Another thing to be aware of is that the fabric is extremely sheer (not slightly sheer) and you will need a camisole or some sort of undershirt beneath it. Otherwise it is a very beautiful shirt.
