 I think American McGee's Alice is one of my all time favorite games. It has lush, dark, beautifully rendered settings. It has interesting and graphically compelling characters and a good backstory. Granted it is not for the kiddies but that this is made for us older gamers is just another plus in my book. I was drawn into Alice's world within minutes of starting play. If you have played Clive Barker's Undying and enjoyed that then you will probably love Alice. It edges out Undying a bit in my book in areas of ease of game play and coolness of weoponery but it is atmospherically similar. In terms of comments on difficulties with movement I have yet to find a game that didn't have places where the movement was tricky or unpredictable. I didn't notice any really bad or overly annoying problems in Alice myself.
