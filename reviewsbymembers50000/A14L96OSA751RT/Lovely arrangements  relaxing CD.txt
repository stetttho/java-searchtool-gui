 I'm not sure why those who claim that they were never a fan of Barry Manilow bought the CD to begin with.  Hence, the low ratings from some reviewers who should have never listened in the first place.  However, this CD has a nice mix of songs.  My only negative comment is that the CD could have used a few more up-beat songs.  Other than that, this is a lovely CD to have playing in the background as you are driving or working around the house or simply relaxing.  I grew up listening to Manilow on the radio but never bought one of his albums.  This one is a definitely one to add to your collection.
