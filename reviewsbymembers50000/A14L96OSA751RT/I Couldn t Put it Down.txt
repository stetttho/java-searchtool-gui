 I love this series!  "To Dream Anew" is perhaps the best book in the series, but this fourth book is just as enjoyable to read.  I hope there will be more to come!  The only aspect of this book that bothered me was the situation between Cole, his mother and sisters, and Diane.  While Cole struggles to take care of his mother and be loyal to his wife at the same time, he really chooses his mother over his own family by making the decision to stay with his mother.  Diane is the one who lead Cole to Christ.  He has known her and her faith for years; yet while they are living with Cole's mother, Cole seems to believe his mother, who curses God, over his own wife. The fact that he didn't see Diane hit his mother yet believes she actually could have seems a bit out of character.    Also, Diane later apologies to Cole for leaving his side, stating that a good Christian wife doesn't leave her husband's side, "no matter how ugly the situation."  Cole's mother was abusing Cole and Diane's children!  To allow that to continue in the name of being a "good Christian wife" is absurd.  To not protect your children is not being a good Christian parent!  Other than this character flaw, the book is remarkable!
