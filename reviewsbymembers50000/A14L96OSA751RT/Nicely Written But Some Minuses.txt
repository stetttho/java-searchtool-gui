 Gist's style is easy to read as her words flow through the pages.  She keeps the story moving without getting bogged down in too much detail, yet she still paints a picture that easily takes root in the reader's imagination. The dialogue is realistic, and the plot unravels in an uncomplicated sort of way.  The book is 31 chapters long.  The first 21 chapters focus on the sexual tension between the two main characters, Constance and Drew.  This is one element I could do without.  Perhaps Gist is trying to balance a Christian fiction theme with the sexual content of most romance novels, but I found it unnecessary and distracting.  I would rather a Christian fiction novel focus on the meaning of true love, which appears to be the focus the book turns to after the 21st chapter.  Drew, attempting to convince Constance to stay, goes all out to win his begrudging bride over with his good deeds and loving gestures.  Constance, attempting to convince Drew to keep her as her bride (a little miscommunication going on here), learns to cook - a task she has never been fond of - in an attempt to please her husband.    While I had a difficult time putting the book down, I did not find the "dramatic twists" author Liz Higgs refers to her in her praise for Gist's first novel.  However, the plot as is still keeps the reader's interest and fingers turning the pages as quickly as possible.    I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a nice love story without the smut typical romance novels offer.
