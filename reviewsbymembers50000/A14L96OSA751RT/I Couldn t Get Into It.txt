 The first Tracie Peterson books I read were the Heirs of Montana series.  I devoured them and was left hungry for more!  I decided to read another book by Tracie and chose Treasures of the North.  I could not get into this book.  The plot was too predictable, and at times I was tempted to just stop reading and move on to another.    Not only was the plot predictable, but the character development was just not there - not like it is in the Heirs of Montana series.    I have no desire to finish the series.  I am, however, going to continue reading Tracie's books - just not the Yukon Quest series.
