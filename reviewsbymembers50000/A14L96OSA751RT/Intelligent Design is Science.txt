 William Dembski is an intellegent scientist who often uses mathematical probability to explain the complexity of the universe and how evolutionary theory cannot explain it.  Anyone who claims that Intelligent Design is creationism has not read any ID book nor researched the ID theory at all.  It took me 30 minutes of research to discover that ID theory and creationism are not the same and that those who claim they are are being dishonest.  Anything written by Dembski will help the honest searcher understand the Intelligent Design theory and get the facts, not the propaganda.
