 This book contains some very helpful information, such as the dangers of trans fats.  I'm a little confused on whether or not Splenda is bad for our bodies.  There is conflicting information about that.  A lot of what is presented in this book can be found elsewhere, though.  However, this book does misrepresent the low-carb way of eating.  It is NOT deficient in nutrients as the majority of carbs come from fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.  What's missing are refined flours and sugars and trans fats - which this book discourages.
