 I was up late one night and saw an infomercial for Dr. Lorraine Day's PRODUCTS.  Yes, she has something to sell. As a cancer survivor who was treated by conventional methods, I was suspicious of Dr. Day's claims.  She had breast cancer, was on her death bed - unable to eat and speak - and she suddenly became well by "some" procedure that you must purchase to find out.  Yeah, right.  Out of curiosity, I visited Dr. Day's web site.  First, I was blown away by her bitter attitude towards anyone who would dare question or criticize her.  Second, I was disturbed that she used God's word to "warn" her critics, as if Biblical truth is really concerned about health remedies and those who question a doctor's methods are condemned to eternal hell.  Who does she think she is?  I wanted to contact Dr. Day; however, she conveniently provides no way to contact her.  Instead, she asks that you read all her material, watch all her videos because your answer is surely in there somewhere.  Of course, you must BUY these materials first.  Clever.  If Dr. Day is so sure of "the truth," why not offer it FREE to those dying individuals who desperately need it?  Jesus offered truth about eternal salvation FREE to a "lost and spiritually dying" world!  Think twice before you fall for this quakery.
