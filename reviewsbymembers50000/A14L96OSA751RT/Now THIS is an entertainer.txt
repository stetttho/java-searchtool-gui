 I'm still amazed Bo did not win the Idol crown; however, he is the American Idol as far as I'm concerned.  His version of "Inside Your Heaven" is far superior to Carrie's.  Bo sings on key and has a nice tone.  He doesn't have to scream to hit the high notes: they come naturally.  Bo's "Vehicle" is a great re-make, and he sings it comfortably and with feeling.  Bo doesn't sound like someone who has memorized words and notes.  He puts his heart into his voice, and THAT is entertainment.
