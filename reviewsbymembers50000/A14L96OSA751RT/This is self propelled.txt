 My biggest complaint is that this vacuum cleaner does NOT feel self-propelled.  There are times I have to push hard to get it to move.  It's almost more difficult than my NON self-propelled cleaner!  The cord is also in a bad location and is difficult to keep up with.  The suction seems good, though.
