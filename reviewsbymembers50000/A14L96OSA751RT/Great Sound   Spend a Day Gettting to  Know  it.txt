 I am amending my previous (now deleted) review after spending the majority of a day learning how to use the player.  The print instructions that come with the player are severely lacking, so it can be very frustrating trying to figure out how to use the player based on those instructions alone.  However, the player comes with a CD that contains a more detailed set of instructions that you can download onto your computer.  I would recommend doing that first.  What's good about this product is the sound.  It's incredible.  It's size is both an advantage and disadvantage.  It's small enough to make it very convenient for traveling.  But the screen is very small, making it difficult to read. Even with my glasses on, I still cannot see all the screen details that well - or at all.  I like the toggle switch.  It's nice to have what you need to operate the player in one central location.  What could be improved is tech support.  It's virtually non-existent.  A toll-free number is provided in the instructions; however, no one answers the phone.  You have to leave a message and then wait days for someone to call.  The best bet is to leave a message on the manufacturer's web site forum tech support board.  Someone usually answers questions there.  The ear buds are too big.  I cannot keep them in my ears.  They have a good sound, however.  The first day I got my player, it froze up on me twice.  This problem appeared to be related to a song I downloaded from a music store online.  It also turned itself off one time while I was recording.  I don't know if that was due to operator error or the player, although I have heard of this happening to others (and not just with the JetAudio player).  This is the first Mp3 player I have owned, so I have nothing to compare it to.  However, as I became more familiar with the player yesterday, I grew to like it more and more.
