 This is good music. The drums are thick, and the heavy electric guitar adds an awesome rock sound that distinquishes this peppy beat from pure pop. The best songs are "Down" followed by "Happy" and "Everyone." The great growling voice of the lead singer sounds very similar to Fuel's lead singer. There is a good variety in the tempo of the songs. This is good driving music and the clean language is an extra bonus in my book. Good rock music CAN be decent.
