 This is a great little book devoting a page or so to many famous philosophers, with just enough information to be intriguing.  It demonstrates that there is plenty to laugh about in the study of philosophy.  Another useful characteristic...it's funny even if you know nothing about philosophy, but the more familiar you are with the players, the more amusing it is.  I'm sorry to see that it's out of print...I think most of my fellow Notre Dame grads from my year own a copy.
