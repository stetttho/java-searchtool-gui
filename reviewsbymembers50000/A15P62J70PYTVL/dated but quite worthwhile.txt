 This book is a product of the 1950s and does contain some outdated attitudes about gender roles and sexual orientation.  That being said, it is a remarkably thoughtful and penetrating examination of the theory and practice of loving.  Many of Fromm's observations are astute, and his concerns re narcissism and consumerism in the search for a mate are even more cogent today (witness reality TV's "Who wants to marry a millionaire" and "the bachelor", e.g.).  Most people I know could learn something from this book.  Be forwarned, though...it is not a quick or easy "self-help" read, and Fromm's advice, which is to behave altruistically, is not easy to follow, either.
