 I found this a very amusing comic novel. Bridget Jones strikes a chord  with every 20-something woman I know in England and the US.  I'm not at all  sure why this novel provoked such outrage, or why it has been interpreted  to be anti-feminist...it is what it is, a rather silly book which is great  fun to read.
