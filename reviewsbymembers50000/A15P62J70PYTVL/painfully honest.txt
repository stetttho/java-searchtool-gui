 This book tells it like it is: the joys and the sorrows of a woman's struggle to raise a baby on her own, all the while dealing with her own problems, like staying sober and fighting down pangs of loneliness.  It's easy to be moved to tears as she chronicles a father denying paternity, a close friend's death, and the frustrations of a colicky baby.  But she never loses her sense of humor and her keen observations are a welcome respite from so many memoirs which are all sweetness and light.
