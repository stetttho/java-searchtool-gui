 A fascinating historical perspective on the post-Civil War constitutional amendments which gives much needed background on family rights as aspects of liberty.  I take serious issue with the New York Times review, which gave short shrift to Professor Davis' analysis.  I read this book in law school but it is accessible to any reader interested in law and the public discourse on family values.
