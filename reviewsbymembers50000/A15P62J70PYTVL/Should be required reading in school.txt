 Feminists of each generation, I think, have to do a lot of reinventing of the wheel.  We don't know our own history, and although in 2001 we take for granted the ideas that women can be professional athletes or CEOs, that families are not all alike, that equal pay for equal work is fair and right...these ideas were once radical, and not that long ago.  Likewise, in the 1970s universal suffrage was taken for granted...and the struggles of women activists in the 1920s were forgotten.  This is a valuable collection of writings which gives us some of that history back.  It covers important feminist thought from 1949 to 1993.  This book holds important lessons for all of us, on religion, rape, health, pornography, family, race, sexual orientation...all manner of relevant and fascinating work.
