 This book reminded me of Jane Austen novels but without the moral dimension of the protaganist.  Newland Archer didn't follow his heart, not because of honor or righteousness, but out of conformity and cowardice.  He  simply lacked the imagination to do it.  For this reason, the story is  tragic.  Edith Wharton has a singularly unsentimental view of marriage, and  a profound grasp of social conventions...an excellent, if disturbing, read.
