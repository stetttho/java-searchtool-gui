 I read this on a plane, which was probably pretty appropriate.  The author takes us into well-covered territory: a movie crew invades a small town full of lovable eccentrics.  This scenario is handled much better in "State and Main."  The characters here are almost irritatingly quirky, the plot predictable, the conclusions trite.  Still, when you're stuck on a long flight, you could do a lot worse.
