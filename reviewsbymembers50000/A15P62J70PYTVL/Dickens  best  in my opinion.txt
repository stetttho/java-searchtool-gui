 Impossible to summarize the plot, but a satisfying concoction of sentiment, mystery, legal satire, and Victorian excess.  I read it the summer before I started law school, which is as good a time as any to tackle this novel.  If you don't enjoy this one, you may as well skip any other Dickens novels...this is as good as it gets.
