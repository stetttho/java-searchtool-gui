 Judy is a surprisingly modern heroine in this epistolary novel, an orphan rescued by a mysterious benefactor and sent to college at the turn of the last century.  She's entertaining, has a sense of humor that the hardships of her past has not diminished, is a talented writer, and aspires to be a "useful citizen."  This is a perfect girls' fantasy with a storybook ending, and has held up over time remarkably well.  I've only seen the Fred Astaire version of the movie adaptation, which I cannot recommend...read the book instead, it's truly charming.
