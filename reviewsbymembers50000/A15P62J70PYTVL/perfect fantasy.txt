 This is a perfect fantasy for an adolescent...being trapped in a family where you don't fit in, where no one understands or loved you, and finding out that you are someone entirely different, someone special, someone with  magical powers.  This book is magical, in the tradition of Madeline L'Engle  without the Christian overtones, or "The Phantom Tollbooth"  without the affectation.  An excellent romp for children and adults alike.   Destined to be a classic.
