 Of course this is to be compared with Bridget Jones, and many have compared it unfavorably.  Although this one is obviously a more serious look at a woman's development, I don't find it to be a stronger book, just  a different one.  It is well written, sometimes a bit too self-consciously  witty, but overall a rather realistic portrait of a young woman's lessons  in life and love.
