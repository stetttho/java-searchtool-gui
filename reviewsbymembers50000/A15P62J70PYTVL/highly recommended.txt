 This book is investigative journalism and doesn't attempt to be a sociological study.  And yes, Ms. Ehrenreich brings her own personality, prejudices, and experiences with her in her forays into low-wage jobs.  However, I think that is an asset, not a detriment to the book.  I think as a society we're often loath to face uncomfortable truths, and the great truth she illustrates for us here is the sheer ugliness of capitalism.  Marx did point it out for us a long way back, but he's not an easy read.  Dickens did too, but the industrial revolution seems a long way away in the 21st century.  Now, anyone with any background in economics can point out that companies need to keep costs down, that a "living wage" would put many small businesses under, the connections between capitalism and freedom, etc., etc.  But sometimes I think we need a harsh look at reality and the indignities and struggles just to have food and shelter that many, many people in this country face on a daily basis.  Ms. Ehrenreich doesn't purport to solve the problems she describes here, but she has done us a great service by making her readers think long and hard about the inequities and injustices in our country.
