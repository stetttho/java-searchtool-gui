 This is a fascinating, vivid, and amazing book, about relationships between people.  Not an easy read, and not a pretty picture of Greenwich  Village and its inhabitants (prostitution, infidelity, drug abuse, suicide  are among the issues), but an extremely effective and emotionally haunting  one.  It explores gender, race, and sexuality from a sympathetic and  humanistic viewpoint, and has the power to shock even today, forty years  after it was written.
