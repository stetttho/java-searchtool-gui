 but it has a real ring of the ugly truth, heartbreaking and hysterically funny as it is. I read this book when my boyfriend (now husband) was in medical school and he swore that it is all true (with the exeception of the  sex...so either 1) times have changed; 2) the author exaggerated; 3) he's  protecting me).  I would recommend this to anyone with a loved one in the  medical profession--just to see where some of the frustration and cynicism  comes from.
