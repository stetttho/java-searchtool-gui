 Barbara Ehrenreich is an excellent writer and has great insight on government, capitalism, hype, the news media, politicians, and just about everything she finds to criticize about our culture.  She's got a wonderful sense of the ridiculous and a sharp wit, yet her writing appears to have true and great affection for her fellow women and men.  This book isn't her best though. It's a collection of previously published essays, some of which have stood the test of time better than others.  Still, worth reading, and a great look back at the infamous decade of greed.
