 This is not a how to plan a wedding primer, so don't buy this if you're looking for one.  It is a rather entertaining series of mini-essays attempting to put the elaborate, extravagant, and expensive spectacles that  weddings are becoming into a reasonable perspective.  I read it while  engaged and found the author's perspective on what is and is not important  a helpful reminder.  For example: the wedding day is not all about the  bride; the wedding is not a fundraiser; the wedding is not a time for  networking; the wedding is not for the entertainment of all present, but a  ceremony uniting two people in marriage; weddings should be in good taste,  etc.  Seemingly obvious points, but yet, many involved seem to miss them!    However, if you're going to plan a large wedding, a how to guide is  actually much more useful.  And if you're dealing with horrid fights with  your family or your in laws, or both, no book can help you--unfortunate as  that may be!
