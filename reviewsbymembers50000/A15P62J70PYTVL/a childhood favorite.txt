 This book is a real charmer.  The rest of the series is nice, and you learn what happens to Anne and the rest of them, but none of them reach the  heights of this lovely tale about the orphan who won over so many hearts.   Buy it for a young girl...I know I must have read it 10 times, and I still  have a tattered copy at my parents' house.
