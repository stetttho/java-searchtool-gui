 I read this as a girl, and randomly happened upon it at a used book store this week and purchased it for a dollar.  It's one of a genre of books I  think girls of a certain age read (I know I certainly did) about animals  and their relationships with humankind.  A charming, rather well written  tale of a quail adopted by a family in Cape Cod.
