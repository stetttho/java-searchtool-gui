 An interesting book, which examines a 1992 Canadian court case concerning  Aboriginal ceremonies from a variety of perspectives: colonialism,  nationalism, feminist theory, etc.  Although the questions and ideas raised  are interesting, reading the book is a bit frustrating.  I found myself  wishing for more factual information, more details about the case itself,  more information about what had happened, but instead practically buried in  analysis.  I also think that the author's political motivation was much  more concerned with the fate of Quebec than of the native peoples, which  struck me as somewhat disingenuous.  Additionally, I think the author owes  more to Foucault than he credits.  However, I found it worth reading, if  simply to force myself to question some of my assumptions about law,  sovereignity, and individual rights.
