 This book purports to be a self-help book, but it does not give you all  the answers.  It gives you questions, things to think about, multiple  answers, none of which seem entirely satisfactory, and a sense of humor  about humankind and our struggle to find our place in this world.   Interesting, full of provocative ideas and perspectives, and amusing.
