 The whole book is a discussion of translation and it is a delight to read  Hofstadter's meaderings on various topic, a lively mind at work.  This book  is rather on the obsessive side and does rework several themes he has  explored thoroughly in other books, however.  Still, in my mind, worth  reading.  This book also adds a personal dimension, his own story of his  wife's death, which does a great deal to humanize what might have otherwise  been a bit on the esoteric side.
