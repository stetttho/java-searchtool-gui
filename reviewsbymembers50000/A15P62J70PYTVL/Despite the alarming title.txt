 Despite the rather alarming-sounding title, this is actually a rather innovative and interesting theoretical work about the meaning of family.  The author proposes that a new definition of family be legally adopted to  reflect practice and need, rather than traditional notions.  She uses the  mother and child model (this a metaphor for the nurturer and dependant  individuals, whatever their age or gender) rather than our idea now that  the sexual tie between husband and wife is the tie that binds.  So, rather  than giving tax breaks and inheritance rights and the myriad of legal  advantages to protect a family on the basis of marriage, Martha Fineman  proposes that the same advantages be provided by our society to a single  mother with a child, or a man in his 30s taking care of his elderly  parents, or a woman who lives with and supports her developmentally  disabled brother, etc.  It is really a completely radical idea, but it is  argued persuasively.  If she can't convince you, she will at least make you  reconsider the assumptions one makes about families and their legal rights  and responsibilities.
