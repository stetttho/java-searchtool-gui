 This book is a classic study in amateur sociology: what makes city neighborhoods work, why areas are safe and unsafe, fascinating descriptions  of parks, neighborhoods, the impact of the length of blocks, public housing  projects.  Especially if you live in New York, Boston, Chicago, or  Philadelphia and are familiar with the areas she describes, but even if you  are not, her observations are acute and her analysis is superb.  As a  municipal government employee, I think this should be required reading for  everyone in city government.
