 An exquisitely written novel, a historical fantasy set in 18th century  Portugal, which ruminates on the uses and abuses of power, humankind's  aspirations toward the stars, the dignity and grace of the common people,  and the simple beauty of true love and friendship.  The book is hauntingly  beautiful.
