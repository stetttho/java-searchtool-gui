 This book had potential, and if only a good editor had toned down some of the overly instrusive self-conscious elements, it may have been accurately titled.  But what could have been an interesting narrative technique was, in the end, too self-indulgent and distracting.  The story itself is very touching and interesting on a personal and societal level.  Or maybe I'm just too old?  Anyway, I'm looking forward to his next book. I think I'll give Dave Eggers another chance.
