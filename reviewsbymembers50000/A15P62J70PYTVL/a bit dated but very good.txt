 A bit dated, but a truly gripping picture of a surgery residency in Bellevue.  It captures much of the frustration and much of the idealism inherent in medicine, and it is a fascinating read.  I'm very glad to see  it is still in print. I have a tattered paperback that must be over 20  years old, and it's good to know that people are still buying and reading  this book.
