 but an excellent summer read nonetheless.  "Prodigal" to me, had never before meant anything but the Prodigal Son parable, but it has another meaning or two here: bountiful, fruitful; or excessively wasteful, spendthrift.  Barbara Kingsolver takes us through three interconnected stories involving nature, the environment, flora and fauna, and human relationships, and unlike some other reviewers, I didn't find the clear analogies between the human drama and the rest of the green earth too preachy or overwhelming.  I enjoyed her lyrical prose, her unmatched descriptive powers, and the slow-moving but satisfying resolution of the plotlines.  Perfect reading for a slow summer afternoon.
