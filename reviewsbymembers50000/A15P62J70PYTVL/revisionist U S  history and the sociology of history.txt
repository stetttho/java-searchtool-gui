 I found this book fascinating: partly for the great amount of historical information that despite my liberal education I had missed; partly for the author's quite convincing explanations of why high school history textbooks are so poor; and mostly for the once again convincing explanations of why the recent past is simply not covered in history classes.  The Vietnam War and why it is left out is covered at length in the book. Second wave feminism is another topic of incredible importance to youth today, and yet it is not in the curriculum except in gender studies; Professor Loewen doesn't make as much of this issue, but it is a good starting point.  Well worth reading.
