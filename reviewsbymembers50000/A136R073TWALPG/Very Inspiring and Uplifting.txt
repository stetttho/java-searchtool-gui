 This was a very uplifting biography and it should only make us appreciate the things that we often take for granted.(ie parents, a stable home environment, etc)   I'm not what you would call an emotional person but right in the middle of the book, when his mean battleaxe of a foster mother got him nothing for Christmas, I could not help but cry.  Finding Fish should serve as an inspiration to anyone, regardless of creed or color, who is having difficulties in life, relationships, careers, to help us put our problems in perspective.  Those of us who complain about trivial meaningless matters like our favorite tv shows getting cancelled or not finding the right kind of department store, etc. must understand that unless we walk in the shoes of someone like Fisher, our little gripes and complaints really mean nothing.  This individual, according to statistics, should be sitting in some kind of state prison right now or in some kind of homeless shelter but instead, had the fortitude and determination to play the awful cards that were dealt him and become a productive citizen. So far, this book is the best biography I've ever read and that would include the bios of individuals with surnames of Powell, Kennedy and Lincoln.
