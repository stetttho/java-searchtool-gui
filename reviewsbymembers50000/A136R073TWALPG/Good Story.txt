 This was my first Mosley novel and I really did enjoy it.  It was very suspenseful with some interesting characters and a tense plot. Mosley was very descriptive in giving an account of 1950's L.A. and how racism wasn't just an affliction that affected the South or the Midwest. My only gripe was that there were too many characters to account for.  It seemed like there was a new character introduced to the book every other page and I had to stop on many occasions and flip back a few pages to remind myself who the characters were.   Overall, I'd recommend it.
