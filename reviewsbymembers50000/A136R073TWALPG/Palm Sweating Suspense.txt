 Harlan Coben pieces together a very suspenseful yarn about the details surrounding the death of a prominent surgeon's wife and the kidnapping of his infant child.  The characters are very well-developed and the story, told from the doctor's perspective, is incredible.  This is not your typical "whodunit" mystery.  If you're new to Coben's novels, No Second Chance is a good book in which to start.
