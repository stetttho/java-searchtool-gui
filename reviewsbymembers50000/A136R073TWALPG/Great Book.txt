 This was a very entertaining book and the best Reacher novel I have read thus far.  Several women have been murdered throughout the country and they all have one thing in common.  Each of them knew Reacher from the military.  However, the murderer is very efficient in that no clues remain as to what caused the death of each woman. Reacher has been coerced by the FBI to assist them with the investigation and he reluctantly decides to help the agency.  Unfortunately, most of the agents on this assignment really do not respect nor like him with the exception of a very attractive yet inexperienced 29 year old named Lisa Harper.  She also proves to be a valuable ally to Reacher in his search for this cold-blooded killer.    Very graphic with intense language but very exciting book.
