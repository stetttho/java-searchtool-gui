 In this "Prey" installment by Sandford, Davenport and his team are faced with a cold-blooded killer who has one thing on his mind. Revenge. After his sister and wife are killed in a foiled bank robbery attempt, an extreme right-winged government hating milita member seeks revenge on the policemen who are responsible. After he escapes from prison, he enlists a few members, including a dirty cop, seeking vengeance against those responsible for his sister and wife's deaths.     A very tense thriller with non-stop action and excitement. I had a hard time putting this one down. Sudden Prey could rank as one of Sandford's best novels.
