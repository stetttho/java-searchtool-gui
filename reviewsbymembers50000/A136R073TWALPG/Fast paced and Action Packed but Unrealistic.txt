 This is the first book that I have read that was written by Gayle Lynds and it started out very intense and exciting.    An attractive female awakens from a long sleep but does not recall who she is.  She has been told that she is a CIA agent who has been recruited to hunt down a cold-blooded international assassin who is nicknamed, "The Carnivore." However, as the novel progresses, she begins to discover that she's not who she thinks she is.  She has become a pawn in one of the biggest government cover-ups and has teamed with a CIA renegade to find out the truth.   The story seemed very well constructed but my big problem was with the action scenes.  Highly unrealistic action scenes were very distracting and it took much away from an otherwise good story.
