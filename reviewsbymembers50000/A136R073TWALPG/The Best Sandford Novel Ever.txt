 This was the greatest effort, in my opinion, offered by Sandford's portrayal of tough cop, Lucas Davenport.  The setting is in Wisconsin during the winter with temperatures at sub-zero levels. He, along with the Sherrif's department in the county, are on the prowl for a cold-blooded killer nicknamed, "The Iceman."   What separated this book from the others was that the ending was very much a surprise.  Unlike other Davenport novels, we usually know the killer in the beginning but in this one, we can only guess until he is revealed at the very end.  A great nail-biting thriller.
