 Mosley delivers an exciting mystery novel that once again, centers around the life of Easy Rawlins.  Easy is recruited to find the murderer of a young white coed, who happens to be the daughter of a prominent LA Asst D.A.  She was also found dead in a mostly black area of Los Angeles and LAPD detectives coerces Rawlins into assisting them with their investigation. Only problem is that Easy is now married with a daughter and has to put his family situation in jeopardy if he decides to offer help. He goes through his usual questioning of witnesses and as usual, he discovers a few surprises in the process.  A good thriller but like most Mosley novels, he has too many characters to keep track of.  Also, Easy is a borderline alcoholic in this one as he is always coming out of the liquor store or some kind of bar filled with scotch. It's a wonder how he's able to question his witnesses without slurring his speech or staggering all over the place since he's drunk throughout most of the book. A good novel but not one of Mosley's best efforts.
