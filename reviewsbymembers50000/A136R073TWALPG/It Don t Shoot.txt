 The greatest line in the book was "It Don't Shoot." For the sake of not spoiling things, I will not explain what that line means but you wlll have to read it toward the end.   This is my first Hunter novel and I was absolutely dumbfounded after reading it.  Swagger is a very complex character who has a lot of ghosts from Viet Nam that still haunt him, especially the memory of his best friend getting killed by enemy fire.  Swagger is one of the best snipers in the business and he is cajoled by a rogue group of secret government operatives into involving himself in an assassination plot.  After the rogue operatives fail to kill him, he becomes a fugitive from justice and has to team up with a disgraced FBI agent to clear his name.  Very tense thriller involving government coverups, trickery and constant grandstanding by the Asst Director of the FBI.   I could not put this one down.  Hunter scores big with this one.
