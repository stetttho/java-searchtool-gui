 The author has a good idea in mind when writing this novel.  The book fast forwards the world 10 years of the aftermath of September 11, 2001 and how Iraq is making an all out effort to destroy the United States once and for all.    However, this story is highly improbable because he paints Hussein and his top officials as religious fanatics.  Hussein was not, nor will he ever be, a religious fanatic.    Also, his protagonist, Jonathan Bennett, had such a limited role in this book, you couldn't help but wonder why so much time was devoted to him.    This book obviously had a very pro-Israel slant and the author was way too preachy throughout most of it.
