 I am a big fan of Lee Child.  He's arguably the greatest mystery writer around today but this book just did not quite grab my attention like the others.  One of the biggest knocks on Child is that he spends too much time on minute details.  In this book, he spent an enormous amount of time on the smallest of details.  The constant review of the videotape filming the Secret Service cleaners got to be nerve wracking.  In fact, I was tempted to just skip ahead of all of that because it was a pain.    In my view, this book is probably one of Child's weaker efforts.
