 This was one of the Clancy's finest works.  The President tacitly authorizes an illegal war against Columbian drug lords in retaliation for the murders of prominent government officials.  Jack Ryan, the newly appointed DDO of the CIA is kept out of the loop but figures out the misdeeds of the President's inept National Security Advisor and the CIA's DDI (deputy director of intelligence) and is determined to get to the bottom of matters.  Very long story but I read it in just a few days.
