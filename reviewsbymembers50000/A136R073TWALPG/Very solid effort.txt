 Ms. Hoag was very effective at presenting the reader with a good suspense tale with many different plot twists.  Her description of Det. Kovak, for example, was so descriptive that I could actually smell old stale cigarettes on him whenever his name was mentioned.   My only complaint is that she gave us a bit too much of the cliffhanger in the middle of the book instead of saving the best for last.  All in all, it was a very good read and can't wait to read her next novel.
