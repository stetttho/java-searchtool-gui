 This novel was written during a period when Clancy was in "The Zone."  This novel provides the reader with a background of a character that we know from previous novels as John Clark.  Clark, an ex-Navy Seal, who possesses a great deal of intelligence and ice water in his veins when confronted with evil.  He shows absolutely no remorse and offers no apologies for exterminating the criminals who wreak havoc on society.  This is a very dark novel with extremely graphic descriptions of gratuitous violence coupled with excessive profanity.  However, the book is also a great yarn with intricate sub-plots and places the reader in the midst of the action that took place during the Viet Nam War era.  What's interesting is that Jack Ryan, son of a homicide detective, makes a cameo appearance as a college senior and discusses career options with his dad.  A shame that this book was never made into a movie.  It would have been awesome.
