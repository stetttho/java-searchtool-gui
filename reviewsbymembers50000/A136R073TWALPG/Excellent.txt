 One of the better historical fiction novels I have ever read.  Mr. Robbins places the reader in the middle of the action in the Battle of Stalingrad.  In this novel, a master Russian sniper, Zaitsez, nicknamed the "Hare" due to his slight frame and quickness, becomes a hero among the Russians because of his dexterity with long range rifles.  The German government has become aware of the "Hare" and decides that killing him will help destroy morale among the Russian troops and give their army a bit more momentum. They decide to bring in a "schoolmaster" who trains young German soldiers to be snipers.  He's also got better shooting range than does the "Hare" and enlists Nikki, a bright young German soldier to accompnay him the field.   What's interesting is that an arrogant General by the name of Nikita Kruschev makes an appearance to award the "Hare" with a medal of courage for his efforts in the war.   Reading the final 150 pages was like watching an intense chess match.  Robbins has scored big with this one and I am looking forward to reading more books by him.
