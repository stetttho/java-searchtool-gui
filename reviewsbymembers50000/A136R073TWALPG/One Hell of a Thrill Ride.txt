 This is arguably the greatest suspense novel of 2003.  This novel is about a female shrink, Robin Cameron, who works with sociopaths, namely convicts and rogue cops, to rehabilitate them by controlling an area of their brain with a high tech medical device, that makes them prone to violence.  Her daughter Megan ends up missing but Robin and the policeman who happens to supervise one of the her subjects, a cop involved in a fatal shooting, attempt to locate her.  So many twists and turns are in this book that it becomes extremely hard to tell the good from the bad.  Prescott tells a great story in this one and I would definitely recommend it.  This book is set in Los Angeles so expect quite a bit of graphic violence and profanity.
