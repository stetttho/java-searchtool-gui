 I've been a fan of Lescroats for a few years now.  I really did enjoy reading works like The First Law and The Hearing.  However,I just couldn't get excited about this work.  The plot was a bit unrealistic while a great chunk of the novel was void of intense dialogue and a few action scenes for good measure.  Lescroats disappointed me in this one. Fortunately, I bought this book at a used book sale for a buck thirty and do not feel too cheated.
