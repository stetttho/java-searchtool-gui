 Eyes of Prey is a highly suspenseful novel about a doctor who wh plays a cat and mouse game with Minneapolis, P.D., namely Davenport, and takes part in several gruesome murders with a hideous partner in crime. Sandford delivers a good effort with this one but it's not quite as suspenseful as his debut, Rules of Prey.  Overall, it's still a better than average suspense novel and very gripping and tense dialogue.
