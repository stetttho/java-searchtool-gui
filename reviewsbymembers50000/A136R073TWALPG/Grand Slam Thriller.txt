 This book was very long and descriptive.  However, it is action-packed with many plot twists and turns.   Anna Navarro is a Justice Department agent who is given the assignment of finding out why a group of elderly men around the world are getting killed.  These men belonged to a highly secretive organization known as Sigma.  In the interim, Ben Hartman is a thirty-ish banker on a ski trip in Switzerland and as he is about to depart, an old college "friend" notices him in a hotel lobby and makes an attempt on his life but fails.  As you continue to read the book, you will discover that there is a direct link between the attempted murder of Hartman and Sigma.   Anna and Ben accidentally meet each other about a third way  through the novel and discover that they both have a lot in common which is the desire to learn more about Sigma and some of its past and present members.     This was a great novel with lots of good history on the many doctors who performed human experiments during (...) Germany.  Of course, some of it is fiction but much of it is not after I had done my own research on the topics in this book.  If you do not read any other Ludlum novel, please find time to read the Sigma Protocol.
