 However, Silent Prey was still worth reading if you are on a plane or bus on a long trip.  The capture of escapee Bekker and the Robin Hood killers, in my opinion, should not have been in the same story.  Doing so made it difficult to follow and keep track of so many characters.  It was still a decent book.
