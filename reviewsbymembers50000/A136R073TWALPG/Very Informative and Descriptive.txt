 This is a very vivid account of the actions surrounding and leading up to the sinking of the Lusitania by one of Germany's U-Boat fleet during WW I.  Ms Preston does an excellent job at the end of the book dismissing certain theories and even creating a few of her own without being too overly biased.  This is an excellent historical account of that tragic day, which unfortunately, gets overshadowed by the sinking of the Titanic and would definitely recommend it.
