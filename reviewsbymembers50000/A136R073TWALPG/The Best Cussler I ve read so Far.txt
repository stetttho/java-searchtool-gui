 You have to take Clive Cussler's books for what they are.  He presents his protagonist, Dirk Pitt, as a James Bond type hero except that he operates at sea.  A very well written plot with a great ending, unique characters, intense action, make this novel one of Cussler's finest works that I've read so far.  However, for some reason, people do not discuss this book as one of Cussler's finest works in the same vein as Sahara.   My only disappointment was that Julien Perlmutter, his obese marine historian, does not make any appearances.  He's one of Cussler's most interesting characters.   I would definitely recommend Shockwave.
