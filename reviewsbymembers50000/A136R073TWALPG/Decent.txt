  Cussler, once again, provides readers wtih a good suspenseful tale which features the exploits of Dirk Pitt and his trusting sidekick, Al Giordino. On the plus side, he provides us with a thorough description of various ships and submarines and puts the reader right in the midst of the action. He also gives us some educational insight on pre-Columbus expeditions and a good history lesson. I also get a kick out of the obese St. Julien Perlmutter. He's quite a character. The downside is that he puts Pitt in too many situations that would kill the average Joe 10 times over but somehow, he manages to come away unscathed every single time. If Cussler does this every once in a while, it would be more believable. However, with Pitt, he does it way too often. There were many instances where I simply heard myself saying, 'Aw, gimme a break' while reading a few paragraphs. Overall, a good story with interesting characters. Definitely would recommend.
