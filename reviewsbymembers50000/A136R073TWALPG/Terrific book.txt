 This book was exciting from beginning to end.  Very intense non stop action and plot twists exist throughout this book.  On her deathbed, the narrator's mom tells her son that her brother is alive.  Will Klein, the book's narrator, is out to find the truth about his older brother, Ken, who is on the run from the police for murdering Will's ex-girlfriend.  Also, his fiancee, Sheila Rogers, mysteriously disappears right after the funeral of his mother. One of the more interesting characters in this book is Will's best friend, Squares, a former skinhead who made good who works as a Yoga instructor.  He also works at the Covenant House with Will in an effort to get runaways off the street.   This book was very well written and I've made every effort to find flaws with it.  I couldn't.
