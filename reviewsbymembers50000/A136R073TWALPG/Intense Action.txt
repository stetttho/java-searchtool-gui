 I do not think that this is Sandford's best work but definitely his most violent read so far.  Davenport is on the hunt for a serial killer and many clues have him focused on Charlie Pope, a mentally unstable and rather dimwitted criminal.   Davenport, however, suspects that the execution of these crimes could not have been carried out by Pope alone because he's not smart enough to do so.  Take caution.  This is an extremely violent novel.
