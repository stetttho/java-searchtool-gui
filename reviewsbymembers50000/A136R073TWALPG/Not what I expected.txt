 After reading "Point of Impact," I was really excited about diving into this Hunter work about a German soldier, Repp, skilled in long range shooting, who is on a dangerous mission and has in his possession a very dangerous state of the art weapon to fulfill it.    The book gets a little confusing because there are so many German towns, phrases, organizations, etc that it becomes hard to keep track of them througout the reading.  Also, the romantic scene between the hero who hunts down Repp, Leets, and a nurse becomes more distracting and really has no relevance to the story.  The action scenes were quite entertaining, however, and the book was hard to put down in the last 100 pages.   It was a decent book but I think I'll stick with the "Swagger" series from now on.
