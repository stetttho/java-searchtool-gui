 Cussler delivers another really good story and plot for his readers to enjoy.   The hero, Dirk Pitt, is faced with a daunting challenge of locating several nuclear bombs that are smuggled into the United States.  A highly nationalistic Japanese executive is behind the controls of what could be the biggest terrorist plot in U.S. history.  Pitt, Giordino along with a few other intelligence personnel, must also locate this ruthless tycoon's operating center and destroy it before it's too late.  Very intense story though Cussler could have done without using racial epithets to describe the Japanese people.  I was not really bothered by it initially until our great hero, Dirk Pitt and his sidekick, Al Giordino, began using it also.
