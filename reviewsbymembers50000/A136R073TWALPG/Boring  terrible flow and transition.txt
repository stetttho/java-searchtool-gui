 I read about 1/4 of this book and couldn't take it anymore.  This is the first time I've read a book from this author and am not familiar with the characters.  Ms. Johansen, however, does not give any good character introductions and the transition from event to the next is very sloppy.  The book was so pathetic, I literally gave it away to a used bookstore before completion.
