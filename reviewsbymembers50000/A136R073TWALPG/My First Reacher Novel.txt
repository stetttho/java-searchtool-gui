 Very action-packed from beginning to end.  Reacher is on a mission to seek vengeance for the death of a former female subordinate in the Army. As usual, he has many hoops to jump through and is working with the FBI to hunt him down. The FBI has an altogether different motive to locate this individual because he might be responsible for a missing undercover agent whose cover was probably blown.   Really good story. There are surprises in this one until the very end.
