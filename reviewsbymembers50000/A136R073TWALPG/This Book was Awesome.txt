 Whenever I read one of Hunter's books from the Swagger series, I am in awe of the flawless writing, intense dialogue and character development talents of this author.  Earl Swagger, decorated WWII vet and sheriff of small county in AR, wants to expose the evil and corruption that takes place in a small prison camp in MS that houses black inmates. He enlists some of the toughest hired guns to carry out his task of waging war against a group of evil men whose lack of morals and disregard for the law are worse than the criminals that they house.  Great page turner.
