 This is my first Pelecanos novel and I was very satisfied with it.  There's a good chemistry between Derek Strange and Terry Quinn despite being from different racial backgrounds.  Derek Strange, while a protagonist in the novel and a good role model for kids, is also extremely flawed in many ways which makes the character real.  Many authors try to paint their characters as Supermen who have no real faults and are infallible. Pelecanos gives us a real perspective of flawed "good guys" can really be.   Intense action with a good plot.  Very good character development is noticable in this one.
