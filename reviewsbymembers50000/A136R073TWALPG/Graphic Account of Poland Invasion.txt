 This book goes into great detail of how Germany invaded Poland by employing its "blitzkrieg" tactics and the atrocities that accompanied the invasion.  Some of the horrors inflicted on the Polish, particularly Polish Jews, are unthinkable.  I really liked how Rossini describes the various factions within the SS and the major players involved throughout the entire process to create "Lebensraum" (living space) for the German peoples. I also find it quite ironic that the Polish are described by many of the SS barbarians as "violent."  My only complaint was that the author could have described the military tactics from the Polish perspective a bit more.  In other words, why was the German army able to steamroll the Polish military so easily.  A few accounts from Polish officers would have helped, though we did get quite a few accounts from Polish civilians.
