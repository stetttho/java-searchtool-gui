 Mr. Carter gives us a thrilling story to go along with an intricate plot.  He masterfully uses the game of chess in providing the narrator, Talcott Garland, some clues on why his father, "The Judge," died and the "arrangements" made prior to his death.   After reading about 3/4 of the book, I was on my way to giving it five stars.  However, I was very disappointed in the ending. There were at least three mysteries that were not yet solved at the conclusion of this book and left me feeling empty afterward.  I almost felt as though I wasted 2 weeks of my valuable time reading this book. When I got to the final 4 or 5 pages, I was hoping desperately that some of mysteries would get solved or mentioned but they were not. Further, the narrator began to become a little bit too sanctimonius toward the end also. He was married to a beautiful and intelligent yet self-centered arrogant unfaithful wife but still loved her in spite of herself.  His self-loathing and seemingly idol worship of his extremely flawed wife got to be a bit nerve-racking.  This book was good but could have been much more had the author tried not to get cute toward the end.
