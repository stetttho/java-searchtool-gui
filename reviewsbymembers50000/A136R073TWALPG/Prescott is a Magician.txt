 I only say that because he is the Master of Mis-Direction.  He'll have you thinking that the story is going in one direction but suddenly, he takes you somewhere totally different.  For example, he will develop a character and describe all of his or her great attributes but may mention one negative.  However,that one negative might turn out to be the turning point of the novel.  This book is packed with excitement from beginning to end. If you are a fan of mystery and suspense, you won't be disappointed.
