 I was at the airport and was getting ready to board my four hour flight when it occurred to me, I forgot to bring something to read.  I hurried over to the news stand and did not have enough time to browse and picked up "No Other Option."   This book took me by complete surprised from the outset.  It is packed with so much action and suspense, I had a hard time getting off the plane as I was about to finish.  Jonny Maxwell is a hero gone bad and Dale Miller, his former partner, has been called upon by federal law enforcement to help find him.   With the help of an attractive cop in Minneapolis, Dale decides to ditch the federal boys and go looking for Maxwell himself.   Wynne is probably the best kept secret among fictional suspense writers out there.  If you like lots of action and do not get turned off by explicit language and excessive violence, I'd strongly recommend this book.
