 This definitely isn't Clancy's best writing but an improvement over Red Rabbit which was downright awful.   Jack Ryan's son, Jack, Jr, becomes a player in the game of terrorist hunting and espionage.  While Jack, Jr is only 23 years old, Clancy turns his character into spoiled brat of sorts. He makes too many references to his "daddy" instead of carving out his own niche and focusing on his strengths.  The Caruso brothers are very interesting new characters but the criteria used to select them to hunt down terrorists is highly unbelievable.  He also fails to mention how these guys are related to Ryan.  Very action-packed with good dialogue among the Muslims and South American drug dealers.  If you are new to Clancy's writings, you might enjoy this one.  However, if you've read epics like Executive Orders or Without Remorse, you will come away feeling a little empty.
