 Though this book was somewhat predictable, it was very entertaining and had lots of action scenes.  Top gun pilot, Trey Woods, gets involved with the Israeli government to avenge the death of his close friend and roommate while on a trip to Israel visiting his girlfriend. The murderers responsible are an Islamic group with roots dating back over a thousand years.    Very intense dialogue accompanies this novel with a sub-plot of an Arab-American working for the CIA as an analyst to track down the leader of this terrorist group. The author really shows the realities of an Arab American working in an environment which fosters anti-Arab sentiments.    This was my first Huston novel and will not be the last.
