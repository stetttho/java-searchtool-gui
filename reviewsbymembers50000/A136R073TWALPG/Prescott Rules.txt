 I read this book in only two sittings because I could not put it down.  Prescott brings back two of his more interesting characters, Tess McCallum, FBI agent and Abby Sinclair, "The Shadow Hunter."  As expected, the two women do not get along very well when hunting down a serial killer but they must learn to work together in accomplishing this feat.    The book had a good combination of action, humor and sadness.  The exchanges between Tess McCallum and her boss, "The Nose" are classics.  They had me rolling on the floor.    Prescott is slowly becoming one of the my favorite mystery writers.
