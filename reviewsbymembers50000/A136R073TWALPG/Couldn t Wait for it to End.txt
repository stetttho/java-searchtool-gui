 Many readers on various book sites would tell me, "you've gotta read the Kidd series by Sandford."  This was the first that I read and it was a bit of a snore.  This Kidd individual seems pretty shallow as his character has no depth or reality to it. LuEllen was a more interesting person than Kidd and maybe it would have been better if the story centered on her.  Don't waste your time with this one.  Sandford should stick with his "Prey" series.
