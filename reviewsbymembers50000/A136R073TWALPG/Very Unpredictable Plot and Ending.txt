 This was my second Lee Child novel featuring his protagonist, Jack Reacher, and I very thorougly enjoyed the story.  Jack Reacher,an ex MP from the Army, is a drifter who is hitching a ride in a small rural town in Texas and picked up by a mysterious woman who tells him she's in trouble.  The problem is that much of her story does not add up and Reacher, being an ex-cop, becomes suspicious of her.    A very intense novel with many twists and turns throughout much of it. A very enjoyable reading for those who like action packed mysteries.
