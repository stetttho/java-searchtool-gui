 I generally hate it when singers attempt to sing '60's and '70's Motown that were not a part of the Organization during that era. However, MM is an exception.  He offers his own style without taking the funk and soul out of the music like many other pop artists, namely Mike Bolton and Linda Ronstadt, are notorious of doing.  He delivers very powerful heart thumping vocals that are impossible for any singer to replicate.  His opener, "Heard it Thru the Grapevine," set the stage for some great rhythms with terrific instruments and background singers throughout the track. "Ain't no Mountain" is another great rendition by him.  Usually, no matter how great the record, there are at least one or two bad songs but such doesn't appear to be the case here.  Michael McDonald has released one of the top CD's of the year.
