 This is a great cd.  I can never get tired of listening to it.  It has some funky beats and powerful lyrics.  Tupac Shakur was one of the most brilliant musicians of the 20th century and wrote some powerful lyrics.  After I first listened to this cd, I really had a hard time listening to any other rap because it goes downhill from this one.
