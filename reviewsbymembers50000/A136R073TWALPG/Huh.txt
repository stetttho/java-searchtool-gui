 While Killer Takes All was a well written suspense novel, I was amazed at some of the characters in the novel.  The setting was in New Orleans and much of it centered on the NOPD.  The nagging question is, "where were all the people of color." With the exception of an overweight secretary mentioned earlier in the book, there was no mention of any black characters and I am still in a bit of shock.  When I read this book, you would think that the setting was in some remote village in Minnesota or Wisconsin, not NO.  The storyline itself was good but I was a bit disappointed in the lack of diversity in this book. I guess some of us simply do not belong in Ms Spindler's little club.  :( I don't think I'll read Ms. Spindler's books again.
