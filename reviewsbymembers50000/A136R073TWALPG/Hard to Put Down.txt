 Very suspenseful tale about a "Ted Bundy" type individual who has singlehandedly placed fear in every brunette in the Twin Cities area.  He's a very twisted bloodthirsty yet highly intelligent professional man who makes these rules for killing individuals.  Davenport plays the cynical yet smart and passionate detective who uses unorthodox but effective methods of tracking the killer.   Very heart pounding in your face thriller and quite a debut for Sandford.  Davenport's character is very easy to dislike in this one because he demonstrates the thin line that separates him and the killer.   Sandford has given us a hero who is very flawed but he's being realistic in his approach.  Face it, not every individual who hunts down bad guys is a highly moral self-righteous church goer who wants us all to get along.  DAvenport is highly selfish and very much a womanizer.  He is also smart, ruthless and tough.  These attributes are necessary when going after a cold-blooded killer.
