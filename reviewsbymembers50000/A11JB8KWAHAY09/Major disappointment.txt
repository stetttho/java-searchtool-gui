 I loved "The Red Dragon" and "The Silence of the Lambs" but this third episode was a major disappointment for me. I found I simply couldn't believe Hannibal Lecter living a new life as a  Dante scholar in Florence. And the whole sub-plot with the wild pigs is a  mess. As for the end, well... a lot of the other reader reviews have said  it already. I simply couldn't accept it, especially as the progression to  that point doesn't ring true. All in all, a big let-down.
