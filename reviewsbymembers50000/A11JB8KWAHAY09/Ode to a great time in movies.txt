 Hollywood produced some great movies in the 70s. Nowadays, most of its production seems aimed at the lowest common denominator, with occasional hints of what used to be from the independents and in studio prestige  projects. Biskind's excellent and eminently readable study shows just how  that situation came about, how visionary directors like Altman, Coppola,  Scorsese and Ashby were either shunted off into the sidelines (often  through their own doing) or forced to sell out to the system. A perfect  introduction to the modern state of Hollywood.
