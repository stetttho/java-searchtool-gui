 A gripping thriller, ideal for a long train journey or flight. What makes it stand out is its compassionate and intelligent portrayal of the world of the Deaf (with a capital D). Any run-of-the-mill writer would have used  deafness as a McGuffin without taking it any further. Deaver's sensitivity  makes his book stand out from the rest of the pack.
