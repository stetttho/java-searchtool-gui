 Here in France, we're not familiar with Julie Taymor's work and "Titus" was given a very limited, woefully short release in Paris earlier this year. The DVD has allowed me to catch up on one of the most powerful interpretations of a Shakespeare play that I have ever seen (and having been raised within spitting distance of Stratford-Upon-Avon, I've seen a few in my time). This DVD edition is particularly worth getting for all the insightful extras that it contains. Julie Taymor is an articulate, passionate and, above all, incredibly coherent lady. I can't wait to see her take on the life of Frida Kahlo. The performances are astounding. Hopkins towers over the whole production but he finds his match in Jessica Lange's perfect Tamora (the American accent may grate on British ears at first but even that has its justification in Taymor's approach - and it works). Equal praise to Alan Cumming, Harry Lennix and the touching Laura Fraser. The artwork by the geniuses working at Cinecitt is worthy of the rest. It's tragic to think that few directors use these guys' talents anymore. "Titus" may shock some people with its violence but simply because it strikes closer to the bone than any Hollywood "shoot 'em up" spectacular. This is violence that hurts and it's too bad that more directors don't have the guts to tackle it.
