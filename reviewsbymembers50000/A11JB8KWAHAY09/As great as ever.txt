 I can't believe there aren't more reviews for this album (I'd give it ten stars if I could). Isn't anyone buying it? It hasn't been out of my CD-player since it arrived from Amazon three weeks ago. Richard Shindell is  one of the best singer-songwriters working today and this tops the  hat-trick of his first three albums (all worth buying, by the way, along  with "Cry, Cry, Cry"). The crystal-clear production, excellent  playing and magnificent melodies make "Somewhere Near Paterson"  really stand out. Shindell's songs are powerful and haunt you throughout  the day. They're beautifully written, full of amazing images (especially  "Transit" on this album). I can't imagine anyone coming out with  anything better this year.
