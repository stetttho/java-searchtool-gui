 This collection of stories, by one of my favourite American authors, describes a world that most European readers, this one included, know nothing about. Yet, despite the sheer alien nature of this world for me,  the stories touched and moved me with their beauty, imagery and  finely-tuned writing. Proulx makes no concessions and the collection is all  the stronger for it. "The Half-Skinned Steer" still haunts me  now, months after I finished reading it. And the implacable fatalism of  "Job History" is terrifying. I can't wait for the next book by  this writer.
