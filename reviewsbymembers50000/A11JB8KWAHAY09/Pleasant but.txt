 I don't really know what to think of this book. True, it is a sensuous experience at times with its wonderful descriptions of the chocolate-making process. However, having lived in a small French village for six years now,  I find the description of village life a little too twee and  "touristy". A real village priest would never have the power that  the one in the book has (at the start of the novel anyway). And the village  itself is a little too idealised. Most of the people in my village would  never be able to afford Vianne's chocolates. There again, the back-stabbing  atmosphere of a small French village is spot-on. Read it but don't expect  to find Lansquenet on your next trip to France.
