 I discovered Norman Lewis through an article by that other great travel writer Pico Iyer in his "Tropical Classical" collection. "The World, the World" is an excellent introduction to an  extraordinary travel writer, man whose life has to be read about to be  believed. This is a man totally in tune with his times both at home and  abroad (his description of his English village is as powerful as his  writing on Cuba and the plight of the Amazonian Indians). There's also a  great deal of humour here, particularly when Lewis describes his travels  with Lord Snowden in Peru. Highly recommended.
