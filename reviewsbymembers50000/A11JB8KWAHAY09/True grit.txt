 After all the readable but increasingly outlandish thrillers by Patricia Cornwell, P.D. James, Nelson DeMille et al that I've read and enjoyed over recent years, it's a pleasant surprise to come across a writer as gritty as  Rankin (a bit like a Scottish James Ellroy). His dialogue leaps off the  page and rings in your ears, while the labyrinthine plotting keeps you  reading well after bed-time. A great deal of the force of this novel comes  from the fact that Rebus is a "human" character with his failings  and foibles. I'm definitely going to read more of Rankin's stuff.
