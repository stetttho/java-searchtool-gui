 At last, here on CD, the soundtrack of one of my favourite films of all time. I still remember the shock I had on seeing "Nashville" for the first time on TV a few years after its initial release - the great performances, magnificent storytelling and innovative style knocked me out. I was able to see the movie again just a few years ago on the big screen and was delighted to see that it hasn't aged. But I couldn't get my hands on the soundtrack. But now here it is, as wonderful as all the rest. The songs stand the test of time as well as the film and there are plenty of jewels here - the magnificent "It Don't Worry Me" in both versions, Keith Carradine's Oscar winner "I'm Easy", Karen Black's cute contributions and Henry Gibson's "200 Years" (interesting to see that another reviewer views this as a patriotic song. Personally, I've always found it brilliantly and satirically funny). But the real stand-out is Ronee Blakely. Her songs and voice are absolutely magnificent. It's high time some enterprising company re-released her solo album(s) because, apart from her backing vocals on Dylan's "Hurricane", the "Nashville" soundtrack seems to be the only recording available on CD of this magnificent lady's work.
