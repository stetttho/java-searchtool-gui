 After years without picking up a novel by Dickens (memories of starchy classes at school), I decided to plunge into "Bleak House", a novel that had been sitting on my bookshelf for about ten years, waiting to  be read. Although I found it heavy going at first, mainly because the style  is so unfamiliar to modern readers, after about ten pages I was swept up  and carried off, unable to put the hefty tome down until I had finished it.  This book is a definite classic. The sheer scope of the tale, the wit of  the satire (which could still be applied to many legal proceedings today)  and the believable characters gripped me up until the magnificent  conclusion. One particularly striking thing is the "cinematic"  aspect of certain chapters as they switch between different angles,  building up to a pitch that leaves the reader breathless. I can't recommend  "Bleak House" too highly. And I won't wait so long before reading  more Dickens novels.
