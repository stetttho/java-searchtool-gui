 It's hard to imagine what would have happened if Nazi Germany had won the war. But Harris comes up with a brilliant portrait of life in Germany in the 60s, with Hitler still in office, the rest of Europe grouped into a  European Union controlled from Berlin and Joseph Kennedy as the US  President. Onto this background, he grafts an excellent, well-paced  thriller that is a real page-turner, ideal for long winter evenings.
