 I don't know this translation but "The Skin" is one of the most powerful books that I have ever read. Ostensibly a portrait of Naples following the city's liberation by the allied forces in 1943, it in fact  provides a view of the state of Europe before, during and in the immediate  aftermath of the Second World War. Rather than a constructed narrative,  it's a series of episodes set in war-time Naples or on the Russian Front  where Malaparte witnessed the horrors committed by the Nazis (one  particularly terrifying episode set in a Russian forest at night will haunt  me for a long while). There are also lighter moments (such as the blackly  comic dinner for American officers when the last surviving fish of the  Naples aquarium is served on a bed of coral) but the one thing that comes  to the fore throughout is the sheer power of the survival spirit, the  lengths that human beings will go to save their skin. Malaparte's  magnificently poetic language makes this one of the classics of the 20th  century.
