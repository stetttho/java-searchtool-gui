 This is a fascinating, beautifully written novel, a fictionalised account of the white rajahs of Borneo. It may seem like heavy going at first but, if you stick with it, you'll soon find yourself caught up in the story. The  characters spring to vibrant life and you can almost sense the dense,  stifling jungle all around them. And, above all, it is a magnificent tale  of love.
