 Once again, Robert Harris's skilful blending of fiction and history has produced another page-turner. "Enigma" is a powerful thriller, packed with suspense and plot-twists. It's also a very vibrant portrait of  war-time Britain, with the black-out, food rationing and all those stiff  upper lips. The characters are believable and the whole book pays a  wonderful tribute to all those unknown men and women who helped win the  war.
