 This is a wonderfully satisfying novel. Although not as spectacular in its range as the "Quincunx", Palliser's latest returns to the same period and provides another furiously enjoyable pastiche of the Victorian  novel. Much of the pleasure of "The Unburied" comes from being  one step ahead of the protagonist and wondering when he will at last  realise what has happened - a little like a literary equivalent of  "Look out, he's behind you!" The stifling world of the cathedral  close is rendered perfectly and the whole novel is bathed in an eerie  atmosphere that makes you keep turning the pages, eager for more.
