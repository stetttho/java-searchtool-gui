 I just finished reading Blink by Malcolm Gladwell; it's a fascinating little book about how some people make extremely accurate split second decisions. On the back it suggests placing the book in the "Self Help/Psychology" section of the book store, which I find a bit perplexing, it is about psychology, but it's nowhere near a self help book, in fact it reads like an extended New Yorker magazine article, which it might be, since Gladwell writes for the magazine. I remember reading some of his pieces before, and I've been recommended his web site by a friend. Anyway, it is interesting why some people are able to see things in a glance that regular people can't. I particularly found the section, 7 Seconds In The Bronx, which discusses what went wrong in the 1999 Amadou Diallo shooting (he was basically in the wrong place at the wrong time and took 41 bullets for it) and what it says about people under pressure and police officers in particular was quite revealing. But all of the chapters were equally interesting and well written. I found it though provoking to evaluate how I personally used "thin-slicing" (looking at limited individual moments of time with scrutiny) in daily life.
