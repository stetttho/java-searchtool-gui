 The Best Democracy Money Can Buy by Greg Palast, a fascinating, eye-opening and disturbing collection of investigative journalism. Greg Palast is an investigative journalist, who is currently working for the BBC and The Guardian. He formerly worked fighting corporations with Labor Unions and consumer groups. He brings his investigative experience from these organizations to uncover greed, avarice, and injustice the world over. He is probably most well know for uncovering the voting shenanigans in Florida during the last election, which makes up most of the first chapter of this book. His documentation is meticulous, and his style is straight forward and to the point. He takes on the Bush family and the corporations (i.e. Enron) and countries (i.e. Saudi Arabia) that have supported them throughout their political lives. He also has a lot to say about deregulation of power, which has significant relevance in light of the recent blackout in the northeast. He also shows how the IMF, World Bank, and WTO have had a negative impact on developing economies and challenges the globalization. Of course he devotes a full chapter to corporate America. In another chapter, he goes after Pat Robertson and Pepsi Cola among others. Furthermore he provides a handy appendix for your turn-resources for action. In that section he lists organizations that are fighting against injustices all over as well as suggestions as to what people can do to get involved. Very motivational.
