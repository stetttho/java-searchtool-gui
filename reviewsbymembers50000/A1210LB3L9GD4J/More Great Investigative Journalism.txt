 I brought along Eric Schlosser's Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labour in the American Black Market to read on my vacation and found it every bit as interesting as his excellent and informative previous book Fast Food Nation. The first section "Reefer Madness" looks at the underground economy of marijuana. It underscores the ridiculous mandatory sentencing drug laws that keep non-violent, low-level drug dealers in jail longer than murderers, rapists, and child molesters. Just another holdover form the overzealous Regan administration's "War On Drugs"-just another misguided governmental policy like prohibition and anti-pornography crusaders (more on this later). Let's just legalize it and tax the hell out of it like cigarettes and alcohol. The second section, "In The Strawberry Fields", is an investigative piece about the exploitation of illegal immigrants and the underclass as laborers in Californian strawberry fields, low pay, no benefits, improper housing, poor conditions, etc...It's tantamount to slave labor, sweat shop style management ethic that we ignore now that most of it takes place offshore in developing countries like China and Vietnam. The whole book makes you want to become an activist, but it also details the system and mentality that you're up against in these situations-so it seems futile. The last section details the folly of the government's demonization of pornography, which seems ridiculous in retrospect since Disney has holdings in pornography these days where hard core images are just a mouse click away. What a waste of time, money, and resources that was. As usual, Schlosser has done an admirable job researching his subjects in revealing the folly of man.
