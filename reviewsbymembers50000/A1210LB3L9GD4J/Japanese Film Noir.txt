 I made a recent purchase of some Kurosawa films form Amazon.com, and I recently watched the first, Stray Dog. It was the first non-samurai movie I've seen since Rhapsody in August, an anti war movie that I saw many years ago and barely remember. I really enjoyed and was quite impressed with this early work of Kurosawa. But this film combines two things that I am really interested. On one level it is film noir, a detective gets his hand gun pick pocketed on a crowded bus and tries to chase down the rabid dog before any other people are killed. The second aspect that appealed to me was that it is set in occupied Japan after the war. The occupation and Meiji restoration are the most interesting historical periods for me; because they are periods of great flux and help explain why Japan is the way it is today. The black markets figure in proximately during the film. On one level it is mediation on the options available to people in post war Japan, the moral choice that ex-army soldier Murakami (Mifune) takes, or the amoral destructive role the thief/murderer Yusa takes. There's a great commentary by Stephen Prince, who also narrated the commentary for the classic, The Seven Samurai. I think I might develop this theme and write any essay on it.
