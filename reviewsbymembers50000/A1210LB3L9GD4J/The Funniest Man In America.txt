 Before heading off to America I wanted to read something entertaining and not so heavy , so I picked up David Sedaris' Dress Your Family In Denim and Corduroy. I think as many as 12 stories had been published n Esquire, GQ, and The New Yorker-so I had read several of them before. However, that did not make them any less funny or enjoyable the second time around. In fact, I enjoyed the collection so much that I basically finished reading it in one day, forcing me to pick another book for the journey. Sedaris never fails to come through with biting, savage, satirical, accurate, and uproariously funny stories. There's a lot to relate to since he writes about families and the petty concerns of the human condition: greed, jealous, envy, pride, vanity, etc...I think there's something that everyone can relate to or at least laugh at.
