 I brought a novel to read on a recent trip, Yellow Dog by Martin Amis. I have to admit I was a bit leery about whether I'd like it or not, since I haven't been impressed with any of his fiction since London Fields (Time's Arrow structurally was interesting, but he holocaust has been so overdone really/ The Information-in terminal and really not all that engaging, a bit of navel gazing novel since it's bout two writers/ Night Train-dreadful American pulp fiction, which shows that you should really stick to what you know). That being said, it is his best novel since London Fields. One of the main reasons I think he is successful with this novel is that he is satirizing the culture and the people that he knows so well: hard men, the royalty, and journalists. I think he has always maintained his masterly stylistic writing and here it is put to goods use, as it usually is with his non-fiction as well (see Experience for a recent example of why Amis is still a great writer). This is an ambitious novel, some of the themes, motifs, and satire includes: the dark side of the male (which is manifested in violence and incest), pornography, the amorality of tabloid journalism, royalty, hardmen/gangsters, father/daughter relationships, and family. I see a sort of similarity in how Amis develops the amoral journalist Clint Smoker to how he developed the lager lout Keith Talent in London Fields-each is the embodiment of all that is wrong with the male species. There are a few weak points to the novel, there is one story strand about a doomed airliner that seems completely superfluous as well as the potential apocalyptic comet that passes the earth without striking it, I guess he was looking for that apocalyptic edge that informed a lot of his mid 80s writing when the cold war was still on-however it seems unnecessary in this case. There are some disturbing sequences in this novel, but overall quite satisfying-it's good to see Amis back on top of his game as far as fiction goes.
