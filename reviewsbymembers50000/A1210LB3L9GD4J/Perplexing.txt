 This is the first book I've read by the Nobel Prize winning S. African novelist.  It was an interesting Kafkaesque novel set in war-ravaged Africa. Michael K. is an aged sexless, hair-lipped simpleton who goes on an inexplicable journey to get his mother to her place of birth to die.  It becomes a strange tale of struggle and survival.  A forceful and curious book, still not exactly sure what to make of it.
