 I loved this book from the first page. There's black humour all the way through it and from my own experience of being an Englishman doing menial work in Scotland (making wooden pallets for three years) of course it was realistic. The three main characters are treated like beasts themselves by their bosses worthless except for the money they represent(the term beasts is what the Scots use to describe livestock).The work they have to do all day is so boring and laborious that all they've got to look forward to at the end of the day is a few drinks in the pub. Oblivion in any form to take them away from the drudgery of their lives. Two of them keep stopping for smokebreaks at the slightest chance, anything to stop this depressing work. Also I liked the way that there weren't any women in their lives, they seemed totally cut off socially from them by circumstance, bad pay and lack of experience. Fenced in themselves, if you like.I liked the bits in the english pub where they sit and drink and there is almost an invisible fence between them and the proper world outside. Sprinkled through the book are plenty of laughs but this will depend on you, the reader, as it is all so subtle. The author doesn't spell everything out for you and there are hidden meanings and hidden laughs all the way through. I'm so glad that books like this that are so different and creative can still be written and find their way to the shop shelves. I'll be keeping an eye out for more of Magnus Mills.
