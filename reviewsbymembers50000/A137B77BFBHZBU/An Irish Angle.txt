    This is a book set in WW1 and concerns mainly three things- the trench warfare, the Irish angle and, of course, the characters themselves. Willie Dunne from Dublin is the hero and he starts out as a fairly simple, if naive young lad of sixteen who cannot live up to his fathers Police force aspirations for him because he is short, so this encourages him to join up to fight for an English King who SB describes once as "The king of Ireland came over from England to visit Ireland" in in doing so gives you a taste of Irish thoughts that will be a main theme in the next three hundred pages. As for the other aspects of the book, you won't see too much of what hasn't been written before but rarely, if at all, will you read one written so beautifully. Of course it's a sad and moving book. Having earlier read Birdsong I found A Long Long Way wasn't quite as powerful or compulsive and I think this is down to the Irish angle which I feel non Irishmen perhaps without the chip on their shoulders will struggle to get into it quite as much. But still a great book.
