    Apparantly this won the Booker Prize in 1999 but God knows how. It was my sister who recommended it and she loved it so what I'm about to say is my opinion only (especially after reading some of the other reviews). I felt this was really a novella of about 100-150 pages with filler material to the extent of 250 pages taking the form of an art history lesson. If, like my sister, you like this sort of thing then you'll love the book. I don't know (or care) how factual the art history is. All I know was that all the art history made the book plod along.    It's about a guy, and not a very likeable one either, who thinks he's discovered a lost masterpiece by Breugal/ Breughal, Shmegal or whoever it is. Our Hero (can't remeber his name)tries to con it out of the owner and excuse himself in the process while trying not to let his greed wreck his own marriage. That's the plot for what it's worth. I would have liked more about his marriage and his base instincts delved into by MF rather than the history lesson which seemed to leave my brain as soon as it entered it. For an attempted farce it was very short on laughs as well but again, when you lecture the reader on art for so long he/she is hardly going to be in the frame of mind for a laugh, no matter how hard the author may try.    But, like I said it has its fans so it's a love or hate book. And I hated it.
