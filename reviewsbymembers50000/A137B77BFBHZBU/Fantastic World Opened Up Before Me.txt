       I'm totally amazed at Memoirs of a Geisha. I wouldn't  normally get a book like it but my friend and I are taking  turns to pick a book out of the BBC's top One Hundred and  this month it's Athur Goldens.  This intricate, beautiful novel kept me totally spellbound  throughout its 420 closely printed pages. I'm SO happy to  have chosen it and read it. It's a little tough emotionally  in the way The Grapes Of Wrath is or perhaps Clan of the  Cave Bear but there are many feel-good moments in amongst  the feel-bad moments. And you can't but help to appreciate  the beauty of some of the characters despite their customs  sometimes seeming so alien. The cleverness of the plot  pulls you along also and now that I've finished it I know I  will be hunting on the net, hungry for more info on Geishas.    I'm amazed I hadn't even heard of this book until  recently.
