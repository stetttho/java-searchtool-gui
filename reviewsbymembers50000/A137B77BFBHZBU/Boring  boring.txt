 This book was just far too long for the little it achieves. The characters all seemed two dimensional, the plot plodded along to the extent that I found it difficult to focus and concentrate and was always wondering if I was missing something.I kept asking myself why was D Tartt going into this much detail. And I couldn't believe one review I read that suggested that if you don't like the book then you're stupid. No, if you don't like the book it's just because you're too bored reading it to take it all in. I just wish I'd given up after a hundred pages of it instead of wasting so many more hours of my life, but I persisted because I hoped foolishly it would pick-up. I have to say the best thing about the book was the very attractive D Tartts photo inside the back cover. I would advise people to look at that and ignore the print!
