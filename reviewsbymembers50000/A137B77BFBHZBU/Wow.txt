    Fantastic book. All you need to know about punctuation. There have been times in the last few years where bad punctuation in society has rubbed off on me to the extent where I've wondered if I've been getting things wrong (and I have, some of the time). It's great to have everything clearly, logically and so entertainingly laid out. A word of warning though: If you think you know it all ( and maybe you do) then don't bother getting the book. It is for learning from and it won't entertain if you don't need to learn. I can't believe some of the comments from other nit-picking reviewers. Get a life, and rejoice in the fact that someone out there realises that people like me, who support the book industry by buying books, will appreciate them more and spend more money.
