 This is a little masterpiece of a book which is told beautifully in the first person.It narrates the cynical thoughts of its hero cleverly and compulsively as he goes to new york for three days after getting kicked out of school.That is the plot for what it's worth,but the book is mainly about author Salingers cynical take on life and the human race(I suppose this is why,even now,he's a recluse).The hero of the book,Holden Caulfield,is grieving over his dead brother and this is,in my humble opinion,salingers device for putting older more cynical thoughts into his young heros'.I do feel that we all learn of the "phoniness" as we grow up but I would have found it a little hard to swallow that such a young man could be SO extreme without Salingers device.On the subject of phoniness I'm sure we could all talk for hours.For me,what makes this a great book is the prose which is fantastic.
