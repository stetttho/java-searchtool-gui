    This story is about a different time and a different place. A family whose father is away are on an idyllic holiday in the Lake District for two weeks and the group of children are allowed to spend all of it camping on an island and sailing. They pretend to be grownups and meet another couple of kids who are pretending to be pirates. Reading this now as an adult was enjoyable enough for me to know I would have loved it when I was a kid. The book made me feel a bit sad in that I don't think this world exists anymore though perhaps it could if kids had the right parents. There's no TV, no personal hi-fi's with their sexual innuendo-filled songs etc. It also shows that kids can, with a little help from the parents, get by for long periods on their own. I don't think parents would allow this nowadays but maybe I'm wrong. A fun read, I'd advise you to get it for your kids then go camping!
