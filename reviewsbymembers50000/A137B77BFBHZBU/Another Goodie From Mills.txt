      This is a strange book set in an almost dreamlike world where the characters speak English and have British characteristics but live isolated on a prairie in individual tin houses miles apart from each other. Things that would be superficial to the story- jobs, shops, transport etc. are deliberately omitted allowing the author to force more focus on character interaction. As with Mill's first two books he hints and suggests at things all the way through. Perhaps as a successful author now and continuing to live in London, Magnus Mills wife has been wanting to move into the country to `get away from it all', I don't know, but there must be a reason for the lecture at the end. Apart from the narrator who is once again nameless, Mills shows the characters that have got away from it all are still very needy of companionship and city life. I'm not convinced by the religious references made by other reviewers.       Once again the prose style of Mills is compelling to the extent where you will wonder why you enjoy it so much. You will see humour and hidden meanings all the way through and, sometimes, it will be easy to see or imagine more than intended, and sometimes you will see less. But sometimes, delightfully, you will wonder what the hell is going on...but you know there's something!
