 As far as the philosophy in this book is concerned I don't think it teaches us anything we didn't know already but it does so very well and entertainingly.I found the book very sad at times because,all the way through it,I was reminded of life and the people and situations I've experienced at work and socially.I would find it hard to understand a reader who ,while reading,was not put in mind of many people in their own lives.I even thought of the LLoyds building in London which got a slating from the critics but I thought is fantastic.It's a compulsive read.I've a couple of gripes-one with the romantic side which just didn't do it for me and the didactisisms liberally spread through the book.I found also that the only character I really cared about in the end was G.Wynand.I read another review on this site by a reader slagging the book off and he reminded me of E.Toohey!I've given the book four stars because all the way through the book little things are striking a cord with me again and again.
