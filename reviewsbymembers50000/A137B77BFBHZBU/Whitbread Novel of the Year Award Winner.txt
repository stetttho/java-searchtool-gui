    This book is almost totally about how it is written. And that is in the first person from the perspective of a fifteen year old with Asperger's Syndrome which, from what I gather from the book, is a kind of Autism or at least similar. Yes, there is a plot which moves things along but the book is about the prose which details the hero's life and thought processes. It is so different but clear and sharp and absolutely charming. From the word Go I couldn't put it down. I picked it up at six o'clock and finished it at one in the morning. I was reminded a little of the first Adrian Mole diary which when I read it also had a plot but succeeded mainly due to its prose.    Mark Haddon's brilliant book starts with the discovery of a dead dog with a garden fork sticking through it and with him deciding to do a murder investigation. I will say no more of the plot. Sometimes the book is very sad and a few times its laugh- out- loud funny as the hero has his daily struggle with the world and the people in it. I think that this is a modern classic and I like to think that in a hundred years from now it'll still be in the shops.
