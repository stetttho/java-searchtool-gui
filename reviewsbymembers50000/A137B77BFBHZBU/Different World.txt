 A friend of mine recommended this book after he'd spent some time in the army and africa (not at the same time) and thought it would show me what a different world it is. The first half of the book is about the background- Sierra Leone (I keep calling it Sergio Leone!), the history, Freetown (the Capital), the gold and diamond mines, the army, the rebel army, the mercenaries, the Mammy Yoko Hotel etc. The second half of the book really takes off after the coup and the rebels loot, rape and pillage the capital untill they turn their attentions to the Mammy Yoko Hotel and the sheltering inhabitants. Will Scully- ex SAS(pilgrims) is left having to defend them against over a thousand rebel soldiers with limited arms in which to do so. It really is an amazing read and an insight not just into the world of Sierra Leone but of men like Will Scully. My kind of hero- it wasn't his job to do this. Cometh the hour, cometh the man doesn't usually happen- but it did this time and I'd advise everyone to partake in his memories. Fantastic book.
