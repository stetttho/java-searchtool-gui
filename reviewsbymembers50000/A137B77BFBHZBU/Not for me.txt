  First I'd better explain my reasons for the three stars. This book didn't do a lot for me because of my own inability to understand Olde English. I don't have the version I read of King lear listed on amazon so I don't know if other versions are dumbed down for the lies of me or if they're all in Olde English. I needed to refer to Amazon reviewers twice to understand what was going on. And although I could write down a pretty accurate summary of the plot I couldn't become emtotional at all while reading it due to having to work out what I was reading. I read this book due to the feeling that I'm missing out on something and I still feel that now. I would advise people like me to find a modernised version if they can and good luck.
