    I'm a big fan of Hornby so had to get this. It's taken me over a year to read it. Some parts are brilliant, some are okay and some are dull. It's the dull ones that cause me to put the book down for long periods. I like the way Hornby thinks, he just always seems so clued up on modern life and people. I had a major problem with the Songs as I didn't recognise 29 of them. Now, the book is written so you don't NEED to be familiar with them but I know it would have helped my apreciation of the book, as would a greater love for music than I have. The book is mostly about what certain songs have meant to him in his life and the idea is that the reader will also feel a link while reading. Which I did for the most part but...so frustrating not knowing these songs. I can see from other reviewers that you can now get a CD for it which you couldn't when I got the book. I would strongly advise people to get the CD as well. Good luck.
