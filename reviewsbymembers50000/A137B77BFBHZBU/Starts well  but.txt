    Seeing such an exciting title made me grab it off the shelf. 'Bridget Jones with attitude' indeed. It started well but wasn't really written in Diary form- anymore than practically any story written in the first person is a diary. You get the occasional start of a chapter like 'Wednesday Morning 20th' but what follows is first person prose. From the first it grips you for a few pages with tales of our heroine and a friend on a job with a 'John'. But it just seems to go nowhere and the little amount of porn in it becomes boring, just like most porn. The book obviously has the selling point and so they make the quick buck but in the long term I don't think books like this are good for the industry. If someone buys it to read on a flight or a train journey, next time they'll take a gameboy instead. I found the premise of a girl wanting to be a callgirl from the age of fourteen unbelievable. The author tries to make it work but it didn't for me. I understand that most girls get into this via drugs or poverty or abuse and part of me found this rose-tinted picture the authoress was painting a little offensive. I think there's so much suffering in the world of prostitution but you don't see it here. The only downside is the narrator worrying if her straight boyfriend will find out. There's no drugs, no pimps, no really dodgy clients, everything's just fine. The other characters all seemed like caricatures - you know, there's the mad one, the prim one, the matriarchal Madame. Well, at least they got my money from me- well done to them for that!
