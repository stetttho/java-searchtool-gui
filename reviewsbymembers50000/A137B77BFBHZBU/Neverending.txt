  This is about a brainwashed, ex-Guantanamo Bay, al-qaida recruit who has some 'special mission' lined up for him if only he can make it across the desert alive to meet up with his new 'family'. I was expecting that halfway through, he would, and the second half of the book would be about his mission in New York or wherever. But no, this goes on right till the end. Gerald Seymore has written so many great books that for me this was a big disappointment. There are no likeable characters in the book. The walk across the desert for some of the characters seemed to go on forever and I wondered why Seymore was doing this, going on and on and on- does he get paid per word? There were the odd killings thrown in almost as if the author sensed the journey would be tedious. The best parts of the book was the by-play between Bart and Wroughton but there wasn't much of this and far too much boring by-play between the Recruit and his guides in the desert who were portrayed as callous, ignorant fanatics to the extent where you just wanted them all to get shot. If you want a good Seymore get The Journeyman Tailor (my favourite) or The Contract.
