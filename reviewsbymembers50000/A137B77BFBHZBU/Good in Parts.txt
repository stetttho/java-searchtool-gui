  This book was okay but confusing in that I can't for the life of me see how it deserves all the praise heaped on it. No way is it up to Steinbecks standard. It was told in the first person by a character called Nick Carraway who, it must be said, is a very boring character.The others in the book seem SO two dimensional. It was an okay book though, just like a thousand others on the shelves.
