  A few years ago Yann Martel read a review by John Updike on a Brazillian book entitled Max and the Cats. The book was about a jewish zookeeper in 1933 who was migrating to escape the nazi's . His ship sunk and he ended up in a lifeboat with a black panther (which represented naziism). Martell then tried to buy the book but there was no trace (Updike criticised it). Martell felt aggrieved that it was such a great idea to be poorly executed and go out of print. Anyway a few years later, in India, he realised in a moment of inspiration, how he could write a great book with it. This is Martells account of how life of Pi came to be.    The book concerns a young lad of sixteen call Piscene Molitar Patel and is set in India. When the ship capsizes Pi is left on board a lifeboat with a zebra, orang utan, a hyena and a tiger. There is no doubt it is a great book. The first half of it concerns knowledge of animals. i.e. Zoomorphism and how animals behaviour can be logical if you understand it- like rhinos sharing a compound with goats etc. Also, we are told a bit about lion-taming and the animal psycology behind it. All of this non-fiction type stuff has a point, as you will find out later on in the book. What I liked was that everything seemed to have a point later on. There a gory bits and sad bits in the book and it was extremely compelling. I just loved it- I didn't know about Max and the Cats until afterwards. I'm not sure if The Booker Prize panel knew about it. But even though it's not quite as original as some obviously think (after looking at reviews) I still loved it and would recommend it.
