     I loved The Restraint of Beasts and in some ways this book is very similar. Once again it is told in a deadpan first person style by a nameless character who seems out of work but can financially afford to expect to travel eastern europe soon. As in Mill's first book our hero doesn't have any friends or family but we're not told if this is down to his nomadic lifestyle or vice-versa. He is pulled into the local community bit by bit due to his subconscious need for company, or the need to belong. Mill's shows that people this needy can be used n' abused to the extent where they can become unwitting servants. The books back cover suggests its about innocence against experience but I'd liken it to weakness against strength or an outsider against an insider. A few laughs again and, as in his first book, some of these will be up to the reader as it's all so subtle. One problem I had with the book though is that you lose the novelty a bit which is natural but I do wonder if Mills can keep this up and continue to be successful. For instance I loved Restraint of Beasts, liked AQon the O/Express very much  and wonder if four or five books down the line I'll just find them okay. Anyway, this book is worth a shot!
