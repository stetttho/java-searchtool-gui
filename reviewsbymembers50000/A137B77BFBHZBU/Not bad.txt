    I found this short story (155 pages) quite good. It's about a creative writing teacher called Rowland who glimpses a students (Chris) brilliant work and becomes overtaken by jealousy. The student uses the jealousy of Rowland to motivate him and so at times even encourages the jealousy. As Rowland becomes more and more obsessed with his student the secret of the jealousy and obsession comes out to the extent where everyone knows about it. Slowly but surely both protagonists go a bit mad with it all. I think I would have preferred it if the jealousy thing hadn't been so strong as to drive them mad and if Chris had been painted as a little more normal. Rowlands wife Nina is shown to be awfully passive in all this: Muriel Spark excuses Nina, saying she is already thinking she will split from Rowland but I would have liked her to have done more. In fact, the women in this book were SO weak, all of them.  However, as I said, quite a good short story.
