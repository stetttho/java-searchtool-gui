    The strong point of this novel is in the characters. The heroine, lilly, runs away from home with her family servant- a black woman called Rosaleen (think of 1960's Southern USA- to Kill a Mocking Bird etc). And are put up by a family of black sisters (real sisters) who keep bees and own their land living off the honey. The characters are beautifull (if a little caricatured) and the sisters, mainly matriarchal August look after young Lilly while she comes to terms with the early trauma of her life. On the downside, life with the sisters seems a bit rose -tinted to me with one of them, June, put in as obvious balance. It's not very challenging to read and all the religeous stuff grated on me after a while. The racist/victim side left me feeling I've seen it all before. But still worth a read.
