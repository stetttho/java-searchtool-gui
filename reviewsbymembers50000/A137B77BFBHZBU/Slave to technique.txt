 My problem with CofKings is the same with the other books(I'm on Storm of Swords at the moment);I find the authors copied (or perhaps influenced) technique of changing the character at the end of every chapter prevents me from really getting into the characters or the book.Some of these characters are quite boring and it's frustrating when you've read 5 or 6 pages of a character like Jon Snow,are just getting into it and suddenly the chapter ends with sometimes a quite contrived formulaic hook.Then you turn the page and the next chapter is entitled 'Catlyne' and you groan inwardly.All of these books are written like this and I will persevere and finish them but,my god,they're hard work.No depth to the characters or storyline.The names of the chief characters are different but we still have the trekking from one place to the other-prisoners escaping and trekking,children escaping and trekking,trekking,trekking! Heroes being outnumbered two to one but winning etc.I've recently read a novel (Birdsong) about WW1 and the depth of characters and reality of the battlescenes puts Mr Martin to shame.Perhaps I've just read too many fantasy books and I should switch genres-I will complete his serier first though but I won't recommend them to you!
