 This is a good book that I feel different people will get different things from. I'm no quantum theorist however so I should have flipped through these parts more than I did and concentrated on the politics and the war parts which were excellent. The quantum theorem stuff gave me a headache but if you can hang in there I'm sure it'll add to your appreciation of the book. I felt a little impatient all the way through as I wanted to read about Trinity and Hiroshima and the politics behind them. And it was interesting to read about the hopes and fears of the very human but brilliant scientists. I liked the way the book linked the dropping of the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki all the way back to before the first world war, the lack of unconditional surrender in 1918 and so the desire for it in 1945, many Jews fleeing from Germany in the thirties including their top scientists, the fear of Hitler getting the bomb first etc. It just all seems inevitable with the gift of hindsight but this book shows the uncertainty and fears of the days and long candlelit nights. I think anyone who is contempuous towards the people involved in the arrival of nuclear weapons should read this book and at least speak from knowledge rather than emotion.
