 While reading the Ragged Trousered Philanthropists I was aware that I was reading a truly great book but also that the prose and structure was poor. I think that, in a strange way, the book benefits from this as it gives the pages a raw genuine feel. It's a little repetitive, didactic and author Tressel is tough on his characters.It was strange for me reading about similar boss corruptions, abuses of authority, sycophancy a hundred years ago. Though in those days the target was more work for food, now the target is more is that newer car or perhaps that bigger house.It stinks now as it did then but I was so glad to read a book with it all laid out. John Steinbeck also has touched upon it in the Grapes of Wrath  less brutally but more beautifully. I would like to force everyone to read this book - especially the Misery's. A friend recently told me that the book was initially entitled The Ragged Ars** Philanthropists.Any way it was very good. N.B. I tried to change my rating to four stars but the Amazon site wouldn't let me!
