    This is a phenomenally creative and brilliant book that deserves the term `unputdownable'I read it in two days. Normally when I have a book that is so different it can be boring and doesn't hook me but not this. It's about a very strange character who at first is curiously innocent, nave and almost alien-like. There is a lot of black humour in the book, and this helps to carry the reader through the nasal alchemy, murder etc. I was amazed at how well this translated to English; I think it reads better than a lot of originally English novels. The prose is concise and to the point. Its 260 pages long and I think a lot of other authors would have doubled that. I will be recommending this brilliant, brilliant book to all of my bookreading friends and to all of you.
