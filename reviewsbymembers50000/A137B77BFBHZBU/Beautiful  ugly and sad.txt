    I found this book a compulsive read. An extremely sad journey through it's pages, you just want the journey to end and the book to be over. This book is beatifully written as I knew it would be. The opening chapter is awesomely written and the tragic Joad family are of course wonderful. Despite the critical introduction I never felt preached to and never felt that dialogue from the Joad family was over and above what you'll get from semi-literate, poverty stricken folk.I don't understand why the publishers allowed such a snobby guy to give the introduction which, before I knew it, told me the ending. How stupid can you get? I'd advise you to read the book BEFORE the intro and make your own mind up BEFORE the intro. This book is one of the reasons I love books. It opened up a little world in my mind that I never knew existed in 1930's America. And I keep talking about it to people and comparing it to the world today. Hope you get it.The book is about farm labourers, small-time plot holders who's livelihoods have been taken away by the coming of the tractors and 1930's Depression. These people have been born and brought up to live off the land, ploughing, sewing etc and NOTHING ELSE. So,skill-less,homeless, hungry, desperate and financially broke they migrate West under promises of work in the West and streets lined with Orange trees. Unfortunately, there's half a million people migrating and not nearly enough work. When the family leave Oaklahoma, Buisnessmen use their desperation to bargain down the worth of their lifes belongings and, when they travel they are told early that buisnessmen use the huge numbers of people, and their hunger and desperation, to lower wages. This book made me hate certain aspects of human nature-competition, survival of the fittest, progress etc. But you will love and admire the Joad family.    In all, an intense beautifully written story that had me hungry for every word.
