    I found this book quite refreshing after a couple of recent bad picks. It concerns a love-sick (or lust-sick) 84 yr old male immigrant from the Ukraine who is marrying a thirty-four yr old immigrant who merely wants money and a British passport (in no particular order). The man's two daughters, now grown up in Britain with families of their own, are obviously very against the woman and the marriage. That's the humour side of it. There is a darker side to the story shown as flashbacks to the man and one of his daughters earlier lives in the Ukraine but not too much- just enough to give depth to things. The book is an easy read, a page turner, refreshingly different and delves into subjects like relationships between siblings and dotty old parents. I would highly recommend it.
