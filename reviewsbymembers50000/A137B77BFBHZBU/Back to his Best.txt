    This is about four different people who meet on New Years Eve at a locally famous rooftop suicide spot. How they get to know and support each other after their collective failure to jump off. How they try to get used and deal with the idea of each of them living on. It's all told in the first person with each of them taking turns to move the story on. There isn't that much of a story, the entertainment comes from Hornby using his characters as vehicles for bringing his views on things to you the reader. These views can be funny or insightful or both and because of the nature of the novel being suicide and depression and lack of hope- I found the book so intense that sometimes I HAD to put it down almost to allow myself to ingest the emotions before continuing the next day. Hornby has a terrific voice, knowledgeable and funny and he struggled now and then to keep HIS voice out of all the characters. There's no wasted pages, no filler material at all though the book does lose it's impetus a little as you get through it- I'm not sure if this was me getting used to the subject matter or if Hornby loses his way a bit. Luckily though, it was just good enough in the end to merit the five stars. Original, well written and an easy but intense read.
