    This feels almost like two different books, such is the compelling strength of the section set in WW2 where our heroine (Jean Paget) is leading a group of women who are captured and are being marched hundreds of miles by the japs.  The Japanese weren't going to kill women and children but barely had enough supplies for their own soldiers so they just kept moving the women on with lies of a womens P.O.W. camp in the next place. During this time an Australian soldier (Joe Harman) steals food for them and gets caught and punished. The story is narrated by Jean Pagets solicitor. After the war she inherits a lot of money and goes back to a village that looked after her to build a well. This in turn inspires her to want to go to Joe Harmans rundown old town and do it up till it's `A Town Like Alice' (Alice Springs- a thriving town).     It's a very compelling story told by her solicitor who is very enamoured of her but knows his place (he's 73) though his feelings are very subtly and respectfully represented by the author. It's not perfect- one or two too many coincidences and sometimes it's frustrating when the author delays things happening. But a great book with a beautiful bitter sweet ending. Your heart will ache for the women and children being forced to march 10 to 15 miles for two years with many dying on the way and all suffering and will ache for the sweet old man that met the perfect woman 'forty years too late'.
