      This book is an absolute mess. It's told in the first person by different narrators but as I was bored and so unfocused a lot of the time I was sometimes not sure who was narrating. Heathcliffe the 'hero' was annoying and in some ways pathetic and the heroine Cathy seemed like a spoiled brat. I didn't like the use of dialect either- It's a lot easier to read English as it should be written and imagine an accent to it rather than see these strange alien words in print. What an absolute mess of a book, I can't believe all the praise I see heaped on it.
