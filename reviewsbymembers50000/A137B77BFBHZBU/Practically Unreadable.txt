    I don't owe Franz Kafka or his publishers anything. If you have a good idea why not just write it on a page and publish the one page? If you want to use the good idea to write a book it has to be entertaining or readable or at least interesting. Looking at the other reviews by people who have given it five stars I wonder if I have just read the same book. There are no new paragraphs when he changes the dialogue from one person to the next and the publishers surely should have done this for him because, in not doing so, you keep having to stop to work out who is saying what. The book just crawled along and was so boring. After about sixty pages I remember saying 'alright, I get it, do something else!' Part of me wonders if it's like the emperors new coat and I should just join in with five stars. Although the other reviewers praise the book they don't seem to actually say WHY it's a good book. It was pure mince.
