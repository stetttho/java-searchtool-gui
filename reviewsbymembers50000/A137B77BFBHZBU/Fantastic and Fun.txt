 Forget the hype, will the suspension of your disbelief and enjoy this terrific page-turner. Without spoiling the plot or surprises it's about a Symbiologist (Robert Langdon) who is in France to meet the curator of The Louvre Art Museum. But the meeting never takes place and there follows in the next few hundred pages an incredible eye-opening journey of discovery. Langdon and a Cryptologist (Sophie Neveau) are on a chase to solve a puzzle left for them by the curator. They don't know who the good guys/ bad guys are, they don't know what's on the other end of the puzzle and there are twists and turns all the way through. It reminds me of The Thirty- Nine Steps by John Buchan where you have an ordinary guy (okay, not ordinary but non-cop/ non-crook) just minding his own business and then suddenly caught up in international intrigue and murder and having to stay ahead of both the good guys and the bad because he doesn't know who's on his side. The beginning, ending, and the ride in between are fantastic. The controversial aspects of the book concern Paganism and Catholicism and I'm sure there are many facts but also fallacies - This is fiction. It's nearly six hundred pages long and I read it in a weekend.
