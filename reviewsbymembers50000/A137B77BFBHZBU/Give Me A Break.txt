 I struggled to finish this book although it was only 270 pages. It concerned Sal Paradise and Dean Moriarty hitch-hiking and driving back and forth across America with no apparent purpose. I didn't care (and still don't) about the beat generation stuff, didn't care about Sal or Dean, and just found the whole thing a tedious literary journey. JK said this was "Kickwriting" but unfortunately for me it wasn't kickreading matter. If you like the first twenty pages you'll love the book because it's the same ALL the way through. In amongst its 270 pages I got the occasional smile or the rare warm feeling for the characters but mostly it was a drag. Its books like this that make me realise why so many authors try to break up what they're writing if they can. Everyone liked the trench warfare stuff in Birdsong, for instance, but Sebastian Faulkes moved away from it a few times to break it up I assume because he was worried it would be tedious. So, I've read another American classic. Not in the same league as the Grapes of Wrath. Maybe it was gimmicky or even revolutionary when it first came out but I was reading it NOW and it has to stand on it's own two feet fifty years on. But it couldn't.
