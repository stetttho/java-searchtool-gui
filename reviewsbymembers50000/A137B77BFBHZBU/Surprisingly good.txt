 ...I say surprisingly because I thought I'd given up on shallow chick-lit type books. You know the type, there's 3/4 friends: The mad one, the quiet one, the firey one the normal sisterly one etc. Also there's the big bad world of men out there, split into 2/3 factions: the tall darcy-like handsome ones, the little geeks, the liars, the friendly fatherly types etc. Anyway enough of them. This book does have the similarities- internet dating in this case but still relative strangers. Our heroine (Sam)is a single mum who's been dateless for a few years and some very, I think, strongly written flashbacks show the reader what has created the character that is a loser with men. This was the core of the book, the reasons behind Sams character. This was refreshing and thought provoking. As a male reader I appreciated the thought and care behind all this. Even now I wonder how the author was able to do so much with such a small book under a "Quick Read" banner. What stops it getting the full five stars from me are of course the cliched 'Chicklit' stuff that I've already mentioned, the annoying daughter, and that I found the ending was a little too twee. But I had a much better evening reading this than watching the **** on the telly.
