    This book chronicals the last year of WW2 as a march on Germany with testomonies from the highest powers (Churchill, Roosevelt, Stalin,) to the lowest soldiers and civilians. For me the dominating factor of the book isn't the warring parts as far as 'Market-Garden' or 'The Battle of the Bulge' is concerned but the human tragedy of the civilians. The POW'S, the starving dutch, the raped and murdered East Prussians- the young boys picking up guns to fight and die for the lost Reich at the end. The displaced, the suffering and the dead millions. The megolamania displayed by the likes of Hitler and Stalin comes across strongly in the book in the form of treating thousands of their soldiers like slaves whose lives were individually worthless. I still find it shocking that Hitler and some of his associates killed themselves rather than face the consequences when they had wanted their soldiers to fight to the death. And, of course, if Hitler had suicide in mind then of course he's not going to hasten it by surrendering early and saving thousands of his countrymens lives. The book makes you question morality sometimes, especially when the Western Allies (in comparison to the Russians and the Germans who cared little about their own soldiers lives) appear so backward when it comes to going forward and the result is they were slower to finish things off, during which time POW's and civillians are dying.     I found the first hundred pages slow but then I found I couldn't put it down. This is a great, awe inspiring book that teaches and makes you think about things long after you've finished.
