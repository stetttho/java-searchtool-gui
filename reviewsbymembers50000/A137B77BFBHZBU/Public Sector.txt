    I just love Magnus Mills. I read his first (and best) book The Restraint of Beasts a few weeks ago and have hungrilly read the others since. This one The Scheme.. is a clever mickey-take on our public sectors (civil service and councils) which of course are paid for by taxes from the productive private sector. Politicians in our real world are always trying to cut back/down-size the public sector as many facets of it are just money pits. I work in the private sector and for a while our attitudes mirrored those in The Scheme and we nearly went under. We changed, lost people, became efficient and survived and competed in the private market. What Mills shows us here is how, with the lack of private competition, these people just can't change. They'll strike if the beurocrats downsize, strike if they're asked to work a full day etc. This is why Thatcher in the eighties was privatizing left, right and centre-work and produce or go under. Give us value for money for our taxes. Oh yes, the politicians know about the attitudes behind The Scheme. This is a very clever book. My only gripe was it just wasn't as entertaining as his first two books. It's all very well being clever but I really would like more fun, hence just the three stars this time. I didn't like the comment by the narrator about the two different sides- The Full- Dayers (those that want to work a full day) and The Early Swervers (those that want to slope off early) saying they were bickering and hence blaming both of them instead of just The Early Swervers- It's a bit like blaming two boys for fighting when one had been picking on the other. But I did like how after the strike, certain people obviously realised The Scheme wasn't needed. I know we've had redundancies at my work when certain people have been off sick a long time and have not been missed at all, you just think 'what are they for? Why do we need them? Yes, a very clever book but light on the entertainment side.
