    This is a very simple story, beautifully written though and covering, in my edition, 177 pages. Though it's large print and very short lines across so you read it in a 4/5 hours. It's really a short story or a 'novella'. It reminds me a little of Of Mice and Men in that it's seemingly short and simple but it catches you. I have to say though, some of the praise seems a bit over the top: Life-changing? What the hell are those guys ON?  Whatever it is, I want some! The only thing that spoiled it for me was the Alchemists 'wisdom' dominating late on instead of a story. Loved the ending. Ideal book for a flight or train journey.
