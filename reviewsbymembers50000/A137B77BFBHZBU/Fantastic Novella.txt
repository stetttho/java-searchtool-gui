 This was a wonderful surprise for me after having to put hard times down through boredom. It's about a hundred and thirty pages long with large gaps in between the lines so it took me about three or four hours to read it. Of course I've seen countless actors play Scrooge (George C. Scott my favourite)but really, because there's been so many, none of them dominated my mind while reading. The plot moves along very quickly and little is in the book plotwise which is not in the films. In fact I'm now aware of how much the films 'fleshed out' some of it.Also in the movies you can't get a lot of the Dickens humour which is sprinkled through the prose so it was a great choice for me and will be for you.
