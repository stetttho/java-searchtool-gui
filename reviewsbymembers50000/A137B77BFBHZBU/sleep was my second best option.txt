 Everyone has their own criteria for what makes a great novel-for me the best praise is that(in the words of an earlier reviewer) I was desperate for lunchtime at work and hometime so that I could continue reading.I forwent sleep untill I'd finished the book.It took me three days when a similar-length novel can take me months.When  you sacrifice things to read a book you KNOW you have a pearl.When you "don't have the time" you have an also-ran. This book,for me,had everything:Fantastic prose(Austen-like),deep characters,convoluted plot,humour, supense.I shy from naming a favourite character out of fear of disloyalty to the others! I'd previously read Brave New World and it was just so awful with it's two dimensional characters and plot (albeit an outstanding idea)and I think this helped my appreciation of The Woman in White.I'd never even heard of it until recently.I,of course, would recommend you read this and,short of weddings,funerals,etc.be prepared to sacrifice your engagements!
