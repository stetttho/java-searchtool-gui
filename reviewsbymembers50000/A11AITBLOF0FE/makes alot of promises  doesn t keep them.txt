 This cd mp3 player really excited me when I first opened it and tried it out(I bought it half price at a retail store).  It supports mp3 long file name, and has a nice bluelit background display.  Here is the problem: cheaply built.  What happens is this cd player reads your mp3 cds no problem (takes 30 seconds to add up tracks, but not so bad at all) and then when you touch the door, i mean hardly even tap it!, or even if you, say, hold the cd player and walk--it will display a 'door open' reading.  at which point it stops playing. and then you must push the door shut and it will then reread the cd. then you pick a track on the nice navigation menu (the menu is actually very cool) and it plays for another 30 secs to a min and repeats this process.  what a shame. this player could have been great if it weren't for the manufactoring defect. spend a bit more, try another brand. all and all mp3 cd players can be great, this one is not. you get what you pay for, at least this time.
