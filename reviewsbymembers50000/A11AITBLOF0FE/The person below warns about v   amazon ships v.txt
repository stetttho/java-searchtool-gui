 The person below warns about v1, amazon ships v2...so don't worry about v1 problems. I have v2 and it works fine. I've had  one plugged in for at least 2 1/2 weeks and have not had to unplug it at all and power back up...seems to work flawlessly and stays at a cool temp.  I know amazon doesn't make it clear, but you should be getting v2. hope that helps.
