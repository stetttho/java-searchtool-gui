 First, a note on buying these remanufactured (I'm not taking off a star since this is lumped with the NEW RS-110 reviews):   They say here 'remanufactured to like-new condition'--a bit of an overstatement...I can see noticable scratches on the phones and a fairly small chip of plastic is missing from the corner of the transmitter (but I'm pretty fussy and notice that stuff).    Still, condition is good and earpads look new (thank goodness).  Comes with all accessories and panasonic AAA's. Still, for the savings (1/2 price) I can deal with some surface marks.  I'm satisfied with my choice to buy remanufactured, but next time I might opt to buy new.  If scratches will bother you, buy new.  Now about the phones: Reviews that say they are plug and listen are true.  I first had to find the battery compartment (well disguised behind one of the earpads)...just turn the pads sideways (eitherside) to reveal what's behind them.    The reception is good, note I'm using these in a residential neighborhood....when I get back to college I'll update.  I walked outside and to opposite sides of my house and to the basement...still soundin' good.  Once in a while I do get some static, but (for me) it isn't constant or common enough to make this an annoyance....living in a city area or apt might cause more interference (more wireless phones etc).  The sound:  Nice base, not too heavy, just right.  The sound is really crisp and clear.  I use these to listen to my music (CDs and LPs) and DVD's wirelessly.  They seem pretty comfortable despite size, the padding on the top and the earpads is very soft.  They do look hilarious on me (according to my sister I look like I should be DJing).  As with most wireless phones these are big cans, but they aren't ugly...just BIG.  And since I'm wearing them mostly indoors, I'm not worried about the size.    Recommended for a good priced and good sounding wireless headphone.
