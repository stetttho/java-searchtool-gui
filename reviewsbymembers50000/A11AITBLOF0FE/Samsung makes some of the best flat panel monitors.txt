 I did alot of comparative shopping and watched LCD prices drop over the last few months.  I got an excellent price on this monitor.  My friend has a slightly older Samsung LCD and the clearity of the display impressed me.  This monitor is no acception.  It's stylish looking and doesn't take up alot of deskspace, but more importantly it has features to make it a worthwhile purchase.  It's got a 12 ms response time, a 600:1 contrast ratio and 1280 x 1024 max resolution.  Comparing this to my economy priced philips 17 in CRT (107s) is not even possible.  I havent done any gaming with this monitor yet, but with 12 ms response time their should be no ghosting.  Most LCDs are 25ms or 16ms, but Samsung provices 12 ms with this model.  More of an issue for gamers, but certainly not a bad thing for the rest of us.  DVDs look sharp and crisp.  The adjustment menu allows for diff color modes, entertainment, internet, custom and a couple others.  A useful feature as for typing I like to tone down my monitor's brightness to save my eyes.  The menu selection keys are sort of hidden in the right hand lower corner, which although some people say is inconvenient, takes little getting used to.  The menu is intuitive and easy to use.  You also get 3 year parts and labor coverage + 3 months for returning your product registration.    The only cons I can think of are fairly superficial.  The power cord is only partially hidden by the back part of the stand, while older samsung models mask the entire cord.  The model is not available in silver, but the black is still really sharp looking.  The stand is limited to tilting the monitor up or down.  Some monitors on the market allow you to adjust height and swivel, for me this is not a concern as I wouldnt use this feature.    This monitor is recommended to anyone looking to upgrade to an LCD.  It saves deskpace and has excellent image quality.
