 For the person asking, these batteries are 1800mAh, but you can charge any NiMH 1.2V AA or AAA batteries if you have ones with higher MAh around your house.  It says if you "rapid charge," which is 5-hour charge, the battery life is 540mAh.  So far I've only tried them in my sony cd player. I allowed them to charge for 16 hours, suggested time is 15-20 hrs for a full charge.  Now the details...  I havent had them long enough to say how long the AA batteries will last.  I plan to use these batteries for my mp3 cd player and a booklight.  For a camera you might want something with higher mAh, but keep in mind you get four batteries, so if your camera takes 2 AA's, it's not so bad. I know most Cannons take 4 AA.    The product is solid as far as build, but it does have many tiny scratches/ marks on the surface right out of the package.  This is superficial though, since battery chargers arent really purchased for cosmetic beauty.    The charger does what it's supposed to.  One not so great feature is that (I quote the instructions) "the indicator light will stay on after batteries are fully charged."  This basically means you can't depend on the charger to tell you when it's finished charging, you need to remember approx. 15 hours, + or - a few, that they are finished.  One good thing to keep in mind is that the charger cannot overcharge the batteries.    Primarily, I plan to use the charger with 850MAh AAA energizer NiMH batteries I purchased for an mp3 player.  This charger is great for this, as most mp3 flash players take 1 AAA at a time and 4 pack of AAA NiMH can be bought on amazon or any retail store.  For the price I paid, and amazon's promo prize, you are getting alot for your money.  4 NiMH batteries, 4 alkaline batteries and a sturdy charger.  For a bit more you can purchase a rapid 1 or 2 hour charger, but you won't be paying this price.  Overall, I'm satisfied.  Just what I expected.
