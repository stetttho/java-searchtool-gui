 I purchased this router and an MA111 (usb adapter acess point).  It was my first time ever setting up a wireless network, although I have a good amount of computer skills.  This router/ adapter setup took me only 2 hours to figure out.  The router itself took only 15 minutes to setup! I soon learned how to configure the WEP (128 bit password) and firewall.  The software is very user friendly.  I think the router and adapter are 75 + feet apart, and two different floors / opposite ends of the house.  We have a 2.5 ghrtz phone, but this does not seem to interfer.  My signal strength is at the minimum 40% and at it's best 65%.  I get excellent download rates from my cable modem (I have comcast and a motorola surfboard cable modem) which is attached to the router.   Why go with G when B standard is so inexpensive?  cable internet usually doesn't go above 3mbps, so B standards max speed of 11mbps is more then enough.  By the time this router gets old, you'll be ready for something new anyway.  This B standard router is fast, reliable and easy to setup.  It gets a little warm, but not too hot. I leave it on 24/7, but turn it off when on vacation.  For the price, it's simply amazing.  Netgear has a help # for those of you who are not so computer savvy.  Netgear.com has all the most up-to-date firmware.  The packaged cd-rom firmware is fine to install, works great. If you get the MA111 adapter make sure to download the usb 2.0 software though, or you could face compatability issues.  I use my computer alot, basically I'm online more than I watch TV.  I download alot of live concert recordings (SHN files, pretty large in size).  This router is great for that, and for simple web browsing.  With this price, there is no reason to not go wireless with your high-speed internet.
