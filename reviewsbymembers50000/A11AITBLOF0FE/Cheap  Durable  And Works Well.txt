 For those who are not sure what this product does...it connects a single headphone jack (found on portable audio equipment) to right/left audio jack connectors on an audio receiver.  So if your looking to hook up say your mp3 player or portable cd player to the receiver of your home stereo system look no further, you've found the right product.  I use this Belkin splitter to attach my muvo (mp3 flash player) and ,sometimes, my mp3 portable iriver cd player to my stereo system.  Works great.  I don't have a problem with the connection being loose, but I don't have an ipod to test this out with.  My mp3 cd players and the few flash mp3 players I've tried work fine with this. Belkin, as usual, offers a quality product.  Cheap, works well, recommended.
