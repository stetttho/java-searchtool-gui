 Sony makes some of the best headphones. I paid a bit more for these 3 years ago, they last a long time.  The foam pads fell off after two years of regular use, but I had spares from a old pair.  These 'phones are made to last and unlike some of those other funky headphones they are comfortable to wear, I wear them for hours at my PC while writing papers/ doing hw. Highly recommended, even for those who like good sound.  These deliver rich base, and are good for mp3 listening as well as dvd watching. In fact, for the price I just might buy a spare. A plus side with this is if you are hard on stuff or simply like to carry headphones in your backpack you don't have to worry about them--the price is so low.  I hope this helps. What are you waiting for? Buy some headphones.  These headphones fit into anyone's budget.
