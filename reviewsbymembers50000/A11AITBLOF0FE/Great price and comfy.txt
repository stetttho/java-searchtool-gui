 For the person complaining about the hem, it does say "raw-edged hem" in the description, so that's part of the style. All the other seems are lined up, at least on the two pairs I purchased.  These do run roomy. The large should fit up to a size 12 or 14 no problem.  So basically if your worried about fit, shouldn't be a problem unless you're on the small side. Really comfy and great for spring / summer. The top can be crinkled, like in the pictures, or folded over (Although I find they are a bit too low waisted for me rolled over).  I do not own alot of clothing from Urban Outfitters, but these did not disappoint!
