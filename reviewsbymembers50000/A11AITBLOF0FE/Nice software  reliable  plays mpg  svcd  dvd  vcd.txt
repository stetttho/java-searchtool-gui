 This software is great. It works flawlessly with windows. I've never had it crash.  The picture is very sharp, and the sound is wonderful.  Plus the controller can be shrunk, and is skinable. When watching widescreen dvds I use the 'mini control' so that I can see the scene/time information and have the dvd options at hand.  you can also take high res still shots of dvd images (saves as bmp), which is nice. There is also a 'show info' option, which gives you detailed info on the file you're playing.  You can choose video color to enhance video and a variety of audio options as well.  I also like being able to keep this player onto of windows, for example, when I'm typing.  This is achieved by selecting 'video always on top.' I recommend this software. There are lots of rebates available out for it, so look around.
