 I have the philips dvd726, which is basically the same as the dvd727, but no optical out (it does have coaxical out). The 727 has both of these audio out options. The blue display is great, it's easy on the eyes. The player reads cdr with mixed media, raw mpg cds (I had one or two mpgs that rolled, but this was maybe out of the 20 I tested). DVD quality is just wonderful too. The mp3 menus are easy to navigate (mp3 long file name would be nice, but for the price I just can't complain). There is a shuffle and repeat option for mp3's--awesome! I have the dvd player hooked up to the altec lansing xa3021 2.1 speaker system for tv/dvd/gaming (only $40 at target). So for a more than fair price I have a low budget, but nice sounding home theatre.  I like the feature that lets you do frame advance (a slow motion fast forward). Also this player has a 5 disc memory recall, so that means for the last 5 movies you've played it remembers where you've left off and bookmarks it, then recalls it next time you put in the disc.  The remote...well, it's pretty easy to use. There is an option to split-up vcds or svcds that do not have menus into moving pic displayed chapters, cool! This version comes with a universal remote, which is even better. Good player that has alot to offer--and with a low price tag.
