 For 2.0 speakers I wasn't expecting much from these, but they sound pretty good. I recommend 2.1 (with a subwoofer) for avid music listeners and movie watchers, but these sound remarkably good for the price.  The sound is crisp and clear.  My only gripe is the bass is a little overpowering with music listening (the back of each speaker has a whole, a sort of bass port).  Still the bass is much better than no bass at all.  For movie watching people will appreciate the rich sound.  Decent for mp3s, great for DVDs.  I use this as a secondary set of speakers.  I have a laptop and sometimes when I travel I don't want to listen to the built in 'tin can' sounding ones, that's when these come in handy.  I also use them with my portable mp3 cd player, so they are versatile.  Overall for what you pay, you're getting nice sounding speakers.  As I said I would like a bass or tremble adjustment knob (that would make these a 5 star item) and perhaps they could be a little sleeker in size.  They do not take up too   much desk space because their bottom width is small enough, but they are a bit too tall.  I can tolerate this though, because they are relatively stylish.  Fairly impressed.  Altec makes some really solid speakers and these are no acception (FYI: there is cloth covering over the front of the speakers).  They feel like they are built to last, and I believe they have a one year warranty.  A definite recommendation for a 2.0 speaker set especially for: watching dvds and listening to music on a laptop and for using with discmen/ mp3 players.
