 This camerae is fabulous.  The photos are clear and crisp.  The settings enable you to tweak almost anything you want.  There are special photo modes.  Including a 'heart' mode which is basically point and shoot friendly.  The quality is outstanding and the price is comparably less than the cannon A60, but without sacrificing quality standards.  Plus this camera takes 2 AA NiMH at a time and not four like other cameras, a huge plus.  This way you can carry extra batteries much easier.  A battery charger is a must so plan to buy one.  With usb 2.0 you'll have your pics on the computer in a flash.  Don't be discouraged by all the special settings.  Just make sure you have the photo on enlarge quality and not internet, so that it looks good.  All resolutions come out nicely.  The movie mode is in quicktime format and the movies come out surprisingly clear and the audio is great esp for such a small mic, it picks up everything.  I can't say anything bad about this camera but... The only cons are, make sure you hold the camera on your subject(s) for at least 2 seconds or the pic will come out blurred.  Bad lighting makes for some digital noise (grainy).  And make sure you purchase at least a 128mb SD card.  This camera has been discontinued due to it's lighter remake, LC50. Go buy one and take awesome photos :-)
