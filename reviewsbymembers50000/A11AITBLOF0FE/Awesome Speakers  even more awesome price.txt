 I purchased these speakers for $40, and they are worth every penny. I hooked them up to my philips dvd726 (dvd player). I have mono sound on my TV and wanted speakers so I could utilize the mp3 playback feature on my dvd player, as well as stereo sound with my dvds, vcds,svcds.  I hooked these up in 15 minutes.  The only con is the wired remote, I'd much rather have a regular remote, but luckily this is in my bedroom so it doesnt really matter.  The sound will blow you away. You can adjust the bass (on the sub), and pick the sound mode on the remote.  I didn't really need 5.1 surround sound...2.1 is great for me.  My movies sound so different, I never knew I was missing so much with a mono TV, but I really was.   I really really like the headphone hook-ups in the remote for private listening.  There are two so that you and a friend can enjoy this feature. The sound is rich and full, and believe me I'm picky too. I have Boston Acoustic Speakers with a subwoofer hooked up to my PC, so I'm used to decent audio speakers.  The style of these is funky, which I like! They look like old radios and the sub is sort of like a rocket.  This may not appeal to the older set--but I'm a college student and I think most kids and young people will find the design pretty nifty.  Plus the silver/black theme matches my other electronics. *One thing that may bother people is there is a very faint static noise when the speakers aren't in use, but on and turned up to a certain volume.  This seems insignificant to me because I only have them turned on when they are being used. Buy these speakers and you won't be let down.  They simply rock.  For a small price you get big sound.  I was skeptical, but it's true.
