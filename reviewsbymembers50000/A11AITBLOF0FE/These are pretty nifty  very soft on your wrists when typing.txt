 I paid alot less for these at a retail store, so with that in mine they are great.  I am one of those people who keeps cleaning the surface of my laptop when it gets handprints and other marks on it, these eliminate that  cuz you can rest your hand/wrist on them while typing.  They are also very soft.  I havent tried them as a mousepad, but it says they can be used also as a mousepad and to wipe the laptop screen.  For regular price they are a bit silly to have, but on sale they are a great little laptop accessory.  Targus also gives them a 1 year warranty.  My only complaint is they get a bit warm after resting your wrists on them for a while. oh, and they are washable...the surface is a brush material so dirt doesnt really show on them anyway.  I'm not sure their is a big market for this, but definitely a nifty item.
