 Well, it's the wee hours of the morning  *yawn*  and I just finished An Accidental Goddess.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, and just have to write a review! I stayed up all night/early morning to read this book from front to back.  I could not put it down!  It has it all:  Love and a beautiful romance, humour and witty dialogue, old rivalries and combat, mystery, treachery, and closely guarded secrets.  You'll also get to meet the honorable and dashing Admiral Rynan Makarian, Simon the wisecracking sentient crystalship, and Captain Gillaine Davre of the Raheiran Special Forces and a very rare "Witch" who, through a accident in Riftspace, has found herself hurled three hundred and forty-two years into the future, and isn't exactly thrilled to find out that she is now worshipped as a Goddess!  There is also a very exciting and unexpected turn of events at the end! I have to say that the weaving of magic with science and technology was brilliantly done!  It also made the story unique and refreshing, not to mention it added a high level of excitement, tension, and awe to the experience.  If you  like Sharon Lee & Steve Millers "Liaden Universe" novels, or Selina Rosen's "Queen Of Denial", you will definitely enjoy this book!  It's going on my "keeper" shelf, the place for my special comfort books and the ones that I know I will read again and again for years to come.  Don't miss this one!  I HIGHLY recommend it! She has also written Wintertide (prequel to An Accidental Goddess), and Gabriel's Ghost.  And she has three other novels as well, written as Linnea Sinclair.  They are Command Performance, Finders Keepers, and Destiny's Game.  And now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to order the rest of her books, and embark on more fabulous adventures!  *happy grin*  Enjoy!
