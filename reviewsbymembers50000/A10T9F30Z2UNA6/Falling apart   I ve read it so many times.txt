 What can I say!?  Terry Brooks is the one who pretty much spearheaded my interest in Fantasy with The Sword of Shannara, and from there I also went on to enjoy the tales of the magical kingdom of Landover.  Magic Kingdom For Sale Sold is one of my all-time favorite books.  I loved it as a child, and still love it as an adult.  In fact, I've lost track of how many times I have read and re-read it over the years.  It is a definite keeper, and one that I have recommended to all my friends, and anyone that has a love of Fantasy. Have you ever wished that you could find a portal to another world?  Have you ever dreamed of being swept away into a magical land with fantastical creatures?  Well that is exactly what happened to Ben Holiday.  He answered an add in a Christmas catalogue, thinking it to be a joke, and instead found himself stepping through the boundary between our world and the world of Landover ... and as it's king no less!  Sounds wonderful right?  Well, let's just say that things were not exactly what he expected! Terry Brooks has spun a thoroughly enchanting tale with Magic Kingdom For Sale Sold!  It has so many wonderful elements; magic, romance, fascinating creatures, humor, a hint of mystery, and lots of wonderful, quirky characters.  But be warned ... once you pick it up, you will not be able to put it down until you have read the last page!  And the adventure doesn't end there.  There are four more books in the series, all equally as good as the first; The Black Unicorn, Wizard At Large, The Tangle Box, and Witches' Brew.   I highly recommend this book.  If you haven't yet read it yet, then what are you waiting for?!!  Buy it now!  You will not be disappointed ... I promise.
