 Tess Soerenson, sole heir to her brother's dukedom, cannot face the responsibilities that this position requires and flees to Rhui, a primitive planet whose inhabitants know nothing of the other technologically advanced worlds around them.  She is taken in by a band of nomadic people led by Ilya Bakhtiian, a ruthless and ambitious man who is determined to unite the Jaran tribes.  And as fate would have it, she finds herself caught up in a dangerous and mysterious conspiracy involving the Chapalii, an alien race that have conquered humankind.  But the Chapalii have secrets they wish to keep from the humans, secrets that could be vital to her brother's plan of releasing their people from the Chapalii domination.    Jaran is an amazing story!  It gripped me from the very first page and would not let me go!  It is an epic tale with fantastic world building, wonderful, unforgettable characters, richly detailed cultures and societies, and a truly fascinating plot that just sucks you in and leaves you begging for more.  This is a book that has everything; love and loss, friendship and betrayal, action and suspense, and much, much more!  And all of it is set against the backdrop of a beautiful world and way of life. I was so completely immersed in the story, so charmed by the lives of these characters, and so desperate to figure out all the secrets and motivations, that I read the entire book in two days!  I did NOT want to put it down!  Kate Elliott is obviously a fan of Jane Austen (as am I), and if you are familiar with Austen's work, you will undoubtedly recognize many of those wonderful elements that Elliott has lovingly woven into the story of Jaran.  I just finished the book this morning and already I am eager and excited to continue the story.  Don't miss this one.  I HIGHLY recommend it!
