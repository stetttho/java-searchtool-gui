 When Rani Trader finds herself wanted for the murder of the Prince, she flees from her condemned guild house and takes to the city streets, disguising herself along the way, and desperately seeking the truth behind the vile crime that everyone believes she is responsible for.  But lies and treachery abound and Rani unknowingly becomes a pawn in an evil plot that centers on The Brotherhood, a secret organization that has been growing for years and encompasses her guild, her family, and even as high up as the royal household. I really loved this book!  I stayed up all night to read it from the first page to the last.  I couldn't turn the pages fast enough, and there wasn't a single dull moment where you can say to yourself, "Okay, here's a good spot to take a break and come back later."  I found myself completely wrapped up in Rani's plight, and followed right along in her footsteps, trying to puzzle out what was really going on and who to trust.  Ms. Klasky did a wonderful job of describing the very interesting caste system she`s created, and the important role of the Gods in these people's lives.   This book has it all; mystery and intrigue, lies and deception, love and loss, friendship and betrayal, action and suspense, and ultimate truth and atonement.  The world was real and believable, the characters were intriguing, and the plot was expertly woven together, with nice little twists and turns along the way.  It was also a roller-coaster of emotions that even coaxed forth some tears.  If a book can make me cry, it's definitely a keeper!  And even though things are wrapped up nicely at the end, I still can't wait to dive into the next book in the series (The Glasswrights' Progress) to see what happens next for this plucky little heroine!
