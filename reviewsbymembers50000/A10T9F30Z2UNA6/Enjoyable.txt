 Teresa Morgan, a lonely, ordinary woman in our world, steps through a mirror in her apartment and finds herself in the land of Mordant.  Geraden, son of the Domme, thinks that she is a powerful Imager, one who can manipulate the magic of mirrors, and believes that she is the key to saving their world.  The only problem is, Teresa feels they have made a terrible mistake.  But even her attempts to deny this alleged importance cannot save her from being sucked into a web of mystery, intrigue, danger, and betrayal.  And just when things couldn't get any worse, the Congery of Imagers take matters into their own hands, setting even more catastrophic events into motion. I have to admit that this book tends to be a little slow in the beginning, and I even found myself skimming a few parts.  But if you can manage to hang in there, things really start to pick up and very soon you'll be hooked.  Nothing is as straightforward as the characters think, and treachery, deceit, and lies run deeper than they could ever imagine.  Just when you think you've got it figured out, the story takes a different turn and you're left scratching your head again in puzzlement.  The one thing that really connected me to this book is the fact that the main characters constantly struggle to understand what is really going on, and I found myself right there in Teresa's shoes, feeling completely frustrated and paranoid ... not knowing at all who to trust! Just a little warning, this book ends with a nail-biting cliffhanger.  And trust me, you'll want to have the sequel (A Man Rides Through) handy as soon as you finish the last page.  If it weren't for the slow pace in the beginning, and a few spots of tiresome info-dumps, I would have rated this one five stars.  But, it definitely gets four stars for eventually grabbing hold and not letting me go, and for making me want to rush out and buy the sequel!
