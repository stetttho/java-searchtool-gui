 When Andrea Flores's husband and daughter are killed in a terrorist attack, she is taken aboard the Jod starship Tyker to heal and recuperate.  The Tyker's captain, K'Rin, who witnessed the aftermath of her family's murder, gives her the opportunity to join his elite and mysterious house guard, the Tenebrea.  Trained as an assassin, Andrea finds herself on a special mission to the planet Cor, where she must gather information about a rumor of NewGen clones that are supposedly being grown for war.  What Andrea seeks is vengeance, but her plan is slightly sidetracked in a new search for answers, and what she ends up getting involved in is something neither she, not the Jod, could have imagined. This book was fabulous!  I really didn't know what to expect, since the back cover is kind of vague, but what a wonderful surprise it was to find myself immersed in a truly gripping story of heartbreak, betrayal, acceptance, friendship, love, vengeance, secrets, lies, and loyalty.  There are also some key points of humor, and plenty of tense and exciting action.  Andrea's story is not as cut and dry as you might imagine in the beginning, and the plot twists and secrets that are revealed along the way make for a wonderful page-turner that teases the mind and leaves you begging for more.   The world building was wonderful, and the characters were rich and multidimensional.  There were times when I really wondered, who were the good guys and who were the bad guys? ... and I'm still wondering about some of them, even at the end of the second book (Tenebrea's Hope), which was just as amazing as the first.   The plot is woven together with such expertise that I was doomed to read the entire book in one sitting, never once having to skim over a dull spot ... and that is very rare indeed.  I highly, highly recommend this book!
