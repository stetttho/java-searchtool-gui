 After roaming the galaxy for 10 years as an outcast, Pricilla Mendoza again finds herself abandoned and betrayed, this time by the captain and crew of the Liaden vessel, Daxflan.  Determined to follow and seek revenge, she joins the crew of the Dutiful Passage who's captain, Shan yos'Galen, has his own score to settle with the people who wronged her.    This book was utterly wonderful!  I started reading and couldn't put it down until I had finished the last page.  The story was intriguing and flowed so smoothly, with not a single dull spot in it.  I was glued to the pages and completely entranced!  Sharon Lee and Steve Miller are wonderfully talented writers who have created such a rich world, and vivid, heartwarming characters.  It is a place you will not soon want to leave, and when you are finished with the first book, you will feel compelled to rush out and buy the next one. I have a soft spot for Space Opera, but it is very rare for me to find one that "clicks" just right, combining all the elements I love and weaving them together with skill and emotion.  Conflict Of Honors is one of those rare books.  I have been a huge fan of S. L. Viehl's "Stardoc" series, but the Liaden Universe is now giving it some very strong competition, and has very quickly become one of the very best Science Fiction books I have ever read.  Please don't miss this one.  In fact, I would strongly recommend buying the omnibus, "Partners In Necessity", which brings together the first three books in the series:  Conflict Of Honors, Agent Of Change, and Carpe Diem.
