 In the first installment of the Mageworlds, Beka Rosselin-Metadi agrees to captain her father's prized starship Warhammer, and sets off on a mission to find her mother's assassins.  What follows is a grand adventure with non-stop action and intrigue. I really enjoyed this book.  The characters were well developed and very interesting.  I especially liked Beka, with her multiple personas and how we begin to understand her feelings about her estranged family.  I also liked the mysterious "Professor" who's identity was an enigma until the very end, and Beka's brother Ari, with his unusual background.  In fact, all of the characters were likeable, with their own distinct personalities and quirks.  I loved how they were thrown together by unusual twists of fate, yet managed to become an effective team. The action was great.  The plot was interesting and original.  There was a surprising amount of humor and witty dialogue.  And technology didn't overwhelm the storyline (definitely a plus for me).  There were a few spots where it slowed down a bit, but then it picked right back up again, and I couldn't stop turning the pages.  I will certainly be looking for the next book in the series, Starpilot's Grave, to see what happens next for this unusual group of friends.
