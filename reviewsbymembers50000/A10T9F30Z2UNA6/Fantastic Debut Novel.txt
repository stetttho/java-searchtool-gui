 Way Of The Wolf will suck you in (pun intended *winks*) from the very beginning with it`s wonderful lead character, intriguing plot, and excellent world building.  A lot of thought and imagination have gone into the history of the world, and you will be astonished to find out where the Gods and Vampires of our legends actually come from, and how they ended up here.  In fact, the world is so vividly described that you can't help but feel like it's a creepy premonition of what's in store for us when the year 2022 arrives! Val has been born into this dangerous, ravaged world long after the cataclysmic events that changed the Earth as we know it now.  But even as you experience everything from Val's point of view throughout the story, you will also feel a certain kinship with some of the older characters, the ones who remember how things used to be.  I felt oddly nostalgic seeing what familiar things have survived from the old world.  It was like being transported forward in time as a ghost at Val's shoulder, longing to reminisce with those old-timers about a way of life that is now dead and gone. Is this book Fantasy, Horror, or Science Fiction?  It's difficult to say.  Way Of The Wolf is an enticing combination of all three genres.  The lines are expertly blurred, and that is part of what I think makes this story so unique and refreshing.  And it has a little bit of everything that makes for a well rounded, exciting adventure; action, "magic", aliens, mystery, romance, a dash of humor, and creatures that have stepped right out of your darkest nightmares. Way Of The Wolf is a brilliant debut novel, and even though it has a satisfying ending, there are still many questions left unanswered, and mysteries to unravel.  I can't wait to join Val again in the next installment of the series, Choice Of The Cat!  This was a fantastic book, and a real page-turner.  I highly recommend it!
