 I picked up Candle Bay early one morning and didn't put it down, not once, until I had finished it about 9 hours later. It was wonderful! Candle Bay is the first book I have read by Tamara Thorne and now I'm itching to get my hands on more of her work!  This book has it all! A fresh and interesting social structure for the Vampires, and very surprising and unique origins!! A vivid, beautiful, yet haunting setting. Wonderful characters, both human and vampire ... dangerous, shocking, quirky, intriguing, sexy, and lovable. There's also action, betrayal, mystery, secrets, love, lust, humor, thrills, and even a surprising bit of good old magic!  The story grabs you from the first page and just gets better and better as you are sucked into the fued between the Darlings and the Dantes, the history of the Cadle Bay hotel, and the dangerous secrets that are hidden in the ancient catacombs beneath it. Definitely a page-turner! I highly recommend this book and am very grateful to the friend who recommended it, and gave it to me as a birthday gift!  My only quibble is that even though things were wrapped up in the end, it felt a little too abrubt. However, it leaves certain things wide open for a sequel, so maybe this was intentional. Candle Bay can be read as a stand-alone, but a continuation of the story would most certainly be icing on the cake! I'm not going to give anything away, but if you read this book you will understand what I mean and find yourself begging for more!
