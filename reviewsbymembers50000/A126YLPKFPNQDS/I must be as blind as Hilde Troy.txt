 On a positive note, I found the prose and story structure to flow much more smoothly.  Which was an improvement on the first story.  The discriptions were much more vivid, and of course Donaldson's dream world concept is fasinating.  It would be obvious to a babe that one could dig deeper and find profound meaning in his writing.  Yet, all I want to do is scream because I hate Covenant soooo much.  I just can't get past this man and his self consuming pity.  In the first book the reader has to put up with his rape of an innocent and sweet young girl.  Now we have to deal with him getting jiggy with his OWN DAUGHTER?!  Don't be fooled reader--he knows it's his daughter, as well as she knows he's her father.  Another note of distaste is the length of pages it takes just to march to the war.  The scene with the giants was extremely depressing--especially when the child killed his father.  Apparently, Donaldson was doing some parent-hating when he wrote this book.  Oh well, I'm sure many will be discouraged or angry about my review.  I'm sure many will assume that I'm "just not getting it."  So be it.  We all deserve to voice our opinions.
