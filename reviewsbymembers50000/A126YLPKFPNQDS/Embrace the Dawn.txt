 I'm not the normal romance reader. I don't particularily care for it unless it is joined with some other genre.  I do like Garbaldon's romance novels about the Highlands of Scottland since they are froth with adventure and intrigue, and I thought this book would be the same.  It's not.  First and foremost, this is a Christian book.  It doesn't take one chapter to figure that one out.  The author goes on and on about how we must trust in God and put him first in his life and "surrender" to him.  Sure, that is all true, but if I wanted to hear that, I would pick up my bible.  The characters are very chaise.  The main character, Killian, is very God-fearing and religious,regardless of the fact she killed her husband, and even insist on withholding favors until after she is courted and then married by her second husband.  Goodness, they don't even kiss (only on the lips--shortly) until just before the wedding day.  I don't mean to sound as though I am putting all this quaint religious fevor down, I only want the readers out there to understand what they are getting into when they read this novel, because I didn't.    For a reader who is used to action, intrigue, betrayal, lust, and humor, you would want to pass this by.  For those who prefer a more tame, holy book, sure you'll like this one.
