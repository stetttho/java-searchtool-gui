 I couldn't wait for this one to come in after finishing Undead and Unwed, so I drove to three book stores until I found one that had it in stock (it was in the back--not shelved yet).  This series is hillarious!  The only problem is that I finished it in one night and now feel wanting.  Wanting more,that is.  Betsy (yes, her name is Betsy) is the vampire queen.  You couldn't find a ditsier Blond in Hollywood.  What Eric sees in her is beyond me (I picture him for the more intellectual sort).  Regardless, the two of them together make for some great reading.
