 I think I still like the first in this series the best.  When Leesil and Magerie travel from village to village coning the locals was funny.  It was definitely a lighter read.  Hendee has gotten much more technical in their writing and has become a better writer, but their writing has also become much more serious.  Leesil returns to his roots in this novel.  In the previous book an elf assassin hints of the possibility of his mother still being alive.  Leesil feels he has to find out for sure if both his parents are alive and returns to the warlands to find out.  They are still being hunted on all sides and going into even more dangerious situations than they have ever faced before.  This book is a must read.
