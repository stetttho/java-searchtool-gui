 How can one person be so unlucky? Just ask Sarah.  She's got it in spades.  The story begins with Sarah being buried alived, only to find out her goofy blind date is a vampire that had stalked her and planned her demised in order so that they could spend all of eternity together.  Her rescuers turn out to be vampire hunters.  Her SECOND rescuer is a vampire attempting to throw himself off a bridge to his death. Then to top it all off, she sucks her bosses bloody finger (while it's still attached to the woman) and gets fired for it.    It just can't possibly get any worse?  Suuurrre it can.;-)
