 I actually liked this one more than The Stone Prince, even though this one was not nearly as funny.  It was way more serious, but had a dry funny undertone here and there.  Grace is lost in the Amazon jungle where she had gone to find her brother.  Her guide attempted to steal her things and abandon her (tried--since she loaded his running butt with bullets.)  Then she stumbles into a fog and cave and comes out in the hidden world of Atlantis.  Yep, Atlantis.  Only to face a the swinging sword of its guardian.    Fortunately for her its Gardian, Darius, decides not to kill her.  I mean, how can he?  For over two centuries he had been unable to see color, smell scents, taste anything.  Yet, he can see the red of this beautiful woman's hair.  He can smell her body, and boy does she taste good.   Very sexually heated story, but it's not all about sex.  Darius' world is under attack by greedy humans and vampires that want to take control.  Grace's brother is a prisoner of same said people and it is up to the two of them to join forces and find the answers to defeat the threat.  Very fast pace.  Loved it!
