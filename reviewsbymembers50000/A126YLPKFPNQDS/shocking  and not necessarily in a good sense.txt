 I found the writing to be overstated.  There was not much flow.  I had to reread several passages over again in order to understand what the author was trying to say.  The main character is deplorable.  I hate him.  The rape scene in the beginning definitely threw me for a loop.  What threw me for a bigger loop was the fact that he did not seem remorseful about it.  And yet, he is the hero?  All these people in this strange world worship him simply for what they think he represents--a hero reserected from their past.  He moves through their world wallowing in self pity, believing he is dreaming, and trying to find a way back home.  Why?  Beats me.  Why would one want to go home to be an outcast?  The reason I gave this story three stars instead of one is the fact that the author has a unique story line.  I plan to read the second in the series for the sole purpose of seeing if he has somewhere he can take it.  And to see if Covenant (the main character) redeems himself for his horrible actions in some way--or at least pays for them.  One can only hope.
