 I thought it dragged, dragged, dragged.  The first third of the book I was completely confused. I thought I read all of Freehan's books, but I felt I was missing something the whole beginning of the book.  Apparently I missed a few of her books.  If you haven't read whatever came before this one, you, too, will be constantly asking yourself, what are these magical powers?  What happened in Russia?  What's up with these sisters?  She kept hinting and hinting, but it was not well written, so the reader was not anticipating anything, just annoyed because the author was being thoughtless.    Apparently, this story is about the third (it took me until page 100 before I even found out she was the third sister and what her power was) sister of seven whose power is making people tell the truth.  Because of it she is ostrisized by practicaly the whole town.  So she travels alot studing dolphins.  Apparently (I say this because it took FOREVER for me to find out the details--it quite ruined the story) while in Russia she meets Sasha and falls in love.  But they have a falling out and she runs home to her family.  Well, Sasha is in town taking care of some theifs and attempting to return to her life.  Blah, Blah, Blah.  I expected better.  I gave it three stars because the sex scenes were steamy.
