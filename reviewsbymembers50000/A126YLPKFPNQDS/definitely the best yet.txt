 I have been a fan since the very first two were first published in America.  At the time I worked at a library and thought, "Why not."  After, I recommended the books to young and old alike and received nothing but thanks in return.  In the sixth year at Hogwarts, the reader will find Harry, much more grown up.  Harry is now sixteen and has been devastated with the lost of his godfather from the previous year.  Regardless, he trugs on.  Afterall, he still has his friends (Ron and Hermonie), Hagrid, and Dumbledoor.  Book six begins with Dumbledoor collecting Harry over the summer (quite strange--to say the least).  Dumbledoor tells Harry of his inheritance from his godfather and that he would like to give Harry private lessons in addition to his normal classes at Hogwarts.  Harry, of course, agrees.  This year is especially dangerous for all witches and wizards everywhere, because now it is known by all that Voldermort has return with his Death Eaters.  While Death Eaters create a rampange throughout the countryside, Harry overhears Malfoy's secret converstations with a curator well known for dabbling in the dark arts.  Harry is certain that Malfoy is now a Death Eater like his father.  Only no one will take him seriously.  The story continues in this vein.  Harry helping and discovering Dumbledoor's secrets, following and spying on Malfoy, and then there is the teenage romance that seems to involve Harry, as well as, all his friends.   I thought Rowling did a wonderful job with this one.  Harry's character is definately evolving into a more confident and intelligent young man.  The ending was a shock.  I don't know if I will be able to stand waiting at least another year for the next one.  I hope it goes by fast!
