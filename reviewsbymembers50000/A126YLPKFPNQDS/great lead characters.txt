 I read Witching Moon first (which comes after this one) without realizing there was any order to these books, but it did not harm the flow of story at all.  Apparently, all books can stand on their own. The only reason I even realized they were together was the reference to the leading man's father (The Big Bad Wolf)was familiar.  What I liked about this book was the sexy hero. It seems all the Marshall brothers, Ross included, are very masculine, and yet very sensitive, at the same time.  I also liked the fact that it was difficult for him and the herione (Megan) to get past the wolf and the wolf's killing of a person, regardless of how evil that person was.  No killing should be easy if you are truly a good person and the romance authors that try to pull that off are left with a flat, unrealistic piece of fiction.  Megan was scared of the wolf and that seemed more normal and true to life.  She had to work through that fear toward her love for him.    Other than the romance in the book, there is definitely a plot.  Ross is a detective and is gathering evidence against a serial killer, only the serial killer turns the tables on him and comes hunting after Ross instead.    Very well done.
