 Spencer introduces Atticus Steele and friends in this latest novel following the trials and tribulations of Ukiah Oregon.  Atticus and his partner discover Ukiah dead in a trunk of a car surrounded by mice.  Obviously something they have seen before.  Apparently, Atticus had more than his share of run-ins with death and mice.  Not to mentioned this "kid" looked exactly like him.  So, of course they decide to save him.  I like the fact Spencer decides to add a new character and for much of the book, the story is told from Atticus' view point.  The reader also dicovers Atticus' love interest is different from Ukiah, also.  Which continues the homosexual theme that began with Ukiah's moms.  It also gives the Dog Warriors reason to leave another "breeder" alone.  The action is nonstop and the reader can't help but feel for these characters.  I really enjoyed all the books from this series.  The reason I chose to give it four stars instead of the usual five is that I felt Spencer should have explained situations more fully.  For example, in this novel she shows the cult as trying to save mankind.  Yet, they know by know that the sex drug is lethal to humans (many of their own have died from it) and does absolutely nothing to the "demons."  Still they continue to manufactor it and sell it the the people.  This completely goes against their agenda.  There were several other things I found that were a contradiction to the character's or group belief.  Still, if you can overlook these things, I'm sure you will enjoy this novel.
