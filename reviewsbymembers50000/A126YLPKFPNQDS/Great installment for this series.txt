 Wow, I don't even know where to start.  This one picks up right where the last left off.  R'Shiel is still very ill from the stabbing she received.  Tarja and Damin have moved their forces to the border to stop the encroaching forces sent by Xaphista.  But these are not the highlighted people or points in this story.  In Treason's Keep, Fallon turns to Adrina and Damin.  Adrina was only mentioned in the first as a Fardohnya Princess with a high spirit that her father, the king, could not pay people to marry.  Well, apparently he found someone to marry her, the Karien prince, Cratyn.  At first, Adrina thinks this is going to be a piece of cake.  She even calls Craytn, Cringing Cretin.  Adrina is demanding, manipulative, and spoiled rotten.  Unfortately, after the nuptuals are finalized, she realized she was not the one doing the playing, but Craytn and the Kariens.  After being hit and threatened, she realized she is in a forgein country with only two people she can trust (her half brother and her maid).    Other things going on at this time:  The Karien's take over the Sisters, when the priest are able to place a sane Joyhinia back in power (I won't spoil it by telling you how).  R'Shiel is taken prisoner, Adrina and her maid escape across the boarder and are captured by Tarja and Damin.  Damin is put in charged of Adrina (you can guess where that will go). Plus, so much, much, more.  I think I enjoyed Medalon more, but this one was still able to hold its own quite well.
