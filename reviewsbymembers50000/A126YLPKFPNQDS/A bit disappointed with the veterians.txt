 I'm not an anthologies fan.  I read fast, so the bigger the better provided it's good.  The first three short stories by Hamilton, Davidson, and Harris was a huge disappointment.  I have read ALL these ladies books.  There was nothing there to capture me.  The last two were a little longer and I found myself much more interested.    Angela Knight wrote a short story intitled "Galahad" I thought was great.  It was a whole new world and concept on the grail.  I liked Vicki Taylor's short story, too.  A guy wants to become a vampire to get back at a vampire that took everything from him, even his fiance'.  I've never read anything from these two authors, so I'll definitely look into them.
