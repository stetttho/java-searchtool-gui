 I read a little over half and then became fed up.  Coming from south, south Louisiana (better known as "Cajun Country") and being the daugther of cajun parents, whose first language is Cajun French, I found the story insulting and completely off base.  Did Freehan even bother to visit here and speak to the people?  The descriptions of the land, swamp, and wildlife was so far fetch I wanted to laugh at the audacity of her.  Then the french phrases and comments Gator made were rediculous.  Most of them are what northerners think we say from cheaply made movies, but no one I know bother's to speak that way.  Even the curse words she used are not "cajun" french, but France-french.  Then the drinking, boats, bar fights, and going to schol and living in the swamp?  Please!  Have you ever even been to a swamp in Louisiana?  I couldn't even enjoy the book with all problems I found. BOO!
