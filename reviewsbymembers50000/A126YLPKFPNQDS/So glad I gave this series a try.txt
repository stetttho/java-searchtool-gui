 I gave in and bought this book even though I wasn't in the "mood" for this topic. Then on a lazy afternoon I picked it up to read only to finish it the same night.    The characters are not in-depth as I would like and all the flashbacks were a bit maddening, but the action just didn't stop.  I wanted to know what would happen next and I truly LIKED the main character.  She was sexy, confident, and smart.    In Ill Wind, the world doesn't know about the unknown heroes, the weather wardens, that protect the people from mother earth.  Without the wardens, mother earth would have distroyed all known life long ago.  Joanne is one of these weather wardens who is on the run for her life.  The people she once worked with are trying to capture, and possibly even kill, her for killing her boss.  What they don't know is that she has a demon mark, which is even more leathal than her co-workers.  I can't wait to read the next in this series.
