 I was impressed.  I liked the futurist world Roberts created.  The new technology and moral beliefs of the public was basically plausible.  The protagonist, Eve, was realistic and well rounded.  I thought Riley was a bit flat.  He didn't show the tarnish of his stated upbringing, but perhaps future books will show this.  Just to give a base line, Eve is a detective, Riley is a suspect for multiple murders.  The murderer plans to kill a total of six legal prostitutes and is accomplishing it one per week.  It is up to Eve to catch the bad guy before he kills again.  My only problem with this book was the ending.  I predicted it (including the bad guy) the moment he was introduced in the story.  Granted, I read alot, so it is easier for me to predict endings, but I still prefer to be surprised and look for that great author that keeps me guessing.  I didn't find it here, but I still found liked it and plan to read more.
