 This series has always been a spell-binding read for me.  The original trilogy was fantastic.  From there it became a little repetitive.  This latest addition was a welcomed change.  One of my problems with previous novels was the extreme description of music.  Shinn could spend an entire chapter describing the rise and fall of angel voices in song.  Almost all her novels were concerned about the archangel.  In this case, she concentrates on two women (not angels at all) and their perspectives.  A Jansai woman and an angel-seeker.  In both women she shows the trials and tribulations of misunderstood and persecuted women doing what they have to do to survive, truely live, and love.  Shinn twines these two women's lives together in an unexpected and touching way.   It's a long novel, but you will find it hard to put down. I finished mine in two days.  Good reading!
