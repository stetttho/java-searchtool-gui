 I could barely stand waiting for this next one in the series to come out.  I so enjoyed the first two.  The futuristic world created by Knight is entralling and even a bit scary.  This book did not follow through on either one of those emotions.    Basically Valentine has spent a year on a secret mission as a Cat to secure a strong enough ship to obtain a secret weapon to fight the Kur.  Somehow the knowledge of this "secret weapon" had only landed in the revolutionaries laps recently.  The weapon is located in Haiti and Valintine doesn't even know what it is, only that the "contact" whom never saw him before in his life would recognize him and contact him.  Strange?  Well, it was.  This was only one of many loose strings throughout the story.    What I missed most about Knights writing was the incredible development of characters and realtionships with these characters.  I didn't see any this time.  Valentine takes up a bit of a romance in Jamaca, but if I was suppose to feel sorry for him for having to move on, well, I really didn't even know this new character well enough to even care.  Overall, I still enjoy this series and plan to continue reading them.  I'm hoping the next one, Valentine's Rising, will pick back up where the first two left off.  Happy reading!
