 First off, I want to point out that I would not recommend this book to a young reader.  I don't think they would "get it."  Even a young teenager.  I think it would require someone with a bit of maturity to grasp the depth of the book.  I also would not recommend it to anyone who does not read and enjoy fantasy, because I don't think they would "get it," either.  Sorry if that offends anyone.  For all those others out there, I think you would enjoy this book.  DeLint uses a first person format switching between Imogine, Maxine, and Adrian (Ghost).  You get the impression that Imogine is the focus character in that, well, everything and everyone focuses around her.  Imogine is a new student at her school.  She purposely befriends an outcast of her school, named Maxine.  This high school is like many schools in that everyone has a clique.  However, it is also different in that the bullies at this school are abnormally more agressive than you could imagine.  This is not important, though, it is simply a side story to the story.  The main part of the story is about Imogine discovering Ghost.  A boy who committed "suicide" at the school in '98.  Imogine makes it her mission to discover why this Ghost seems to be following her around.  When she does, even stranger things begin to happen.  It was a good book, I finished it within two night because I was anxious to see how the problem would be solved.  I'm definitely reading more from De Lint.
