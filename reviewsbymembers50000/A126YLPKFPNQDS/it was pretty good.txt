 I prefered this one over the last one of the Dark Series she wrote.  It drives me crazy how much of a knock off this is from other vampire books, though.  I thought this one had more of a plot.  There was a problem to solve and the characters made an effort to solve it.  It still a pretty mindless book, but even mindless books have their place.
