 I read the other books in this series and although they were a bit bland, I did find them somewhat enjoyable.  That was a few years ago.  I picked up The Dark Sleep two days ago and attempted reading it.  I made it to page 90.  I normally can finish a book in a day, sometimes two.  By the time I reached page 90 of this one I was asking myself "So what's the conflict?"  I found no major conflict in this story.  How can you have a story without conflict?  Perhaps something will come up later on, but I'm just too bored with it to read on and find out.  As far as I'm concerned, every great author knows you should introduce the problem early on to hook the reader.  I'm SO not hooked!  Sorry, but I can't imagine myself ever returning to this series or author.
