 I haven't read everything by Buold, but I have read the two previous books in this series.  Even though a few years have past since I've read them, I remember them being much  more fast paced and action filled.  This book is slow. It plods along.  Regardless, it's still a good book, just not up to par.  I'm not even sure how it fits in with the others.  I don't recognize any of the characters from the previous book and I suppose I would have to reread them to find out.  So if you are someone who plans to read this as a stand alone, I don't think you would have any problems following the story.  Basically, you have to main characters:  Ingrey and Ijada.  They are both Weirdlings in that they possess an animal spirit.  Normally, this is punishable by death and the two are in fear that things will lead to this vein eventually. But there is a much more problematic occurance on the rise.  The Hallowed King is dying.  His youngest son is murdered (by Ijada--in selfdefense) and another being--claiming to be the REAL Hallowed King is moving his pieces around the board to plan for something big--I mean BIG.    I liked it, but I wished there was more action in the story; thus four stars instead of five.
