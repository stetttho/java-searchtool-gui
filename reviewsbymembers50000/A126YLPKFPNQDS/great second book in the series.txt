 Second to Tiger Eye, but could stand alone.  Liu does a great job with plot and action.  The story is definately going somewhere and at the same time she throws in some romance.  We get to devil into the conscience, world, and background of Artur (introduced in Tiger Eye).  Artur is captured and jailed in what sounds like an insane asylum with a basement experiment lab.  How awful! In the process we get introduced to three new and interesting characters.  I really can't wait until the next one just to see who she chooses to center the story around.
