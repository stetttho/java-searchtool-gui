 Okay, of course I'm probably going to get like 40 no helpfuls for this, but what the heck?  Are you people insane?  This was about the most unrealistic novel I have ever read.  Granted it is fantasy, but hey, that's all I read.  What is the point of a great fantasy if you can't fall into the unrealistic?  This novel leaves me no opening.  The characters are unloveable, unrelatable, unwanted.  The narrator's voice, as well as the dialogue, was stilted and highhanded regardless of their status in society.  I think the author was trying to be proseful (but prose has everything to do with flow and little to do with 10 syllable words).    What was with all the horses?  I mean here is this princess that goes all blubbery over a horse, but doesn't blink an eye for her brother or fiance'?  How realistic is that?  And don't give me it was a breakdown.  What?  She breaks down for EVERY horse, but never for her supposed love ones?  And by God, what kind of ending was that?  It was so beyond far fetched and against the description of the characters she gave that I almost trashed the novel, then I realized it belonged to the library and thanked my lucky stars that I didn't actually spend money on this rubbish.
