 In this strange world, divided by religion and politics, the common, uneducated people fortell the coming of the Demon Child that will set them free from the sisterhood.  Little do they know the Demon Child herself is studing to become a sister and is the dauther of the First Sister, nonetheless.  R'shiel and her half-brother, Tarja, are unhappy with their lives and having to live under the thumb of their demanding, over-bearing, and power-hungry mother.  Despite all that they manage to be their own person and defy her.  Tarja soon discovers his pretty sister is not his sister at all but was stolen at birth by his mother for her own unknown reasons.  When they escape the wrath of their mother (after defying her) and hide as they travel on the road, they come across a band of rebels and discover there is much more going on with the sisterhood than they ever imagined, and that things were not always as they seem.  Fallon keeps the action going, as well as deviling deep in her characters.  I had several surpises (which is not a common accurance for me).  I'm definately looking forward to the next in this series.
