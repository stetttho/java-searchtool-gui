 This one had real potential.  There was an interesting plot introduced, but not developed.  I like the gang related idea and the kidnapping.  Lula had me laughing so hard I was in tears, but the ending was a major disappointment.  It was like the air going out of a balloon.  I finished the novel in just one afternoon, which was another disappointment.  When you buy a hardcover book you want to be entertained for longer than a few hours.  It was like a two minute romp in the hay.  It got you all hot and bothered and left you wanting.
