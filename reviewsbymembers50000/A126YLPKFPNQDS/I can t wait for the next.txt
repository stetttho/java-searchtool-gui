 I was apprehensive at first.  Something did not call to me about this book.  Yet, it continued to obtain more and more wonderful reviews, so I gave it a try.  Right off, I was hooked.  Not many authors are talented enough to switch setting and characters so smoothly as Keyes and not loose the readers train of thought.    The reader immediately begins to ask themselves what is connecting all these different characters.  How does it relate to preface?  Like a spider weaving his web, Keyes draws them together.  Your held breathless wondering will this character survive?  Will they see the wrong-doings of this one?  Why must she be so selfish, doesn't she realize how she hurts others?  I simply cannot put into enough words all the emotions that will go through your mind and heart as you read this novel.  You truly become involve in this story.  Hopefully, the wait will not be long for the next one!
