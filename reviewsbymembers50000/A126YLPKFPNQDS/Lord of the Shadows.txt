 I was tempted to give this one four stars, but couldn't make myself do it.  I have so thoroughly enjoyed this series. The characters were so well put together and realistic.  The world was intriging.  My only complaint was the character Tia. She was beyond annoying and I could just not imagine someone as wonderful sounding as Misha falling for her.  The ending was great, one of the best climaxes I read in a novel in a long time!    I'm looking forward to see what else Fallon has up her sleeve.
