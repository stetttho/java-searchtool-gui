 Henry is definitely having family problems.  It is obvious his parents are not getting along.  One morning he witnesses his father coming out the spare bedroom instead of the room he normally shares with Henry's mother.  After a long talk with his father over breakfast at a local cafe, his father admits to him his mother is having an affair.  All Henry want's to do is escape.  He does while visiting old Mr. Forgarty.  Mr. Forgarty hired Henry to do some cleaning around his house, since he is too old to do it himself. Henry is a hard worker, but there are days Mr. Forgarty only wants to talk--about aliens, conspiracies, faeries, etc.  Henry knows the old man is batty, but believes him harmless and usually just humors him and his wild stories.   But on the day of his father's revelation about his parents problems, he doesn't fill like talking and asked Mr. Forgarty if he could just get straight to work cleaning up the shed.  While cleaning the shed, Mr. Forgarty's old tomcat catches a butterfly in his mouth and attempts to eat it, but the butterfly fights back.  When Henry approaches to get a better look at the strange insect, he realizes it is not a butterfly at all but a small boy, his age, with wings.  A Faerie.  Henry and Mr. Forgarty join together to help the faerie, a prince from an alternate world who enemies were trying to kill, and this brings them on a very exciting adventure.  I thought it was a little slow in the beginning and the author flip flopped between setting and characters a little to often, causing confusion.  Also, the spelling of words were off. The author did not use the letter z at all.  Regardless, it was a good story and I'm looking forward to reading the second, The Purple Emperor.
