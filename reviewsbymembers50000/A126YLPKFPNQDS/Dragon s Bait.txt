 My only complaint with Vivian Vande Velde's books are that they are just so darn short.  You don't want the story to end.  You want to continue reading and learning more about the character and what they will do next.  What is amazing is the way she can pact so much information and feelings about the character in so few words.  That requires talent.  In Dragon's Bait we are brought into the time of the witch trials.  Alys is accused of being a witch for no other reason than the greed of her next door neighbor who covets her father's shop.  In short time, the witch finder is called, a trail commenses and she is convicted by the same people she grew up with for fifteen years.  Here's the twist, instead of the usual burning, hanging, or drowning, she is tied to a steak in dragon country and left to be eaten.  Oh, the dragon definitely arrives, but he is more than she, or even he, imagined.  I've only read a handful of VVV's novels.  I've been making my way through them over the last few weeks.  So far I have not been disappointed once.
