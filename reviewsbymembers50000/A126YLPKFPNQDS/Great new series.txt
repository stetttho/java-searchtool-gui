 I read a short story of Knights in an anthology that contained the witches and vampires concept (Galahad it was called) and thought, wow, what a great idea.  I had no idea she actually developed that concept further with this book and Master of the Night.    This one is my favorite so far.  It is about a young city clerk and part time policeman volunteer who just so happens to also be a werewolf.  Diana's race was created by Merlin as a fail-safe in case the the vampires and witches would become bad, since the werewolves were immune to magic.  No one knows they exist except Llyr, the king of the faries.  He was told by Merlin before he departed for other worlds in need.  The werewolves on the other hand know all about faries, vampires, and witches.  (Others names for these entities are used in this book, but I choose these for those who are not familar with this topic).  Only, one of the bad vampires had come to Diana's town and is killing the local young men in a really horrible way.  Diana is determined to stop the strange creature.  Meanwhile, the good guys living in the magical parallyl universe are setting out to stop the rogue, evil vampires when they come across the killing in Diana's town from a copy of the local newspaper.  Llyn recognizes Diana's face from an erotic dream he had about her the previous night and volunteers to set out for the the town and destroy the vampire.    Yeah, yeah, I know it sounds corney, but you really have to give it a chance.  Knight's story is interesting, funny, and is hard to put down once she get started.  Happy reading!
