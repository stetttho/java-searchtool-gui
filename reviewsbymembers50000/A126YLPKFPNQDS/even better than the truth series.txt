 Cook's ability with characterization is surperb.  The main character, Tess, is spoiled, self-centered, and silly.  (a typical princess type) Yet, the reader has the pleasure of watching this character develop through and from circumstance into a loyal, honest, and strong independent woman.  All of which was realistically done.  I love and am jealous of Cook's abilty in doing this.    Tess, the above mentioned Priness, discovers that she is not the actual princess of the kingdom, but a decoy. In place since baby (one of three--she's the only one who survived the assassins) in order to protect the real princess. Meanwhile, the real princess is being brought up in a nunnery.  Unfortunately, Tess learns all this just before the only parents she had ever known is murdered right in front of her. Her father, the king, being killed in a last effort to save her life.  Tess goes on the run.  She's determined to find the one man who knows her secret and had, in an unobtrusive way, taught her everything she knows, and the real princess.  Great adventure, love, and fantasy story all wrap up into one. Happy Reading!
