 Black creates a modern world riffed with fairie creatures.  Strangely, this world of bad guy and girl teenagers is extremely realistic.  There is alcohol, drugs, smoking, partying, etc.  Kaye is a part of that world, especially with her mom, who is in a low-class rock-band.  She spends more time getting drunk than singing.  But this is not the only world she knows.  Kaye has also been visited by fairies since her young childhood.    After walking home in the rain after a bad experience with her friends, Kaye comes across a fairie wounded near the woods.  She helps save his live and he rewards her with answering three questions (to be given at another time).  The wounded fay is Roiben, whom Kaye finds extremely attractive.  Later, Kaye discovers she, too, is a fairie creature (a pixie) and is being asked by her old childhood fairie friends to risk her life to stop them from living in servitude for seven years.  But to do this, she will have to go against Roiben.  I was sorry to put this one down.  I loved it.
