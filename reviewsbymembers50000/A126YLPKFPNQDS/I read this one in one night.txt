 Actually, I found this book more enjoyable than the first in the series.  Up front, I want to tell anyone who reads Hamilton's books simply because she gives great sex scenes, then this book is definitely for you.  I read all the previous reviews and I can see the point of all of them, bad and good.  ...You need to realize that writing (and reading) is purely for enjoyment.   It is easy to see that Hamilton wrote this book as a go-between of the first and those to come.  She is setting the scene of something big to come.  I thought this was an important bases to help the readers get a better understanding of each character.  I for one enjoyed reading about how each has grown and changed from the first novel to the end of this second one.  She also gave background on a few (All the Guys).   ...[N]ot all sexy guys have got to have long hair.  I mean, come on, it's getting a bit redundant.  I know the fairie court has a thing with long hair, but between the vampire series and this one, the long hair is getting soooo old. Happy Reading.  I hope L. Hamilton hurries with the next book. ;-)
