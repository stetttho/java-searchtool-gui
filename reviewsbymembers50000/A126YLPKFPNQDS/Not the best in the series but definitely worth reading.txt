 I look forward to each book in this series.  Kenyon faithfully provides steamy sex scenes and hunky men.  This one had a bit of a twist on her "normal" paranormal romances.  First off, the Dark Hunter is a woman ("Danger") and the hunky male is, well, Other ("Alexion").  Hey, I'll even give you a clue, Alexion is not a name, but a job title.  Apparently, a revolt is happening among Dark Hunters in Mississippi and the Alexion is called in to either straighten them out or eliminate the whole lot of them.  Only he had no idea just how difficult it would be to keep his mind on his job, especially when he meets Danger.  The reason why I gave it four stars instead of five was because it did not keep me hanging on the edge of my seat.  Yet, I still wiped it out in just two nights.  I think for those Dark Hunter fans out there, it would definitely be worth your time.  Those of you who have not read any from the series.  DO NOT begin with this one, you will only be completely baffled by what is going on.  This is not a stand alone novel.  Either way, happy reading!
