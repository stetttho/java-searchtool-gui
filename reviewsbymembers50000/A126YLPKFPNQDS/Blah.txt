 It all seemed a bit cliche' to me.  Like I could have turned to any late night cable network on tv and found the same dribble.  I bought the book because it had promise.  A team of vampires to take down terrorist has promise, but it ended up with sugar coated plastic dolls fluffing their way through what should have been serious problems.  The really bad part was the fact that all the characters really cared about was getting laid.  I mean really, the sillyness of rubbing her foot up and down the attractive man's calf is old, overdone, and overripe (i.e. it stinks)
