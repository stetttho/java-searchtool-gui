 The only reason I read this book is because it kept showing up on my recommended reading list.  I had tripidation since I realized it was a teen book and I just wasn't in the mood for that sappy-teen-best-friendness-trist.  It wasn't until I came to fill out this review that I realized that I am the 530th reviewer.  I had no idea just how popular this book became. Well, I can honestly say it was well worth my time.  This is a story about four friends spending their first summer apart.  These 15, almost 16, year old girls have been friends since before birth and are different from each other in every way you could imagine.  Yet, they support and love each other unconditionally.  When Puerto Rican, Carmen, buys a pair of jeans at a thrift store, she doesn't even bother to try them on.  Not until she is packing for her summer away with her father and decides to throw them out, that ratical Tibby ask if she could have them.  Tibby tries them on and the girls are amazed at how good they look on her.  Each girl then takes a turn trying on the "magical" jeans and discover that they each look fantastical regardless of height or body shape.  They then form a pack to share the jeans throughout the summer.  Never to wash them and express mail them to the next girl after they are through. I know, this sounds incredibly corney.  The surprise is it's not.  The girls begin their summer discovering who they really are.  Tibby meets a dying 12 year old girl that teaches her how to see the world in a different light.  Carmen creates a new relationship with her dad.  Lena gets to know her grandparents in Greece and (well, I don't want to say anything else--this part really cracks me up).  Bridget (probably the most disturbed teen) makes a horrible mistake. Teen or adult, you cannot go wrong with this novel.  A wonderful, touching, tearful read.
