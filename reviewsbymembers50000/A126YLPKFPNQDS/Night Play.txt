 I found Kenyon's books becoming repetitive.  This one was a change--mostly because it contained werewolves.  I liked the beginning. Kenyon grabs the readers attention by showing the were brothers hanging from trees, left for dead.  She introduces the female character by receiving a fed-ex from her now ex, dumping her.  Very witty, very attention getting.  My only fault is that she is alway elborating on how over weight Bride is and how self-conscience she is about it, yet during the first love scene, she's watching her body in the mirror.  Over weight women that have a problem with their bodies, would not be over eager to stare at them naked in a mirror.  Vane is the man almost every woman dreams of.  I love this sexy character.  The parts where he puts Bride's ex in his place are priceless!
