 I thought it was  much better than some of the nonsense I've been reading by Christine Freehan.  It's historal paranormal romance with werewolves. The werewolf concept definitely takes a back seat for those of ya'll who enjoy reading about strange creatures.  As a matter of fact, the character doesn't give into/turn into a werewolf until the very end of the book.  The fact that it could happen is considered a curse to the family that they want to get rid of, but first they have to solve the poem that tells them how.  This is not even the major plot followed throughout the story, that one is about an abused young woman who is trying to escape her phyically abusive step-brother, whom she is the ward of.    I liked it and definitely plan to read more in this series.
