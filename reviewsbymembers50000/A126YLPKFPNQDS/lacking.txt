 I have been a huge Evanovich fan from the very first Plum novel.  I was very disappointed in "Hard Eight."  For seven whole books she stringed us along wondering what Ranger would be like, only to let us down with the extremely short result.  I found all her adventures in this novel were too neatly wrapped up.  Her criminals were too easily caught too quickly.  I don't want to give away details, so it's hard to explain myself as fully as I would like to, but I hope the next Plum mystery has more meat to it than this one did.
