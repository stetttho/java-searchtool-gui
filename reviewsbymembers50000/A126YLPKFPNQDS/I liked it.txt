 I've never read a book by De Lint, so, unlike other reviewers, I'm not bias because of reading his later works.  This one is a normal run of the mill fantasy, based in a far off land and a far off time.  It is my understanding that De Lint normally writes urban fatansy, so this obviously is a difference.  What I like about it is the fact that it is not some epic fantasy.  He doesn't go on and on about the world and how what the hero does or accomplishes will save man kind or beast kind, or whatever.  This is simply a man, with a certain gift--or curse (depending on how you look at it) who simply want's to find his place in life.  He's unhappy and lonely.  By shear chance he is taken in by a family made up of friends and welcomed as their own.  He even finds a love.  But these friends may not last forever, because they don't know his deepest secret--that he is a werewolf.  Unfortunately, someone comes to the village that does, a hunter, and the hero (said werewolf) has to make a decision.  To run or stay and fight for what he has found.  I found De Lint's writing poetic at times and well put together.  He said much, with only a few words and his character development was flawless.
