 I'm so glad Forsyth decide to return to her world of witches.  I thought I'd read the last of them.  In this latest series, the reader returns to this fatasy world of Eileanan 25 years in to the furture after the war.  We are introduced to a young girl (half human and half syticorn).  Because she favors her human side too much, she is in fear of her life.  It is only a matter of time before her herd decides to kill her off as a weaker link.  She escapes on the back of a wing horse and is found close to dead by a young man named Lewen (who happens to be the twenty year old son of Lilanthe and Niall).  And yet, her journey has only just begun.  The story leaves you hanging quite a bit, so now I'm stuck waiting for the next installment. Very much worth my time and yours.
