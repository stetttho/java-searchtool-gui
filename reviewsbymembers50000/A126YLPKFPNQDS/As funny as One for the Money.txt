 I always find Evanovich's books funny, but I don't remember laughing as much with this one since the very first one.  Throughout the entire book I giggled like a school girl on her first crush.  Between the wrestling gramdmas to the cake fight, it was hilarious.  Of course, Stephanie always looses a car, but how about three?  Then there is Morelli--Mr. Happy had to lock himself in another room to get some rest!  And Ranger having to scrable video to keep his worker's minds on their job and not Stephanie's top.  Whew!  I'm giggling again just thinking about it.  Of course there is a crime to solve--apparently four men left their jobs one afternoon to never return and some crazy person from Stephanie's past is leaving treatening notes and car bombs to scare her.  Granted, this is nothing new for Stephanie and she doesn't even take it as seriously as she would have, say in about book five or six, but it is enough to make her go snooping to find out who it is.  Most intersting of all is the fact that the story begins with Stephanie quiting her job and turning her job position over to Lula (I'm sure you can imagine the possibilities there).  Therefore she spends her time throughout the story going from one dead-end job to another until she finally finds more "stable" employment working for Ranger (again--the possiblities!)  I know it sounds like I'm giving it all away, but trust me, there is soooo much more.  Okay, enough with me, stop reading it and go out and buy that book!
