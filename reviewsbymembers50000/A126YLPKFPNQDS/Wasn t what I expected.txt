 The novel was great.  I enjoy all of Berg's work.  I think her characterization is beyond comparison.  I'm not sure what happened in this novel.  The story starts off like usual.  Karon is off leading a fight.  Seri is at home trying to raise their son, Gerik.  Then suddenly, Karon want's to kill Gerik.  Gerik flees to a new world, the Bounded.  Which is a really interesting place.  Nearly 1/2 of the book is spent in this new world, with Gerik trying to solve its problems.  Eventually he leaves the Bounded to solve his family problems as well as the problems of the other two worlds.    The only problems I had with this book is that the world of the Bounded and the actual bad guy in the end of the story was never introduced.  I don't understand how these people could just pop up out of no where.  Would this stop me from reading any other books from Berg?  Of course not.  Berg is still a very talented writer and will always be on my number one list of reads.
