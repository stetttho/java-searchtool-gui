 I picked up this book solely on the reviews I read on Amazon.com.  I prefer fantasy to sci-fi, but I truly enjoyed this book.  I plan to look into reading more by Wen Spencer.   Tinker is based only 30-40 years in the future.  In this world, a piece of Earth, Pitsburg (of all places) is now located on a planet from a different demention.  In this world, Elves are at the top of the food chain.  Once a month, Pitsburg is transfered back to Earth for 24 hours (called Shutdown).  For those 24 hours they are able to gather supplies, take care of business, etc.  Also during Shutdown, pretty much all electronic equipment, including phone lines, are dead.  It was during this Shutdown that our hero (Tinker) saves an elf's life.  Spencer then brings us on a roller coaster ride, where we follow the lead character, a physic's genius at age 18, discover her first romance, as well as save the world (both of them) by becoming involve in political intrigue.    What amazed me the most was the way Spencer was able to blend the romance, fight scenes, science, and political intrique together so flaulessly.  I wonder, though, is there a follow-up story to this one?  I plan to find out as soon as I send this through! ;-)
