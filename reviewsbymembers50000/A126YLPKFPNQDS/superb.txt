 Carol Berg has got to be one of the best modern riders.  Her characterization is far and above anything I have yet to read.  Each character in the story is unique in their personafication.  They, also, grow and change throughout the story based on their experiences. In this first novel of the D'Arnath trilogy, our heroine, Seri, is upper class citizen, intellegent, free speaking, and of outstanding character.  She has a close nitch of friends, one of which she falls into love with.  They marry and are happy.  Problem: He is a sorcerer, which is punishable by torture and death in society.  Seri helps keep her husbands secret and supports his choices.  Karen, Seri's husband, has a special gift that allows him to heal the sick (somethimes from even close death).  Regardless of the risk of being caught, Karen continues to use his powers for any in need.  Eventually, he is caught.  Now they, and their friends, will have to pay the price.   This is only the flashback during the story.  In current time, Seri meets a mysterious stranger (naked and without his memory)  she has to unlock his past in order to save the world.   Fast pased, fasinating, intriquing, well-written.  I went sleepless nights reading this novel.  You will not regret buying it either.
