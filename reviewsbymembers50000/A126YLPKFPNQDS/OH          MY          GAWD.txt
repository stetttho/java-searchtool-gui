 You have got to be kidding me.  Did all those readers that signed their name to those quotes in the front of the book even bother to read the book?  The only reason I even bothered to buy the book was because of the all the glowing reviews.  How terrible!  I can't remember the last time I read such amaturish writing.  The characters were completely flat, boring, and sterotypical.  The leading man (our supposed brawny hero) was a pansy.  I begin to cringe halfway through the story whenever a sex scene came into play.  I mean, really, "f**k me" might be a bit sexy the first time, but after the twentith time it's just crude and trashy.  I hated the sterotypical "broomstick skirts" all the witches wore and the swords on the fairies.  Did not the rest of the population think this strange?  Or how about the hero (after not being on earth for 2000 years) fit in perfectly with society and speak the language?  There was so many holes in this story it could have been mistaken for Swiss cheese.    Nothing could compare to the completely flat characters that did not illicit the merest amount of feeling from me even with the death in the family--me, who normaly becomes so emotionly involved within a story that I cry at the happy scenes as well as the sad?    Regardless, I have no desire to read anything further from this author.
