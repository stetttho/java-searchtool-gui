 Usually I can guess fairly early on what the secret is in a book.  I could not with this one.  There are five people in this small town with unusual abilities.  Apparently, all five were born at midnight and all five can enter this surreal blue world for one hour at midnight every night while the rest of the world is frozen in time.  Only they are not alone.  The basis of all nightmares is awake and moving around with them.  These nightmare creatures usually leave the humans alone, but when the fifth person (new in town) arrives, they come out of the shadows after her and they definitely mean harm.  The other four do their best in protecting her until they can figure out what her special powers are and why the creatures see her as a threat.  Great suspense and action.  I'm looking forward to see where Westerfeld will take this plot line.
