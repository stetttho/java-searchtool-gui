 How often I have read stories written in diary format are too numerous for me to count.  Yet, I have never read one quite as well put together as this one.  I've read one other book by Rees', called Pirates!, and was fascinated with Rees' research ability of a certain time period.  In Witch Child, I found the same thing.  Rees' did a wonderful job of capturing the Puritains of this time period, as well as, hardships and trials upon a ship crossing to America.  Witch Child is definately a fantasy, but the fantasy part is not so much "in your face."  It is much more subtle.  The main character escapes on a ship headed to America.  She befriends an older lady who is also on her own.  Upon arrival they travel through the wilderness to join the group of family members that arrived the year before.  I would hate to give the story away so I won't say more about it.  I loved the ending, though.    I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
