 Margiere and Leesil continue on their journey for answers. Answers about both their mothers. This book picks up directly where the second left off and I would not recommend for anyone to try reading this one without reading the first two.  Regardless of Leesil's determination to find his mother, especially after finding out in book two that she may still be alive, Margiere talks him into returning to her home in order to find information on her father (the vampire who mated with a human to create a warrior against his own people). The reader discovers early on in the story just what went into creating a Damphir (mainly the bloody sacrafice of five different magical creatures, each representing a different element--spirit, water, fire, earth, and air).  Hot on her tail is Welsteil and Chane (a partner), who is also determined that Margiere gains for him the treasure he seeks.  This story is first a vampire book, second a horror, and lastly a romance.  If you think you will find the sultry romance which is becoming popular with authors such as Freeman, you need to look elsewhere.  There is very little romance and no sexual tension in these novels.  I'm not stating this as a negative, I actually prefer it this way, but I wanted to clarify what another reviewer mentioned.  The reason I gave this book four instead of five stars is due to editing.  Several times I stumbled in my reading due to glitches in the print.  Extra words or missing words, causing the reader to have to reread to clarify the meaning of the text.
