 Kitty is a werewolf DJ taking the midnight to four job at a small local radio station.  After taking a call from a vampire and dishing out advice she becomes an overnight senstation and begins to travel on the road to sendication.  But her radio station is not only attracting the supernatural in need of advice, it's also attracted a wacked out serial killer.  After Kitty's "coming-out" she joins the police to help stop the serial killer.   Great refreshing novel.  Definitely not something done before.  I loved it; even finished it in one night.
