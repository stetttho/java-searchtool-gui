 I read Single White Vampire and Love Bites in one night each, and thought them fresh and funny.  It took me a week to slave through this book.  It lacks all the humor the first two contained and therefore all the reasons I bothered reading all three.  Come on people, does a reader REALLY need 300 descriptions on just how much one person thinks the other person is sexy.  I got it the first 20 times it was said, thank you!  None of these characters were endearing, funny, or interesting to me.  The off the wall situations Sands introduced that (I'm guessing here) she thought would make people laugh, was unrealistic, and therefore unrelatiable.  Please give me some plot here!
