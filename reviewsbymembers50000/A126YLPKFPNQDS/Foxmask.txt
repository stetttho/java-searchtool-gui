 Beautifully written story picking up 18 years after Wolfskin.  In this novel, Marillier devils in the lives and relationships of the grown children.  Marillier is a true artist as a writer, and even though it slightly, only slightly, lacked the emotional roller coaster found, and therefore expected in all her novels, it is still a novel that cannot be missed.
