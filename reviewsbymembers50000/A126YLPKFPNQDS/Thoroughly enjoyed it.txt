 I read the first three in the series and then jumped to this one.  Regardless of missing a lot of meat along the way, I was still able to fumble through this book. There was a lot of action and I was happy to see that the character, Harry, grew from the first few books.  Granted, he's still growing and making mistakes, but he seems to be thinking things through more.  One major complaint I have about the book is a screw up in printing.  My copy seemed to have been missing about 10 pages in the center of the book.  Instead of the missing pages, 10 pages repeated itself.  How disappointed I was.  I never did get to find out how the meeting with Queen Mab went.  Thus, I gave it four stars instead of five.
