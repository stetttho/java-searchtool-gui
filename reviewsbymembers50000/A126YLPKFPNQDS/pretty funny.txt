 Loved the beginning and middle.  I found it funny and full of action.  Strange and different take on the vampire. I mean, who ever heard of a vampire--once upon a time monk?  The scene with the sex doll was hilarious (especially when they were moving it around--like into the trunk).   I found the very end to become a bit contrite.  I thought it could have been pulled together better than it was.  Otherwise, great read and an looking forward to more.
