 I was told by many people to try this author out, but held off for several years.  The books are so large and intimidating.  I never felt I would have the time to read the whole thing, not to mention I normally hate romance novels.  I finaly gave in and tried Outlander and what a surprise.  This is no ordinary romance novel...this is an adventure, fantasy, action novel.  I read the whole book in a matter of three days.  They ran to the local book store (no offense amazon) to pick up the next.  I can't wait until Gabaldon continues the series with another novel.
