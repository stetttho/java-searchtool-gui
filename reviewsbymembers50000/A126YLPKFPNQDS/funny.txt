 The story was sooo cute.  I especially like the play between Katie and her four over protective brothers.  The jokes they play on each other and their interview of her new "boyfriend."  The drinking scene and the condom scene were hilarious.  Of course the sexual tension was great.  Big Warrior Man Shows His Woman a Night of Passion Therefore She Will Fall in Love With Him I guess would be too long of a title, but it basically sums up the whole book.  Of course, Katie doesn't agree with becoming intimately involved with someone only for them to leave her for always, so she puts him off.  Surprisingly, I can relate better to that than the fall into bed scenes found in most romances.    Definitely five stars!
