 How disappointed I was to finish this book and realize I would have to wait for the next. I picked up the first in the series after reading the reviews and recommendations through amazon.com and have no regrets.     In this third installment, Alissa, our main character, is still struggling with flying lessons as a ruku and is practicing her skills as a master. Unfortunately, during one practice of tripping the lines, she is transported back hundreds of years in time. Back to when the castle was teaming with people. She meets new friends and interesting new characters, but also one old friend.    She tries despirately to get back especially when she realizes she is loosing control to Beast and soon realizes if she does not figure a way home, she could become Beast permentely.     What I like the most of Cook's book is her witty characters. I laughed aloud several times from their antics. Especially in the end. Just remember this: "meat" and "I only need one night," and think of me. I'm smiling again just thinking about it.
