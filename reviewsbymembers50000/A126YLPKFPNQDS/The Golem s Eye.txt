 I was looking forward to this book, since I thoroughly enjoyed the first in the series.  I'm happy to see so many great reviews.  The writing was wonderful and strong.  I just didn't think it was as good as the first one.  Bartemus's character is wonderfully put together and it is easy for the reader to see that he is wise (how can he not be with all those years behind him).  Unfortunately, Nat has is growing to become snobbish and conceited.  I wished for a bit more action and flow of writing, which is why I gave it four instead of five stars.
