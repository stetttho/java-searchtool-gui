 I'm surprised to see this new novel does not have dozens of reviews.  Freeman does a wonderful job of characterization. As stated before in previous reviews, each character is well rounded and interesting (evil, as well as the good guys). It was hard for me to pick up this book in the first place since the front cover was a turn off for me.  It reminded me of Planet of the Apes; only with mountain lions.  I am so not into Planet of the Apes, but now that I've finished it I regret not reading it sooner.  The story is about a young soldier (like a foot soldier) named Rabbit (human) who while out lost with his troop meets up with Laurel (the human form mountain lion-a magical being).  After making a convenant with Laurel to save his troop, Laurel returns with the troop to speak with the commander to ask for protection to visit the king with a serious problem from his land.    The conflicts:   1. Humans hate, fear, and in some cases--don't believe in magical beings. Therefore it is dangerous for Laurel to be out on his own. 2.  Possible war is on the horizon.  Since Laurel want's to speak to the king about the murder of several other magical beings (including sprites, unicorns, dragons, and other Faena like himself.)  3.  Several people are trying to take over the kingdom  4.  Humans are turning.  You'll have to read to find out into what.  The action is fast paced and the 548 page book is very difficult to put down.  Happy reading!
