 Briggs has managed to produce another intriguing novel with well developed characters.  After ten years of fighting in the war, Tier is on his way home.  He snuck away at the tender age of sixteen and is unsure of his welcome at the bakery.  In a small down along the way he comes across a Traveler being burned on a pier.  Upon entering the local tavern, he observes a second traveler about to be sold or burn and decides to step in and save the young life.  He places himself as the young girl's protector even against his own family who do not welcome her with open arms.  And this is where Briggs earns her four stars instead of five.  She skips twenty years in the future.  She literally gets you deeply interested in the lives of young Tier and Sereph and then moves them on to an old married couple with teenage children.  I would have loved reading more about how they fall in love.  What they had to endure in a world that would look upon the mixed marriage with disappoval.  Briggs does include a few flashbacks to their early marriage.  The story of the two teenage sons and one daughter is also wonderful.  They are interesting and unique characters; so the book is enjoyable regardless. I think you would find it well worth your time.
