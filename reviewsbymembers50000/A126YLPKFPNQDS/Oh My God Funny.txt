 So you have this eccentric vampire, Luc, who really just wants to be left alone to write his NONFICTION history books and not bother with the telephone, email, mail, or any real human contact.  Even his own vampire family can be a bit bothersome at times.  It's not like he is really undead--he can go out in the sun, with protective sunscrean; he can eat foods, with a supplement of a lot of blood; he doesn't sleep in a coffin, regardless of the fact there is one in his basement.  He can do lot's of normal everyday things.  So why is this nut job of an editor, Kate, hounding him.  First she writes constantly.  Asking for his email, his phone number, his consent to do public book signings.  I mean is she nuts?  She says his fiction vampire romance books are a hit, but what makes her think they are fiction.  The stories of how his parents, brother, and sister met their wife and husbands is absolutely true.  And to put the icing on the cake, the woman has actually showed up at his house and brought her luggage.  Sheesh!  Life will never be the same.  This novel cracked me up!  I think you will enjoy it, too.
