 What a strange role reversal.  The men are pampered, raise the children, give the comfort (kissing the booboos), and generally have the soft hearts.  They wrap their arms around the female's neck and seek comfort and strength by cuddling into her body.  I know. . . it sounds so feminine.  You wouldn't think you could become involve in such a novel.  You wouldn't think you could picture a such a man attractive, yet, you do.    In this strange world, based in a time period similar to the 19th century, men are EXTREMELY rare.  Whole groups of sisters that can number as many as 10 to 30 women will share a husband in order to have offspring.  The results would be another huge brode of girl siblings, with the hopes of perhaps one boy (more than that and the family was considered lucky and rich).  The women guard there men by keeping them hidden away from any other woman not a sister or mother under guard.  Meanwhile, the women are the ones who rule, work, fight, and labor.    Jerin Whistler's family is one of the lucky ones. He may have over 25 female siblings, but he is also the oldest of four brothers, too.  His sisters protect their commodity with all their force.  He and his brothers are their only chance of purchasing their own husbands to share in the future.  Because the wealth of four brothers, they will be able to split the sisters in two to three groups.  Each group sharing one husband they will get after selling or trading a brother for.  Jerin will be coming of age for marriage in only a few months (he'll be turning 16!) when a stranger is attacked on their land.  With the elder sisters and mothers gone, it is up to Jerin and a younger sister (for protection) to bring the stranger home and out of danger.  Little do they all realize, she's also a princess, and her and her sisters will change all their lives.  I could not put this novel down.  I started reading in the evening and the next thing I knew it, it was four in the morning!
