 I was slightly disappointed with the second in this series, since Rachel was a shown just too dim-witted, BUT this one has turned out to be the best out of three.  Rachel is still a bit goofy, but is portrayed more devoted to her relationships and honest.  Which is weird, because she get's in a huge fight with Jenks for her not being completely honest with him.  I would hate to spoil everything that happens in the story like a few other reviewers do.  I'll only give you the basic jest of it.  After encountering several possible employees and friends with problems with a new bad lord come to town, Rachel is pulled in to stop the bad guy.  Stanley want's to take up Piscary's old stumping ground, and believe it or not, he's worse than Piscary.  New characters are introduced--a new elf and werewolf. Old ones returned--soooo glad to see Kisten again (in my imagination of course).  Ivy is put in a more humane light and we even get to meet her family.  Al is back and way evil.  Then, to top it all off--a demon--that even Al is afraid of.  I stayed up to three in the morning because I could not put this one down.  The action was nonstop and fabulous. I don't just mean the fighting and running for your life, but it was a little racey, too. And yet, even though problems were solved, Harrison left a few strings hanging, so you know this is not the last you've seen of the Hallows.  I can't wait for the next one.
