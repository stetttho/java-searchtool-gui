 This series will be the death of me.  I cannot stop reading it.  Everything else gets put on hold while I read it.  This is obviously an old series and I picked up all three at once.  I'm a fast reader, but I took my time reading this because it was so well written and I was afraid to miss the least thing mentioned.  It took me a week to read the first and a week to read this one.  I'm not picking up the third one until I get some personal things taken care of first.  You truly fall into the lives of these characters.  I can't tell you how often I shed tears for Fritz.  What a tragic life he leads, and yet he goes on.  He has loyal friends who love him, but it's like everyone's hands are tied. It's either sink or swim, and they are definately swimming with sharks.  Fritz does have a little bit of happiness in this novel.  He gets to spend time with Molly, his love. But even that becomes heartache when he realizes Molly is receiving visits from Regal.  I don't want to explain everything that is happening in this series, it is just too numerous to mention.  I can promise that this series is a great adventure, one not to miss.
