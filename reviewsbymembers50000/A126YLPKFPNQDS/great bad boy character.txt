 Almost every woman is attracted to the bad-boy image.  Edge personifies that bad-boy, take-it-or-leave-it attitude. Very sexy. Edge wasn't always bad.  When he was newly formed he was the leader of a gang of abandoned newly-formed vampires, mostly kids (one was transformed at only 12).  They all turn to Edge for guidance.  One night, one of the gang does not return, so Edge goes out to find him.  When he returns empty handed, it is to find all the fledglings brutally murdered.  He cuts down the bodies, cleans them, and burns their home.  Then pledges to revenge his love ones no matter what, no matter how ruthless he has to become.    The person he hunts is Stiles.  He had already captured him twice before and killed him, only to watch Stiles walk away from death.  Obviously Stiles has found a way to beat death.  After treateningly questioning several of Stiles old co-workers, assistances, etc., he discovers that Amber Lily is the key.  Stiles obviously found a way to eternal life after experiments done on Amber Lily.  Therefore, if he finds a way to destroy Amber Lily, then he will have a way to destroy Stiles.  Of course, he wasn't expecting her to be so innocent or attractive.
