 This book is one of the funniest I read in a really long time.  I use to laugh like this for Janet Evonovich's Stephanie Plum novels, and what a relief to find a subtitute for the lacking series.  Vampire readers, romance readers, and fantasy readers will enjoy this light comedy.  It begins with the death of the main character, Betsy.  She knows she is dead, but thinks something has happened to her to make her a walking zombie, goodness knows she doesn't remember being bit by a vampire (at least not in the convintional sense).  So she immediately tries to finish the job!  Jumping off buildings, electrocution, buses, noting works. Imagine the surprise on her family's face when they see her strolling in?  Imagine her hated step-mother's face?!  Then there are these crazy vampires who use every cliche' from the movies and are really sore at her for laughing at them because of it.  The one reward?  Eric!  Guys, this novel is hilarious!  You will not be able to put it down!
