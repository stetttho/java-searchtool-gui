 I'm surprised to hear this is his first novel.  Sanderson writes as if he has the experience of several successful novels under his belt.  I read alot and I normally can predict correctly what will occur next in a novel, yet he had me fooled even with the trival things until the very last page.    In this novel you will find twist, intrigue, and just a smidgen of romance. Elantris was a powerful city of gods and goddesses with wonderous powers that was used for the good of all.  Yet, ten years ago that power suddendly disappered. The once gods and goddessed of Elantris turned into horid half corpses without even a heart beat.  The gates of Elantris was closed and locked from the outside and the people stricken with the wasting sickness were locked inside without water, food, or clothing.  Many turned feral.  Others laid in the street in agony.  Yet, when the prince of land woke one morning to find himself with the tell-tell signs of becoming an Elantris, he decides to change things for the better in dismal city of Elantris.    Meanwhile, his fiance', who was on her way to meeting him for the first time, finds herself a widow before she even becomes a bride.  She, too, decides to change things the better in the city of "free" people and is determine to save the land.  Great story.  Great premise.  I'm looking forward to more from this author.
