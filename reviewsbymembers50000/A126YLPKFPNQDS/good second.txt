 I liked it.  It took me some time to get aquainted with the story line, since it had been some time since I read the first in the series.  I ended up spending most of my time trying to remember who was who.  I couldn't even remember if the emperor was old or young or in-between until Seraph made a comment about him being only a few years older than Jes.  I still liked it, though.  Some readers complained about it be repetitious, but if it wasn't somewhat so, I would never have remembered enough of the first to enjoy this second.  It's definitely not a stand alone book.  The story continues were the first left off.  You get to see the budding romance between Jes and Hennea. And a friendship develop between the emperor, Phoran, and little Rinnie.  (It makes me think that Rinnie might be the future queen in some later book--once she's old enough.)  There is still alot of guessing going on.  For example, what is Hennea hiding?  Who is the shadowed?  Enough to keep you reasing through the book.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
