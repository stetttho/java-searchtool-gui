 Wasn't sure what to expect when I began reading this book.  It is actually two novellas.  The first by Howell tells of a vampire keep lord that wants to water down his vampire blood by taking a mortal wife.  The "vampire" aspect is not very primary in either tales, but Howell explains more in her part than Sands does.  Apparently, in Howell's part, they really don't need to drink blood at all, even less so when they are only part vampire.  With the exception of when they are hurt or near death.  Cathell pretty much finds his bride when she is literarly deposited before him in his bed by one of his men.  Then and there he decides she will be his wife and over the next few weeks "woos" her by capturing her in very heated embraces every chance he gets.  Only Bridget is not everything she seems.    In the second novella by Sands, the vampire aspect is a bit different, since the vampires have to feed.  I don't think this was meant to happen since Cathell and Connell are cousins and are blood realted.  Perhaps Howell and Sands should have got their basic facts straight before writing the novellas.  Anyway, Connell is not as luckly in finding a mortal bride as Cathell is.  He actually has to send six men out to buy one from her miserly brother.  Eva is brought to the keep and spends several days without even seeing her husband.  Apparently Connell is a bit more shy than Cathell.  Meanwhile, while trying to prove her worth, Eva gets into several accidents.  They finally start to meet with each other over a chess game and Eva proclaims to her husband, let's just get "it" over with.  Well, that definitely breaks the ice!  Of course, there is problem to over come in this book too, since someone is trying to kill Connell.    I enjoyed both.  I've read other Sands' books, and after this, I think I will look into more from Howell, since after comparing the two, she sounds like the more adept writer.
