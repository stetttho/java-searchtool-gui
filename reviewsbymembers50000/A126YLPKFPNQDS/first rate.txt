 Dawn Cook has managed to write a series that is totally unique.  Hidden Truth picks up where First Truth left off.  You have Alissa and Strell at the Hold being domestic, while fending off the evil Bailic. All three are becoming restless.  Strell, due to his unvoiced love of Alissa; Bailic, due to his wanting the book open; and Alissa, because she want's to know where the heck is that darn raku, Useless!  Useless does show up of course and begins his tutorage of Alissa (of course in the nick of time to prevent Bailic's temper from overloading).  Bailic, thinking Strell is the Keeper, attempts to teach him magic and is pleased by the results (unbeknoweth to him that Alissa is the one actually performing the deeds.)  Bailic desides to attempt the rising of the ghosts of the nearby ghost village of Ese' Nawoer.  It doesn't work, but in the process Alissa does.  Enter Lodesh, ancient Warden of Ese Nawoer.  Things become increasingly interesting from here on.  I actually read the third book in this series before this one.  Please don't do this, although it did not take away from the third in the series (increadibly good/funny) it did take away from Hidden Truth.  Having done this, I could easily see how Cook prepared and led the series into the third.  Everything in Hidden Truth is a set up for Forgotten Truth (Third).    I highly recommend any and all books in this series, but please be prepared to stay up late finishing it off.
