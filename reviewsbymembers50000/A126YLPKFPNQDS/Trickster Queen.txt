 How wonderful to finally find out what happens.  I'm so glad TP completed this story in two books instead of four.  Even though I gave this five stars I have to say I wished she gave more detail to the character and character relationships.  It seemed to me she did so in the first part, and yet focused more on the war and battle stratgies in this one.  Regardless, it is an excellent piece of work and would be well worth a fantasy reader's time and money.
