 Well developed characters.  Interesting world and topics.  Strange and unusual creatures.  Great book.  The writing is not the same caliber as some Briggs other books, but overall great read. The female protagonist is strong and independent, which is a change from the usual.  Some of the plot's topics (slavery, rape, murder) is serious and disturbing, but not unbearable.  The story is of an escape slave that returns to her slavery roots--for a lack of a better word, to uncover a plot to kill the king (also a friend's brother).  The story is a fast paced read and don't be surprised if you stay up late to finish it all in one night--I did.
