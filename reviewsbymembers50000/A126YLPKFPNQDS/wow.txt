 Great book.  I finished it in one night.  It was just too great to put down.  What a fantastic world Snyder created.  Basically a country runned by milatary rule.  Everything is to the letter.  There is no gray areas.  If you kill someone, even is self defense or by accident, your hanged.  Which is what is going to happen to our herione.  After spending almost a year in prision she is let out for her hanging.  Amazingly, rules are set saying that the next person up for a hanging will be asked to be the next food taster for the Commander and she is it.  So let's see, live in the palace, eat great food, bath, sleep in a warm soft bed or or or or or be hanged?  Well, duh.  Life is not all rosy, though.  The Commander's second seems to be intent on poisoning her himself while training her and regardless of his harsh ways, she thinks she's falling for him.  Also, several others are trying to kill her.  Especially, the father of the man she killed.  A lot of intrique.  A lot of mystery.  A lot of surprises.  I loved it and can't wait for the next.
