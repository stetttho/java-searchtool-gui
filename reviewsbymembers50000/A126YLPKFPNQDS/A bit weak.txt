 Okay, so you have this somewhat crippled woman, Allie, (by the way her name is Allegra--like the medicine!  It drove be batty--what kind of author would name a character after an allergy medicine?) who meets this vampire.  Now this girl is painted by the author as having all these issues about being in control.  Apparently she had this real lame husband who beat her as well as other things I won't bother to mention for those of you who want to read the book. Then you have this vampire, Christian, (Another name that drove me crazy because I kept forgetting this was his name and then she would use it in a sentence and I thought she was talking relegion--how weird is that?)  Who is desperate to find the love of his life in order to complete him.  (This entire plot practicaly stunk of a very popular series by another author who I will not name--which cause another problem with me because I cannot stand authors who steal plots.) Okay, so the author goes on and on about how perfect Christian is physically, but is a real pig when it comes to women's rights.  All she says about the heroine is that she has weird eyes and a messed up leg.  She doesn't tell you anything else about how she looks, so you are left with a limping shadow woman when you picture the scenes in your mind.  Yet, they are maddly drawn together.  Next thing you know it they can't get enough of each other.  This premise totally goes against what she set up in the beginning.   Ultimately, the author's characterization bites the big one.  And I don't know about you, but if the characterization stinks--the book stinks. I gave it two stars because the sex scenes were okay. Hope this helps.
