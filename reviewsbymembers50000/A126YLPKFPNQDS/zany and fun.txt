 I loved the previous books by Evanovich and Hughes following the trials and tribulations of Jamie and Max, but I think I enjoyed this one even more.  Full Bloom switches to a whole new set of characters (don't worry, the old ones stop in to visit--often!) Annie is this fiery red-head.  She's short, smart, smart-mouthed, and has a temper that can make the almost strong man weep.  She happens to run a bed and breakfast that has been in her family for generations and she inherited from her grandmother (it just so happened to be a bordello in a previous life).  There are two, funny old ladies who are permanent residence and the psychic, formally introduced in a previous book as a visiting guest. (Of course she attracts the ghost) Then there is the handyman, a good for nothing drunk, which begins the story.  Why, because Annie has been hired by Jamie and Max to hold their wedding at her bed & breakfast, and the handyman is no where to be found.  When he does show up, Annie decides to teach him a lesson by chasing him around a tree, swinging at him with a rolling pin.  When a stranger arrives and tries to stop the ruckus, he gets beaned in the head with the rolling pen--twice!  Of course the stranger is HOT and Annie feels terribly guilty.  He threatens to sue, she offers lunch and the help of the retired doctor next door.  Only the stranger doesn't know the retired doctor is retired from veternarian medicine and accidently gives him a horse tranq.  Trust me, it only gets better.  Later in the story, Annie's husband's (the one she thought deserted her three years before) body turns up in her back yard and she is accused of the murder.  The good looking stranger turns out to be a P. I. hired by Annie's mother-in-law, and basically the whole world goes insane.  And just think, I only covered the first chapter or two!   Happy reading!
