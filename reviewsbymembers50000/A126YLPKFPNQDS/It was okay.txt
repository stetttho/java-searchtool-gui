 I've read other books by Hobb and thoroughly enjoyed them, but somehow I just could not get envolved with this book.  There were sooo many characters and sometimes you would have to wait through five to six chapters before Hob would return to that character so that you could find out what happened.  This would normally not bother me in the least, but I never was able to form an attachment to any one character.  I simply could not relate and because of that I simply could not enjoy the book as much.  Granted the story itself was excellent and the world was well thought out.  I think if Hobb would have focused on fewer charactesr and attempted to developed them more, I would have enjoyed it more.  I finished this book, realizing in the end that nothing was solved and I would have to read through two more oversized ones before I would ever find out.  I ended up only scanning through the next one and returning them to the library.  Sorry, Amazon, but I am glad I did not bother to pay money for them.
