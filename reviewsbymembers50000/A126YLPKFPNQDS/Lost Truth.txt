 I am so happy to find this series.  I love Cook's witty dialogue.  In the fourth book of the series, we have Alissa going on a journey.  For years now, Alissa has been having dreams of a girl named Silla. Now she realizes Silla is a real Raku over half a world away.  She talks Useless in letting her travel to find the Lost Ones.  Before, Useless has been overly protective of the last surving female raku (Alissa), but overcome with worry and hope of finding the lost ones, he agrees to let Alissa, Connen-newt, Strell, and Lodesh travel to find and bring back his people.  The raku she finds on the faraway island are shocked and outraged by Alissa's ways and knowledge, especially Useless's wife, Keribdis.  Keribdis realizes early on that Alissa could be considered a threat to her leadership and makes it her mission to get rid of the young raku.    This book is filled with adventure and excitement. I loved it.  For fans, you will be releaved to find out that Alissa finally chooses between Lodesh and Strell.  I was pleased!
