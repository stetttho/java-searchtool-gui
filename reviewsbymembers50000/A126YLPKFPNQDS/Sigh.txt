 I've read every one of LKH's books (including the Merry series).  I was so excited to see the heafty 650+ novel.  Normally I would finish one of her books in one to two nights, so the enjoyment of this one would last, I thought to myself.  The last novel (Merry Gentry one) was a major disappointment (all sex and absolutely NO PLOT--not an exaggeration, either).  She definitely had to have plot in this one.  I mean, how could she write 650 pages of nothing but sex scenes?  Well, ladies and gentlemen, call Believe It or Not! because she did. Okay, I'll be fair, about 600 pages were nothing but sex, the rest was plot.  The story starts off promising.  Anita is serving, on the grooms side--tux and all--in Larry's wedding.  She gets a phone call at the reception to attend to a murder scene where a stripper was murdered by muliple bites of a vampire.  This is where I got really excited.  I was thinking to myself, "Yea! Plot!  The old LKH is BACK!  Then on page 30, give or take a few, begins the sex.  Then there is more and more, and by the way, MORE sex by multiple partners, places, times.  It's not even good sex, just the same old thing-but different partners.  Then around page 600, she solves the murders.  AUGH!  Something has got to change.  I want my old Anita BACK! Not all this unrealistic, cold-hearted rubbish!
