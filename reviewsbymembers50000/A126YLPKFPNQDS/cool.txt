 I liked it alot.  A well known reconstructive surgeon is kidnapped by wealthy vampire to correct his distroyed face.  She does the work, but instead of thanked and sent on her way, she is locked in the room with him when he comes out of his trance. Well, he's hungry, she's food, and one thing leads to another.  I thought this was better put together than most paranormal romance books.  Viehl at least tried to explain the vampire concept.  She intertwines the church, templars, the black death, and the holy wars in her explaination.  I know it sounds crazy, but at least she tries to explain it logically, unlike other writers.  Overall, I'm looking forward to reading more.
