 I actually listened to this on tape.  It was my first Reichs book.  I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it.  It reminded me alot of the Lincoln Rhyme novels (character of a book--not author).  Reichs did an excellent job of explaining the process of her characters job without overloading the reader with difficult to understand mumbo jumbo.  Of course, like I said--I did the audio version, so that might had contribute to my understanding.   In this story, the main character has to discover the cause of death of three skeletons found in the basement of a pizza parlor.  What she finds is frightening and grotesque--not to mention a threat to her life. I will definitely try another book from this author.
