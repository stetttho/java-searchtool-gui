 I was a little disappointed in this one since it was not as "put together" as the first one.  The story picks up about six year later, which is when Emily has come of age to marry.  Seylin has also found himself in absolute love of her and has been trying to find a way to ask her.  When he does, she misunderstands his meaning and ends up arguing with him instead. Seylin knows he is not the only one who is after Emily's hand in marrage and when he suggested for her to marry the other in the heat of a fight, she readily agrees. Devastated after the fight, Seylin decides to leave the Goblins to find his own people, the elves.  When Emily realizes what she had done, she sets out to find him and bring him back.  Each, in the months outside the Hollow Kingdom, have their own adventures and learn something about themselves, as well as the world around them.  What I found lacking in this book was the focal point of the story.  The author kept switching around on us.  At first it was about Emily and Seylin, then it was about the elf, Sable.  Then she switches to Rose.  Then there was Richard and his problem.  And before the book was over, she switches again to Til and Catspaw--another nine years in the future.  It was almost like she was having a hard time finding a story, so she through in a whole bunch together in a mix-match.
