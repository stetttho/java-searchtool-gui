 Read this in under two hours.  I've read some of Atwater-Rhodes latest novels and found them wonderfully in-depth, so of course I was fasinated to read her first ever.  All I can guess is the reason this book is so acclaimed is because she wrote it when she was only thirteen.  As a matter fact, this fact is stated in the bio, as well as the back cover of the book.  (Like it is the selling point of the book--which it is.)  I found it lacking the emotion found in her book characters she is so well known for in later novels.  I'm guessing  because thirteen year olds don't have the life experence to know what passion is?  I don't mean romantic passion, but just passion in general.  The concept of the story was interesting and she did a fairly good job of flashbacks.  The story is about Risika, who was unwillingly transformed into a vampire three hundred years previously.  In the present she is basically picking for a fight with another vampire who is suppose to be stronger than her just for the hell of picking on him.  He keeps warning her away, she keeps disreguarding the warnings until she faces him down.  I can't really say more or I'll be telling the entire story--it's extremely short.  I think I'll stick to her latest novels.
