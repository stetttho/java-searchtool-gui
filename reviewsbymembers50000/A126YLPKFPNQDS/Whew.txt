 My goodness!  This is not just a book, it's really porn, with a plot (I guess that makes it girly porn).  Ha!  Here we have three novellas.  All are related in that they are members of a crew on the starship Starrunner.  In the first one, we have a crazy colony where all the men get off whipping their errant wives for burning dinner.  Until Captain Nathan arrives.  In the second, the second mate seduces the princess with a little S & M.  In the third, one crewmember is stranded with the sexy enemy and a waterfall.  Ha!  I want to bust out laughing just writing this because it is so corny.  Yet, I really enjoyed it.  Angela Knight made it work.  Her sex scene (which were numerous) were well written and vivid and there was a definitely workable plot that kept the story interesting and fast paced.  I'm looking forward to reading more.  For those who were comparing her to Anita Blake -- PLEASE!  Hamilton needs to take pointers.  Hamilton ain't got nothing on Knight.
