 I'm surprised to find so many five stars.  I thought it was "okay."  The vampires are bad and as numerous as cockroaches, yet one particular vampire has managed to keep a hold on his humanity. The herione in the story is born a vampire, but has not come into her vampire ways yet.  This is never explained.  I mean, how did she become one. Why is her mother able to give birth to her?  Who was her father?  The author left so many confusing and unanswered questions.  I found this made the story itself lacking.
