 Moning continues her story with the druid family by introducing an ancestor from the ninth century--thus explaining the hidden library in the process.  You discover in this book that everything that has happened thus far in every book is by the whim of the Seelie Queen.    Cian is probably my favorite (beside Black of course) so far.  He's very manly-man (in a caveman sort of way).  I kept waiting for him to hit the Jessie over the head and drag her by her hair back to his cave.  There were a few parts that made me laugh.  The famale character is practically a carbon copy of every other one that has come before (which is a common problem in all of Moning's books).  Although she did try to changer her a little by making her look smart and slutty.  What confused me was how she kept saying how "horney" she was in the beginning of the book and then near the middle (like all the other characters) we discover she is a virgin.  So . . . why was she horney?  Usually you have to actually try something before you can miss it.  Oh well, whatever.  Weird thing is I'll probably keep reading them just to see what will happen with the queen and if Black will show up again.
