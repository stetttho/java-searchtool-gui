 Whereas, Martin's writing in itself, was just as honest as before, I felt as though I read 700+ pages and discovered that nothing--nothing--nothing! was resolved.  The story went no where.  The only thing I felt was gained was a deeper insight into Jamie.  He truly was a deluded soul. He believed so strongly in his nutso sister and was so completely entralled by her that he became blind to all else, even common morals. The reader begins to feel sorry for him, even though he attempts to gather inner strength.    What drove me the most crazy about this installment, other than the fact that many of my favorite characters were glaringly absent, was the fact that Martin decided to leave the reader with HUGE cliffhangers.  You really have no idea if some of these characters are dead or alive.  In previous books (I believe the second one it was) he told the reader in the end that little Bran survived, but here, well, I guess we'll have to wait a year or so to find out.  Hopefully, it won't be more than that.  Over all, still a wonderful read, I only took off one star for the problems listed above.  After all, if Martin want's to make sure to make a killing on his next, he most certainly accomplished that.  I possitively on pins and needles waiting.
