 I read all the others in this series and enjoyed them, thoroughly.  Yet, this one left me wanting.  The characters were flat and steriotypical.  The action seemed forced.  The entire book is of running, running, running.  Same scenes over and over, just in a different location.  There are brief injections of the vampires and werewolves, but only very, very brief.  The demons are also flat and are left with the impression of them being completely evil.  Which we learned in "A Darker Crimson" was not the case.    Overall, I found it a disappointment. I even had to force myself to finish the book, just so I would know what was going on in the next.  Hopefully, the next author picks up the strings and delivers something with more action and more well rounded characters.
