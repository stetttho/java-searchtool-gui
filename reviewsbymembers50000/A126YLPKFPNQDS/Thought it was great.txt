 Usually a second book just can't seem to hold up to the standards of the first, but this one definately held its own.  It had been some time since I read the first and normally I struggle to remember what occured previously so that I know why the characters do and say what they do.  Butcher kept me up to date without being obvious about it.  I fell right in the story like I read the first book just yesterday. Also, I had the hardest time putting it down.  The action was nonstop.    In Academ's Fury, two years have past since the Second calederon War and Tavi is at school.  Because of his lack of furies (magic) he is teased and mistreated badly by students and teachers alike.  Regardless, he makes a few trusted friends (especially his roommate-Max).  He also works closely with the High Lord as a messenger and is in training to be a spy. So, basically, even though he may not have furies, he most certainly can hold his own.  This story is much more serious than the last in that there is not only a threat to the High Lord from those wanting to over throw the government, but apparently Tavi and Ketai let loose a horrible creature when they set the wax forrest on fire and that creature has tracked Tavi all the way to the kingdom, but not before she creates two other queens and unleashes them in different parts of the countryside.  These creatures can create warriors of immense strength, and worse.  Like I said, very fast pace and hard to put down.  I'm looking forward for more and hope I won't have to wait too long.
