 The story is about a young girl who grew up a street orphan with another older child.  At age thirteen she ran away from all she knew to join an elite organization part of a triad that protects the outer city.  The Hawks teach and train her in the art of, well, watching.  (Swords are the fighters; Wolves are the hunters)   Unfortunately, what Kaylan is running from returns seven years later.  You see, over 30 children between the ages of 10 and 13 were butchered when she was young and every one of their bodies had the same strange tattoos that are also present on her own body.  She knows she is a part of this horrible crime, but does know why or how.  When the Lord of the Hawks has her team up with her old orphan buddy (whom she want's to kill--you'll have ot read to find out why) and a dragon person, they have to return to the mean streets of Nightshade to solve the crime.  Great story, but the writing definitely does NOT flow.  I had to read over passages over and over again to try to visualize what the author was trying to say.  Many times she left me completely baffled.  I'll most certainly try the next one because it's a great story idea and I'm hoping she'll work out the kinks in her writing.
