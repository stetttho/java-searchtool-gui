 I fell in love with the Briar King.  After the Charnel Prince, I can't believe I will have to wait for the next one see what will happened.  Because now I feel like things can go in any direction.  How easy it would be for someone to die.  For a love interest to turn in another direction.  To discover your enemy was actually your friend.  Wow!    I could't possibly explain all that is going to on this novel.  I will say the action continues.  The characters are still on a mission.  The author switches lead characters from chapter to chapter and almost every chapter is a cliff hanger.  That's the only thing that drove me crazy.  I always flip head to discover what happens and then flip back to continue where I left off.  Regardless, I am on the edge of my seat waiting for the third!
