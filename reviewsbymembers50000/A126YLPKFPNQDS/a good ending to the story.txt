 There wasn't nearly as much drama as in the first one.  I don't think either the second or this one could ever meassure up to it, but it wasn't a bad story, either.  Dunkle jumps far into the future to the death of the king and the crowning of Catspaw.  If you are hoping to revisit Emily or Kate, forget it.  They are hardly mentioned at all.  Instead, the author introduces us to a new character, Miranda.  Miranda, apparently, had been promised from before her birth to the goblins when Marak decided to release Til to the human world.  Miranda is Til's daughter.  Til's temperment does not improve from the second book, being that most of Miranda's childhood consist of her mother berating her to her siblings and staff.  All that Miranda has to look forward to are the weekly visits from Marak.  Finally, when she turns 17, her death is staged and Miranda is taken down into the goblin city to wed Catspaw and become a queen, only, the day of her wedding she is told by Catspaw he can't marry her.  Instead Catspaw must marry an elf girl with great powers. You see, a tribe of elves showed up and according to their treaty with the goblins, they will give the elf girl in exchange for peace.  Miranda, runs off thinking she would kill herself, but instead runs right into the arms of Lir, the elf lord, who decides to make her his prisoner.  So you see, much different plot and characters, but still an interesting plot line.  I think you'll enjoy it.
