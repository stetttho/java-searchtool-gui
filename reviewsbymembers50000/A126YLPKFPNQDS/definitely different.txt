 I don't think I have ever read a book on gargoles.  Nice having a new take on the paranormal romance.  I really liked the beginning of the book.  Taylor begins with the six year old herione of the story getting her daddy to look under the bed, in the closet, etc. for the "monsters."  She really just wants all his attention for herself since there is a new edition to the family. The chapter ends when the same six year old watches her parents murdered as she and her baby brother hide in the cupboard beneath the stairs.  A very dramatic beginning to the story.  Definitely grabs the reader.  I simple felt I could not put the book down until I discovered the reason behind her parents murder.  It also set the premise of why the herione was so driven to find the "monsters" she witnessed killing her parents.  Excellent book, I gave it four stars instead of five because I thought the story lagged around the middle.
