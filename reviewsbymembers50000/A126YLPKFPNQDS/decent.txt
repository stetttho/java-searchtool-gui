 I read the entire series in one week from Beyond the Highland Mist to the Immortal Highlander. It wasn't difficult.  All the books were "easy reads--fluff books."  Which can be enjoyable in their own right.  Perhaps because I read them all at once made me not enjoy them as much.  I noticed while reading that every book had the same basic principle.  Time travel, fall in love, someone jealous want't to kill the girl, day is saved, the end.  It got to the point I was getting confused between what, or who, was in which book.  Most of the girls were also similar in looks and just alike in personality.  The men were all the same, too--brawny, tall, black hair, and massively in love and faithful.  All the girls were virgins.  I guess if I spent a year in-between books, I might not have noticed the repetitiveness as much, but it truely spoiled it for me.
