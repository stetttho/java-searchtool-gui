 This is the first book by Jefferson I have read.  It was handed off to me by an aquantance I share book author's with.  I found it graffic in every sense of the word.  The weird part was that I was more offended by the blashamy than about the homosexual acts.  The main character is pitiful and the real fiend of the book, his lover--David, is deplorable.    So why four stars?  The writing itself was excellent.  You don't have to have a happy, happy book with nice characters to have a good book.  I just couldn't stop reading.  I wondered throughout what could they possibly do next.  I'll definately try another by this author.
