 Fallon begins the second book of the Second Sons Trilogy two years after the first.  Her characterization is the best I have ever read.  Working with over half a dozen characters, she stays true to each.  Their problems and strife nearly leap off of the page.  I'm amazed at how deeply she can capture the human psych (sorry, I'm not sure of the spelling).  The main character, Dirk, discovers the only way to "save the world" is to betray everyone he loves.  Antonov is a fanatic and believes what he does is for the Goddesses sake (which makes him more dangerous than most).  Kirshov is a good person at heart but is determined to prove his own merit.  Alenor finds herself more alone than she ever realizes and also realizes at the young age of 16, has to become more adult, responsible, and brave than any other adult in her family has ever been.  Belegren is becoming more desperate each day that she doesn't know when then next Age of Darkness will occur, especially when it becomes apparent that the lord does not seek nor need her advise.  Marqel becomes more cocky; believing everyone else the fool because they don't realize she would stoop to murder to get what she wants.  And Tia (Sorry, but this girl is a looney!  Honestly, I don't understand why Dirk bothers with her!  She's nothing but a big winey baby.  I for one hope that he gets to meet Jacinta and falls for her.  At least she has a brain and can use it.)  By the way, Jacinta is Alenor's cousin and new lady in waiting.  What is so great about her is that she has Marquel completely fooled and looking like a drooling idiot.  Every character has a bit of bad and a bit of good.  The reader is able to relate to everyone.  Although I found myself shouting at the book, "My God!  Are you nuts!  Can't you see she's using you?!"  on several occassions.  I absolutely cannot wait for the next one!
