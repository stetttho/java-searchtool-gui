 Ukiah, Max, and Kraynak leave to rescue Alicia; Kraynak's niece and Max and Ukiah's friend.  Alicia was camping in the forest when she turned up missing.  Thanks to Ukiah's awesome tracking abilities--he may be the only one to find her.  After two days on the trail and after Ukiah being shot in the process, they determine she was kidnapped and turn to detecting mode to find her.  Several days past with the team searching for clues as to what people Alicia encountered in the local town.  Ukiah is dismayed to learn that Alicia had a secret crush on him and accidently actually uncovers Ukiah's past after seeing a picture of him in a local museum.  Now the team has to race against the clock to save Alicia, as well as Ukiah's real family.  I like this book, it keeps me interested and reading.  I don't like the science part of it, though, it was a bit far fetched for them to just so happen to find the turtle, the ship, and have the power necessary to run an alien gadget.  Oh well.  I still want to read the next one.
