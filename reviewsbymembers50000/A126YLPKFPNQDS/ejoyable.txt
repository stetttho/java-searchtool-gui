 I liked the different characters.  Many of Kenyon's books' characters were becoming carbon copies of each other, but these were different.  Wren is a cross between a white tiger and a snow leopard.  A "tigard."  Because of which he is virtual outcast.  Maggie is a college friend of the belated Nick and is missing him something terrible.  He was the only "real" person she knew in a ocean of "fake" rich kids.  When she goes to Nick's favorite bar, Sanctuary, she meets Wren and, well, basically, love at first sight.  Yet, that's not all.  Kenyon adds a bit of mystery for the reader.  You see, Wren's parents apparently killed each other when he was young and now he's being accused of the crime.  Wren and Maggie have to discover what really happened in his past before the coucil comes after him.
