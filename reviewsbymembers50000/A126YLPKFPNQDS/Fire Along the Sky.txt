 Normally, after a few books in the series, the author starts to lag.  She/He began to find it hard to come up with new ideas and plots.  Donati seems to only get better.  Wow!  If this book wasn't so long I would have finished it in one night.  In FAtheS, Donati focus on the lives of Hannah, Jennet (cousin from Scotland), and Lily (one of the twins).  Ten years have passed.  Jennet's unwanted, unloved husband finally passes away (relief for her).  Hannah is devestated after losing her husband and eight year old son (I cried when Donati finally explained what happened to them after reading over half of the book).  Lily has to choose between to men.  Of course Elizabeth is there to give advice and watch her little chicks with an eagle eye (she cracks me up when she handles Lily's indescresions). Curiosity still knows all.  Meanwhile, the American Revolution is taking place and Daniel (Lily's twin) want's to be a part of it.  The whole family is devistated when they find out he, along with Runs-With-Bears' son, is captured.  Whew!  So much more is going on.  You really can't miss a single page.  I cried, I laughed, I enjoyed myself greatly!
