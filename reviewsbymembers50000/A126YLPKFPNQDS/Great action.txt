 I believe Armstrong has gotten even better.  I wasn't sure if I would like a ghost story, but she blended the ghost world with the real world wonderfully.  In this series Eve is "hired" to catch an evil serial killer that escaped from a form of hell.  Eve uses her unique talents and mind to track down the evil nix.  Only the nix has her own way to make Eve pay, and that is to go after what Eve loves the most, Savannah.  I don't want to say any more, you'll just have to read.  I will say that this book stays fast-paced and will be hard to put down.  I'm looking forward to what Armstrong has next for us on her agenda!
