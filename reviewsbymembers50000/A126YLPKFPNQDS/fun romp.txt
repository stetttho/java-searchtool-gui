 Julie is obsessively shy.  She can't be near a nice looking man without stumbling over her words as well as her feet.  Tristin is from another planet in another galaxy and has earned the unwanted attention of a Druinn (a being with magical powers).  Perhaps I shouldn't say it was unwanted--after all it does take two to make bed partners (suffice it to say she wanted more from the relationship).  When Tristin refuses to be her mate she betwitches him to a life as a pleasure slave trapped in a jewelry box.  Meanwhile, on earth, Julie is shopping for antiques for her antique store when she come across an old jewelry box.  Something tells her she must have it and after haggling (unsuccesffully) for the price, she purchases Tristin's box.  When she opens the clasp when she gets home she is shocked to find a very attractive half naked man in her kitchen.  After threatening karate she tells him she wants him gone.  So he disappears--she thinks she is loosing her mind.  Anyway, the story goes on.  Julie ask Tristin to teach her how to suduce her neighbor, but Tristin has other things in mind.  Very cute story.  A nice little get-away.  My only fault with this story is that I read another with the same premise that was done so much better.  Tiger Eyes by Liu has the same story line, but the action and reality of the story was so much better done.  If you like this one, I suggest you look up the other.
