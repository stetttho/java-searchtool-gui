 What a shame.  The first two books in the series were hilarious!  These last two are blah.  Oh sure, there are a few funny parts (very few), but mostly it's a runaway train heading no where.  I would imagine the first rule of writing is to have a plot.  I mean, where is the story without a plot?  Unfortunately, in this story it's missing in action.  Suposedly, Betsy was going to team up with her cop friend to solve a serial killer case, but the reader goes through 3/4 of the story without there ever even being a mention of the serial killer.  Instead, the author just dribbles about day to day life.  Betsy writes an advice column (sorry, but that was stinky advice that the author passed off as good), Betsy babysits her new baby brother.  Betsy's vampire creature in the basement crochets more.  Blah, blah, blah, and then at the end--oh by the way, let's go catch this serial killer.  Oh well, hopefully the next one is better.  Silly me, I'll give it a try, but only because I liked Derek's Bane and the first two in this series.  I can't imagine putting up with it again after that, though.
