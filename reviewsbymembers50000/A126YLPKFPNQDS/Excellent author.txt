 Berg continues her Bridge story with Seri returning to her family home to pass on the message from her brother to his son as promised upon his death.  Regardless of the fact that her brother murdered her son and was involved with the people who burned her husband to death, Seri comes to the belief that her brother was used and manipulated in doing so by the enemies of her husband's people.   When Seri arrives at Comigor she discovers a frightened, strange nephew and a prissy, self-absorbed sister-in-law.  While Seri's sister-in-law is bedridden from a dangerious pregnancy, Seri decides to help out running the home she loved as a child, for her nephew's sake.  She begins to make it her business in getting to know her nephew (a recluse) and tries numerous ways to draw him out.  The story becomes fast-paced when her nephew, Garrick, is kidnapped.  Seri goes on a dangerous journey, accompanied with friends from the previous novel, through two worlds to save Garrick.  This novel is riddled with suspence, action, and surprises.  I'm usually very good at guessing what would happen next, but Berg left me guessing on several accounts and surprised me on several.  It took all I had to not flip to the end.  What I love most about Berg is her superb ability to show the true nature of humans.  I'm anxious for what next Berg has to offer.
