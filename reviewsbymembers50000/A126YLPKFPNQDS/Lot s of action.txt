 I enjoyed it thoroughly, but I'm not a big romance reader, either.  This is a fantasy based in the future.  In this new world vampires and werewolves live among humans, but not very comfortably.  The vampires mostly live in luxary in big sky rise buildings.  The werewolves live in poverty in underground tunnels.  The humas live somewhere in between.  When a human special forces man and the new head of the vampires meet, there is instant attraction.  But don't think this is a romance book.  The romance takes a second burner to the action and mystery they have to solve.    I liked it alot.  I even read it in one sitting and went out to buy the second in this series.  Although, it is written by a different author (Liu).
