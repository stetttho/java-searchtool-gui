 I've only read a couple of Atwater-Rhodes books recently and am shocked at how talented such a young author is.  The thought of having a best-seller at the tender age of 13 is mind-bongling.  Her books only take me a few hours to read, which means they are fairly short, yet with so few words she can bring the reader to smoothly and easily into the life of this fictional character.  I can understand how the main character feels, why she is thinking the way she thinks.  Even the bad guys are made crystal clear.  I'm definitely planning to work my way through all her writing.  In shattered mirror, Sarah is a witch, and a trained vampire hunter at seventeen.  As a matter fact, her mother is the most famous, and feared, hunter of her time, and she comes from a famous line of vampire hunters.  She was trained mercilessly since an extremely young age on how to kill these "leeches" with as little emotion as possible.  After all, they are all just creatures preying on the human race.  Sarah has to attend a new school after being kicked out of the last one for fighting.  On her first day she meets and befriends a sister and brother, both vampires.  She can tell they are weak and not prone to feeding on the human race, but that doesn't change the fact that they are leeches, none the less.  She tries to break off the friendship, but they are just so nice, so good, it makes it hard to turn away.  Besides Christopher is so sweet.  He leaves her the most beautiful sketches of herself and poetry in her locker and books and, well, how could she kill someone she likes?  If your not sure wheather or not you should give this one a try, trust me, you won't regret it.  Happy reading!
