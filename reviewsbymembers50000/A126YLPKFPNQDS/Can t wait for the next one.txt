 High in action.  I loved this new novel.  There is not really in romance (for those out there looking for a paranormal romance--you won't be interested) in this one.  It's mostly about a macanic, named Joanne (or Jonie or Jo).  Joanne is coming home via plane from her mother's funeral when she sees, from the air, a woman being attacted.  When the plane lands she grabs a cabbie (enter Gary--the cabby who become emersed in the story from here on).  Joanne and Gary find the woman being attacked as well as find themselves emersed in a magical war.  It will be up to them to basically save the world from the Hunt.  No that is not a typo, I said THE "H"unt.  Can't wait until the next in the series.  Gary is a trip!
