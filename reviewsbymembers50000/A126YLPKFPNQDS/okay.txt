 I found Myrren's Gift to be orginal, yet predictible.  I was guessing the plot and climax way before anything ever occured.  Basically, the story is about honorable Wyl, whose father dies in war. His mother died when he was young, and he and his sister becomes the ward of the king (his father's best friend).  The king want's his own son and Wyl to become best friends like he and Wyl's father was, but the Prince is psycho and it doesn't work out.  It takes only five seconds after the king takes his last breath, before the prince moves in and plot the murder of Wyl.  Only Wyl had been blessed with a gift from a witch before her burning that he was kind to six years previously and when Wyl is stabbed through, something miraculous happens.  I'll let you read to find out.  Or if you are like me, you'll figure it out way before.  Regardless, I liked the idea of the plot, and I plan to read the next to see what will happen.
