 I wouldn't bother reading this book if I was looking for literary talent, but it is very mindless and it made me laugh.  The characters are very one-dementional and it was easy for me to predict EVERYTHING that happened in this story.  But there is a place for even books like this.  Those weekday reads when you want to escape, but may need to put it down if you have more important things to do.
