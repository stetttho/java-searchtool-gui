 Hiaasen is a crack up.  I just know people on the street were staring at me like I was some insane person laughing silly in my car while driving down a highway.  The story begins with a couple on their second anniversary on a cruise ship.  There is a light drizzle, it's the middle of the night and the husband has just stooped down to tie his shoes--only he grabs the ankles of his lovely wife and tosses her off the boat. Luckily she was a swimmer in college and was able to turn the huge dump into a dive.  After slipping her clothes and grabbing on to a bail of dope (yes, dope) she floats her way straight to the stilt house of an ex-cop.  What really got me loving this was the turn from the usual chase'em and bag'em Hiaasen writes.  In this novel, the surviving wife takes her revenge, but not in the usual sense.
