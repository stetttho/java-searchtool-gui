 In the first book, Joanne dies, but then wakes up a Djinn, thanks to hunky David.  She thinks at first that everything will be alright, but when the head honcho, Jonathan, of the Djinn insist on seeing her and David, she realizes her mistake.  David had to give up a piece of himself to save her and now according to Jonathan, David will die unless Joanne learns to become a Djinn in her own right, or dies. But that's not all!  Strange blue lights are coming into the world. Only the Djinn sees it and apparently it is lethal to them.  It's up to Joanne and David to figure out what and stop it.  But that's not all!  Now that Joanne is a Djinn she runs the risk of being claimed.  And is, by a pimply face, hormonal teenage boy with a psycho step mother.  What a great series.  You will have the hardest time putting this down.  I've read the first book and second in only one day each.  I'll have to go out to buy the third, which could not happen soon enough since this one leaves you with a cliff hanger.  Happy reading!
