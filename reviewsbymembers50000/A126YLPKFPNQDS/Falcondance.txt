 Very well done.  Perhaps a bit more darker than the previous two, and very much less romance.  Someone was always falling in love in Atwater-Rhodes other two books.  In this one, we are transported about 20 years in the future to the son of the two Falcon warriors.  He's miserable and loney and when one day he nearly dies by crashing from the sky, he discovers he must go to the falcon kingdom (basically the enemies of his parents) to be tutored.  I don't want to say more, since Atwater-Rhodes books are so short and concise.  I would hate to give away the story.    Of course I'm suggesting that you read it.  It is obvious at the end of this one she plans to continue on.  I'm looking forward to reading more of this strange world.
