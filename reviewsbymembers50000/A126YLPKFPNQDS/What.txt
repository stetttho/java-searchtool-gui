 I honestly did not think she could have gotten any worse than what she had been pulling off in her Merry series, yet, Hamilton did the unthinkable and actually made an even more boring book.  I remember reading long, long ago an interview with her where she was complimented on her realistic sex scenes.  What was put in this book was nothing short of a cheesy, cheap porn movie.  I'm not talking B movie, I'm talking all the way to z.  ZZZZZZZZZ  When I tried to picture the description Hamilton gave of the act, all I could picture was Micah going on and on about his huge member (woe is me) and Anita having a seizure.  I mean what was all that bouncing and waving of her appendages for anyway?  In her attempts at a plot we have Anita going off out of town to raise the dead and has to argue with a judge and attorney before she can do the deed.  But of course, not before Micah has to step in and hold her?  How professional is that?  Then there is the FBI agent that accuses her of being easy.  She gets all huffy, puffy about it (What for?  She IS easy), yet, when the same FBI agent finds out about her living with two men and having sex with them AND sleeping with both of them at the same time, he doesn't even lift an eyebrow.    There was sooooo many inconsistancies the story becomes more of an aggrevation and not entertainment.  I'm at the point where I check Hamilton's books out at the library so I don't spend any money and read them only so that I can laugh at the poor characterization and creepy sex scenes.  BOOOO!
