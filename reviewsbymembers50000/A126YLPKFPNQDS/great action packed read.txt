 I was so impressed with Liu's debut book (Tiger Eyes), I snatched this up at the book store to see if she would be faithful in her writing ability.  She definately did not leave me disappointed.    A Taste of Crimson is actually the second novel in the Crimson City series.  Apparently several different authors were hired to write for this series and each are putting out a different book.  I normally do not care for this, because authors can be notorious for not getting their facts (worlds, characters, etc.) straight.  Luckily, A Taste... does not revert back to characters that were developed by a different author.  Also, the Los Angelos (Crimson City) stayed faithfully the same as in the first book.    For those of you who are more into the romance part of the paranomal romance, you will be more pleased with Liu's version.  She pulls more from that genre.  Yet, she is still strong in action and mystery.  The crimson world she creates, which centers mostly around the werewolves in this addition to the series, is rich and intriguing.  I read it in one sitting and am looking forward to trying more from this series.  Hopefully, the other authors will not diappoint.
