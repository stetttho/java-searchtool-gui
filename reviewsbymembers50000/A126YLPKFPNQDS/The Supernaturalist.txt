 Colfer brings his readers into a futuristic world of an overly abused planet with a deteriated ozone layer and extinct plant and animal life.  The people on this planet only know the blue sky through old outdated movies and check the weather on the news each morning to decide if they need to leave in a gas mask or not.  In this harsh climate you would find Cosmo, an orphan in a new world that has no place, nor use for orphans with the exception of testing new and dangerous products on them.  Miracle of all miracles he escapes and meets up with a gang of fighters who call themselves the supernaturalist.  With this gang he finally finds his family.  Unfortunately, he will also find himself fighting a war against stranger creatures that could possible affect the human race.  Colfer, like normal, does a wonderful job in creating characters and setting that are superb. The only reason I gave it four stars was because of the overly neat ending.  I expected more.
