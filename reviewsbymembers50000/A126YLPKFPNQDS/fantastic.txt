 There is no certainity when you read Martin's series of books--A Song of Ice and Fire.  You will find yourself favoring certain characters only to find them killed off.  We have been conditioned to believe when we read a book or watch a movie that the main characters, be it the hero or herione or such, are immune to extreme adversity, yet our heros and heriones of Martin's books have no such immunity.  Like always, Martin moves from chapter to chapter switching from the persepective of different characters.  Some are good, some bad, all are shown as being human with human faults.  You can't help but have favorites. My favorites have  been the same since book one--Jon and Arya.  I can't help but skip through chapters to see how long I will have to wait before I'll get to read more. Now I have to wait for book four.  Overall, excently written.
