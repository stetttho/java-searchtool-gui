 If you are familar with Terry Brooks, then you automatically know you won't be disappointed.  Brooks gives wonderful details of Shannarh that have not changed from the very first book.  My only complaint would be that the story line has not changed much, only the characters.  This second book in the trilogy continues with Pen running for his life from the Druids and to complete his journey to save his aunt Grianne.  The book skips from Pen to Grianne (captured and tortured in the Forbidden) to the Prime Minister (bent on controlling the world reguardless on who he distroys in the process).    I look forward to the last in this trilogy.  Brook seems to be building up to an explosive ending.
