 I'm more of a fantasy reader than a romance reader,which is why this book did not attract me like it did most of the other reviewers. Which is why I gave it four stars instead of five.  It was still a good book with an interesting topic. The characters were interesting, but I thought the writing a bit slow and amatureous.  She picked up steam as she went along, though and got better  in the end.  A lot of steamy sex--mostly through the animalistic sense than human, which was sorta of creepy--especially considering how many of ya'll out there thought it was hot; and that is why I dropped it down another star to three.
