 This picks up right where the third left off.  I thought Armstrong would never do as well as the first in the series, but this one surpassed it.  I loved the action and the relationship part of the book.  I was surprised to find Benecio (spelling?) was really a loving father, not nearly so mean and scary as Paige assumed him to be. (Or at least not so much as his other sons).    This one is a real winner and I'm looking forward to what Armstrong has up her sleeve next!
