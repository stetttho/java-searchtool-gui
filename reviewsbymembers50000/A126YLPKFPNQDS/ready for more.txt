 Britain did a wonderful job in her sequel to Green Rider.  Normally second books never measure up to the first, and yet Britain surpassed the first.  In First Rider's Call, Karigan is older, more mature, and stronger.  She fights the rider's call for several years only to give into the horn's call. What I liked about this sequel in paticular is that Britain added in a few laughs here and there to take away from the serious subject matter.  Readers, get ready to find out just HOW Karigan answered the call.  I loved the way the characters became more well rounded.  The reader learns alot more about the king, as well as the first rider, and Karigan's orginial ancestor.  There were several touching scenes (I got teary eyed during the scene where Lil said farewell of her lost green riders.) I don't want to say too much and spoil the book, but here's is just a brief on what's going on.  Karigan is haunted by a ghost, Lil, the first green rider.  Lil (a ghost)has been trying everything in her unearthly power to get Karigan to answer the call.  Eventually, deparate to get Karigan going back to join the green riders, she blows the horn (famous horn that will summon all green riders).  It works.  Karigan arrives back to the city to offer her services to the king and join the green riders.  Well, the king nearly falls off his thrown by the sight of her. No time for romance, because unfortunately, something is not right in the kingdom.  There has been strange happenings.  Karigan is sent on a mission when a powerful wraith is released from a prison.  After 1000 years, it looks like the dark lord is coming back.   This novel is well worth your time.
