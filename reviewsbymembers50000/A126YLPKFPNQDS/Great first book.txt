 I couldn't put this one down.  I stayed up most of the first night trying to finish it off, until exhastion kicked in and I had to stop.  It's really a very sweet romance between a 17 year old girl, mature beyond her years, and a 100+ year old vampire, turned at the age of 17.  The vampire motif is a bit twisted.  The goriness of it is not brought to light, but instead romanticized.  Regardless, you'll find yourself reading it not because it's a vampire novel, but because of the sweetness of first love.  I know I did. The characters are flawlessly portrayed and you can't help but fall in love with them yourself.    I'm looking forward to reading more from Meyer.
