 I picked up this book after reading all the rave reviews on it.  I must say this author does, did, whatever, have promise.  The story has a great opening that truly catches the readers attention, but then drags all through the middle.  I found myself getting bored with all the court life talk; all the nuances of the back-stabbing court life.  After all, it has been done over and over in many such books.  I was looking for something different and unique to this one, but didn't find it.  Even the Jungle Book scene (girl raised by wolves) is over done.  Ya, ya, we get it--move on!  About three quarters of the way through I skipped to the end to see who is put on the thrown and then sighed because I couldn't get myself to bother reading the unread portion (strange for me, since I normally want to read it anyway just to see how it led to that conclusion).  Also, it pretty much grossed me out, this unspoken IN LOVE thing the herione has with her wolf partner.  Basically what I saying is that I was bored for most of the story.  I heard book two and three are better and I'm thinking of trying the next one.  I'll keep my fingers cross that the author worked out all the kinks.
