 After only just discovering VVV recently, I've been working through her books.  I find her to be an excellent writer with highly effective characterization.  This book is no exception.  The character of Weiland draws the reader's compassion.  Especially after discovering how he was capture as a wolf pup and basically turned into a human and abused and tortured consistantly throughout his life.  The author does not let the reader discover much about the interworkings of the evil Daria.  We only know that she is evil and would not shy away from brutally and viciously murdering anyone (even her own family).  You can guess early on in the story (well, those older can) the truth about Weiland, although I was surprised in the end by something I had not even considered.  (Of course, I won't spoil it).  Overall, I think you will enjoy it, but I don't think it was as well written as some of her other works.
