 I've read more books than I could ever count, and no book has made me laugh more and harder than this series by Evanovich.  I actually fell off my bed laughing.  The main character, Stephanie Plum, is someone everyone can relate to.  She is quirky, clumsy, how-many-more-cars-can-I-go-though, man-(oops, men-) problems, just-lost-my-job-now-I've-got-to-get-help-from-my-family type of person.  And talk about crazy family.  Trust me, you'll love them.  She also has a wonderful website....
