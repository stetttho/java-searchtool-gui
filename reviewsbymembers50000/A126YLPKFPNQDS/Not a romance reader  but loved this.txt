 Coming from a home, whose male occupants know all the James Bond movies by heart, I enjoyed a laugh riot with this novel.  There was so many tongue in cheek comedy through this entire book I could hardly put it down.  Jane (female James) Spyrus (come on, who are you fooling) is lighthearted, goofy, unaware, and intelligent.  The many men in her life are sexy, dangerous, and intriging.  With Knockout Lipstick, laser shooting braclets, truth serium perfume, tracking tampons (no I am not making this up--Sands is), and Vibrator mini launchers, nothing will stop her from stopping the bad guys and saving the world.  God, I'm laughing just thinking about it!
