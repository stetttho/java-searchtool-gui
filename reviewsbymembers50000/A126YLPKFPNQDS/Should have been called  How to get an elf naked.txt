 What great fun.  I had a blast reading this book.  Jane, the heroine, accidently runs over a bunny rabbit and crashes her car.  She wakes up to a group of strangely dressed men. One in particular takes charge to bring her to safety.  Come to find out he claims to be an elf.  To top it off, he says he has been choosen as her lawyer to represent her in trail for killing a fellow elf, namely a shapechanging one--the bunny?  Of course Jane believes Charlie, her lawyer, is in need of a padded cell.  Until he shows her his eyes.  So?  He's a trekky fan.  Then he shows her his wings, yikes!  If you think this is the ordinary fluff romance where the guy gets the girl in bed and then they fall in love as they have numerous acts of sex, well sorry, not the case.  Jane and Charlie  have more problems than just the murder trial.  Apparently some magical force in Charlies parallel world is killing off life--plants, animals, even human.  The women are unable to babies and the kingdom is in a panic. Even more strange is the fact that everywhere Jane goes things happen (like opening walls, plants growing and mass conception);-)  Then there is the man trying to kill her.  And oh, we can't forget Charlie, Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes.  Jane is determined to get him in bed and he is determined to stay as far away from her as possible.  Of course Jane does everything in her power to make that impossible.  The only reason I gave it four instead of five stars is the ending.  It was just a little too nice.
