 Great read, but be forewarned--you will want to read every book in the series back to back in as quickly as possible.  I know I did.    The story is about a young woman, Alissa, who was sent out of her home by her mother (only surviving relative) and told to go on a journey that she would inately know where to go.  Well, of course, Alissa is devestated, confused, and even a bit angry about this whole thing.  I mean, what?, is her mom off the rocker or what?  Without much choice she heads out on the same journey her father took and never came back from almost 10 years previously.  Our second main character is Strell, coming home from a long journey that his family sent him on several years previously.  He and Alissa cross without seeing each other heading in opposite directions.  Strell comes across Alissa's mom and discovers that his entire family is wiped out in a horrible accident.  He is the lone survivor.  Distraught, he takes to the road to run away from his sorrow.  Only to run into Alissa, stuck at the bottom of a small cliff and very irate over her predictament.  From here on begins the real adventure.  These two characters are hilarious together (between Alissa's bumbling and smart remarks to Strells witty and boyishly sweet good humor) you will never get enough.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who appreciates a light, yet wonderfully witty penned book.
