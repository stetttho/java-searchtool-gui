 I think I giggled all through this book.  Not to mentioned I read it in one sitting on a Saturday afternoon.  Derek is a werewolf going alfa.  What does that mean to the rest of the world.  Not a darn thing.  But it does mean that he is definitely not getting along with his best friend, Michael, who is the alfa of the pack.  To prevent strife and possible death, Derek is sent on a mission by the local werewolf psychic.  He must save the world by "taking care of" the reincarnated Morgan La Faye.  More than happy to leave, Derek takes off to "off" the girl.  Only Sara, the supposed bag girl, is not was he imagined.  First of all, she's cute.  Second of all, trying to kill her gives him an anurism (spelling?) LITERALLY!  So instead the two go on a cross country search to find the real bad guys and save the world.  Sounds corney?  Of course it is, but it's also hilarous.  I loved the witty comments, the slapjack comedy (in my head of course), and the ditzy characters.  Derek is awfully sexy and lovable.  Sara is strong willied and funny.  This book is a great get away and will definately cheer up any sour mood.
