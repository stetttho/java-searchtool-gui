 Sorceress is a continuation of Witch Child.  The reader finally gets to find out what happened to Mary so many years ago.  Only, Rees continues the story in such a unique fashion.  Her research abilities come into practice again as the Reader gets an insight on the life and habits of Native Americans during the time of the French and Indian War.    Agnes is having strange dreams in which she sees her self as Mary, her apparent ancestor, after reading the book Witch Child. (How you like that?) She decides to email the author by using the web address found at the back of the book.  She comes into contact with Alison, who is doing the research on Mary and was one of the scientist who discovered the diary in an ancient quilt.  They get together to join their talents.  Through Agnes' eyes, the reader gets to relive the days of Mary's escape, rescue, hardships, and life with her Indian family.  Wonderful read.  I'm anxious to find out whatelse Rees has up her sleeve.
