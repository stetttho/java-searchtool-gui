 I devour everything Hamilton puts out.  Her books are a great distraction as well as mind-candy.  I even put in an order for this book before it was even published, then eagerly awaited its arrival.  All that anticipation ended like a balloon with a hole.   The story of Merry picks up with her harem (um, I mean guards).  The boys are back, trying their best to impregnant their (hopefully) future queen.  This is where everything gets difficult.  You see, I want to explain the plot, but there is no plot to explain. Scenes of the book move from one sexual romp to another, even going as far as girl on girl. Perhaps I'm just too innocent, but that was a new one for me.  About half way through the book, the reader finally gets excited, because it sounds like something is actually going to happen.  Merry and her men have an agenda.  They are to visit the Seelie Court, then King Kurag (who want her to attempt procreation with a few of his creepy dudes), then on to the Unseelie Court.  Yeah!  Possible conflict, possible suspense, possible action!  Then just more sex.   Oh, well.  It won't stop me from reading her books, since I truly do love the Anita series and did love the Merry series. I hope Hamilton does read these reviews and perhaps she will take a little more time in building up the elements of plot in her future books so that instead of a feeling of dispointment, we can all lay back in the afterglow. (No pun intended!)
