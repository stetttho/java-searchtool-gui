 I must have really liked Hamilton to just keep on reading.  I think I might actually be insane.  Yet, here I am, still buying the books.  I had a huge problem with the last one because it was all sex and no plot.  Well, in Stroke of Midnight, she attempts to add somewhat of a plot:  A double homicide.  The reader practically becomes giddy with anticipation.  You think to yourself:  "Is the old Hamilton back?  Could it be?  Please, please let it be!"  Then you read the other 300 pages and realize, no, just the same old-same old.    Some of the problems I had with this book included the endless stretch of a day and night.  For two books now I have been waiting to find out what will happen at the Seelie Court and the gnomes.  I'm beginning to feel I'll have to wait five more books to ever find out.  How utterly depressing and an efficient way to loose readers.  I was also hoping that the solving of the crime (murders) would envolve Merry.  Instead she delegates and moves off to have more sex.  Then there was the sex.  Sure it was steamy, but there were sex scenes that would last through four to five long chapters.  They would play then talk, kiss, then talk, fondle, then talk.  AUGH!  What made it worst was the talk was mostly self-pity, woe-is-me, I'm not worthy.  Booooorrring.  Most sex scenes were Merry with two to three guys and EVERY sex scene was with a host of other guards watching.  Even the one with Adair, who is supposedly sooooooo shy.  Merry, who is totted as being the prefect lover, basically tells him, either put out or she'll take another to bed.    The wrap up at the end was the worst of all.  Your not even sure if the murder is solved.  The queen believes it, but who wouldn't admit to murder after being led around by their intestines?  So, why am I giving it three stars?  Because the men sound sooo sexy.  God, I'm gullible!  I'll probably even read the next one.
