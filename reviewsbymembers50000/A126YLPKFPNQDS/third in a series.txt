 This novel picks up where Stolen left off.  If you are hoping to continue the werewolf saga, don't bother picking up this novel.  Elena plays only a cameo role in this one.  In DSM, Armstrong devils deeper into the witch's role on society by showing us how Paige and Savannah are getting along. Not too well, I might add.    I prefer this novel to Stolen.  I found Stolen lacking and boring in parts, but this one had a little more action and several conflicts going on at one time.  Paige and Savannah's relationship.  Paige versus the Coven's reclusive ways.  Paige trying to discover the missing piece of working higher magic.  Paige with a possible love interest. Paige against crazy half demons.    I found it enjoyable and well worth my time.
