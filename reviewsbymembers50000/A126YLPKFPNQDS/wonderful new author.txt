 It's difficult to believe this is Liu's first novel.  I loved it!  The heroine is a psychic-powered woman named Dela.  Dela and her family all have some type of psychic power.  Dela's power is working with metal, and because of this she has become well known as an artist, especially with swords and knives.  The story begins in China.  Dela is shopping at a local market when she comes across a strange and beautiful riddle box.  After taking it back to her apartment, she discovers how to open the box, and out pops Hari.  Hari is a shapeshifter who had been cursed to the box for 2000 years, only to be called out by his "masters" and forced to do unbelievable acts.  This makes him hard and angry.  So when he materializes before Dela, that anger and hatred is focused on her.  But Deli is not like his other masters. She refuses to order him to do anything.  Instead they make a blood pack and she makes it her duty to find a way to break his curse.  Unfortunately, there are more troubles coming out of the woodwork, because someone used one of her swords to kill a child of the mafia, and now the family want revenge on everyone who had to do it, even the maker of the sword, Dela.  Wow!  This was a wonderful novel and I can't wait to read the next one from this author.  Take my advise, please, and give her a try.
