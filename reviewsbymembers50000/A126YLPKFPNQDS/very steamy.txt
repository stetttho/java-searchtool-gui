 Sort'a like the Termenator.  We have a girl named Jane.  She inherited her father's paper but despises her father. She believes the possiblilty that he might have murdered her mother, although the truth of this never comes to light.  Then enters Baran, from three hundred years in the future, with his wolf, Freika.  Freika, believe it or not, has a voicebox that allows him to talk; not to mention several crystals that hold data and needed information for missions.  (He's a regular walking computer)  Baran and Freika are partners that timed traveled to save Jane's life.  What they find is a head-strong woman and her frisky feline, Octapussy.  Jane fights the intruder in the beginning, not to say she wasn't noticing just how sexy-gorgous he was.  Even when he restrains her and pats her down for weapons, she can't help but wet her panties and Baran, with his superior sensitive noise can't help notice.  Needless to say, they get down and heavy, several times.  Enter, Drusas, a modern day Jack the Ripper (Oh wait, he's the real Jack the Ripper who has traveled through time) and he wants Jane--dead.  I really enjoyed this one and am looking forward to reading more by Angela Knight.
