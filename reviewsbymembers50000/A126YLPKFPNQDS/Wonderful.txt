 Black is a gifted storyteller with the ability to show the true harsh reality of the real world.  The way she is able to blend the now with a fairie realm is amazing.    In this novel, seventeen year old Valerie catches her mother and boyfriend together intimately and runs away from home.  It was not her intention to "run-away."  She simply just doesn't want to go home, yet.  After missing the tram, she sleeps the night on a bench and in the morning buys coffee at a nearby coffee shop.  There she meets two unusual people.  From there she gets deeper and deeper into the world of faerie.  After meeting a troll, who lives under a bridge (LOL), and discovers she likes him, strange as he may seem, she wants to help him when he is accused of murder.  Wonderful tale you won't want to put down.  I'm anxious to see what else Ms. Black has up her sleeve!
