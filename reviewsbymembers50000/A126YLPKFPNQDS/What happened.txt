 The whole plot was simply just too outrageous to believe.  This whole being stuck in a game that is soooo realistic that you can feel the pain and pleasure?  That the computer can generate what you look like simply by how you see yourself?  That an entire world and it's people can interact with you like real people?  Just too far gone.  There weren't even any periameters set in the game to achieve goals and success at winning.  No guidelines are objectives.  It was simply too far fetched.    But, hey, even I can live with that if MacAlister keeps me laughing.  And at first I was laughing, but then the main character turned into a dingy blonde and I lost interest.  Also, I begin to picture the love interest as a whinny pain in the ***.  I think I would have rather he stayed the blonde sex-god she first described him as.    Overall, it was a major disappointment. Especially considering this whole plot was done already (only correctly) by Vivian Van Veade (Not sure if I spelled that correctly) in her book Heir Apparent.  I suggest ya'll try it.  It was a blast to read and she did a wonderful job of correctly portraying what a vertual reality game would could really be like.
