 I thought it was okay.  You have the cop trying to find the serial killer.  Only this cop seems to have little to no hold backs.  There's no one to tell her she can't do anything, including out right killing anyone she believes to be the suspect.  (This concept dropped one star for me).  Mia specializes in alien murderers.  So she basically goes out, finds the killer, and then kills them.  Only this case is driving her batty, because her suspect has a sexy alien brother who basically wants to f*** her.  (author's words, not mine)So he kidnaps her and shows her who the true killer is.  After that, she basically just has to neutralize the killer.  The other problem with this story is Mia is too tough.  She's rude.  Aggressive.  Mean.  Hateful.  Has little to no morals.  I just don't like her, and when you find nothing you can relate to a main character to, or the main character is totally obnoxious, like this one, you find yourself rooting against her instead of for. (That dropped the second star)  This was a book I could have done without reading.
