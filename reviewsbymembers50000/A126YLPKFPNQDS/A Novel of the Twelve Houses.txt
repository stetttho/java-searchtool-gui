 I begin reading Shinn the year she came out with Archangel and she has not disappointed me, yet.  Her worlds are intriguing and fanciful.  Her characters are realistic and she seems to get better and better with each book.    Shinn creates another new world with Mystic and Rider.  In this world, the people fear, even hate anyone with magical abilties to the point of murdering whole families.  The king has sent out a few of his most trusted to guage the temperment of his kingdom.  The person to lead the small band is Senneth (a mystic with astonding abilities).  With her is a daughter of a wealthy and royal linked family (also a mystic) and her companion.  For protection the king had assigned two of his royal guards (called Riders).  Everyone in the kingdom fears the Riders because of their incredible fighting abilities.  But even this group is weary and uncertain of each other.    In this book, the reader follows along with the band of unlikely friends as they travel throughout the kingdom witnessing atrocity after atrocity and doing what they can to make a difference.  Throughout it all, they grow in friendship and become more to each other than they ever expected.  The story is definitely not finished here with this book and I'm anxious to see where Shinn will take it next.  Very much worth your time.
