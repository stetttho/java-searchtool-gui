 I read one of Shayne's latest books and liked it so much that I backtracked to be able to read them all in order.  This book contains the first three of this series:  "Twilight Phantasies," "Twilight Memories," and Twilight Illusions."  The first two I didn't like as much as the others I read.  They were too tamed and reminded me too much of Christine Freehan.  The vampires are so overly nice.  Also, the plot centers only around the romance.  The third, I found was much, much better. Probably because there was a mystery to solve and it was not all sex.  I think there was only two sex scenes in all.  I perfer the action to be enhanced by the romance, not the other way around.  I'm definately reading more.  Considering my experience so far with this author, I'm hoping she only gets better.
