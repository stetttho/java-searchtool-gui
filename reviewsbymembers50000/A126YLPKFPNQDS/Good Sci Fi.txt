 I'm not a big Science Fiction reader, but I've read the four books in this series and found them quite enjoyable.  There were a few glitches that did not bode well with reality, but I shrugged it off.  After all, if I wanted to read a true to life book, I would have chosen a realistic fiction.  The main character is very likable.  His sometimes childlike innocense mixed with deep wisdom (from where, not even he knows) makes you want to love him.
