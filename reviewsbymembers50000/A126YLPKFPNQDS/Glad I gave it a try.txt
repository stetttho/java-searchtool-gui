 The demon in the title through me off, I'm not into reading "demon" books.  Well, it's not, instead this one contains vampires and the witches who kill them.  It was strange feeling a connection to the obvious "bad guys."  The vampires are evil and they do kill to feed.  The witches are good and they risk their lives and family to stop them.  This is not a book about that fight.  The witches are more in the background, but leave an obvious impression.  There like a shadow that leaves the main characters more colorful and bright.  Jessica knows she is different.  Kids at school skitter away from her even as she approaches and she doesn't have the best relationship with her adoptive mother.  Her only release, her only freedom is the books she writes and her all black room is stacked with her manuscripts.  She is only 17 and, as of only two weeks ago, published her first novel about vampires.  Her second one is at the publishers right now.    Alex is the new boy at school, but he has a secret.  He's not there for an education, but to kill the author publishing his history as the vampire, Aubrey.  He doesn't know how she knows all his intermost secrets, but she must die.  Only when he meets her face to face, he doesn't, and he doesn't even understands why.  Caryn is also a new girl at school and she's there looking for Jessica, too.  But for a different reason than Aubrey.  Caryn is a witch and it is her life duty to protect Jessica, even if she doesn't want protection.  Very well written book.  It is a short read:  I finished in only a couple of hours, but very satifying.  I'm looking forward to reading more books by Atwater-Rhodes.
