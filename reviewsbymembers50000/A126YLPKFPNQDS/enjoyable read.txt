 My suggestion is to get both "The Hidden Queen" and "Changer of Days" at the same time, since the story continues on without a skip in the beat between the two.  I didn't read the other reviews which explain that it was orginially published together as a part 1 and 2, so I had to wait for the second and then review the first to remember where it left off.  It is an epic fantasy and is well written.  Although I wouldn't put it in the same category or standard as someone like Martin, but still very enjoyable to read.  The plot is tamer and nicer.  It reminds me of something of a romance in that romances always have happy endings and nothing bad ever happens to the good guys.  So you know you won't be diappointed as your reading, you know what to expect from a romance.  Unfortunately, that is the very reason why I don't like to read romances--it's just not realistic.  Bad things do happen in real life, even to the good guys.  It is also why I gave this four stars instead of five.  Basically, the story is about a nine year old girl, whose father dies in battle and her half brothers sees this as his opprotunity to claim the throne for himself.  She ends up going into hiding and for the next eight years moves from place to place throughout the entire kingdom and beyond.  Waiting until she is old enough to reclaim the throne.  The story shows how she grows and matures through these years.
