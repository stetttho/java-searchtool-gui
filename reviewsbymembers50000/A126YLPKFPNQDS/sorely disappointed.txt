 I was only able to struggle through the first 200 pages.  Normally, I finish a book no matter what.  I hate unfinished business, but with my time taken up with family and work, I simply just didn't have the time to waste, and it felt as though it would have been if I would have continued.  Hobb's writing is still superb, but the plot was simply not going anywhere.  I was bored out of my mind.
