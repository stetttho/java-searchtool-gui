 The only "Patterson" I found in this book is his signature short chapters.  The book is short, the print is large and the chapters average about three to four pages long.  Obviously a reader could finish it off in a night, which I did.  But it wasn't because I couldn't put it down.  I found the characterization horrible.  The characters were so flat and boring.  How can a guy who came so close to receiving his MA be so gullible, air-headish, and stupid?  Or an up and coming FBI agent so easily believe a total stranger even when ALL the facts say something different?  This can't possibly be Patterson's writing.  It sounds nothing like his earlier books that so easily captured the actions and thoughts of a complex character.  I don't think I'd bother with another of his co-authorships again.
