 Excellent book.  Seems to be more Sci-Fi than fantasy.  There was a lot of speculation on the setting being an alternate world due to the two suns.  I think it is Earth, only thousands of thousands of years in the future.  (After all, they do mention lions and wolves--only call them farie animals).  Hey, it could happen.  Fallon introduces a whole strew of characters, all of which are well rounded and interesting.  Every one is sort of like yin-yang.  Bad with a little good, or good with a little bad.  It made the reading vastly interesting since the reader could relate to almost anyone.  The setting is vivid and easily pictured regardless in the difference from earth.  The main character is a boy from an island.  Sixteen year old Dirk's life is interrupted when a pirate ship shipwrecks on his homeland leaving only one surivor.  The lone survior unwillingly pulls Dirk into political intrigue, fanatic religion,  as well as family secrets.  The reader is taken on a roller coaster as Dirk fights to save not only himself, but his family, his furture, and all that he knows.  I can't wait to get to the next in the series.
