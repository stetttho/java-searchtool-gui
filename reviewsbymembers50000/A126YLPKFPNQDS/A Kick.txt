 This book is nonstop action.  The characters are diverse and interesing.  The writing is witty and fast paced.  In a world of today where half the human population has died due to a strange biodrug from (of all things) tomatoes, supernatural creatures have finally found themselves on equal footing with humans and have come out of hiding to make themselves known.  Rachel, a witch and the main character, is in a type of law-enforcement that deals primarily in these magical creatures.  The only problem is she doesn't ever seem to catch a break.  The story starts with her attempting to capture a leprechaun.  On the drive back to the station (sharing a cab with a vampire and a pixie), she decides to quit the law-enforcement and use the leprechaun to make a clean break.  The only problem is everytime someone tries to break from this department, a death contract is put on their heads.  Rachel has to dodge crazed faries, weres, witches, etc. while trying to capture a huge law breaker to pay off her death contract.    Rachel is funny and original.  I loved the pixies.  Jenx with his huge brood of kids is hilarious.
