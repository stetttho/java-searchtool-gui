 Young adult book about seventeen year old, Selwyn Roweson.  The story begins with Selwyn being accused and convicted as a murderer.  It's kind of hard to protest when they've gagged your mouth and you have no say in the matter.  Because there is no executoner in the small town and the townspeople don't want to have to wait for the authorities, they decide to bury Selwyn with the dead body in a local burial cave.  The dead, Farold, was never a friend of Selwyn. As a matter of fact, the two boys were both vying for the hand of the same pretty girl.  (She chose Farold.)  But when a strange witch shows up inside the dark cave and shows Selwyn the way out (after agreeing to payment), Selwyn finds himself with a chance to find the real killer (with the help of the witch and the dead Farold).  Wittily told.  I laughed throughout.
