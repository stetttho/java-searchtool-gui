 This is the best country album released in 2001 that I know of.  For years, Patty Loveless has made terrific albums.  On "Mountain Soul", Loveless harks back to the acoustic, no percussion, bluegrass music she grew up with.  Get this album and just sit and listen to the edgy dobros, crashing mandolins, the haunting fiddles, and of course, Patty's heartfelt voice singing those insightfull lyrics.  Three tracks that particularly stand out for me are *Out of Control Raging Fire*,*You'll Never Leave Harlan Alive*, a descriptive saga, and a song that Patty wrote herself, *Sounds of Loneliness*.  Ricky Skaggs and Travis Tritt lend their voices and instrumental abilities and Emory Gordy's production is right on. There is not one song on here that falls short of being enjoyable.  Patty seems to be well on her way to becoming a lengend. Recommended! thank you
