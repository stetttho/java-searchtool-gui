 This record is filled with one classic folk-gospel tune after another.  All the songs on here have that familiar sound that you'll love!  *Someday My Ship Will Sail*, *Angel Band*, and *Precious Memories* seem to be the standouts.  Obviously, the dominant theme here is spiritual redemption, but Harris doesn't really try to put her own spin on these songs and act as a social interpreter of them.  Instead, she simply runs from one traditional christian song to another, as if she were the special musical guest on a Sunday afternoon.  Emmylou's vocal interpretations of the songs are very sweet and subtle.  With the help of an excellent backing trio of musicians, each song is delivered with warmth and nuance.  Listen for Vince Gill's tenor harmonies and mandolin picking.  Also, watch for all the beautifull, gentle guitar work by Ms. Harris.  All in all, this is a beautifull, spiritual album that is great to listen to when you need to get some work done, or if you just want to relax and have some quiet time to yourself! Thanks
