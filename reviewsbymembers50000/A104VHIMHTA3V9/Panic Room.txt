 Okay, as some of the negative reviews have pointed out, this isn't quite a thrilling horror flick like the title may suggest.  To fully appreciate this excellent film, one must drop all expectations and presumptions at the door.   Now, "Panic Room" is no-doubt a thriller, but it has an unusual dosage of humor and unlikely castings.  Forest Whitaker's soft heart, Jared Leto's comical stupidity, and Dwight Yoakam's impulsive rage are indeed an odd combination for such a film.  Add in the the fact that this is not your typical cat-and-mouse game between a cop and a criminal, and "Panic Room" is truely one of the freshest productions to come along in a good while!  Jodie Foster and Kristen Stewart handle their roles to a tee, but it is the villians who are the gleaming highlight.  The characters played by Leto and Whitaker both have weaknesses that make them seem almost harmless, allowing for respite from the dramatic action.  By the middle of the film, you'll realize both of them are far from the bonafide, heartless killers you may have intially thought them to be.  Nonetheless, Yoakam makes sure the viewer gets his/her share of shakes and jolts as his homocidal character progressively gets more and more out of control throughout the film.  "Raoul" starts off as if he's just a quiet assistant to Leto and Whitaker, but he soon takes control of the scrape with his quick instincts and cold-blooded decisions.   Overall, "Panic Room" doesn't contain the all-out viciousness, nor the head-scratching mystery that most thrillers live and die by.  In place of this is a creative plot and some very interesting character interaction.  The script is sharp, not wasting any time on narritives or character backgrounds. Finchner's fast-moving camera work is the icing on the cake that makes this a fine thriller.  "Panic Room" is smart, quick, and is sure to keep you glued! Thanks!
