 Sheryl Crow self-titled her second album to symbolize a new beginning, to prove herself to be more than just a "one album wonder". In comparison with the highly popular "Tuesday Night Music Club", this record has a slicker, more rocked-up sound, including some weird sound effects and a full arsenal of loud guitars and drums. Sheryl wrote/cowrote all of the songs on here, many with her guitar player, Jeff Trott, and also produced the entire album herself. Also, Ms. Crow played a variety of instruments, including the guitar, keyboard, piano, wurlitzer, and bass. Anyway, onto the songs! *Change Would Do You Good* is an upbeat rocker with a mean melody and a lyric that you'll be singing to no one in particular for weeks: '...Oueen of South Beach, aging blues, Dinner's at six, wear your cement shoes/ I thought you were singing your heart out to me/ Your lips were syncing and now I see...' Listen as Sheryl incorporates some crafty guitars like the twangy, moody guitar in the background on *Home* and the ratteling, Stones-y one in the middle of *Sweet Rosalyn*. Sheryl speaks out her views on violence and hate in our society on songs like *Love is a Good Thing* and the classic rocker *Hard To Make A Stand*. The midtempo acoustic strum on *Oh Marie* and the inward looking *Redemption* add more variety and flavor to the album. And just try to resist the guitar hook at the beginning of *Everyday is a Winding Road* and the funky guitar solos that continue throughout the song! My favorite track is the killer cosmic rock ballad *If it Makes You Happy* with its hard-hitting electric guitars and pedal steel. All in all, quite a terrific recording that is needless to say, quintessential Sheryl Crow. Highly Recommended! Thank You
