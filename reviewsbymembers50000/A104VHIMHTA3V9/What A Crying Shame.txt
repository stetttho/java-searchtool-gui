 The Mavericks were simply the best mainstream country band of the 90s. They had some other great albums, but this one is regarded by most fans and critics as their finest. The record features top notch musicianship and songcraft with lead vocalist Raul Malo cruising through each song with ease. Raul was also in on the writing of seven of the tracks, four of which were with the great songwriter/guitarist Kostas.  Starting with the self-pity binge *There Goes My Heart* and finishing with the heart-on-the-sleeve *The Losing Side of Me*, The Mavericks go through all the phases of the love game. Echos of Malo's aching voice will haunt you throughout the Orbisonesque ballad *I Should Have Been True*. Then listen as he goes through the remorsefull *Aint Found Nobody*. The Mavs are confident troubadors, blending many retro country and rock/pop sounds. Watch as they jump from the 50s dancehall rocker *The Things You Said To Me* to the straight-ahead honkytonk of *Just a Memory*. Then comes the latin beat-driven *All That Heaven Will Allow* and into the loungy, intimate weeper *Neon Blue*. Finally, there are three fantastic moments on this record: *What A Crying Shame*, with its catchy guitar hook, steady drums, acoustic strum, and terrific organ, will tear out your heart and leave you wishing for a more "positive" story. Highlighted by its beautifull waltzing fiddles, *Pretend* is an excellent midtempo tune with a classic melody and great lyrics. A third song that strikes the middle of the target is the beautifull, romantic *O What A Thrill*, which is complete with lush strings and wonderfull piano work. As soon as the first verse starts: 'Oh girl in a moment I may kiss your lips', the song is an instant classic!  All in all, *What A Crying Shame* is a thrilling album from top to bottom with not a single weak song in sight. Get it as soon as you can and you'll be singing and dancing right along! Thanks for reading!
