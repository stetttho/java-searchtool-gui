 Well, sometimes you put together a slice-of-life film about two people who are totally clueless as to how to interact with society.  So, we have this basic theme about self-deemed losers who are are totally unable (or totally unwilling) to adjust to and interact with the "Ghost World" around them.   On the surface, the two characters couldn't be anymore different, but both have the same motive for their indifferent attitudes towards the purpose of life.  Enid is an immature teenager with a chip on her shoulder, struggling to find any sense of identity, let alone a direction.  She comes from a broken home, living with a father who scarcely knows her.  40-year-old Seymour is more seasoned and is less nave and more accepting of the way life treats him.   He's an introverted bachelor music-nerd with a slew of unattractive habits and personality traits.  Enid and Seymour are not rebelling from society--they are simply clueless and careless regarding their reputation among others.  They both feel rejected and misunderstood, or as Seymour puts it, `Some people, you just give them a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're satisfied'.  The two of them unite inauspiciously when Enid plays a cruel joke on Seymour, but quickly finds herself inquisitive of the man.  She befriends him, and they hit it off relating to and trying to help each another with their problems.  However, the movie ends with a sense of apathy and despair for both characters.   The supporting characters, with the exception of Enid's girlfriend, are chiefly there to add some badly-needed comedy to a somewhat dragging plot.  The actors have a sharp script to sink their teeth into, with Steve Buschemi being the highlight-everything this man touches turns to gold!  All things considered, a fantastic film that explores the depths of human loneliness and indifference. Thank You
