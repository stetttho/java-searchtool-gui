 This is my favorite Dwight album.  Although the songwriting was not as quality as *This Time*, the songs as a cohesively engaging album flow from one to another unlike anything else the man has ever recorded.  The cover/insert artwork is also among his best, thematically coinciding with the music.  Just look at those moody pictures of him reading the newspaper in the empty room and then brooding the night city streets with the hookers.  I like how the record starts with four upbeat songs as he goes through the lovin' 'n leavin' stage, then slows down into the dark aftermath of cigarette smoke and salty tears.  The music is a vibrant atmosphere of distorted guitars, melancholic organs, and sweeping strings.  Songs like "Nothing", "One More Night" and "Don't Be Sad" rank among Dwight's finest, but again, it's the ten tracks as a whole that create a sharp, fast story that will really captivate the listener.  Eclectic, mysterious, sexy, witty, those are the words that describe *Gone*.  A true work of art! thank you
