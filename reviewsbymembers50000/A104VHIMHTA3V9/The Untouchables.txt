 An action filled history film that'll keep you on the edge of your seat! The depiction of 1930s Chicago and the accuracy of the events is great and even better yet, the casting/acting is terrific! Kevin Costner shines here in one of his breakthrough films with his role as a classic good-guy hero, in this case it's Treasury Cop Elliot Ness. Sean Connery delivers a remarkable performance as the hard-nosed, confrontational policeman "Malone", who has nothing to loose. And of course, Robert Di Nero fits his role as head gangster Al Capone to the nth degree. All the co-stars do a nice job as well.  It's rare when a big-budget history movie can be so artsy, so precise. One of the best mobster flicks ever!  Thank You
