 Dwight Yoakam's pen flew solo on 8 tracks on here and he also co-wrote 2 others. A little less emotional than the gut- wretching "Buenas...", *If There Was A Way* is nontheless an intense story of a rocky relationship between two people.  The black and white cover art perfectly illustrates the feelings of love-and-lost.  The record starts with the bouncy hillbilly romper *The Distance Between You and Me*, where Yoakam sings about a dead romance between a couple still living together. *The Heart that You Own* includes beautiful twin fiddles, heartfelt pedal steel, and an honest acoustic guitar strum. Dwight and the band then pick things up with the bluesy *Takes Alot to Rock You* and *Nothing's Changed Here* features Dwight and lead guitarist Pete Anderson playing a classic 12 bar blues along with Scott Joss' raunchy fiddle. From these turbulent songs, we go into post-mortum self-pity (Sad, Sad Music), denial(Since I Started Drinkin' Again) and regret(If There Was A Way).  The barroom-ready *Turn Me Loose* has some fantastic telecastor guitar licks! At this point in the story, Yoakam has at least temporarily given up on his elusive love and is tryin' to ease the bad memories. The bouyant *It Only Hurts When I Cry* was co-penned with the legendary Roger Miller. *Send A Message To My Heart* (w/Patty Loveless) is a nice healing tune where there is finally a hint of hope in the relationship.  *I Don't Need it Done*, finds Dwight telling the lady that he's moved on and 'found real true love'.  The story ends when he slides into the tearful and vengeful *You're the One*, which has this obsessive little snare drum tap that builds throughout the 4 minute epic.  The final two songs, *Dangerous Man* and a cover of *Lets Work Together* are sort of a bonus. I second one of the previous reviewer's opinion that this music is good for both good times and bad.  Rolling Stone Magazine rated *If There Was A Way* as one of the Top 5 C&W albums of the decade.  Obviously, I recommend it!   Thank You
