 Emmylou's first major label debut, and what a fantastic way to start what has become a great career! *Pieces of the Sky* is an excellent blend of down-home country, folk, and rock. For the most part, the album is pretty off-beat, containing several mello country folk ballads and a few honkytonkers that pick up the pace in between. My favorite track is the shattering "Berfore Believing", which features a heavenly acoustic guitar hook and a serpentine melody.  Another favorite is Shell Silverstein's "Queen of the Silver Doller" and Harris' self-penned "Boulder To Birmingham".  Harris also takes her cracks at more up-beat stuff with Merle Haggard's roudy barroom classic "The Bottle Let Me Down" and the bouncy strut of "If I Could Only Win Your Love".  However, it's the wistful, pensive  ballads where her vocal beauty gleams the brightest.  Just take one listen to the romantic, sweeping sound of "Too Far Gone"! Emmylou Harris and her band keep these songs relatively simple and acoustic. Just a little electric guitar and snappy drums here and there to give the album a contemporary touch. Emmylou rarely writes her own material, but her pasionate vocal interpretations make the songs seem as if they're her own. Definitely worth the admission price!  Thank You
