 Lyle Lovett is easily one of the most complete popular musicians around these days.  He has a fantastic lonesome, bluesy voice and his songwriting and eclectic stylization is simply ingenious.  *Pontiac* is argueably his strongest piece of work, but how can one choose from such a great lineup! Lyle starts this record with the descriptive and surreal *If I Had A Boat*.  This folky, midtempo song has a beautifull, building melody and perfectly sets the tone for the album.  *Give Back My Heart* is a hilarious upbeat country-blues song, that you'll be singing and humming along to immediately.  Lyle is breathtakingly bold and unpredictable, most notably when he goes through a tune where he hunts down and kills his Ex at her wedding (*LA County*), and right on into a song where he marry's a girl and sarcastically describes the restrainments of marriage! (*She's No Lady*)  The music selection remains tasty as Mr. Lovett adds in touches of R&B (*M-O-N-E-Y*), and loungy big-band (*Black and Blue*) without losing any focus.  Another excellent song is the title track, a slow acoustic ballad with a haunting fiddle.  Lovett's vocal performances are loose and deeply inspired. Just listen to how his voice fades out at the end of Pontiac and then picks up right into the swinging *She's Hot To Go*---"Now to find a man good loving aint an easy thing to do...", from this opening verse, he's got you hooked!   The backing band of musicians are fabulous, and Emmylou Harris' and Francine Reed's backing vocals on a few of the tracks are icing on the cake!  The cerebral songs will give you chills and the witty ones will crack you up.  Lyle Lovett is truely an American treasure, and the fact that his music is rather uncategorizable makes him all the more appealing.  Wish I could give this record 6 stars, it's well worth the trip!  Thanks for reading!
