 She won the prestigious Grammy Album of the Year award for "Car Wheels On A Gravel Road", but I feel that this self-titled 1988 album is her finest! You've got wonderfull narrative songs like *The Night's Too Long* and *Crescent City*.  Then there's the playfull lament of the tex-mex *Big Red Sun Blues*, the folk-rock roll of *Passionate Kisses* (which is probably the highlight of the record}, and the raunchy *I Asked For Water*.  My favorite cut is the melancholy *Abandoned*, which has a beautifull electric guitar solo.  The book includes a quote from Lucinda's father making an analogy to how her music is so versatile, so uncategorizable. Lucinda can comfortably include material like the harmonica/electric guitar bluesy rock of *Changed The Locks* to the tender country balladry of *Am I Too Blue For You*. Yet, the album always maintains a tight focus, none of the songs sound out of place. Williams also included 6 bonus tracks, including acoustic blues covers like *Disgusted* and *Nothing In Rambling* as well as a beautifull folk ballad, *Sundays*. Lucinda can get very literal and detailed with her lyrics, which makes her songs all the more emotional and mysterious! The thing that struck me the most, though, was the raw, spontaneous, and inspired sound of Lucinda and her band. The musicianship and the production is very lively sounding. Like they just went into the studio, let the tapes roll, started playing, and wa la, you've got an album! The guitar hooks are edgy and catchy, and William's voice is pasionate and dynamic throughout all eighteen tracks. Emmylou Harris, Tom Petty, Mary Chapin Carpenter, and Patty Loveless all covered something from this album. If you discovered this talented lady through "Car Wheels", you'll love this record as well. Thank you!
