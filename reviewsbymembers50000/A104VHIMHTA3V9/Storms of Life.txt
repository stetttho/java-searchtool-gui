 A wonderful album from country renaissance man Randy Travis! Every song is a keeper and every song has a different story to tell. Best of all is the opening song, *On The Other Hand*. Just listen as the backing chorus comes in after the first verse. Randy also includes bouncy honkytonk on tracks like *The Storms of Life* and *1982* , some country blues with *Messin With My Mind*, and even a little comedy with *There Always Be A Honkytonk Somewhere*.  Of course, his specialty seems to be the soulfull ballads, but Randy also proves he can handle a faster tune with the swinging *My Heart Cracked*.  Travis' vocals are smooth and steady as he delivers each song with confidence and ease.  The lyrical content harps back to the simple things in life and nature.  This album will take you to that gravel road in the countryside---grassy fields and tall trees on both sides. Thank You
