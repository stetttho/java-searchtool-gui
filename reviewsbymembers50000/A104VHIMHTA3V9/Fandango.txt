 This is a hip flick! This is one of those low-budget, spontaneous films where all the actors look like they're having fun while making it. Kevin Reynolds did a nice job with the script, the setting, the desert scenery, and the filming. Kevin Costner & Co. are terrific and Marvin J. McIntyre is a riot! The part where he's scribbling all over the chalk board, trying to explain how to parachute out of an airplane is just hilarious. All five of "The Groovers" come from a different background. They all have different personalities, different plights, which makes things very interesting.  One of the boys is intent upon becoming a preacherman, another one is having second thoughts about getting married, while another one simply has no clue where he's going.  Judd Davis is anxiously awaiting his enlistment into the military and Vietnam, while Costner has been hanging around in College for several years trying to avoid the draft.  Despite their growing differences, they all decide to come together for one last fling before they go their own ways in life.  I loved the soundtrack to this movie as well! Los Lobos, Steppenwolf, Carol King, Blind Faith, etc. I think people of all ages, males and females, will like this film. Buy "Fandango" today and you'll be thoroughly entertained! Thanks
