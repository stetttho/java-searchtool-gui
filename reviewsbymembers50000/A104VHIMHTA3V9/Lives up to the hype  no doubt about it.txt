 "O Brother Where Art Thou" is fantastic! This record is not only introducing a new generation of music fans to bluegrass roots music, but it's doing it with a slew of top-notch songs that'll get stuck in your head for weeks. Each of the tracks on here offers something different for the listener. You've got the eerie vocals of Emmylou, Alison, and Gillian on *Didn't Leave Nobody But The Baby*, the sheer acapella simplicity of Ralph Stanley's *O Death*, and the original recordings of bluegrass folk standards *Angel Band* and *Big Rock Candy Mountain*. You also get a taste of the blues and its relationship to bluegrass with Chris Thomas King's *Hard Time Killing Floor Blues*. --- It has always been said that country music and blues music are just a beat away! Even the instrumental versions of *I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow* add flavor to the album and also bring out something new to the song itself. Then there's the reworked covers of familiar songs like *In The Jailhouse Now* and *You Are My Sunshine*. Alison Krauss and the backing choir in *Down To The River To Pray* will take your breath away and who can ever forget the bouncy instrumentation and catchy lyrics in the Soggy Bottom Boys' *I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow*. As a whole, the soundtrack will paint lots of pictures in your mind, primarily taking you to a dusty road in the middle of a tallgrass field. The songs range from hardcore bluegrass to "newgrass", making this a nice introduction for new fans of the genre. Pick this record up today and join in on the fun, for you will not be disappointed!
