 "Guitar Town" is essentially a roots rock album with a heartland, hillbilly twist.  Steve Earle wrote six of the ten tracks, and cowrote the other four.  His voice cuts through the listeners ears, giving you chills.  From start to finish, the record is filled with outstanding songs that you'll never forget.     As a songwriter, Earle uses razor sharp lyrics, particularly noticable on the title track: 'Everybody told me you can't get far on thirty-seven dollars and a Jap guitar.'  He wrote that song after arguing with his girlfriend on the telephone while he was out on the road doing concerts!  *Fearless Heart* is a fantastic rock ballad--watch for the spine-tingling guitar solo.  Earle brings in jangly guitars on tracks like *Gettin' Tough* and *Goodbye's All We Got Left* and also includes some hard, natural country on songs like the bouncy *Think it Over*, the working-class *Hillbilly Highway*, and the acoustic *My Old Friend the Blues*.  *Someday* is the best cut of the record.  This wonderfull storytelling song includes a beautifull electric guitar solo after the second chorus, and a timeless hammered-chord acoustic strum.  Steve closes out the album with the smooth *Little Rock 'n Roller* and the mandolin-drenched *Down The Road*.   Steve Earle delivers each and every song with all the confidence and conviction of the long-time veteran he was when this recording was released.  Using studio musicians rather than his band seems to be the only flaw, but the remarkable high quality of the songs overcomes that.  Definitely an essential recording for any alternative country/roots rock music fan. Thank You!
