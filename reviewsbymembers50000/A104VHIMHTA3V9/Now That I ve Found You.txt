 Covering some of her finest moments of the first decade or so of her career, "Now That I've Found You" IS the place for the novice fan to start with this talented lady. This compilation album includes three new songs as well as four others that only appeared on tribute albums (not on any of Alisons' albums). Whether she's with her Union Station band or not, Krauss always hits on all cylinders. Her vocals are dynamic and emotional, yet soft and not over-the-top. She has a deep care for keeping her personality and distictiveness in the music, and one cannot overlook her great instrumental talent (fiddle). Tired of female vocalists substituting volume for emotion in their singing? You have come to the right place! Alison and her backing musicians will blow you away on this recording!  The title track and *In The Palm of Your Hand* are wonderfull cover songs and Ms. Krauss' bluegrass-pop reworking of *When You Say Nothing At All* is every bit as enjoyable as Keith Whitley's original. Also, listen for the country-blues instrumental work on *Oh, Atlanta* and *When God Dips His Pen of Love in My Heart*. My favorite Alison Krauss song is the lamenting *Everytime You Say Goodbye*. It has a beautiful melody that starts off with a bouncy mandolin and banjo and then slides into a rich fiddle solo. "And your words just are like arrows through my heart, everytime you say goodbye" is one of my favorite lyrics of all-time. The entire album is played to a light, if not non-existent percussion backbeat. Alison does a crafty job of refreshing bluegrassy music while blending in touches of pop and folk. Add in her top-notch vocals, unique phrasing and fiddling and you've got an artist who has certainly carved out a niche of their own. This album will leave you craving for more and luckily AK has put out a good 7 or 8 other records. Highly recommended! Thank You.
