 I stumbled across Amosoff's The Open Heart in a shelf full of free books at my university. I skimmed thru it, and my first impression was that it was a pulp novel from the 40's. I was mistaken. What this book actually is is a couple of days in the life of a doctor who performs open heart surgery, and also has an open "humanistic" heart himself- hence the title. He seems like a pretty nice guy, but he's not that great of a prose stylist, and the whole cybernetics angle was rather dull. I don't know that I'd recommend it for an engaging read; I'm only giving it 3 stars because the intent was good and the doctor's compassion and feelings were at times expressed very well; there were moments when I got a glimpse of this man's soul and felt he was writing from his "open heart". But these points in the book are few and far between, so you might want to pass this one up. It's out of print anyhow. Not surprising.
