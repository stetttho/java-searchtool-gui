 I could play 'S'Wonderful' and 'The Look of Love' all day, but the rest of the album... not really. If Diana Krall jammed like she does in those two songs in all her songs, I'd listen to them constantly, but as it is, there's only a couple that beg repeating. Another reviewer mentioned that she's "souled-out". Give her room to showcase her voice and she'll be good to go- girlfriend needs to sing it like she means it, not like how she's supposed to. When she doesn't do vocal stylistics, the magic isn't happening, so please! more of that.
