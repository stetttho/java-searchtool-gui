 If you love homoerotica, or you love heavy films, this is the flick for you! The story is fascinating and Ripley is played to perfection by Matt Damon (although it appears very few of the reviewers on here would agree with that), but really, Jude Law as Dickie steals the show! He gave one helluva performance-- one I won't soon forget. Heck, the whole movie is unforgettable, and it really makes you think, which is what a good movie should do. And all that homoerotica...mmm-mmm-mmm! I was just beside myself with joy and laughter to see all this steamy interaction between the attractive men in this film. Yeah, 5 stars, baby!
