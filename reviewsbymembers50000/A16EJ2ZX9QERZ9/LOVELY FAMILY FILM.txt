 I thought this was a well-acted, well-written film that conveys it's  message beautifully and will not soon be forgotten by most who watch it.  Bergman is splendid in the role of a shy recluse chick. There are too many  heart-warming moments to mention. It gives me a warm, fuzzy feeling just  thinking about this movie.
