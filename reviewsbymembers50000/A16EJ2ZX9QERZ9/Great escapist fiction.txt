 This is the perfect book for fans of the Golden Age of Hollywood. Tryon takes the reader back to a time when everything was glamourous and there was something almost magical about the movies. But he then proceeds to tell the very REAL behind-the-scenes story of some leading ladies, who share a common thread in that they were all involved with the same man at one time or another.  This is the kind of book you can't put down. There's lots of melodrama, intrigue, sex... and even murder! Also some pretty funny twists, especially the first story. (If you read it you'll see what I mean.) Glorious camp! Five stars.
