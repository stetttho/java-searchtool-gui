 I picked this book up randomly at the library, because the title was a bit odd for a novel- and boy am I ever glad of my penchant for quirky titles right about now! It led me to what is sure to be one of my favourite authors... that is, if this book is any gauge of Donald Harington's talents.  With colourful characters, humour from bawdy to book-learned, and an understanding of humanity and history I've rarely seen in a modern author, Harington's 'The Architecture of the Arkansas Ozarks' definitely is a masterpiece. In this book he traces the saga of the Stay Morons, focusing on the Ingledew family in particular. He uses architecture as a conceit to show how 'the great world spins forever round the ringing grooves of change' (paraphrasing Tennyson). Just remember "the base is heavier, the upper part lighter, and... the roof is pitched."
