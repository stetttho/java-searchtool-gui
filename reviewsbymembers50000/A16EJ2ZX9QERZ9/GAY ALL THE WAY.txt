 The Gay Divorcee, starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, is still as funny and charming today as when it was first released. Just watch the two of them dance to "Night and Day"-- beautiful chemistry! All the dance numbers are great, but "The Continental" number went on a bit too long for me (although admittedly it was written for this movie, so it is understandable that an elaborate production was made out of it.) The loverboy who keeps forgetting his lines ('chance is a fool's name for fate' and the many variations that he came up with) had me in stitches too. To sum it up, this movie is great for the whole family and you won't be disappointed!
