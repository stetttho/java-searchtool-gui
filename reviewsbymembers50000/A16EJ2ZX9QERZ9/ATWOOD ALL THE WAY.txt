 This was my first Margaret Atwood novel. After reading it, I realized my standards have been much to low. Atwood showed me how interesting and  bizarre a story can be, how many layers it can have, the beauty of the  English language. Plus, it didn't hurt that a lot of it took place in some  very familiar settings, making me feel nostalgiac. How can I go back to  reading "popular fiction" after experiencing her breathtaking  style? From now on, it's Atwood all the way, baby! Anyone who hasn't  already picked up a novel by this talented lady of letters, take the Atwood  plunge; you'll be doing yourself a favour.
