 The guns, the broads, the alpha male posturing- all this and more make James Ellroy's The Black Dahlia an engaging read. I had trouble putting it down, the writing was just that taut and suspenseful. Although I don't agree about whodunnit (I think it's the surgeon guy who went nutso...a guy never mentioned once in this book) and I was pretty sure of who Ellroy would have it turn out to be from early on (although that could be due to the fact that I read too many mysteries and can guess pretty easily) I did thouroughly enjoy this novel. I don't know much about the Dahlia's background, so I can't comment on the accuracy with which she was portrayed, but I will say that I did find the story Ellroy wove out of Elizabeth Short's life to be fascinating either way. The one thing I didn't like was the psychologically overdone Lee- can you say cardboard? But you're allowed one lousy character in a book full of great ones. The dumb cops were a hoot, and all that manly man stuff had me in stitches (the interrogation room beatings and the phallicly charged gun-toting). If this is any indication of what Ellroy's other fictions involve, I'm sold! Long live the alpha male!
