 What can I say? Bogarde's a genius, and this book, like all his others, is evidence of that fact. They broke the mold when they made the Dirkster, and the world is a better place for it! His light is so bright it'll blind you if you stare directly at it, just like the sun. Approach with eyes averted, as if humbly bowing down to the gods.
