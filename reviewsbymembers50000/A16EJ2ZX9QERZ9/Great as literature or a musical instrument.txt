 Sick Puppy is a wonderful book. A good read, and also it makes really cool  noises when you scratch it (hardcover). I read the book, and when my eyes  got tired, I played Classic Rock on the book jacket.  Maybe I'm reading  too much into this, but could Skink be the antichrist? There are a lot of  parallels in Hiaasen's books that would indicate that it might be the case.  After all, religious scholars say the antichrist is in human form here on  earth and is a militant environmentalist. Supposedly, eating roadkill would  fit the description, too. Antichrist is supposed to not kill animals  himself, but has no qualms about eating those which are already dead.  That's my belief, and it is a bit bizarre, but it makes reading Hiaasen all  the more fascinating. Well, if not, the scenarios in his books (which are  filled with the type of events that would potentially be leading up to the  second coming and Skink himself), are eerily similar to what religious  scholars believe to be true.
