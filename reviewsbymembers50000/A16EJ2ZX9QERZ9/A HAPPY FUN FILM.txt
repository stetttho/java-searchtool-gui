 You Were Never Lovelier is a light, romantic musical with a great cast and wonderful songs. Hayworth plays Maria, a beautiful young girl whose family  wants her to marry. Her father, in an effort to get her in the right state  of mind for love, starts sending her flowers and notes purporting to be  from a secret admirer, hoping to melt her "refrigerated" heart.  Astaire, who plays a dancer (naturally *g*), gets mixed up in her father's  deceit--lies and misunderstandings follow. Never fear, all ends well (but  of course!). The supporting characters are perfect and add to the  atmosphere of the film and make it even more enjoyable. I especially liked  the very gay secretary who plays his part to perfection. Hayworth is in  top form dancing in the numbers "I'm Old Fashioned" and  "Shorty George". I was more than impressed by her beauty and  grace. Astaire's best part in the film is when he does a difficult dance  number in Maria's father's office and makes it look easy, as per usual.
