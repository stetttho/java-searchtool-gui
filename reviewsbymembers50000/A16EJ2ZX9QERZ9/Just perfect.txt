 Welles wrote, directed and starred (along with his then wife Rita Hayworth) in this mind-blowing 1948 film noir. It looks beautiful, it sounds beautiful- heck, it's just beautiful... period! Welles' shark story is the coolest thing I've heard in my life and I repeat his Buddha-like words of wisdom every chance I get. For the love of God, watch this film!
