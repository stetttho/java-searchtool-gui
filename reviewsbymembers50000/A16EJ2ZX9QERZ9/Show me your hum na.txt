 I stole this book from my local Chapters and when I got home was greatly disappointed. I took it upon myself to return it to the store, I just didn't want this piece of garbage cramping my style. Kinnell is up to his usual hijinks, talking about the ins and outs of Life and Love in our time, but this one lacks the charm of his earlier works. I haven't read his earlier works, by the way, but they can't be as bad as this.
