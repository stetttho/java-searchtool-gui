 I'm embarassed to admit it, but yes, I am totally grooving to this manufactured pop group's single 'Just A Little'. I first heard it at some all-ages nightclub, and it really caught my ears so I listened for it on the radio and all that. The chorus is just so durn catchy and the beat is far too easy to get lost in. I hang my head in shame.
