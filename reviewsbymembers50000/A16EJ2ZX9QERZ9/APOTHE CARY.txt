 Cary Grant was such a gentleman, so gay, charming and debonair. The pictures show him at his homoerotic best, to the delight of all his  hardcore fans. This book is great, with nice writing and not a juicy detail  left out (and were they ever juicy...*slurp*) Cary Grant is the man!   Giddy-up, dah-ling! Ride 'em cowboy!
