 The person who reviewed this before me is right: this is the best movie ever! Scandal, sex, secrets, lies....and Lauren Bacall, the best actress  ever! What's not to love? Lots of phallic symbols and very campy,ironic  dialogue, and over-the-top acting, too. The best parts are Dorothy Malone's  nympho dance and the big 'climactic' shouting/fighting match near the end  with the two male stars. Rock Hudson was something else; there'll never be  another like him. No one could do melodramas in quite the same way he  could. It was like the whole genre was made just for him. This movie is not  to be missed!
