 Sinatra is amazing in this movie about a nightclub singer and the ladies in his life. All the songs are first-rate and Sinatra's performances of  "Lady Is A Tramp" and "I Didn't Know What Time It Was"  are classic. The plot is entertaining, and though admittedly tamer than the  story originally was, still has enough of a hint of naughtiness to stay  true to the swing of things. Hayworth gives a kick butt performance and  steals the show as the glamourous rich widow who helps Joey finance his  dreams. Novak is beautiful and does good, but what woman can compete with a  co-star like Ms.Hayowrth!  But the best thing about Pal Joey is that it's  Sinatra bring Sinatra and that's why I fell in love with this movie.
