 This is Heston at his "hamming it up" best. It is a great movie  on many levels, but the level I like is the overly dramatic scenes where he  shows us what he's most talented at. Watch "The Agony and the  Ecstasy" as an informative history of one of the greatest artists that  ever lived, or as a typical Heston laugh-fest, if you're one who enjoys the  unintentional humour of his acting style. Who couldn't love a movie where  Heston's voice rises to a powerful crescendo and he says: "I will  paint men as God made them: in the glory of their nakedness!" That is  thespianism at it's finest!
