 I am a huge fan of M*A*S*H so when I was flipping through the channels and saw Alan Alda's name in the credits of a movie about satanism, I thought "this is gonna be good." Alda plays a pianist (I love saying that word...hehe) who sells his soul to the devil to become a master of his craft. This is really a cool idea, since traditionally satan has been associated with phenomenal musical talent (just think of the rumors about Led Zeppelin selling their souls to the devil for fame). A lot of really cool stuff happens in The Mephisto Waltz, and there's lots of melodrama and screaming and overacting, and dun-dun-dun....suspense! My favourite part of this movie was the ending. Alan Alda must have been starving, since he looked like he was ready to eat the face off of the chick he was kissing! (I won't say who that chick is; it's a surprise) That's what I call love, satan style! The ony thing I didn't like was all the use of blue light and halluciantion techniques of the Scottish rite. Congrats to the director, though. You earned your middle degrees of freemasonry well.
