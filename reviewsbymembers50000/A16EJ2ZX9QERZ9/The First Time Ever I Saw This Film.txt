 Eastwood stars and directs this psycho/stalker thriller about a radio DJ who has what he thinks is a no-strings attached sex encounter with one of his callers (who always says "Play 'Misty' for me" when she calls him up, hence the title) which turns out to be more than he bargained for. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat, and despite (or maybe because of) the hysterical performance of Jessica Walter as the woman scorned, it did manage to create and sustain a mood of suspense.  One thing: what the heck were the two montage sequences doing in the film? They were so out of place and really detracted from the atmosphere. The movie could've really done without them, although I didn't mind seeing a nekkid Clint Estwood pawing away at a nekkid Donna Mills in a forest while Roberta Flack sings in the background. Classic scene: psycho-woman Jessica Walter gets into one of many fights with Eastwood's character and screams at him "You're nothing! You're not even good in bed! I just felt sorry for you!"
