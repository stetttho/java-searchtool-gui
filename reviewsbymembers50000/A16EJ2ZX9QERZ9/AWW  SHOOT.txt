 This was my first Goodis book, and it absolutely blew me away. If this is any indicator of what to expect from the man, I'm in love. In this noir  novel, things get messed up, then get even messier, and messier still,  until it's just one big mess and Eddie has got to keep hiding and runnning  and fighting for survival. And the unbearable nature of it all wakes Eddie  up out of the complacency of his life. That's what this book is about. Not  to mention that Goodis' writing is like reading hard-boiled poetry. The  words flow together beautifully and have an air of mystery and profundity  about them. The last two pages alone will stay with me forever as a fond  memory. Like a previous reveiwer, _ Of Human Bondage_ is my favourite  book-- and still is, but now it shares 1st place with _Shoot The Piano  Player_.
