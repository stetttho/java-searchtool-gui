 In this (unintentionally?) hilarious movie, Lionel Barrymore, a man put into jail for the crimes of his former business partners, breaks out of prison and vows to get revenge. He escapes with a mad scientist who can shrink people and take away their free will, rendering them incapable of resonding unless powered by the force of another will. When this mad scientist guy kicks the bucket, Barrymore's charcter gets the brilliant idea to dress up like a chick and along with the mad scientist's wife, go and terrorize his former business partners as revenge for all the years he spent in prison. For this he uses the little people, who are marketed to the men as the next big thing in toys. They of course appeal to the greedy capitalistic nature of these evil businessmen, serving to lure them all right in to Barrymore's trap.  Barrymore looks like he's having a bit too much fun playing a woman, and anyone who watches this movie will be having fun along with him. He gives a damn fine performance as an Oscar Wilde-ian old lady, a performance no one should miss. For the corniness, the campiness, and the Freudian symbolism, this is definitely a movie worth watching!
