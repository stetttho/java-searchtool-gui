 Heston sweats alot (along with the rest of the men in the cast, but Heston is the best looking greasy-face), gets naked, and takes a shower with a chick. He also tells Edward G. Robinson he loves him many times. There are  some good fights in this movie and Heston is wearing tight pants that are  very flattering from the back. At the end of the movie, Heston actually  emotes. He does it so rarely that it's a monumental occasion when it  happens. What is he emoting about?  You'll have to watch for yourself and  find out.
