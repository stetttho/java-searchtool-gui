 Swell is a pseudo-sophisticated book that tries so hard to be hip and witty but in the end if you don't got it, you don't got it. And the chicks who wrote this book don't got it big time! This book may appeal to socially inept wallflowers who watch Sex & The City and wish they could be like those oh-so-cool ladies (said with heavy sarcasm) but since these wallflowers don't go to fancy parties or do all the things "sophisticated girlies" do, the tips in this book won't be of any use to them. How's that for irony?
