 This is such a funny book, but underneath all the satiric and wickedly  evil humor lies a truth so awful that it may be hard for you to face it.  The story is told with all the subtlety of being hit by a Mack truck at  high-speed. This novel was surely no easy feat for Waugh to write. _Vile  Bodies_ is crafted in such a brilliant and many-layered style, and still  communicates it's deep underlying message very clearly, so even those not  looking for a hidden meaning will see the truth. The scathing wit and utter  absurdity are the veneer that once penetrated, will take you to a place  deep in your mind that is all too real. Buy this book and take a second  look at life.
