 This is just an average Jim Thompson book, which still makes it better  than a lot of the junk out there right now, but not as good as "The  Killer Inside Me" or "The Getaway". It's nonetheless worth  reading, and as a woman, reading Thompson is such a treat. I get a lot of  flack for saying this, and many women disagree, but his female characters  are amazing. I just love them all. They're so brilliantly written, and  besides the fact that his books are based on Greek mythology (ripping off  the classics is a tried and true way of writing a great story) that's the  main reason why I read him. This book is no letdown in the awesome babes  department. Two very unforgettable criminal-type women inhabit the pages of  this book.
