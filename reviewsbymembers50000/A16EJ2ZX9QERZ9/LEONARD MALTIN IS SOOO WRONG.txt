 Leonard Maltin called this film contrived and weak-- it is no such thing. Me and a few of my friends watched this movie, and though they're not particularly fond of classic film, they nevertheless loved Bluebeard, a sure sign of its greatness. Gary Cooper, in the role of the oft-married man, romances Colbert into becoming his eighth wife. Being a man who never learns from his mistakes, Cooper just keeps on making more and more of 'em. There are lots of laugh-out-loud funny jokes, both verbal and physical, and the movie has a very Parisian feel, or the Lubitsch touch, if you will. I certainly am very fond of this movie, and it's now one of my favourites. Don't listen to that movie critic; give this movie a try- you may just like it! My only complaint would be that we never got to see Gary Cooper without his pyjama bottoms, but that old man with skinny legs paraded around without 'em. Not much of a complaint, but I was hoping we'd at least get a glimpse of Cooper's sexy gams.
