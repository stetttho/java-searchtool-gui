 The president is scheduled to make a stop in a small town called Suddenly, and Sinatra and his buddies are hired hitmen who plan to bump him off when he arrives. In order to carry out their plan, they take over the house of a widow, her son, and her father-in-law, holding the inhabitants hostage.  Sinatra's speech about guns and God is a classic, and the allusions to nefarious government plots will have the conspiracy junkies wetting their pants. I wouldn't be surprised if the NRA funded this picture. Four stars.
