 The first thing I'll say is that I am so happy this book is written in coherent English for the most part (there's an abundance of Latin as well). With 'Ulysses' and 'Finnegan's Wake,' man, have you ever got to work to make sense out of what you're reading! I don't mind the work, but it's hard going and takes much time- time that I don't have right now. So, until that day when I do have time, I'll have to content myself with 'Portrait...' I don't know about most readers, but Joyce's semi-autobiographical novel reminded me of 'Of Human Bondage' in many ways. You know, guy comes from religious background; he's shy, broody, and inclined to a love of words; there are 'moments' when he begins to appreciate the aesthetic; there's talk of hell and the protagonist worrying about being a sinner if he falls away from the church...and so on. So if anyone out there found 'Portrait' difficult, try 'Of Human Bondage'....ya might find that it's your cup of tea. To abuse a word, for me, 'Portrait...' is a book of 'moments'. There are scenes that are brilliant, almost magical; and then there are scenes that border on the pretentious. Overall, it is worth reading, because these moments are worth the fodder you have to read through to get to them.
