 This is a great movie about a bunch of shysters and the two main ones  (Gable& Harlow) marvellous love affair. Lots of tough-talk and romance  as only Gable can do it. And there's women in prison (sort of...it's more  like a detention centre) too! This film brings to mind that old cliche:  They don't make 'em like this any more!
