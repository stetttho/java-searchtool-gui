 This book is absolutely hilarious! Moll Flanders is a woman who loved money a bit too much and in turn was loved by many a man with money. The comedy in this book stands the test of time (at least for me) and in my opinion, the language is not as archaic and difficult to follow as one previous reviewer stated. There are some words that aren't in use today, but their meanings are pretty self-explanatory. If you love scandal, you'll love this book. This chick has baby after baby, sleeps with almost any man with money, and even marries her own brother! If Moll were around nowadays, she'd probably be on Springer! Highly recommended.
