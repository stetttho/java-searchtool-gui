 I'd rather read tea leaves than ever read this book again. It's like smelly socks, sweat, and beer-stained undershirts: men stuff. A  pre-schooler could entertain and enlighten me more than this goof  Hemingway. Bitter men will enjoy it. All that misogyny is right up their  alley; and as an added bonus, Hemingway rarely uses big, complex words or  sentences, the easier for troglodytes to understand him.
