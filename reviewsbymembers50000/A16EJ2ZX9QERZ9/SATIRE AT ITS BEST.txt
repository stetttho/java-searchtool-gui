 Evelyn Waugh, one of the greatest satirists that ever lived, does it again in Scoop. With his brilliance, wit, and keen observational skills, he weaves together one unforgettable story of mistaken identities, colourful characters and superb irony. This book had me bursting out into uncontrollable peals of laughter (but then again, what Evelyn Waugh book doesn't?) time and time again. This is, simply put, a work of genius-- no doubt of that. Evelyn Waugh will forever remain one of my literary heroes. If I could only write half as good as he did....
