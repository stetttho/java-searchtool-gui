 This book is full of dangerous ideas, especially if you're a church-goer. The religion being taught nowadays is not the same one you'll find in this book. What happened from then to now? Maybe greed got the best of what used to be a pious and moral people. I feel that the brand of religion in this book, untainted as it is, as comprehnsive and logical as it is, in it's purest and actual form, is an improvement on the one you may be indoctrinated with by misinformation feeding preachers. Oh yeah, the illustrations are breathtaking, too. This book is just screaming "buy me!"
