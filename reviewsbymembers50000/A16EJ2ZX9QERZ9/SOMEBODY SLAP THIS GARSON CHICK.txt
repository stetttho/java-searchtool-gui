 There is no chemistry to speak of between Garson and Peck in this boring, snoozefest of a movie. The idea of them being in love is absurd and they  should never have been cast together romantically. What was Hollywood  thinking? Every character is a walking cliche and the plot is entirely  predictable. Predictability can be good, but in this case it's just another  reason to dislike it strongly. Garson's character is annoying, uppity and  full of herself (what a stretch *snarkle*). She's just one of those  holier-than-thou type of people who think they're better than everyone else  and I wanted to slap her around 'til I knocked her delusions of grandeur  out of her. I'm sure this is not how her character was supposed to come  off, but that was the impression that I got. How could anyone want her to  be happy and get her man? No guy as hot as Paul (GP's character) deserves  such an awful woman as his wife! The only thing that saved this movie from  being a total waste of time was Gregory Peck. Besides being a young,  handsome gentleman in this film, he gave a great performance and his effort  to save a disaster of a movie deserves two stars, and know that both stars  are for him and no other part of the movie. And people actually gave this 5  stars? Oh boy!
