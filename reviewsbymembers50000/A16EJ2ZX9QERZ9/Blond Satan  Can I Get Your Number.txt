 Dashiell Hammett's Sam Spade is a blonde satan with his own moral code which he upholds come hell or high water. Read it as a mystery, read it as 'a man who knew what it meant to be a man's ethics' and either way it'll hook you in and you won't be able to stop until you've finished. Over the years I've read this novel several times, each time gleaning something new from it. Although any mystery will lose its appeal in the respect of 'whodunnit' after you know the ending, the story about Flitcraft and the falling beam, Spade's theory of the fall guy and the priceless one-liners are worth the price of admission or readmission as the case may be.
