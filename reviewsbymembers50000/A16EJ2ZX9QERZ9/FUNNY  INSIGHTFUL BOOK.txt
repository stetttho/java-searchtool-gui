 This book about women and art is a very accurate commentary, peppered with  plenty of humour. All of what Joanna Russ writes about rings true with me,  and at the same time I wished it wasn't so. I've always known what she says  to be as it is, but I just accepted it, and didn't really give it much  thought. All narrow-minded literary scholars (and I've met plenty...so many  college profs. are) should read this book, and hopefully it will open their  mind.
