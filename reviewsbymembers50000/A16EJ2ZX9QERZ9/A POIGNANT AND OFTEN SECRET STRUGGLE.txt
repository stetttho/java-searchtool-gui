 Battle Hymn is a story about Colonel Dean Hess (Rock Hudson), a pilot stationed in Korea. But this is a Douglas Sirk film, so you know there's a lot more to it than that, and things aren't always what they seem. The movie manages to combine a warm and endearing stroy with a hidden plot that will please all the Sirk fans.  There's a moving death scene that rivals Greta Garbo and Robert Taylor in Camille for most romantic of all time. And this is man to man, not your convential sort of deal, by no means. Rock Hudson looked so at home running his fingers through the sergeant's hair and whispering comforting words about "the abundant light". Talk about swoon-worthy! Battle Hymn can be summed up perfectly with this quote from the film: "Perhaps, through the agony of war, I have finally done what I was never before able to do. In reaching beyond myself, I have found myself." The quote signifies many things on many levels, and can be equally as disturbing as it is inspiring. You'll have to watch the movie to find out what it all means for yourself. Oh yeah, and it also helps if you know about Douglas Sirk and what his objectives were when making a movie. Then it will all become clear. Such genius. Such revelations.
