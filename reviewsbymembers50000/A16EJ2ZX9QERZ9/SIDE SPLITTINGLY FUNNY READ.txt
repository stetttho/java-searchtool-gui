 This book is Rabelais at his best. Yes, the humor is at times crude and vulgar. Yes, the more delicate reader may find it disgusting and idiotic, but if this isn't one of the most clever books ever written, I'll be a  monkey's uncle! Not unlike Robertson Davies, who mentions our potty-mouthed  friend many times in his book "The Rebel Angels", Rabelais takes  bathroom humour to a level you probably never thought it could reach: high  comedy. I highly recommend it!
