 Die! Die! My Darling! is a great movie. The basic story is that this chick (Stefanie Powers as Pat) goes to pay her belated condolences to the mother of a man she was once engaged to (mother being Tallulah Bankhead as Mrs. Trefoile), but who had died. The mother..., decides to hold Pat captive after learning about her plans to marry (or remarry, since Mrs. Trefoile considers Pat and her son to be married in the eyes of the lord). Sinner, repent! So, Mrs. Trefoile keeps Pat a prisoner, on a diet of scripture and not much else. Bankhead is great as a fundamentalist who is so fundamental she's in a religion all her own! If you want your supper in her house, you better get down on your knees, bow your head and sit through about 20 verses of scripture. And then, if you're lucky, you'll get a miniscule portion of some bland concoction. Remember, the Lord wants us to lead simple lives! In light of her personal life, the fact that Tallulah Bankhead plays a religious fanatic is just so ripe with irony. Her performance, while not up there with the old hag horror movies of Crawford and Davis, is still pretty solid and surprisingly not as campy as I expected. Yeah, if you didn't know who Tallulah was, you might not detect the booze-drinking (even on the set of this film), ...lady that she was. Also of note is a young Donald Sutherland as a mentally handicapped servant at the Trefoile house.
