 Light? Entertaining? Maybe on the surface, but this book is as dark and cynical as they come. When we first meet one of the main characters, Cuckoo, she is having a mid-life crisis, so she boozes it up and tries to drown herself. Fortunately she is rescued by Marcus, the object of every man's lust- and every women's, too! He even gets raped later on. Oh yes, how light & entertaining. We also meet a miserable tyrant of a film director who speechifies on actors being clay, and him being the potter. This is a man who would stop at nothing for art. I won't say what he does but you'll see what I mean. At least Marcus puts him in his place. I was like "Yeah!~ You go boy!" Sure, all this is ample material for spoofing, but underneath there are some heavy issues being dealt with. The same dark pattern can be seen in many of the other characters, such as the narcissistic, historically obsessed Archie, or Leni, whose guilt over her German heritage leads her to an odd kind of atonement for the sins of the fathers. Oh yeah, the ending is so positive and cheery... lots of hope there(note the sarcasm). An alright book, but certainly not one with a joyful message.
