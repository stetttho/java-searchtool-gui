 Yes, this movie is yet another vehicle for Cary Grant and his  beastiality/phallic symbol obsessions. Not to say it isn't a rootin',  tootin', high-falutin' good time to watch these films--of course it is! The  scene with the turkey baster and the vaseline is not to be missed. Cary was  way ahead of his time and I'm eternally grateful to him for sharing his  vision of breathtaking genius with the world. He changed everything and  opened the door for Swedish films dealing with the same issues but in a  more graphic nature. Bravo!
