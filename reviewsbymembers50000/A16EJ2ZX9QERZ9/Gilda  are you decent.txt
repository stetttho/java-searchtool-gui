 The always stunning Rita Hayworth stars as Gilda, the ultimate femme fatale in this film noir classic. She's a woman who uses her womanly charms in a manly way: to manipulate and gain power, creating drama for everyone, including herself. She's her own worst enemy, and all because... well, you'll have to watch and find out. I won't be so kind as to spoil the ending for you (see some of the other reviews for that), but I will agree with others in saying it's an unsatisfying cop-out. It doesn't matter, though. The first hour&40 make this DEFINITELY worth watching. To the previous reviewer who called this film misogynistic: say what? Gilda's more manly than any of the actual males in this movie, who may or may not be gay. Besides, how can one female's actions stand for females as a whole? Since there are no other women protagonists in this diegesis to compare Gilda with, that reading rests on a faulty basis.
