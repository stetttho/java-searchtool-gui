 I wasn't expecting much from The House of Seven Corpses, and for that reason the fact that this horror film is clever (but not too clever) and funny (but not too funny) came as a pleasant surprise. Others have already commented on the plot, which doesn't altogether make sense on a literal level, but symbolically makes perfect sense, so I'll just comment on some of my fave things about this movie.  The irony and self-reflexiveness that the film-within-a-film made possible was my favourite aspect. I hate the newer movies that have that sort of humour, but this film wasn't smug and in-your-face about it, so it worked for me. Especially the ending, where one of the zombies drops a... well, I won't say, but it's perfect! I love the way they used cross-cutting, and the montage sequences were neat in a cheesy way. The directing was wanna-be Hitchcock (esp. the use of mirrors), but on a low budget, even Hitch would look like a wanna-be of himself. Another funny bit was when one of the actresses discovers her cat Cleon cut in half and she goes into hysterics. Then later, if you look closely, you can see John Carradine's character (Price) chiselling the cat's name onto a headstone. No one draws attention to it, but if you're sharp you'll catch the name. Also, there are lots of other visual jokes which I found myself rewinding the movie to laugh at again.  About the actors- no Academy Award performances here, but everyone was competent. The tyrant director (played by John Ireland) was my fave of all. It was great when the zombie was chasing him and he notices the film scattered all over the floor and gets more upset over that than being stalked by a killing machine (My film! Oh God!). While this movie is not a masterpice, it's good for a laugh or two.
