 Every word in this book, "Does America Need A Foreign Policy?" is a lie, meant to beguile you into seeing things in such a distorted way that you approve of the ideas Kissinger is proposing, ideas that he has in the past, and will in the future, go through with whether you like it or not. Henry the Beast? doesn't want you to hate him; he'd rather be your friend, (or at least pretend to be) but if not, he goes both ways, so children, be on your best behaviour, lest Henry- SNAP, went the dragons! An interesting aside...Hey kids, I've got something fun for you today! You can try this experiment at home if you want. The only danger is the implied one. Henry's last name is Kissinger. If we assigned multiples of 6 to every letter of the alphabet, starting with A=6, B=12, C=18, and so on and then add up the total values in the surname Kissinger, we'll get six-hundred and sixty-six right on the money: the mark of the beast. Make of that what you will. Have a nice day!
