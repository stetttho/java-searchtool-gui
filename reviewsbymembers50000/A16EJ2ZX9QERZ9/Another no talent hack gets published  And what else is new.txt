 The Badlands is a terrible book. It alternates from boring the reader to making them cringe at the pathetic attmepts Kroetsch makes at creating patterns, meanings and symbols that transcend character and place. This is the kind of junk that young hacks churn out in creative writing class, and it also seems like it was written with academia in mind. It has all the requirements to meet an English Lit. course's criteria; it can be picked apart and would serve to teach students about different techniques and literary devices, although they could (and should) learn from much, much better authors. This book is dangerous and it sucks, while most books in Canons of literature don't. Also, the devices used to give significance to events are so blatantly out in the open it's as if he just threw together these elements with no concern for story whatsoever- going by the guidelines of one of thse "how to write fiction" books, as it were. (By the way, you should avoid those books at all costs if you're serious about being a writer...they homogenize your vision of the world and inhibit your originality, and you'll end up writing junk like Badlands.)  How this got rave reviews I don't know- how it even got published is a mystery to me. The author seems to be lacking any sort of warmth and understanding of humanity; his characters are flat and don't act as human beings would. This is probably the work of a cold pseudo-intellectual who thinks the world revolves around him and has no concern or compassion for his fellow humans. Considering how the protagonist of this novel is a man who fits that description, I wouldn't be surprised if Kroetsch is what I've pegged him to be. Either that, or he's just a hack who got a lucky break. Maybe he knew the right people, or paid them off, or he slept with the publisher or something.  Not a rewarding book. If you have to read this, I feel for you. If not, avoid at all costs!
