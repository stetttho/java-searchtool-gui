 The Thin Man, Dashiell Hammett's high-society detective novel, is most  definitely NOT like the movies based on the book. While the movies are  about a gay, carefree couple who solve crimes and do a lot of social  drinking, the book is more about a couple in a destructive relationship.  Nick only married Nora for her money, and they both know it. He's also a  womanizer and an alcoholic (as is Nora). Nora is a younger woman who seems  enchanted by Nick's sinful ways, and allows him to use her as he feels free  to. The whodunit mystery, although discussed very much in the book, is not  the most interesting part of the novel, nor did Hammett intend it to be.  Read it for the satirical potrayal of bad relationships. Not just Nick and  Nora's, but the dysfunctional (although dysfunctional may be an  understatement) family they help to solve the murder.  The Thin Man is  also notable for the use of a certain word to describe male arousal.  Hammett was attempting to pave the way for other authors to discuss  sexuality more openly. Unfortunately, it didn't quite catch on.
