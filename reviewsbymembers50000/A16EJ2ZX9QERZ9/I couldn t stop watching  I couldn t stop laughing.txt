 Yes, it's stupid, yes it will very likely offend you, but darned if I wasn't laughing till my sides hurt as I watched Tom Green do one shocking & mindless thing after another. Betty, his girlfriend, was such a hoot, and Rip Torn as Green's dad proved his greatness. I especially love the scene where he pulls down his pants and bears his buttocks. You have to see it to believe it! Actually, most of this movie has to be seen to be believed, since it's so ludicrous that writing about it you'd think it was some psychotic fantasy, which it is, but it's just not mine. Money talks, so Tom Green was allowed to indulge his insane whims, while I can't. No fair!
