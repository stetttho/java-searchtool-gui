 This movie is just plain trash, and I don't mean that in a good way. It doesn't know if it wants to be a comedy or a melodrama and it might've been good if they'd stuck to one or the other. As it is, it's just a painfully boring, poorly-scripted movie that did have occasional bursts of excellence (although if you blink, you'd miss 'em), but not enough to make it worth watching. Even the Italian scenery isn't worth the price of a rental, and certainly not worth the cost of actually buying it. If you're looking for Italy, you'd do better watching a travel video-- it'd probably be more interesting than this movie, anyways.
