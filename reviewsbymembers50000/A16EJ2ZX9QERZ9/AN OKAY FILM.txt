 If you don't expect anything amazing, you'll enjoy this film. It's  well-intentioned and could have been more, but it just doesn't have that  magical chemistry that makes for a great movie. The plot is a bit hokey and  predictable, but it wasn't trying to be anything more than that in the  first place. Not a must-see, but a nice southern romance full of intrigue  type of movie to sit back and relax with.
