 Dennis Lehane's outstanding first novel, A Drink Before The War, reads like a pastiche of Raymond Chandler's detective novels updated to the 90s, except this time the setting is Boston, and there are two private dicks on the case (and one is a chick. Woohoo!) Dripping with irony and a cool sensibility, the first-person narration of Kenzie, our modern-day Marlowe, is stellar and true to the genre. Like Chandler, Lehane is also an expert at unique descriptions and uses similes that either make one chuckle or marvel at their imagery. The language used almost makes the violence romantic. I say almost, because Lehane shows the reader violence in all its gritty realism- no glorifying what should never be glorified- but somehow the way it's described is poetic enough to be savoured and read over repeatedly. Kinda like the martial arts films where they make fighting look like ballet. The theme of racism in the book bordered on preachy, but the elimination of moral superiority and self-righteousness saved it from being a wretch-inducing sermon. Lehane has a very good grasp of the victim mentality and handles abusive relationships very realistically (not surprising, since he counsels abused children), which is to be praised, because in the wrong hands, victims can become a cliche and like the race issues, make one wretch at the flat, cardboard characterization. There's no sense of the author having thought to himself "I'll create a token abused person (interchangeable with token gay and the token minority) character for my series! That oughta pull their heart strings, and maybe another 1% of the population will identify because they've been abused (or gay, or a minority). Look at me, expanding my market. Making me some more dollars." Corruption, violence, one-liners, pain, politics- this book has it all. This was my first foray into the Kenzie/Gennaro novels, and without a doubt, this is one series I'm definitely gonna keep on reading.
