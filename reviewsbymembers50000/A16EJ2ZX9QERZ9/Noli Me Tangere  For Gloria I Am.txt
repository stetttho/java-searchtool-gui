 Gloria is a novel that follows the life of a rich, smart, young girl in the 1950s, from her teenage years to her metamorphosis into a woman. The story is told in a series of flashbacks, tracing Gloria's life and loves, and then taking the reader forward to the present to examine how her experiences have shaped her as a person. There are many metaphors and symbols running through the book, such as The Faerie Queen parallel and Sir Thomas Wyatt's poetry as a relfection of Gloria's inner life (Gloria is an Eng. Lit. major in college, so there's a lot of bookish stuff going on here). The novel is well-written and has that vraisemblance that makes the reader feel as if these characters are living, breathing souls. Even the characters who don't have that big a part in the book are written in such a realistic style. Maillard knows what it is to be human-- more specifically female(!)-- and he showcases it finely in this book. I loved it and will definitely be reading more of this gifted author's books.
