 McBain writes about oranges, apples, mangoes and lotsa other fruits, but  in a way that transcends the genre of fruit fiction. The 87th precinct is a  place for all the people who don't want to just eat the watermelon, but  rather want to pour a gallon of vodka in it and get drunk at the same time.  This reading experience is even better than a drunken fruit frenzy. 50  novels and not a stinker in the bunch. All intelligently written, full of  dark humor, and having all the precision of a scalpel. His books, and  McBain himself, deserve all the praise they get.
