 This is a great, fun movie from the William Castle oeuvre, with the gimmick this time being a punishment poll where moviegoers were (supposedly) allowed to choose whether to really let that evil ole' Sardonicus have it or not. The version I saw he (not surprisingly) gets the extra punishment, as I'm sure has always been the case.  Overall, this movie is very camp, with an outrageously improbable story that works all the same. Also the homoerotic over- and undertones don't hurt. And one last thing: Sir Robert rules!
