 I won't concentrate on the films themselves because anyone reading this review already knows that Kubrick, though sluglike in turnout, produced the most consistent opus possibly of any director. Watching landmarks like 2001 or A Clockwork Orange proves to us that he took his time for a reason.  As far as the collection itself goes, it could have included more extras (indeed, any at all on some of the discs), but we should be glad to have a collector's set at all, and I would argue that the exclusion of some of his earliest films strengthens it considerably. As for the extras (or lack thereof), I would like to say that we should be glad there are even chapter selections. Mulholland Dr. doesn't even have that. Then there's the documentary, "A Life in Pictures." Clocking in at over 2 hours, it is the extra to beat all extras, covering his entire career, dispelling any notions of Kubrick as some drug-addicted maniac with a camera, and even addressing ideas he had for future pictures. It is a shame that having lost him, we cannot look forward to any running commentaries, but this is a drawback that true fans shouldn't take too badly. We have the films, and that's what matters.  Sure, an unedited version of Eyes Wide Shut would have been nice, but I don't think a cloak here and there subtracts from the picture very noticably. And it would have been nice to see A.I. directed by the man who conceived it, instead of the overly sentimental studio guru who landed it. (We started off with a story by Phillip K. Dick, and we got Pinocchio.) On a personal note, I would like to express my surprise at the fact that, after paying full price to see A.I. during its early run, Spielberg included NO dedication or any mention at all of the man who gave him the project (not to mention immeasurable artistic insight) to begin with. I guess someone guaranteed to make a huge profit can afford to overlook a genius or two on his way up the ladder.
