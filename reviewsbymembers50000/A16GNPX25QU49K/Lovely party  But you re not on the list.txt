 I wanted to like this more than the original, and in a lot of ways, that prospect looked promising. But about 20 minutes into this masturbatory fantasy, you realize it's a one-way mirror. It's Hollywood celebrating itself.    The meta-narrative about Tess being a Julia Roberts look-alike is undeniably funny. What is not funny is Bruce Willis following her around, reminding her what good friends they are. Like the rest of the story, it would have been funny and effective enough on its own, but Soderberg just had to push that much further.   I agree with another reviewer here that it's also too long. But the indulgence is what sank it for me. It really is a flashy, extravagant party that you are pointedly not invited to. At least the first, for all its silliness, was accessible. This one's a train that left the station an hour before you got there. I'm tired of people sitting around idolizing celebrities, and for that matter, watching movies about that very habit, as if they're the only people with lives. Fortunately, many of us know better than to put our faith and attention into something so vapid, fleeting, monotonous, and plastic.   I have a life, now go find yours.
