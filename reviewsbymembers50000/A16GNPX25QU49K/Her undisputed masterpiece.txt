 This album comes off as something epic, and on the brink of madness. I think this grandeur fits her better than even the scratchy, bloody quality of Rid of Me (her earlier masterpiece, and still one of the best rock records I've ever heard.) TBYML is, I think, her best album yet. But since she is as form-shifting as clay, she may top herself yet. Stories from the City... approaches it. But she will never meld her pain, frustartion, brilliantly simplistic writing and truly outstanding voice this well again. But I will be waiting anxiously for her to do just that.
