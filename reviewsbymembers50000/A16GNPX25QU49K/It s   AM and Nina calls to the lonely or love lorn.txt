 This CD displays Nina Simone in an intentionally un-eclectic light, showcasing her ballad work. While I would recommend the PolyGram Very best of to the uninitiated, I actually prefer this album because it only includes one or two of her most popular tracks. Naturally, anyone holding a PhD in voice is going to be incredible, but this is Nina Simone. There is a tenderness on this disc that I have only fleetingly encountered elsewhere. Nina's strengths are myriad, but her balladry cuts to the quick, and this collection remains unparalelled. She has been many things, from a political activist to a showtune diva, but it's in her quieter moments that you really feel the texture and implications of the voice that has never been equaled or surpassed. It's too bad taht her best-of collections are so uniform. Not to say that I don't like her when she's rolling, but it's this CD's gentle rock that will entrance. Needless to say, I could not recommend this disc more, especially for the already established fanbase.
