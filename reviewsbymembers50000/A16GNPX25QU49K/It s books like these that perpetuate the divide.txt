 The only reason I'm reviewing this at all is that the title sounded refreshingly down-to-earth, and I'm very interested in how pop psychology and the media address the entire discourse of gender and difference.  What I got was that guys are go-for-broke hunters, and women are apathetic worriers.  And it's not even 1956 anymore.  Maybe it's time for another sexual revolution.   I'm 25 years old, a college graduate, sociable, single, told I'm attractive (and tend to agree), and sporadically sexually active.  Also like most young people, I go to bars regularly, but unlike them, date very seldomly.    That said, I consider myself "in" on the type of crowd that seems to be suggested in this book.  And yes, I have found myself "just not that into" a vast, ever-expanding number of people who may have been better off for having gotten advice like this book's title.  But I have never misled anyone or set a negative-feedback-loop trap for them.  When I want the attention of someone, why the hell should I take all the initiative?  Read: in a world of equality, equal opportunity, and equal rights, I subscribe to the notion of equal work by both parties.  I don't NEED to hound anyone to go out with me, and neither would the people I'd be interested in.  It's not some tipped-scale game; it's the exercise of pure interest.  If the contemporary view is that people are equal, then the behavior shouldn't need to play into gender expectation and role-taking.  Come on, people.  Get over it and get out of the house.  And stop reading checkout-lane flipbooks that claim to be able to explain away your deeper social shortcomings.  Stop right now.
