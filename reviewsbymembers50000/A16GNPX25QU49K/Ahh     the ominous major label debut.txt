 ... but it works. I was used to the Modest Mouse of This is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing to Think About and The Lonesome Crowded West, and then I got this. It's not Completely Different, but it's definitely more mainstream-oriented. But that's no problem. Modest Mouse are just uncompromising enough to mix the raw eloquence of their last albums with the layered, textured sound of The Moon and Antarctica. Since no owners of this record would read this review, (unless you're like me and study up on everyone's reactions to records you love) I strongly recommend it. If you're on the Modest Mouse page, you know you will not be sorry to buy this record as an act of defiance against those Other Bands. Modest Mouse deserves more attention. Period.
