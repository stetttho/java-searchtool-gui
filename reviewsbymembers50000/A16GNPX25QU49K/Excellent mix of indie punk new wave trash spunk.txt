 While this may seem to be only the latest addition to the genre of ever-monotonous, unfailingly overrated conveyer belt line of bands whose names begin with "The" (glaring exception-- The Shins, a wonderful band), Franz Ferdinand is an exception. True, "Franz" and "The" are two different words, but they could have easily landed in that generic cesspool of critical hype. But I think they escape it with flying colors.   Speaking of flying colors, an otherwise articulate and usually credible underground/indie website (whose name cannot be printed here) recently (meaning today) posted a clearly indifferent review of the song "Michael," the new single from the very album they otherwise loved. There is a lot of homoeroticism here, and they only seem to be comfortable with it when it is tongue-in-cheek. "Michael" holds the distinction of being the only song on the album which blatantly addresses this quality, with an insistence that makes us question whether or not it's all a joke. My question: why does it have to be? When you have a groove this infectious, with guitars that scream and circle each other like amphetamine gypsies and drums that are as stately as they are fericious, does "stubble on my sticky lips" really turn you off to the song that quickly? Or does it come just close enough to turning you on?   The album, I agree, can sound a little monotonous on the first few listens. But unlike Is This It, this album got better with each listen.   The reason I wrote a review at all is that I couldn't believe there was only one review of this so far. That means not enough people have heard it. I say drop your copies of Highly Evolved and Room on Fire off at the 2nd hand CD shop, or at least donate them to someone who owns an Evanescence album, and move on.
