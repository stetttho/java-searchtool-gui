 With Beach-Boys-caliber harmonics that are playful, gorgeous, and even slightly wayward, The Magic Numbers have made 2005's best album.  Only slightly winning out over Anthony and the Johnsons' "I Am a Bird Now" and maybe the Fiona Apple album we never got to hear, this CD is a gift.  When I first heard it, it all kind of ran together, but after repeated listens, I realize that only its consistency made it seem so.  No 2 songs are alike in any way, and the music is just beautiful.  Its like what The White Stripes would have sounded like in grade school, hade they hung out with Weezer all day eating peppermints and listening to "Pet Sounds."  Amazing.
