 This is a great CD. Maybe not as great as everyone made it out to be, but definitely a solid record by a band with a much-needed sound for this otherwise mostly pathetic musical period. It sounds a little like the Velvet Underground, but that's not the first comparison I would have made.. (wishful thinking?).  My only problem with this album is that after a few listens, it is a LITTLE monotonous. It's not that it all sounds the same, but it does all sound like different versions of about 3 different songs. You know what......... nevermind all that. There's no need to criticize a band who is at least trying to forge ahead and have a unique sound, which is something they accomplish brilliantly. I just can't wait to hear where they go from here... they already have MY attention, so give them yours.
