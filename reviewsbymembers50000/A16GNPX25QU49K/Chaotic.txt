 Having missed Radiohead this summer due to a badly-timed rainstorm in the Baltimore/DC area, I was apprehensive about buying this in the first place. I didn't want to hear what I had missed ealier this year. Well, I heard it. It's great, of course.  No storm could have proven a match for Radiohead's violent, sharp-edged renditions of these eight songs. For those of you who think that there's no way the same moods could be captured live that were captured on Kid A and Amnesiac... well... you're right. What you have here is something different. It's a visceral, raw-sounding band who doesn't hit every note perfectly and actually doesn't care to.  Everything is sped up to maximum velocity. The National Anthem, aggressive enough on Kid A, comes off live like a derailed train. I Might Be Wrong, which was so controlled and tight on Amnesiac, gets a faster, harder treatment here. Even Everything In Its Right Place, so consciously subdued on Kid A, jams along with a drumline that wasn't there before, and the last 2 minutes of the song are just loops and loops of Thom's  voice echoing backward and forward and up and down. The biggest change on the record is Like Spinning Plates. It's done without the spiraling synthesizer effects of the Amnesiac version, and to great effect. In its place is a layered, gentle piano number that works beautifully. And finally, the inclusion of True Love Waits is something fans who know what they're talking about have been waiting for since about 1999. I just wish Lift had also been included (will we EVER get to own this song??). Overall, it's a great EP for diehards, since no one else will care enough to listen, and we like that just fine.
