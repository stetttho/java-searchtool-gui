 It has been a while since I've read anything by Jim Harrison, and after reading this book, I can't quite remember why it's been so long.  Harrison is an amazing wordsmith, and his stories are very engaging, in a hedonistic, manly kind of way.  The Beast God Forgot to Invent is a compilation of three novellas, each about different men at interesting points in their lives.The title novella is about a retired book dealer who is charged with the task of describing the last days of his brain-damaged, womanizing friend, Joe, to the coroner...This book has definitely inspired me to continue reading Jim Harrison's works.  I encourage you to pick this book up.  It's an enjoyable read, interspersed with profound truth.
