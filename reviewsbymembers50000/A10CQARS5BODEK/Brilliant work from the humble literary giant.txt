 At the risk of sounding clich, I have to say that Murakami never ceases to amaze me.  The Elephant Vanishes is actually a book made up of 17 distinct stories, several of which have previously been published in publications as varied as �The New Yorker� and Playboy.�  A reader would be hard-pressed to determine what the common thread is throughout the stories in this book other than Murakami�s own exploration of the mundane and dark corners of his soul.  Many of the stories in The Elephant Vanishes are mere snapshots of the protagonists� lives.  Others are amazing realities created by Murakami�s amazing imagination.  Whether commonplace or extraordinary, Murakami tells each story in a beautiful and convincing manner.  While the characters in his stories never accomplish anything uncommon in their own worlds, readers are taken to places they�ve never even thought about going through Murakami�s remarkable story-telling abilities.  I highly recommend this book.
