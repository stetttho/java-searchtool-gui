 Ryotaro Shiba has a dramatic, almost hypnotic way of relaying the life of the last shogun, who relinquished his title almost as soon as he received it. Keiki, as he is known throughout the majority of the book, is an interesting character -- hard-headed, determined, wise, and eloquent.  From his birth into the Mito clan until his ascension to the title of shogun, he was assisted or hampered by various subterfuges. His father, Nariaki, had believed from Keiki's early youth that he would become shogun and worked diligently to put him in a position to attain that goal.  Many anti-Mito groups, however, worked toward the very opposite goal of ostracizing him from the bakufu (military government).  Many died in helping him, and many died in hindering him.  Once in the ultimate seat of power during the reign of the Tokugawas, Yoshinobo showed his great wisdom by relinquishing Japan's governing power back to the Emperor, launching Japan into the modern world.  Thus, roughly 300 years of self-determined isolation for Japan ended. Ryotaro Shiba does an excellent job of providing all of the pertinent information, but he does an even better job of engaging the reader in the life and inner-workings of Keiki.  If he does as good a job with other figures in Japanese history, I can't wait until future translations are released.  For history that reads like fiction, this is the perfect book.
