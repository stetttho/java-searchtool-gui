 Don't let the cover of this book turn you off.  While it is about the author's experiences in the martial arts, it is not a martial arts book per se.  It's not about technique.  There aren't 100 pictures showing various stances, blocks, and throws. Mr. Twigger talks about his life during this period, the wonderful characters he meets along the way, and the grueling demands of the Tokyo Riot Police training course.  He writes in a language that is engaging and witty.  I found that I was laughing at his characterizations and wincing in pain at his descriptions of the impact this training had on his body.  If you are expecting a book on aikido techniques, or you're confused by the title and think this is a book about using bleach in your laundry, you will be disappointed.  If, however, you would like to read the memoirs of an English poet engaged in some of the most brutal training around ... if you want to be introduced to characters you instantly feel an affinity for ... if you just want an engaging book that you can't put down ... you'll love this book.
