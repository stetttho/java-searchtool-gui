 This book is truly a rare read.  I've been looking to purchase it (at a reasonable price) for some time now, and I finally found a copy.  But I must say that the anticipation of the reading experience was greater than the actual reading experience itself.  The majority of the book is dedicated to Jack Hoban's personal take on the state of affairs present in the late 80's, when this book was written.  In fact, very little of the first two-thirds of the book has anything to do with the history, philosophy, or ethics of the ancient ninja ... or even the current Bujinkan organization as a whole.   Hoban briefly mentions the history of the ninja, which includes how their way of life compared to the rest of Japanese society.  And the last one-third of the book, concerning the physical aspects of warriorship, is really one of the best explanations of taijutsu written (which is why I give the book 3 stars). But the rest of the book contains Hoban's take on our free-market society, laissez-faire, democracy, the impending doom of our society if government is allowed to attain more control of our lives, the role that government should play in regards to a free society, and a lot of other conservative political ideals.  Don't get me wrong. It's not that I don't agree with Jack Hoban's ideas, but that's not what I bought the book for, and that's not what the title suggests.  I could've bought a Rush Limbaugh book and a Hatsumi Sensei book for what I paid for this book and would've gotten what I was expecting.  But, I now own the book.  And if our free-market society persists, perhaps in a few decades, I can sell it for a large profit. :)
