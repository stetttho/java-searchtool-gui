 This is an excellent first-hand account of the concentration camps of World War II; however, not the concentration camps that most of us are familiar with.  These were the camps of America's creation, built to house and isolate its very own citizens.  It is the story of one Japanese-American family's imprisonment in Tanforan and then Topaz camps shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor.   Both Issei (first-generation immigrants to America) and Nisei (second-generation Japanese-Americans who had known no other home than America) were herded into poorly constructed barracks in the middle of the desert.  Yet, as Uchida retells, they all faced this unspeakable act of their government with a dignity and patience that few individuals could maintain, much less a whole segment of a population.  It is a story that would be difficult for most to tell without a tone of righteous indignation.  Uchida, however, lets the story create the reaction and inspire us to say (hopefully) that we will never let this happen again.
