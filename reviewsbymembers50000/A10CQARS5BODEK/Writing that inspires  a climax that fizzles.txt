 Despite what I'm about to write in this review, let me just state up front that I would highly recommend this book. Now to the task of dissecting Anne Rice's third installment of The Vampire Chronicles. Queen of the Damned further supports my belief that Anne Rice is one of the finest writers of our time.  Despite the length of her books, she doesn't fill them up with useless verbiage.  Her descriptions are concise but effect.  The remainder of her writing is comprised of effective dialogue, compelling internal monologue, and enthralling action. As Rice takes us through 6,000 years of history, we're drawn into each time period through well-placed historical facts (or theories). But, of course, the most important aspect of these trips through history is the world that Rice has created, in which vampires and spirits exist.  We have the additional benefit in this book of seeing this world through the eyes of multiple characters, as they tell the evolving tale of Akasha and the twins. Despite this tremendous foundation on which to build her plot, Rice falls just short of a rousing success in this story's culmination.  400 pages are spent leading up to the ultimate clash of the immortals, but if you blink, you'll nearly miss what happens.  I'm not surprised that the movie (which I ashamedly admit I've seen) didn't have the same ending. I believe that Rice must've known she failed in the climax, because the denouement of the book lasts for roughly 40 pages, as Lestat seeks to fully grasp and understand what happened.  Overall, the book is outstanding.  The story is well-composed ... so well-composed, in fact, that it can exist regardless of the ending.
