 Yoshikawa is a master of developing characters throughout this fantastic novel.  Not only does he adequately cover the development of Miyamoto Musashi into Japan's greatest swordsman, but he shows how Musashi's fate was intertwined with some of Japan's most notable figures (specifically  Takuan Soho and Yagyu Munenori).  I would recommend this book without  reservation to anyone who has an interest in Japanese culture, history, and  relationships.
