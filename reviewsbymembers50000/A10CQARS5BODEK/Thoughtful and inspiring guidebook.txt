 In Celebration of Discipline, Foster has provided a well-written guide to help Christians enhance their relationship with God.  He breaks the book down into three major sections: the Inward, Outward, and Corporate disciplines.  The disciplines covered are meditation, prayer, fasting, study, simplicity, solitude, submission, service, confession, worship, guidance, and celebration.   For the most part, this book is a great starting point.  Foster backs up each of his statements not only with Biblical references, but also with quotations from Christianity's most prominent writers and thinkers. I found, however, that he falls just short of providing a complete picture of each discipline.  Often additional time is required of the reader to research the writings that are quoted. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to move forward in his or her relationship with God.
