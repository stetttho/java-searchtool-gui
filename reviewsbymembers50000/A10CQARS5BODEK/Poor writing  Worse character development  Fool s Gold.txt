 Okay.  Come on people. Don't be blinded by the fact that this book was written by Anne Rice. Not everything she lays her hand to is golden.   If anything, this book should prove that she does not have the "Midas Touch."  It's obvious by this attempt that Rice believes she has a magic formula, into which she can plug any story, any character, and get positive results This book was a paltry attempt to bring a new character into the realm of the beautiful undead. Quinn is the typical Rice vampire - handsome and beautiful, androgynous in both appearance and sexual preference, educated, loves art, classical music, literature, and culture ... wait a second. Does this sound familiar? Why, Quinn is the modern-day version of Lestat, and Marius, and Armand, ... shall I go on? In short, if you are reading this book to catch a glimpse of a new vampire, you'll be sorely disappointed. He is the same vampire as all of them, with a different name. Obviously Rice has run out of ideas. The main character aside, the story is a great disappointment.  Ninety percent of the book is wasted on covering the background of Quinn, which could have been covered in 100 pages or so.  It is absolute drudgery through Rice's boring concept of elegance.  The story's climax and "resolution" are finally reached in the last 30 pages of the book, but quite honestly even these were a flash in the pan, an absolute waste of energy.  I had hoped that "Blood and Gold" was Rice's last failure, but apparently it wasn't.
