 Every culture has its heroes and legends, its folk tales and myths.  In this book, Tom Brown, Jr. presents the legend of Stalking Wolf, Brown's own mentor and teacher in the ways of the scout, who is affectionately referred to as Grandfather.   In "Grandfather," Brown reveals how Stalking Wolf received the gift of communicating with spirits and how that eventually led to his training as a scout and a shaman in his Apache tribe. In the decades that followed his training, as he roamed North, Central, and South America, Stalking Wolf learned the many vital lessons (often at the point of death) that he would eventually pass on to Brown as a child. This book has been criticized for being overly-sentimental as well as for presenting Stalking Wolf as a near-deity, a legendary hero that always survives to tell the tale.  The very depths of Grandfather are not explored, and it is hard to believe that he is human at times.  But that is the beauty of this book.  Stories about great men are always embellished to the point of seeming mythical.  The goal of such stories is to inspire the reader to action, and I think Brown has accomplished this. It is a shame that much of the wisdom of the Native Americans was lost, but I'm happy that some of it has been preserved through Brown's writing.
