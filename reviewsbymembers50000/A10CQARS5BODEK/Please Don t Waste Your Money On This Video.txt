 I'm not sure what the other reviewers were thinking when they reviewed this video, but they obviously left quality out of the picture.  The "Secrets of Dim Mak" was obviously made with someone's personal camcorder by a very amateur videographer.  The sound quality is so poor that the viewer will need to turn their volume all the way up just to understand what's being said.  Random images are edited into the video and offer no significant contribution to the message.  In demonstrating some of the moves, both Montaigue and his partner disappear from the screen, leaving the viewer even less knowledgeable about the impact of the moves. I don't doubt, in the least, that Erle Montaigue knows his stuff (I own his Dim Mak Encyclopaedia), but he should've invested more into the production of this video.
