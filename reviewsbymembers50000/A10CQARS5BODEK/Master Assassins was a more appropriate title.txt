 The original title for this book was "Master Assassins," but I suppose they changed the title to something they thought would sell better.  As a student of ninpo taijutsu, I was a little disappointed to find that the protagonists were merely assassins, not the mythical ninja.  But, that disappoinment aside, I have to admit that I was drawn in to the story by the author's wit, simplistic writing style, and interwoven plots.   Master Assassins (as I choose to call this book, out of protest more than anything) is a compilation of six short stories about Baian, a doctor and an assassin, and his counterpart, Hikojiro, whom Baian trained as an assassin.  The two of them travel around Edo, Kyoto, and other villages, fulfilling contracts taken out on people the world would be better without -- rapist ronins, cruel bureaucrats, evil samurai, etc.  Surprising twists in the plot keep the reader enticed and enthralled, and I often found myself reading until very late, just to get to the end of the story.  Warning: if you're looking for a thick, literary masterpiece, I'd recommend that you keep reading Eiji Yoshikawa books.  But if you're interested in an entertaining book with easily read text (minus a couple of translation errors here and there), pick this book up.  You'll be through with this 184-page page-turner in no time at all.
