 Stephen K. Hayes has done what so many other authors and screen writers have failed to do -- he's managed to tell a compelling story about the ninja without raising them to the level of mythic beings or dropping them to the level of incompetent street thugs. It's really too bad that this book went out of publication, especially since Ninjamania rubbish, like the movie "9 Death of the Ninja," is still in circulation.  I'm not saying that this is the best book I've every read, but compared to Sho Kosugi's completely inaccurate portrayals of the ninja, this book is a masterpiece.  If you can find this book ANYWHERE, you truly need to purchase it, new or used or in a file folder on loose-leaf paper. It took me about 6 months to find, and I'm extremely satisfied with the purchase.   The storyline flows very well, and Mr. Hayes offers a unique perspective of the traditional views of good and evil, antagonist and protagonist. The only weakness I can see in this book, which may in part account for its lack of current publication, is that any reader without some cursory knowledge of ninjutsu and its terminology may be easily confused.  At times, especially in the combat scenes, the reader really needs to have a grasp on what the significance of each strike is.  Otherwise, this is the kind of book the ninja community needs more of, now that we've had time to recover from the Ninjamania of the 80's. Great job, Mr. Hayes!!  Gambatte!
