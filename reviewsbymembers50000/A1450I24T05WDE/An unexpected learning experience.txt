 I purchased this book only as a guide for home use. I practice BKS Iyengar's method twice a week in a class setting and I wanted to practice at home to better my postures. I thought I would only use this book in order to remember the many asanas, but found it to be a spontaneous learning experience. The Mehtas are highly knowledged in Iyengar Yoga and have managed to bring unexpected change to my life.
