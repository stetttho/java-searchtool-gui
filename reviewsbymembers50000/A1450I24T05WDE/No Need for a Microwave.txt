 This recipe collection is perfect for the gourmand who doesn't have a lot of time or energy to cook. The food is not only innovative and fast, as the title attests, it is also simple, fresh and healthy.  Hay has organized this collection down by cooking times: 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes. I am by no means a seasoned homecook, so these times are very approximate to me. But to be honest, these recipes are so fun that I don't really notice the time. Yes, that's right, I said *fun*. I suspect that this book is most appropriate for someone who lives along the Pacific Rim. Asian cuisine has a significant influence on many of the recipes and a person living in the Midwestern United States might not have access to some of the ingredients. Otherwise, Hay has a global perspective: you will find innovations on Italian, French, Indian, and (even) Scandinavian cuisine.  I also feel that you will get the most bang out of this book if you shop at a market that offers gourmet foods. Rocket (or arugula), among other items that you will not find at a typical supermarket, is a prevalent ingredient here. I don't mean to sound esoteric in my review, but as I stated early on, this is a book for gourmands, ie people who are heartily interested in food and drink. Speaking of drink, my only suggestion to better this book would be the addition of a section on table wines.
