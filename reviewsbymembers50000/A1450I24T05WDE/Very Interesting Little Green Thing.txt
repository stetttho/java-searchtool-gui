 I found this very compelling little utencil at the grocery store and couldn't resist it. Even though it looks so cute and calls itself an avocado tool, it's actually a very strong and versatile cooking utencil. I've scrambled eggs with it and used it to keep the eggs aerated while cooking. I've smashed celery root with it. I've used it to deep fry. Someday I might even use it to make guacamole! It's made of sturdy construction and its nylon material will be safe with non-stick cookery. I also love its fresh color and chunky handle.
