 Apartment living can be so frustrating. Your surroundings are unchangable, so they tend to dictate your life. It's tough to express your personal style within the confines of Navajo White walls and tan spreckled Linoleum! There is also the issue of storage -- rather the lack of it. Additionally, your furnishings have to be easily broken down and carried, since a move is always imminent. To sum it up, the act of decorating one's apartment has its own set of problems and "Architectural Digest" does not have the answers. Michael and her friends, on the other hand, do. This book is rich in photographs of apartments of various sizes, styles, and income brackets. On the surface, there are many different styles of decor pictured: from Chinois to French Flea to Deco to Space Age. But this book is not just a sum of pretty pictures; Michael includes tips on decorating, space planning, storage, entertaining, and so on. She also sprinkles in some great "before and afters", my favorite being the miniscule kitchen with the disgusting 1970's laminate cupboards transformed into a sweet, bright 1950's cutie with not much more than fresh paint and new fixtures. She also offers instructions for making a few of the decorative elements found within the photography, such as minimalist box shelves for your collectibles and a theatrical cornice.  If you grow weary of apartment dwelling and need some instant and inexpensive inspiration, I highly recommend this book. I keep it handy for when things get stagnate around here and, as another reviewer wrote, my 2 year old copy is dog-eared. I just hope that Michael comes out with a new edition... and soon!
