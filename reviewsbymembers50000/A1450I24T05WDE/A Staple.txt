 This book came to me by word-of-mouth and I've told two friends and they've told two friends and so on and so on... I have nothing but love for Ina and this book, which should be a staple in every homechef's collection, right next to "The New Basics". I make the roast chicken EVERY WEEK now: my boyfriend simply is not happy without this new ritual. My only alteration is that I have the butcher cut the chicken up for me. I also highly highly highly recommend the roasted brussel sprouts: sheer earthy green heaven.
