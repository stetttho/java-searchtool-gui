 I've kicked my rating up one additional star for this one reason: I have been doing this tape everyday for 2 weeks and I can truly see and feel the difference. My stomach, waist, and hips are getting stronger by the day and are visibly more slim. My pants are definitely baggier in these areas and I can see definition in my stomach, and this is after only 2 weeks. Also, I feel stronger in these areas as well as my thighs. Much less joint pain and creaking going on down there, as well. The most signifigant aspect of this rapid improvement is that *you do not break a sweat when you do this workout*. Additionally, it's short, approx. 20 minutes, so I don't feel as though I'm wasting any part of my schedule by doing it. Another bonus is that you don't need any special workout gear, clothes, shoes, scary contraptions, etc. It's just you, the mat, and Ana. I do have one recommendation for new users: get yourself one of those sticky mats that we use for yoga. The Living Arts company, the very same group that puts out this video, has one. Also, be certain to get Brooke Siler's book in order to understand the poses to their fullest. That's all I have to say. I just love this workout.
