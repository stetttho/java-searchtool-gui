 After about 4 weeks of Caban's Mat Based Workout for Beginner's, I have stepped up to her intermediate version. First of all, if you are new to pilates do not attempt this tape without first doing the beginner's tape. There are several poses in this workout that are the same as those in the beginner's, but as more advanced versions. It's important that you should learn the beginning versions first in order to understand exactly how the poses are executed. As for the intermediate workout, it's wonderful. There are a series of poses where you are not allowed to rest your head back in between each one. This is where you will really start to feel that powerhouse at work. The side poses feature new exercises that tone your waist moreso than the beginner workout. Ana's trusty sidekick is back, as well. However, she does not give as many simplified examples. In case of emergency, I go back to the old beginner poses. This time, you go much further with the teaser. If you've been doing the beginner workout religiously, fear not, you CAN do it.  Yes, the production value of this video is pretty bad. But don't let that hold you back from a fabulous workout by a wonderful instructor.
