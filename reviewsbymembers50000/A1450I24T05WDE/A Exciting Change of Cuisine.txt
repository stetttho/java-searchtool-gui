 I bought this cookbook on impulse (okay, because of the cover) and have used its recipes quite frequently since. First of all, since I mention its cover, I have to say that the photography is rich and beautiful and pays great homage to this cuisine. Each recipe has its corresponding photo plus step-by-step photographs of its preparation, which I felt might be overkill, but actually helpful when dealing with ingredients and techniques that I've never met before. I found unusual ingredients in this book such as ackee, cassava, chayote, taro, green bananas, and salt cod. I took this as an opportunity to try foods that I have never tried before. Such an opportunity is something that I expect from a cookbook and this one certainly delivers the goods! I also appreciate the unexpected combination of ingredients in each recipe. For example one of my favorites is the Caribbean Vegetable Soup with onion, garlic, thyme, carrots, celery, green bananas, taro, red lentils, chayote, macaroni, etc. I promise you will not be disappointed! Some other favorites are the Coconut Jumbo Shrimp, the Mango, Tomato & Red Onion Salad, the Creole Fish Stew, the Pork Roasted with Herbs, Spices & Rum (very rich!), BBQ Jerk Chicken, and last but not least, the Peanut Chicken. One more thing to add, if you are trying to incorporate more fish into your diet, this book is for you. Though the fish section is heavy on the shellfish, you will find 4 delicious recipes included for snapper, trout, and salmon. Enjoy!
