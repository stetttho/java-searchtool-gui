 This is a great intro for the uninitiated. Used as a companion to Siler's "The Pilates Body", you will have a nice, all-around beginner's workout. Caban moves quickly through the poses, so the book is a good idea if you want to spend more time understanding exactly what is going on.  The bonus is that one of Caban's students accompanies her to exhibit a simplified version of the workout. I switch back and forth between both versions, depending on the pose. The workout is short, approx. 30 minutes, because it only covers the core of Pilates method. These poses will carry on throughout, from beginning to advanced, so it is important to understand these well. I will definitely be doing this everyday for 3 more weeks, then I will move on up to the intermediate tape.
