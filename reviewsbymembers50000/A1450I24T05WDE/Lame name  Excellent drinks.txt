 Everything about this book of 101 cocktail recipes is on point, except for the title. Rachel Federman has done her homework and produced a set of recipes that will surely impress your friends. I love the pocket-size of it, so I can take it to the liquor store or to the bar.  These aren't stuffy drinks. These are caramel martinis and chocolate-covered strawberries and london fogs. Variations on themes like Shirley Temple Blacks and blueberry mojitos. They're as much fun to make as they are to drink.  This collection is so big on creativity that I've conjured a few of my own recipes as well as morphed a few of the oldies. Instead of mixing cream into a Brandy Alexander, pour over a scoop of vanilla ice cream, grate fresh nutmeg on top, and call it a Randy Alexander! I really hope Rachel continues her research and comes out with more editions!
