 Not exactly sure if this is the same model number but my wife bought me a Remington with this same "cleaning station" setup. The cleaning station broke down after approx 6 weeks and the metal parts that were submerged in the alcohol/oil mix had actually rusted out. The shaver itself was the most uncomfortable I have ever used and drew blood and made my neck look red and angry more often than not. I dumped this overpriced gimmick for a $38 Norelco and I swear my face jumped for joy that day.
