 Not too sure what sets the sensor off as my air quality has gone from one bar (very good) to max bars (horrible) with fan automatically running on high and I don't know why. Cat broke wind perhaps? Anyway, I set it on whisper mode at night (sensor off) and it is "white noise" quiet to both my wife and I. We don't need to increase the TV volume because of it. I guess it is working well - the air smells fresh and neither one of us awakens with sinus or eye problems since getting it. As allergy sufferers, it was a small expense for some springtime relief.
