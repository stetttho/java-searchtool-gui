 I have wanted one of these most of my adult life, especially when I needed it and didn't have anyone to help me. I always assumed (correctly) that it was more expensive. When I "stumbled" across the WM 225 at the Amazon price with FREE shipping on this fairly heavy object - it was a done deal. Mine arrived in perfect condition much faster than the Super-Saver option allowed for. Wood, PVC, hacksaw, circular saw, glue - I have found my WM to be a new best friend. My wife sees me carrying it between garage and basement and knows that I'm finally attacking my "honey-do" list. Wish I'd bought it years ago. Thanks Amazon for a great price on a great product delivered.
