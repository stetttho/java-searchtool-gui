 It was recommended to me and I don't like to question the taste or intelligence of friends, but I honestly could not finish it. I saw characters doing things that rang so false that I wondered what the heck Haggis was thinking. Then I remembered his Million Dollar Baby work and it made more sense. He doesn't go for reality - he goes for the message, and twists reality in service of that. It was especially ironic that the carjacker was played by a rapper named "ludacris". It's an apt description for much of the behavior in this contrived setup. As far as Best Picture Oscars go, Crash might even be a poorer choice than American Beauty.
