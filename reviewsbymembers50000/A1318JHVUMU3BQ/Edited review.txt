 Where the carafe shows the 12 cup line is where you should fill it to, no more. There is a hole on the back of the unit and if you overfill the maker it will drain out of there. That is why some people complain about wet counter tops... they didn't figure out that this unit is *not* one of those that counts the top of the carafe as an "extra" cup. We love ours, and find that it brews great coffee and keeps it hot (finally!). We don't even need to keep the warmer plate set on its highest setting. Looks retro cool - we have the red one - and always gets a comment from guests.
