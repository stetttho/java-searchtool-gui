 My wife started dropping hints about the Shark, and need for a cordless in general for hardwood & linoleum. After (thankfully) doing my homework on Amazon, I talked her into the Boss instead. She loves it, and I must say the downstairs is getting vacuumed more often than I ever expected. We have several black mat type rugs and no amount of sweeping or clapping against the deck rail would get them spotless... but now they are. I can walk barefoot through the house w/o particles sticking to my feet. We have the Hoover upstairs (for deep pile carpet) permanently now - no lugging means that the upstairs gets vacuumed more often too - a double bonus!
