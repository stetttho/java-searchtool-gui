 My experience is that this Auto Feed trimmer IS indeed a string hungry monster. I would have given it 5 stars otherwise. Fortunately, hand winding a reload is a fairly fast & simple proposition. I cannot recommend highly enough to buy the largest roll (for economy) of bulk string refill you can find. The reason I probably gobble more string than some other reviewers is because I do use it as designed, to edge along concrete as well as clear flora from along the foundation of my house. This brute actually breaks up loose cement with a loud "Ka-chunk!" (there goes a bunch of line) and keeps on whacking, so for heavy-duty operations it does garner the 5th star. Maybe with more experience I'll edge precisely and never hit the concrete at all - but in the mean time it's winding and whacking (and relaxing and admiring). I now have the best looking driveway, sidewalks & curb on my street.
