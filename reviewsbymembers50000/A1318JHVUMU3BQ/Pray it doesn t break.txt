 The local vacuum repair store with the best reputation around told me when I took in the ProHeat+ that they loathed to work on this machine and the minimum charge was $. I had no choice as I had already been on the phone with Bissell support and had tried *everything* to get the machine to spray water. Turbo brush worked fine but no floor spray or flow indicator spin. After three days they called and said "we can't get it going either. Cleaned the heater assembly and all hoses, checked pump etc." All the things I couldn't do. Said it worked with the cover off but not when properly assembled. Tried over and over. Said it would be no charge, and that they "used to be" a Bissell Authorized service facility, but they dropped Bissell. So I get on-line and find the closest authorized center and tell them my story. The man on the phone says "We hate those machines too, and Darryl (the man who worked on mine) is one of the best I know of - so if he can't fix it I wouldn't bother driving it out here". So now we get to put warm soap & water down with a garden sprayer and suck it up with our overpriced glorified vacuum cleaner. Oh by the way - this was our 6th time using it and stored it according to directions (water only). Before you buy I would seriously call your local repair center and ask them their opinion. They may rent Rug Doctors and be biased but tell them you need to buy an affordable ... machine and see what they say.
