 I can see why the engineer failed this clock, but you know what? It's still a great buy. If you're like me and really don't fiddle with them much once the time and alarms are set, then this clock has some really great amenities. Weekend Sleeper - I love it already and haven't even hit my first weekend. No turning the volume down on Friday night (if I remember) or turning it back up Sunday night (if I remember). The gentle wake is really nice too - no jarring out of bed to run and turn the thing off. It actually took three minutes for the volume to get me up but it did it so gently that it felt almost like natural waking. The sound is passable - I'm not going to rave about it like others, but then I don't listen to my clock for entertainment. Works and sounds good enough. Nice bright LED that I can sure read across the room without my glasses. It's a keeper. Now for a complaint - the people at Phillips that refurbished mine slapped a huge paper sticker right on the side of the unit itself. One of those stickers that never completely comes off after 15 minutes and generous applications of Goo-Gone. I ended up starting to remove the finish and just gave up, fairly disgusted. Oh well - I saved $20.
