 This is Norelco's most comfortable yet - and the best shaver I have used to date. I have owned Brauns and Remingtons as well as older, more expensive Norelcos and I will never overpay for a good cordless again. I didn't expect too much for this one because it was less than half what I usually paid for shavers that usually only lasted 2-3 years tops anyway (for whatever reason - there were many). If this one lasts 3 years I will be very happy.
