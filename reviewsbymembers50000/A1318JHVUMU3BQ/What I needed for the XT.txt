 I also have a Rebel 300D with a grip (and E1 handstrap), it is considerably larger than the XT w/ grip. If you have large hands the vert grip is a great addition. Learning to use the controls beyond the shutter release is recommended too  ;-) Some people I hear are still bending their wrists and using the regular release to shoot portraits even with the grip. Strange how some folks who have a grip still need to "get a grip".
