 I'm a big guy @ 6'3" and 260# and that is why I did not get the LifeGear bike I was looking at (smaller 6' reviewer said I wouldn't be able to use it). Even with this one I had to modify the extension tube by adding a drill hole to accomodate my height. The good news is the boxed tubing is heavy duty and I still feel confident even after modifying it. I exceed the max capacity by 10 lbs but the bike is solid and doesn't seem to mind at all. EZ 30 min assembly if you use your own tools. It comes prebuilt save for 12 bolts and two screws (plus you have to thread the pedals on - no sweat). I have a Stamina air resistance upright bike that was given as a gift but I don't care for the bike style seat or the noise. It nonetheless has worked flawlessly for two years of occassional use. This one, however is comfy on my fat behind and whisper silent to operate. Perfect to get me going on a regular basis.
