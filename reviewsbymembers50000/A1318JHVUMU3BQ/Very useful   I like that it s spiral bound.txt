 Dennis has basically taken the 4500 manual and laid it out in a manner which "flows" from function to function with explanations of the why accompanying the how, and gives examples, which of course the manual does not. Since I'm an amateur photographer, I give this book 4 stars for getting me up to speed that much more quickly. I like that it's spiral bound so that its large 8.5" x 11" pages lay flat so you can operate the Coolpix while you read about the functions and take test shots as you go. Thanks to Dennis I'm now ready for Peter iNova's e-Book.
