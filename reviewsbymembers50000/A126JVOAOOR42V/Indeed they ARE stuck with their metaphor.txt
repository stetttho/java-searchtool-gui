 A friend once bemoaned there being no autobiography, or biography, of Joseph Campbell. This book fills a void. For those who have watched "The Power of Myth" videos, and read several JC books, this  collection of dialogues is no disappointment.  No intimate details are  given of Campbell's life; when asked for juicy details during one session,  he responds (more or less):  "That's biography, and I don't do  biography." I was impressed with the quickness of Campbell's replies  and answers.  JC relays several anecdotes of his friends Robinson and  Zimmer, and gives honorable mention to the Bollingen Press and Sarah  Lawrence College for crucial assistance in his career development.  Particularly of interest are the frequent remarks concerning, and  discussions with, his wife (and former student) Jean Erdman. While many  of the remarks are verbatim replies heard in "The Power of Myth"  videos, some are unreleased gems: there are two kinds of people in this  world - those who know their myth is a fact (the orthodox religious) and  those who know their myth is a lie (the atheists)- both KNOW that their  myth is most certainly NOT a metaphor!  I enjoyed it.
