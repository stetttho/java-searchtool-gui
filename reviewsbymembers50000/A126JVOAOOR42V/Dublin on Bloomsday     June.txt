 Ulysses DOESN'T throw out the welcome mat. Joyce spent 7 years in its composition (1914-1921), and it took me two years to finish a thoughtful first reading (consulting numerous references meanwhile).  Ulysses refines the technique used in the Portrait of dramatic (i.e. without author's comments) presentation of plot by psychological inflection through linguistic artistry. The not inconsiderable word-play presages Finnegans Wake, - "con-trans-magnifican-jew-bang-tantiality", for starters.  As do Portrait and Wake, Ulysses redefines [?] the concept of "reading" a book. A fresh, intimately realistic atmosphere is reinforced in each chapter by successive changes in style. Juxtaposed humour and pathos, numerous levels of interconnectedness between people and events eluding definition -Plato's "intelligible sphere whose center is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere"... Mark Twain remarked that "a great book is a book everyone wants TO HAVE read and no one wants TO read". Ulysses' impeccable crafting makes it "a book to be enjoyed over and over again", as Joseph Campbell remarked.  Certainly there is something NOT realistic about the incredibly profound and intellectually pregnant reveries of the young lion Stephen Dedalus as he walks along Sandymount Shore, nor in some of the musings of Leopold Bloom. Yet it is often unclear whether these mental images are distinctly voiced or simply lapping on the shores of the characters' awareness. [If seriously interested, get Campbell's "Wings of Art".]
