 Two very gifted men, Golan Trevize & Stor Gendibal, from the First and Second Foundations, respectively, find themselves catapulted into derring-do by the machinations of their domestic political opponents. And so the tale has a certain symmetry at outset. We intuitively sense that they will eventually meet with catalytic force. Each man is convinced of a hidden power behind Galactic Events: Trevize suspects Second Foundation influence while Gendibal intuits a deeper, more elusive, insidious force. Although I enjoyed F.E.,  Asimov strains credibility in the intricate plot twists brought about by the machinations of the story's protagonists... Perhaps not, because here we are dealing with a Terminus governor (Harla Branno) presiding over a federation of planets greater in extent than the late-lamented Empire of Trantor, and Second Foundation hierarch Stor Gendibal, past-master both of Seldon's psychohistorical equations AND an additionally-developed science of titanic psionics; consequently, great and deep minds' plotting is maybe not to be marvelled at. Stor Gendibal and Branno both find themselves ultimately outmaneuvered by .... [you'll have to read the book] ... .  While I have yet to read "Forward the Foundation", it was disappointing to find that the eventual climax of the much-touted Seldon Plan does not appear to be forthcoming. This would have been a delectable volume, tying up numerous philosophical questions brought on by the broad thrust of the plot throughout the previous four volumes. (My present impression being that FTF is a regression to the early days of the Seldon Plan's incipience...) Obviously, if you've read the earlier volumes, you'll want to read this. While it was a Hugo and Nebula Award winner, it seemed no better than the earlier Foundation volumes. Which is to say, outstanding.
