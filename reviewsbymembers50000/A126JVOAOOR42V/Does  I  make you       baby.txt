 The four stars above are extremely parenthetical, as this is a book suited  for a limited audience: those already VERY familiar with the writings of  Uspenskii and Gurdjieff. The great expositor of Uspenskii, Nicoll brought  on board material not only from Jung but also from the New Testament, where  "repentance" is translated from the Greek "metanoia" -  "change of thinking". The four pillars of THE WORK are: 1.  self-remembering 2. self-observation 3. non-identification 4.  non-expression of negativity (If you don't know what these signify, you  don't need these volumes. Go read Uspenskii's "4th Way".) The  tenets are the same as found in all religons read gnostically: man as we  know him, and as we are each of us constituted, lacks a central, permanent,  unchangeable "I". This is the basis of Zen, alchemy... all  mystical traditions. This curious psychological truth is exactly what  constitutes the force of "loving one's enemies" - one is  displaying a tour de force of psychological freedom par excellence. THE  WORK is a respectable business nowadays. It is perhaps a little dangerous  for those lacking a sufficient background in subjects arcane, as the  elegant power and demonstrable truth of its tenets easily overwhelm the  uninitiated. These commentaries are an excellent exegesis.
