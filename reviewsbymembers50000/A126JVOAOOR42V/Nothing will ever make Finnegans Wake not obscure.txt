 The author has tightly focused his attention on the SLEEP aspects of the  Wake. While this makes for a rather monochromatic presentation bordering  the banal, the clarity and sheer thrust of the presentation are  indisputable. (At bottom, one really doesn't like to admit there's so much  IN the Wake that such restrained scholarship is required.)  [from the  text, pp.4-7]: "Suppose we charged ourselves with the task of  providing in chronological order a detailed account of everything that  occurred to us NOT last night...but in the first half-hour of last night's  sleep. The 'hole affair' [535.20], (and a 'hole', unlike a 'whole', has no  content), will likely summon up a sustained 'blank memory' [515.33]: 'You  wouldn't should as youd remesner, I hypnot' [360.23-24]. What would become  equally obscure, even questionable, is the stability of identity...No one  remembers the experience of sleep at all as a sequence of events linked  chronologically in time by cause and effect." Joyce remarked to his  friend William Bird: "'About my new work - do you know, Bird, I  confess I can't understand some of my critics, like Pound or Miss Weaver,  for instance. They say it's OBSCURE. They compare it, of course, with  ULYSSES. But the action of ULYSSES was chiefly in the daytime, and the  action of my new work takes place chiefly at night. It's natural things  should not be so clear at night, isn't it now?'"
