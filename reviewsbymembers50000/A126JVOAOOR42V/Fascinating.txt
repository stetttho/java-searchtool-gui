 Atherton's book is "absotively" wonderful. I would agree that APPRECIATING the Wake certainly requires this book. Numerous influences  from various authors are catalogued. Particularly interesting is the  relatively lengthy section on Lewis Carroll's influence on Joyce.   *Carroll is presumably the undisputed inventor of the portmanteau word:  a word with multiple meanings. Carroll was content to have dual meaning  while Joyce packed as many meanings as possible into his words. *Carroll  also worked with successive alterations of one letter in a word: meat,  meet, mate, maze, etc.. Sections of the Wake which referenced Carroll would  routinely incorporate this technique. *Alice also served as an alterego  for ALP, where "Wonderlawn" = the Garden of Eden. In short,  Joyce found lots in Carroll's work which, (in the case of the portmanteau  word, to his surprise), neatly "dovetallied" with his own  "work in progress". BATW is a fascinating and well-written  collection of many more such analyses, (Shakespeare, Blake, Vico, etc...)  and does not promote tooth decay.
