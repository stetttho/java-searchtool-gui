 As usual, Taylor's highly sympathetic inveighing adds a considerable  amount of charm to a classic pagan text. And if you want familiarity with  high paganism, this book should be on your list. The crucial issue  explored here is THEURGY: as Taylor remarks, it appears to be an element of  religion which has become lost to us moderns. Theurgists presumably were  able, through long years of training, to invoke deities. One is reminded of  "the communion of saints" notion in the Apostles' Creed. A very  humorous technique employed by Iamblichus is to set up the text as a  dialogue-by-mail from the Greek mystic Prophyry to the Egyptian priest  Anebo; the Greek's assertions and questions are followed by the Egyptian's  replies. And as the Egyptians considered themselves far superior to the  Greeks in matters philosophical, it comes as no surprise at all that the  Egyptian corrects the Greek on every occasion! "It must be granted  that there are gods" Porphyry opens.  "Not so", counters  the Egyptian. "An innate knowledge of the Gods is built into the very  fabric of our very being, and so to frame the question thus, as though it  could be disputed, is in error." (This of course is a throwback to  "The Divine Pymander" in which it is asserted that 'whatever can  be seen, has a creator'.) My advice - You should probably get a copy of  Manly P. Hall's taped lecture on this text from the Philosophical Research  Society, Los Angeles, CA, if you really want to appreciate this  mind-expanding work.
