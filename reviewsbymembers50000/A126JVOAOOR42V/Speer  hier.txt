 I actually met Albert Speer in 1970, shortly after the book was released, in his hometown of Heidelberg, Germany... I was just ten, and although I  had read some of the book and understood generally what the Nazi agenda was  about, he nevertheless struck me as a wonderfully kind, grandfatherly-like  figure... He still had a great interest in architecture, and his study -  panelled in dark wood - had numerous architectural drawings cubby-holed  along the wall above his desk. When we mentioned an upcoming road trip to  Italy, he recommended a visit to Paestum, Italy; he called it "the  greatest example of Magna Graecia architecture on the Italian  mainland". Back then, no one had heard much about it... What we saw  weeks later when we arrived on a beautiful summer day was a fabulous temple  to Poseidon, set alone in the rolling Italian countryside, with only an  ice-cream vendor and a few passers-by in parked Fiats to admire it... Of  all the Germans of that era, I think Speer speaks most modernly. Originally  an architect, later Hitler's Armaments Minister and "best  friend", Speer successfully managed to retain an intelligent, detached  psychological centre throughout the Nazi phenomenon. He was in a position  to know all the major players in the Nazi hierarchy and, from his  vantagepoint as Armaments Minister, to become widely acquainted with  strategic and important domestic issues, decisions, and  controversies. The book is illustrated with a nice assortment of  representative photographs, drawings by Hitler, and models of the proposed  huge building programs which were to be commenced at the victorious  establishment of the post-war "thousand-year Reich". I have  read this book time and again; the style is not only tolerable but  engaging. An important first-hand account of the foibles and eccentricities  of the Nazi bureaucracy. Recommended without reservation.
