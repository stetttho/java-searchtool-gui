 Again, another Zelazny bar-setter. There is something infectiously gravitational about Z's prose; I find myself fleshing out his ideas, images, and references for him during the read. The "grabber"  is the opening scene, in which we find we know as much about the  protagonist, Corwin, and his condition, as he does. As the storyline  develops, the reader is pulled more and more into an emotional  identification with him. The lovable, (Han Solo-ish) rogue is what this  fellow represents, and as he possesses demigod-like powers, "the hits  just keep on coming": incredible battles, recoveries from unstoppable  adversity, opportunistic sex - in short, just what you expect from  Zelazny. I went through a whole afternoon, and several mugs of coffee, at  a bookshop reading this thing through, after I picked it up as  inadvertently as stepping on a landmine. Hard to put down, it is both an  enjoyable and enthusiastic read. And, of course, it's just the first volume  of the Amber Chronicles!
