 As a devotee of alchemy - particularly its spiritual and philosophical connotations - which I first encountered via the work of Manly P. Hall ~ 20 years ago, this book immediately fascinated me at the outset of my Wake  trek five years ago in Chicago. With high hopes, I purchased a copy. It  was something of a let-down for me, anticipating something more rigorous,  given the broad range of attack on the Wake which a study of alchemy can  deliver. There are the obvious analyses of the Wake's obligatory  alchemical references, handled judiciously, if not with inspiration. And  this, I must suppose, is my difficulty with the text. The book reads much  like an uninspired Master's thesis: the bases are covered, broad  inescapable outlines are delineated, but there's just this nagging feeling  that, given the complexity of the two subjects, the author assumed that  anything further would be either lost on the reader - unlikely given the  recondite nature of the topic - or few people would question the narrow  range of conclusions delivered... and I read, and read, in vain hopes for  inspired insights. Instead, the book reads rather lyrically; the author's  conventional treatment of alchemy reminds me of Jowett's handling of  Plato's Timaeus: uninspired and pedestrian. (In fact, the book left me  seriously considering writing my own humble, hephaestian version of this  fascinating topic.) Three stars for being the only currently available  reference, and a suitable gloss on this important topic for the mildly  curious.  Specific gripe: a thorough recital of the tenets and symbols of  alchemy, and a rigorous, tabular account of their correspondences with  Wakean themes is lacking. Also, a tying-in of the guiding lights of alchemy  and their appearance throughout the text might have been attempted.  If  you have to find out about this topic, a good start. (For a more luminous  and rigorous account, wait for my book...)
