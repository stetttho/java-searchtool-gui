 I've studied group theory - CHEMISTS' group theory, not the strictly mathematical variety - three times: once as an undergraduate and twice as a postgraduate. This book is, (or perhaps it's "was" now? - I've not looked at another book on group theory since buying this one), an ideal way to learn how to apply group theory to spectral interpretation. I picked up my copy in Scotland back in 1993 for the rather outrageous sum of( ) . But it was an inspired purchase.  I ALWAYS use Davidson's book when approaching this subject. The presentation is very clear: symmetry elements and operations, groups, matrices (primarily useful for computer simulations), spectroscopy, etc.. Already familiar with the Woodward-Hoffman rules, I found the final chapter, "Orbital Symmetry and Chemical Reactions", neither very clear nor helpful.  Each chapter ends with a series of questions (answers in back) of what you've just been presented. And of course there are character and correlation tables appended. The comparison of Raman and IR spectral data is well-covered, as are the construction of molecular orbital energy level diagrams. Numerous examples include trans-butadiene, octahedral metal complexes, nitrite and carbonate ions, etc... Cotton's book on this topic, though considered a classic, strikes me always more of a virtuosic acrobatic performance directed to academic colleagues than the assistance of tyros in mastering this recondite topic. While "Group Theory for Chemists" may be pejoratively referred to as "a bit rule of thumb" by old alchemists, I would recommend it not only to beginners but to all desiring a clear presentation considerate of the reader.
