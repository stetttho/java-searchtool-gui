 OPENING SCENE: Henry the Proud knowingly, cold-bloodedly and methodically demolishes an innocent welfare family before a jury...  CLOSING SCENE:  Henry the Humble graciously and sincerely assists this family...  Really  enjoyable, like 'Rainman' there is humor and alot of innocence. Innocence  comes across better when its vehicle is an adult rather than a child; it's  rarer and more noticeable. My favorite character is the physical  therapist, Bradley, who teaches Henry to walk, talk, and even think again  following his trauma. On their strolls around the sanitarium, Bradley is  always ogling, in a very politically-incorrect sort of way, the cute young  nurses who go walking, running or jogging by, telling the still-mute and  barely-able-to-walk Henry "I gotta get me some o' that!" It's a  little bit of 'My Fair Lady' in reverse as, after several weeks of this  operant conditioning, when a cute nurse runs past the two of them, Henry  very innocently mumbles to Bradley "Yeah, you gotta get you some o'  that" . But make no mistake, Bradley DOES have a heart of gold,  enhancing this film with his infectious joie-de-vivre... So... RH makes a  good point that we spend our lives misplacing our affections... The only  people who care about Henry before his accident are his wife and daughter,  more or less. Naturally, he spends his time with everyone else but them.  Similarly, the true-blue business associates are sadly yet predictably -  with some exceptions here - deplorable asses, after the shooting, when it  becomes apparent that Henry's situational ethics and razor-sharp mind are  no longer on tap. Ford does a very touching, lovable and convincing job  here. A very human film which nicely avoids mawkish sentimentality as we  watch a legal devil incarnate become an angel. (Oh, and by the way... The  loss of memory was caused NOT by the head wound, but by anoxia due to a  damaged subclavian artery [chest wound].)
