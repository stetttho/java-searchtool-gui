 "There's a beetle in every pudding": in this one it is, as already noted, "azzJay olicePay". Burn baby, burn!  However, and that is a BIG "however", this album is strangely moving and  poignant. "Take this Waltz", please - a landscape much of the  Finnegans Wake sort: "Vienna" is mythologized into a tour of the  human psyche. In Vienna,  "...There's a shoulder where Death comes  to cry.. ...There's a tree, where the doves go to die...". Music is  a very personal medium, much more than literature, and so one hesitates to  pontificate. But, - this CD is moving and haunting, despairing and  uplifting. It is Greek tragedy.  My remark to a few also-admiring friends  has been that IYM won't get you out of your hole, but it will make it more  bearable. It is a shade depressing; I suspect LC was going through a  breakup on several of these tunes: they FEEL so right.
