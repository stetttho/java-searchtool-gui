 Well! Have I got the show-and-tell story for you! I finished reading this  book while riding on a lo-o-ong stretch of rural interstate highway, which  I heartily commend to anyone reading this book! You'll never look at  highways the same! (see below) So... The story revolves around the notion  that out there, out on those dreary long roads and highways which we travel  daily, bored out of our minds, there are a few hidden turnoffs and exits  which those who know how to find them can access. These byways and  underpasses lead to a completely different sort of roadway: a roadway in  which Time stands still and exits now correspond to time zones measured not  in hours but in centuries. And so the book involves time travel by a  hero...  I personally do not think this book is great, - maybe just  outstanding. I did feel the ending was a little too applepie and Waltons'  Mountain for my taste. The basic premise is wunderbar, but it does read  like a great idea clothed in old pastiches from other Zelazny yarns: new  wine in old wineskins. Any way, I do recommend it and did enjoy it - picked  it up for a buck at a used bookshop. Reading time: about 5-6 funfilled  and disorienting hours.
