 The book, of course, is a classic. Heinrich Zimmer intended this book, and fortunately Joseph Campbell proved the midwife for what would otherwise have been an intellectual stillborn child, due to the former's untimely passing. My copy was a first edition hardcover: a lovely book to hold and touch.  To my thinking, this book is THE first, (and perhaps final), reference for those interested in the depths and subtleties of the Hindu tradition. I have never found a more accessible and enjoyable read on the broad topic of Indian Spirituality.  The history of Hindu religious development, and the import of its symbols, are nicely embellished throughout with the relevant Sanskrit terminology, which adds a considerable pleasure in the course of the read, especially when Zimmer describes the rich philosophical texture of these terms. One is immediately reminded of the difficult translational passage on leaving the psychologically rich Greek language for our practical, utilitarian English.  Zimmer nicely bridges this gap. Further, the reader is never at a loss to follow the scholarly exposition of ideas. The presentation nicely dovetails with Campbell's own work in comparative religion and mythology, and for anyone that appreciates his clarity and articulate manner of presentation, or has unhappily fallen back from unsuccessful attempts to appreciate the broad outlines and import of the philosophies of India, this book is simply a gem. My only proviso is that the book does become mildly tedious toward the middle, as historical minutiae begin to proliferate.  Nevertheless, if this topic interests you, be sure to consult Philosophies of India first; it is most certainly an excellent primer.
