 As usual, for those who have the sympathy and inclination, Taylor once more scores high marks for this wonderful translation of Julian's remarks contra the Christians.      The observation that stays with me was how the Christians were often very good people, but seemed terribly ignorant: theirs was not a virtue in the grand Pythagorean or Platonic/Neoplatonic style. They had amazingly simplistic and crude ideas, yet for all that, in many cases, managed a high personal level of morality. (Try having an intelligent discussion with the average modern Christian proselyte of the inherent contradictions of Petrine Christianity and its roots in paganism, and you will understand Julian's remark.)     Of course, the complement to this was how the Christians often came from the absolute lowest and most disreputable strata of society. In the pagan mysteries, according to Plutarch, Plato et al, only those who were of pure heart and highly reputable character would be permitted to enter.      A good reference, but not one of the Taylor translations that I enjoy rereading.
