 (My only complete reading of Dubliners was from this version.) 1. What makes Dubliners so amenable to an annotated edition is that it is  essentially an immediately accessible work of fiction - Joyce's only one,  (the Portrait's a little trickier).  The multiple place and character  references make up a significant portion of the narratives - lose these  settings, and you're not left with the virtuoso, stand-alone subtle  psychological complexities of either the Portrait or Ulysses to gnaw  on. 2. Is it "Margaret Mary Allicott"? I forget the spelling.  Apologies. A reference is made to her in Dubliners... Buck Mulligan refers  to her in Ulysses as "Margaret Mary ANYcock".  Without  annotations, what can you make of that? Who was she? The annotated  Dubliners points out that MMA was a figure of considerable religious  veneration in Dublin at the time. Icons of her were to be found in many  homes. She would drink only dirty washwater, and ate only the pus from her  numerous sores: Neglecting the body = Sanctity  =  turn of the century  Dublin morality [! ] The annotations permit you to enjoy not only the  bizarre character of the Zeitgeist, but also appreciate the Buck's nasty  pun. 3. My point here is that you can only appreciate these sorts of  references WITH annotations. And you can easily imagine that the instances  are numerous.  The pictures & annotations are not "a key";  rather they breathe life into a good collection of early Joycean  tales. 4. A fun copy. And remember, these stories were originally read by  people who DID understand the references and allusions.  The only  readable version of Dubliners and heartily commended to all wishing to  enjoy and appreciate these heartwarming yarns of a city's moral and  psychological twilight: paralysis, disillusionment, and collapse. Survey  sez: "Marvellous".
