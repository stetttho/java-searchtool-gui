 Having heard and seen the audio and video adaptations of this book  invariably with disgust and disappointment, it occurred to me at last that  reading it might be a good idea... The book is funny and humorous and  hysterical, (particularly after the Earth's precipitate destruction by  galactic bureaucrats). It is well-written in a very light-hearted style,  and absolutely addictive. A wonderful enjoyable romp delivering all that a  piece of light entertainment should. Reading time: about 5 hours. Highly  recommended!
