 This is the all-time hands-down winner in the ancient geometry field. Nothing comes close. Most books are simply uninformative, regurgitating ad nauseam old truisms about the golden mean and squaring the  circle.. Brunes' two volume study presents a tightly-argued and  magnificently illustrated description of the prevalence of a standard  geometrical pattern applied to works of western art and architecture  throughout the millenia. The basic procedure used a square of known  dimensions whose diagonal was subtended to the horizontal, (1:square root  of 2). This relationship was then elaborated to lay out the design of  numerous sacred sites.  The same patterns, clearly provided, are present  in works as far back as ancient Egypt up to the gothic period. Particularly  fascinating are Notre Dame de Paris, Glastonbury Cathedral, the Parthenon  and the Pyramids. Floor plans are provided with an overlay of the geometry  and discussion of the standard planning method's application. While the  significance of their method remains problematic, it would appear to have  been based on Pythagorean notions of the ability of geometrical pattern and  arithmetical canon to invoke corresponding spiritual influences. This  book has all the thrill of a good detective novel, and is a wonderful and  impressive read for anyone interested in this arcane topic's relevance to  western religious architecture. (A discussion of this method's connection  to chess and written language is also included.) If you want to locate  this book quickly, I suggest Samuel Weiser's used book section/warehouse in  York Beach, Maine. It's pricey... p.s. And by the way, this book makes a  good companion to Genisis by David Wood.
