 Professor Terrell was my neighbor in Orono, Maine, where I completed my M.A. in English.  I spoke with him at his home about this book; he said he spent about six years on it with the assistance of graduate students, collecting and collating his notes and researching unclear references.  It's still an amazing work and a cornerstone of every Poundian library.  Professor Terrell provides the reader an annotation for each potentially unclear reference. Like "Finnegans Wake," the Cantos are abstruse - nearly unintelligible without a companion reference.  For serious study, this text is an excellent investment; it is hard to imagine being able to penetrate the Cantos without it.   (Another fine, but much briefer, reference is William Cookson's "A Guide to the Cantos of Ezra Pound."  Unlike Terrell, Cookson concentrates less on the vocabulary and more on the broad historical sweep contained within the Cantos.  The two authors, taken together, provide an excellent key for unlocking the Cantos.)
