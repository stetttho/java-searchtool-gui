 Joseph Campbell coauthored the classic Finnegans Wake reference Skeleton Key, and in these six tapes of an informal lecture to a small audience he presents another tour de force encompassing his analysis of Portrait, Ulysses, and Wake.  He delivers Joyce's theory of art, (alone worth the price of the tapes), relates the texts' themes to mythology and philosophy, and generally provides a wonderful sense of James Joyce as a brilliant man of sorrows, acquainted with grief, who labored mightily to bring forth the Big Three. Perhaps even on a level with Stuart Gilbert's "James Joyce's Ulysses". These tapes are a great buy for anyone interested in Joyce.
