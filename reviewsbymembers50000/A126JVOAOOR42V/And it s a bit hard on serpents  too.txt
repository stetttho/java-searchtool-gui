 Campbell really throws down the gauntlet to the Christians.. Make no  mistake about it. There is a wide, insuperable gulf between Campbell's  scholarship and contemporary blind faith in vicarious atonement through the  Maitreya Buddha, or the Christ, or the prophet which Douglas Adams conjures  up in the restaurant at the end of the universe. I am not taking sides,  just making an observation. Campbell maintains that "getting stuck  with the metaphor" in a religion is the root of all evil.  C:  "The story is that Jesus ascended bodily to Heaven. That his mother,  while still asleep, ascended bodily to Heaven. You don't have to get rid of  it - you just have to figure out what it's saying..". M: What do YOU  think it's saying ? C: "That he ascended through the INWARD spaces,  which is what you must do, too." M: "But aren't you undermining  the classical Christian doctrine of the death, burial, and resurrection of  Christ prefiguring our own, and overcoming Death through a higher Spiritual  truth?" C: "Well... THAT is what I would call a mistaken  reading of the symbol... That's reading it in terms of prose, instead of  poetry... That's reading a metaphor in terms of the DEnotation, instead of  the CONnotation. Moyers and Campbell also have a good time reading  Creation stories from around the globe, and observing similarities.  Campbell observes that in most cultures, the snake is positive, and that  when one encounters a mythology which regards the serpent as evil,  "that amounts to a refusal to affirm Life".
