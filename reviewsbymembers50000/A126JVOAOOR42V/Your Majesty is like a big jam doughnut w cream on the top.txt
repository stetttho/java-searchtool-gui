 War and Peace gets straight tens, but even that to me is not necessarily proper. Lord of Light is a book I have always remembered, first reading in ~1974  as a teenager. Reread it several times. Like Finnegans Wake, its end ties into its beginning, so that the novel is a circle, mirroring circular time, recurrence, etc.. Perhaps it was my youth, but the book had a great effect on me. The characters were memorable, even the Tathagatha, (Sam), once I got to know him after the 2nd or third reading. I won't summarize the plot, but perhaps what causes us to remember it after all these years, (and who would put this o.o.p., by the way?), is the strong sense of reality the book has despite its surreal setting, and our sympathy for a man who - if memory serves - is trying to do what is right despite opposition, and doing a good job at it, too. Well, I hope that I have been reviewing the right book, it has been over 20 years after all. As for the nine, the Tathagatha would approve of my "seeing how the countercurrent would flow." (Just between us, I give it an unofficial 10!)
