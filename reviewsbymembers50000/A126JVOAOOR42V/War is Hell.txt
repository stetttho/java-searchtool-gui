 The best place to see this is in the cinema. A considerable amount of  dramatic tension is created in the first 7 minutes when we watch an aged,  unknown Army veteran approach a military grave with his family. Unless we  happen to notice the Airborne pin on his left lapel, we're unsure: is this  man Captain Miller, weeping over his failure to save Private Ryan, or is it  Private Ryan moved by remembering the bravery of the man who saved  him? In the combat sequences, Spielberg certainly approaches what  Schopenhauer calls "the sublime" in art:  experiences of ecstacy  as one "is blown" by immense power. The sheer visual spectacle of  real-time emotional content within a context of vicious small unit actions  is what places this film in a class by itself. The beach assault IS  sublime. Particularly impressive are the small unit tactics which enable  the men to find the "Dog One Exit" around a fortified  emplacement, and eventually secure the beach: "COVERING  FIRE!". Perhaps the most charismatic figure is their sniper, the  good ol' Kentucky boy Private Jackson, (Barry Pepper), who recites passages  from Psalms as he passionately and methodically dispatches Wehrmacht  soldiers. In the final climactic scene, fought for a bridge over the  Merderet river in a bombed-out hamlet - probably the greatest war scene  ever - mistakes cost lives. The translator Corporal Upham, who should have  been left behind on the bridge, is brought into high relief. As is the  price one pays for misplaced sympathy in time of war.
