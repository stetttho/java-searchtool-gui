 "What one great thing would you dare to dream if you knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that you absolutely could not fail? This is one of the most important questions of all, because what this says is that this is really your great dream and your great ambition in life, and if you can write the answer to this question it means that you can have it. The very fact that you can think clearly about what this answer might be, and that you can write the answer down on paper, means that you are capable of accomplishing it.  "Nature is not capricious, and Nature does not on the one hand give us the ability to clearly visualize and write down a goal without at the same time giving us the ability to realize it. This is one of the most exciting things about the human psyche: the very fact that you can crystallize your desire means that you can achieve it. The only question is, how badly do you want it, and are you willing to pay the price to get it? Because the only limitation is in your own mind; it is not contained in physical reality."   This is Brian Tracy's central thesis in these six motivational cassettes.  The material is classic Peale and Nightingale - with a considerable amount of modern psychological research added to flesh out the concepts presented. I particularly enjoyed the description of Johannes Shultz's autogenic conditioning, and how it has been used by Olympic athletes to enhance their performance.  Mr. Tracy is an enjoyable, enthusiastic, and engaging speaker; I recommend these cassettes highly to anyone desiring to overcome negative habit patterns, maximize creativity, and live life to its fullest.   Most enjoyable.
