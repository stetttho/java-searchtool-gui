 I remember a talk given by Bruno Bettelheim in which he said that in a  modern mass-society, the constant fascination with speed and movement  betrays the inner emptiness of "a hollow man": "Instead of  asking where we are [inwardly], we just jump into the car and say 'Let's  get going'."  Nietzsche always reserved his strongest diatribes for  "the rule of men who are the mass". 'Fahrenheit 451'  caricatures and develops these ideas to their extreme, if not logical,  conclusion.. The plot is generated by the awakening of conscience in a  (heretofore enthusiastic) mechanical servant of a soulless, grassroots,  Orwellian government. Guy Montag, the protagonist, starts questioning the  very official premises upon which his culture is founded: constant non-stop  mindless entertainment, endemic disrespect for life, lots of motion and  very little introspection.  Books are found to be antagonist to this  futuristic world premise, which is more or less an unholy mixture of Montel  Williams and Barney, and so "firemen" BURN books, whenever and  wherever they can be ferreted out.  A national life of quiet desperation  is presented here. Bradbury divined back in the fifties that the little  "-isms" rife in the US would begin to dominate the cultural  scene, as we have now already witnessed. This book explores the moral and  social implications, admittedly in an extreme form, of our present  Zeitgeist. The novelty of the book keeps one fascinated to the end. Not a  great book, to my mind, but one I enjoyed reading and would certainly  recommend to others. Very much a "finger-on-the-pulse" book.  Reading time: ~ 10 hours.
