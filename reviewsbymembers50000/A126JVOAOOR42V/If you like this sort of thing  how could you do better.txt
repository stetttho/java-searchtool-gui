 This book is highly-priced; there was a $30.00 version. I bought the $500.00 (yes, five hundred) signed, limited edition. That's how much I thought of Manly P. Hall. He was a great scholar, and also had the great pleasure of hearing him speak at the Philosophical Research Society in 1990, shortly before his death. Having read classical and comparative philosophy and religion for nearly 20 years, I think you really cannot do better than this book. You might want to look for a more economical version, but my understanding is that the illustrations are very attractive in this edition. If you appreciate Joseph Campbell, but wish to pursue the more mystical side of religion, Manly P. Hall is an excellent resource. Whereas Campbell was a self-proclaimed "maverick" with no particular allegiance to any one form of religion, Manly P. Hall was a 33 degree Freemason, and clearly was sympathetic to the notion that at one  time in our history there was a system of mystery religions in which invocation of deities was practiced, and actually achieved. (Classic example, if memory serves, being Plutarch's tale of the invocation of the Neoplatonist Plotinus' guardian angel in the Temple of Isis in Rome by an Egyptian priest.) If you are sympathetic to "the old religions", and want a sympathetic  scholarly accounting, - again, it is hard for me to imagine how you could do better than buying this book.
