 First of all, let me make one thing perfectly clear: I have the highest regard for Professor Atkins' abilities - one has only to be exposed to the tremendous labor of his Physical Chemistry and Molecular Quantum Mechanics to know that the gentleman is gifted.     On the other hand, this particular book is really not much to write home about. Peter has simply collected numerous pages from a laptop file named "Musings on Life", (or so it seemed to me), and had the temerity to have it bound for mass consumption.      He plays devil's advocate and baldly states that he, and you, and I are nothing more than jiggling atoms. In other words, just another hackneyed materialist bromide. The brilliance shines through, but certainly this has to be the most pretentious and gas-filled read of all his publications.      Were it not for his name and intellectual command, it would never have gotten past the publisher. Poor fare indeed. Two thumbs down.
