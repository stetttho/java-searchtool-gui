 "Instant Manipulation" would be a more forthright title for this CD. Michael Brooks is an NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming) trainer and "founder of the Rapport Technology Group" - which organization, oddly enough, I cannot seem to locate on the WWW.  My initial reaction on listening to this CD was pure disappointment.  On reflection, though, I consider Brooks' presentation potentially baleful for anyone unfamiliar with NLP.  If you *are* already familiar with NLP, you won't waste your time with this CD.  My first proviso is Brooks' repeated affirmation that likes attract while opposites repel.  This is a tremendously glib overgeneralization by Brooks because opposite temperaments typically *do* attract.  The "like attracts like" adage refers to a successful couple's worldviews, ideals, dreams - not their temperaments.    My second proviso is that it is the deplorable "dark side" of NLP - machiavellian manipulation of others - that Brooks is touting.  Thirdly, Brooks is a lusterless speaker.  Brooks' claims are the standard valences of NLP: the mind links sequential "processing strategies" with specific events and specific feelings.  People's eye movements and word choice are clear signposts to their individual processing strategies.  Responsiveness to these behaviors enhances rapport.  If you've ever found yourself disagreeing with someone and wondering why, when it seems your views are very similar, NLP can be a marvellous tool for bridging such a language barrier before it develops into a full-fledged communication breakdown. But you'll learn very little about that from this CD. "Instant Rapport" is little more than a twisted travesty of Chapter 6 of Anthony Robbins' excellent "Unlimited Power," which book - unlike Brooks' CD - I do recommend as an excellent and motivational introduction to NLP.
