 This is a story where the book and the film take equal honors.  The Crichton novel has a few gems of characterization which the film omits.  That said, this film's special effects, though now eclipsed by the digital wonder that is Lord of the Rings, were top-flight in 1993, and still are gripping. The story is a retelling of the Godzilla Myth: man toys with nature experiencing inevitable retribution.  The twist here is that it is not the action/reaction of the Old Newtonian World that engenders the demise; rather, it is Chaos Theory: newest god in the Pantheon of Physical Science.  The chaotician, brilliantly acted by Jeff Goldblum, pontificates for several minutes about how the idyllic pleasure park cannot last, only to find his predictions made reality in the space of one afternoon.  Apparently, a butterfly flapped its wings in Peking that particular day -- so the theory would have us imagine. The plot device, of course, is the household word "DNA." Behind all the modern trappings, theories, and special effects is the age-old hoary tale, that of the sorceror's apprentice.  Science in this film is a form of black magic which destroys all who attempt to employ it for personal gain.  That's a moral for you.  On the visual level, Jurassic Park is a dream-come-true for children.  I would have loved to have seen this film when I was a child -- and no doubt been frightened for days after.  Fortunately, I was able  to watch it with my nine year-old son, which, I think, was even better.   Again, Jeff Goldblum steals the show, speaking what is certainly the film's most memorable line.  Stranded in a powerless jeep, helplessly watching as an enormous Tyrannosaurus Rex bursts free from its electrified pen, he remarks: "Boy, do I hate being right all the time." A roller-coaster of a film certainly worth seeing at least once.
