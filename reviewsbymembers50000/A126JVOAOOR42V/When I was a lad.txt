 we played the 33&1/3 silly, man. This was, at the time, the best music anywhere.  It does start to sound dated... I suppose it's one of two things, or both...  First, the times were different, and PG sounded  (ZO)SO abrasively raucous and bold. Alot of H2O under the levee since.   Second, perhaps listening to anything for 25 years, though it keeps the  dust from settling, nevertheless does wear tracks in the brain engrams, if  not the vinyl any more, man. Plant and Page were heavily into topics  spiritual and mystical: Plant "the flower child", and Page  "the hermit". IF Aleister Crowley and the Golden Dawn can be  believed, transcendent psychological states are attainable. Did the  zeppelin lads attain these, and is Kashmir their duet of metaphysical  exultation, hence their favorite? Regardless, Kashmir is a  flower/power/tower-house that still sounds good "after all these  years".  The only LZ album I still own.
