 It's hip to disparage Freud, despite the circumspectness of his arguments. But for readers of FINNEGANS WAKE, Joyce's long and winding road WILL lead them to this door, - wordplay and repetitive number significance are  touched upon. Freud suggests crucial ideas for a "universal  grammar" of dream-consciousness, (consult Noam Chomsky, or Leonard  Bernstein's "The Unanswered Question" videos).  1. "I  THINK I CAN, I THINK I CAN, ..." Remember Molly Bloom's "Yes,  yes, yes..." dialogue at the conclusion of ULYSSES, before dozing off?  There ain't no "no" in Mr. Sandman's lexicon. Instead, negation  is expressed by ideas stood on their heads or made insensible, (compare  with Joseph Campbell's appraisal of Picasso's handling of mythic  imagery). 2. "YOU WERE PUMPING IRON WHILE I WAS PUMPING  IRONY" A vague idea may be signifying its direct opposite. Freud  compares this to primitive proto-language etymology, where either extreme  is expressed by one and the same word. (I have known people like  this!) 3. "I AND THE FATHER ARE ONE" Condensation of ideas  and personalities occurs to shortcircuit "inner censoring" and  "prefrontal control"... For example, not-dreamed-about Ms. A is  indirectly indicated by investing dreamed-about Mr. B with details  reminiscent of Ms. A. Ostensibly about Mr. B, the dream in fact revolves  around Ms. A. Googols of cross-references ad infinitum, while  round and  down she goes... Joyceans- just say YES. To all others, an OK+ that will  put you to sleep. And if it puts you to sleep...
