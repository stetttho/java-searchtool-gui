 I'm not too clear on the review of this book by  Booknews, Inc. (above). What this book IS is a collection of papers on the topic of using various computational methodologies  - primarily ab initio & density functional - to predict chemical shifts. It is very useful obviously for computational chemists, such as myself.  IF you are NOT a computational chemist, and are looking for a source of information on NMR *techniques*, this book is not for you. Also, if you are looking for a concise technical description on how to run such calculations: again, this book is not for you, either! What the entire set of papers distill down to is use of UNIX-based software packages such as Gaussian94 to generate geometry-optimized conformers, whose cartesians are then exported into the SP NMR mode of Gaussian94 to determine the NMR isotropic chemical shift tensors. There are numerous descriptions of the applicability of various methodologies to various chemical systems: polymers, crystals, olefins, etc..  The 23 chapters include such jewels as: "Effects of Hydrogen Bonding on 1H Chemical Shifts", "Ab Initio Calculations of 31P NMR Chemical Shielding Anisotropy Tensors in Phosphates: The Effect of Geometry on Shielding".... and last, but definitely not least, "Recent Advances in Nuclear Magnetic Shielding Theory and Computational Methods". [whew!] My own (**VERY limited**) work in this area suggests that although Gaussian94 ab initio analysis does a good job in generating isotropic tensors which are predictive of chemical shift, computational accuracy may well break down on the introduction of multiple bonding. (Using HF theory on a 6-31G* basis set.) If this all sounds Greek, it is to me, too...!
