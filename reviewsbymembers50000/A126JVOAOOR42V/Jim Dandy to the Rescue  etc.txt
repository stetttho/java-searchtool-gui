 Why a ten for a book that is being panned by Kirkus? Why a ten when I only gave Moby Dick an 8 or so?     One must understand what the book is. It is a very delightful tale about a naughty puppy's adventures. For its intended audience- small children- it is a delight to read. My children find it a very happy book and look forward to hearing it.     I agree that it is light fare, but simply to attack this sweet, sincere little tale for children because it is not "literature" or "profound" seems hardly fair, and at worst mean-spirited.  I laughed out loud when I read the first page, and that was with a bad sore throat and not feeling well, either.     In its peer group, it certainly outshines very hungry caterpillars and foxes in socks. Two thumbs up.
