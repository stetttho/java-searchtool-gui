 Listen my children, and you will hear Of the time when the Zeppelin travelled quite near. I was living the life of a poor country boy When Zeppelin tickets sold down on the floor Were only a hundred, or perhaps  even two, But to pay twenty bucks For a seat in the stands Seemed a  trifle too much And it slipped through my hands -  A chance to see  Bonzo, JP, Plant and Page Even though they were rightly considered the  rage. The concert was stellar, my friends all relayed But I wouldn't  pay twenty So I've no more to say. Well, actually ---- just a little  more. "The Rain Song" and "No Quarter" are over the  hills and far away better on this album than in the studio performances of  "Houses of the Holy". Even Stairway really jams here live. (My  first drum set was patterned after the Zildjians and Ludwigs Bonham used in  this performance's video recording.) As always, a period piece. But, what  a period! Period. (And yes, the above is true; I missed seeing Zeppelin  back in '78 because $20.00 seemed a trifle high for concert tickets:  "But I always thought I'd see you again..".  I have since paid  more than twenty for this CD, and its video, and each is well worth the  money, the latter especially if you're fascinated by the group's  personalities.)
