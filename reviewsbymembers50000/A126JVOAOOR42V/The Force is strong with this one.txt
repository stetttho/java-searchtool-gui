 I earned my shodan during three years training in Japan, (my instructors were wonderful people), and have taught for three years also, (receiving permission from World Aikido headquarters). This is an excellent little  book; it is pleasant both to look at and read, and covers alot of  information in a well-paced and thoughtful manner. The elegant presentation  reminds me of books on Japanese flower arrranging. It is also concise,  delivering not only what I understand to be a complete rendition of the  various ki techniques and their applications in a straightforward manner,  but also including brief notes on the various influences of aikido on  cinema (the seven samurai & Star Wars), apocryphal tales about the  founder Ueshiba Morihei, etc... I enjoyed reading this book and consider  it, unlike several other books on the subject, both well worth the expense  and a useful addition to one's aikido library.
