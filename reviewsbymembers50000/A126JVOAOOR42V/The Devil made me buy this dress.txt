 [I will limit my remarks to the second of the two tales: reading time ~1 hour.] Uspenskii was not a bad writer.. The tale opens as our grumpy  European traveller realizes he will not be getting to sleep, due to the  intense heat (or is it the humidity?) of the Indian climate. When, lo and  behold! - it's the DEVIL!  And the devil - for reasons not too clear,  shares his thoughts on humanity with the traveller, our  protagonist. Uspenskii makes an interesting point that one man's meat is  another devil's poison. Terrestrial daemons are busily concerned with  keeping our interests occupied with the immediate here-and-now. For them,  any spiritual release is mysterious and frightening, and so they help us -  to their way of thinking - by surreptitiously bending our ways to their  ways. I enjoyed this story with clean, enjoyable prose, and very little  pretence. It wakes you up - just a little! - so there'll be no need for  devils to bother you upon completion!
