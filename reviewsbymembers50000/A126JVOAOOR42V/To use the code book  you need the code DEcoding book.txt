 The Annotations is a very helpful reference, pure and simple. Even for those familiar with the nightlife of the Wake, ANNO. invariably points out  redlight districts which have escaped the reader's attention.  It is  simple to use; my hardcover copy is identically paginated and so there is  no confusing looking for the right page. (Apparently the softcover versions  conform to this, also.) Etymology is provided where necessary, and there  are the usual plethora of abbreviated historical allusions. Reviewing  ANNO. before reading considerably helps in "getting" at least an  increased small percentage of the numerous puns, parodies, allusions,  etc. Not an absolute requirement for reading the Wake, but doubtless a  very great help.
