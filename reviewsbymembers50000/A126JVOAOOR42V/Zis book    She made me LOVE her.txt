 Corwin's terrific dynamism and cunning drive the first five chapters. The second half: "Aye, there's the rub!". As Merlin, son of Corwin, confesses, "I'm not in the same league as my father".  Imagine Homer's "ODYSSEY" with the entire second half devoted to Telemachus. Maybe Zelazny had done better to have a multiple plot going on here with both men; THAT might have been good!   From chapter six on, you sadly feel the tale slowly but steadily decelerate with Merlin the magical wunderkind at the wheel. In fact... it's the expansion of the plot complications and range of characters already briefly encountered in the first half of the book which makes Merlin sustainable. Compared with Corwin's judgment and cunning, Merlin's decisions seem wayward, his rationale just too intuitive. It's hard to identify with him... Yet, he does have his shining moments, for all that. Other small defects there are... BUT! This is a Whale of a Book: mildly hazardous if you are on a work schedule. "The Great Book of Amber" is positively addictive; prepare to be bleary-eyed until you finish it. It reminds me of "the Pattern"; once you start, you just can't stop 'til you reach the end. Have fun. It's holds up well to a re-read, also.
