 I've not had the pleasure of seeing this particular edition. Mine was a  limited edition hardcover by Chthonios Books. I did actually read most of  it about 11 years ago.  The format, as you might expect, is a lengthy  foreword by Taylor in which he vigorously defends the pagan mysteries, and  extensively footnotes Proclus' commentaries throughout. A line or two of  Plato is followed by anywhere from a few lines to a few pages by Proclus.  IF you enjoy Timaeus, you're almost certain to enjoy this.  Unless you're  wildly interested or planning to do postgraduate work on Neoplatonism,  however, this very beefy tome is probably best described as a book  "for laying down and avoiding". The enormous amounts of Taylor  material make it well worth the cost (assuming a readable edition).  Interesting is Taylor's observation that the circulation of the bloodstream  was already mentioned in the Timaeus two millenia before William  Harvey! [Samuel Weiser may be carrying a nice hardcover edition?]
