 This video is divided into two sections.  First, Moyers and Campbell  discuss the idea of courtly love as sung by the European troubadours of the  12th and 13th centuries. Campbell asserts that prior to that time, the idea  of marriage solely for personal love, "marriage as a person-to-person  thing", did not exist "AS A SOCIAL SYSTEM". There had always  been isolated incidences of it, but after that time it became "the  ideal, at any rate, of love in the Western world". And Campbell points  out that this is what makes the West unique: that the individual is taught  to have FAITH in the validity of his own experience "AGAINST the  monolithic system". In the last half, the notion of the Goddess, and  goddess mythologies, is discussed. Campbell retells the Egyptian myth of  Isis in search of her dead spouse Osiris. (Note parallel between this and  similar motifs in classical paganism, alchemy, and 'Star Wars'- Demeter  & Persephone, the adept's search for the drowned King, and Skywalker's  rescue of Darth Vader.) Campbell points out that there is something  unnaturally extreme about Biblical mythology, in which the male Creator not  only occupies a dominant role, but "takes over [the Goddess']  role", so that she is "wiped out". "The Hebrew term for  the Canaanite goddess was 'the Abomination'". He points out that  typically agrarian societies have female gods, while nomadic hunters, e.g.  the Hebrews, worship male deities.  Despite this banishment of the  Goddess figure, "she came back... in the Virgin". Campbell  implies either that there is something in the human psyche which requires a  female Goddess, or that this archetypal figure was intentionally  reintroduced into the religious worship of the West under the guise of the  Virgin Mary.  A very enjoyable filmed interview with great visuals, as  are each and all in this series. Recommended with fear and trembling.
