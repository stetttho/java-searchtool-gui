 I read this book about 7 years ago, and I can never recall the experience without a certain amount of incredulity that the author, Mr. McDaniel,  presumably an intelligent man, actually produced this albatross.  As a  scientist, pseudo-technical glosses do not pass unweighed in my readings,  particularly on matters philosophical... McDaniel's work struck me as an  immense flaming verbal orgy which danced around numerous topics while  miraculously illuminating none. (Far different from Clymer's works.) If  the book was intended as a spoof on New Age literature, it could not have  been better fashioned. At best, it reads like a good idea that just didn't  work, like Gallipoli. Whatever insights the author wished to convey, his  pen failed to capture them. "And that's all I have to say about  that."
