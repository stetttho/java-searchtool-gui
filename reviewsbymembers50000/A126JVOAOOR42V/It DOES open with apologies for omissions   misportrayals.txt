 ...I have perused Gandhi's autobiography and, if we give him credit, he WAS an unusually good little  boy, and young man. Pretty ignorant otherwise of his life story, I came to  the movie as much of a "blank slate" as could be wished...  I  thought the development of his character WAS evident, his initial protests  based more on principle, and faith in the British legal system, than  heartfelt compassion. I also thought the breach between Indian Muslims and  Hindus was also faithfully, if briefly, delineated. The film makes it  clear, too, that while many Britons were decent and humane, many others  were mindless automata blindly serving a system whose humanity they refused  to question. I was reminded, particularly after the ghastly massacre of  over a thousand non-violently protesting Indians by the British, of the  Holocaust. Would Britons have complied had a similar program been initiated  in India? One wonders... The storyline proper starts with Gandhi the  lawyer being called "Sammy", and thrown off a train, arriving in  South Africa. From here, he decides to campaign against what he considers  to be manifest injustice, drawn more and more into the limelight of  international notoriety. Gandhi understood that, at root, the British  system was INTENDED to be just and that, with the aid of the international  press, he could successfully wage a campaign of aggressive passive  resistance. I found it highly amusing as the film went on as this sort of  phrase started to become well-worn: "Arrest everyone, but NOT  Gandhi!". A great film.
