 I used this book abroad while studying chemistry for four years in Scotland. As I remember it now, it was the only required organic chemistry text, (for reaction mechanisms - i.e. aside from the various supplementary spectroscopic texts). There were color diagrams in our version, and I still refer to it. I highly recommend this text. The notion that one could completely digest its contents in an undergraduate chemistry course beggars belief.
