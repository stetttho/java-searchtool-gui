 I read an original copy, circa 1890. It was a three volume set with beautiful, color stone lithographs and, of course, no editorial abridgement. I gave it away as a gift to a friend wanting to learn about  architecture, as the best possible starting point. I personally have very  little patience for people who want to abridge Ruskin's work. And Ruskin's  illustrations really make this work.  So, having said this, IF one is  willing to overlook these editorial wiseacreings, this book is obviously a  classic. It is a marvelous experience to be able to look at a building, any  building, when driving or walking down a street, and know the history,  name, and significance of each of its facets & adornments. Unless you  happen to live in an area with considerable architectural variety, you will  find your newly-acquired skills only serve to confirm your opinion that we  live in an age of totally bland and meaningless construction. I cannot  recommend this book highly enough.
