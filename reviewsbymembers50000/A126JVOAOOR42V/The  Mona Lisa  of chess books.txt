 Nimzowich has a wonderful writing style: humorous and human, e.g.   "Self-praise is only allowable when deserved recognition has been  unjustly withheld; in all other cases, it is both in bad taste and  demoralizing."  That is about all I am fit to comment on: the book  is a classic. Nimzowich expounds basic concepts of chess strategy,  particularly the idea of the blockade, and provides numerous examples  within the text, which are supported by a collection of games at the end.   This IS an ideal book for any literate beginner, particularly as  familiarity with his ideas distills the essence of the game down to several  key principles. Nimzowich cuts through all the usual confusion,  explaining  the game in terms of his systematic approach to positional play.
