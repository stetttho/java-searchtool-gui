 Genisis is certainly a worthwhile book for those interested in geomancy and the emerging science of sacred sites. The author attempts to prove that certain Greek myths were, at least on one level, deliberately coded information regarding the origin of mankind. He supports his argument by the geometrical patterns created, presumably intentionally, by the placement in France of ancient sites devoted to religious cults. His claim that phallectomy, (No, I'm not kidding!), was an intrinsic part of certain ancient religious initiation rites seems farfetched, but nonetheless the book is a highly stimulating and most unusual presentation of the ancient astronaut genre.
