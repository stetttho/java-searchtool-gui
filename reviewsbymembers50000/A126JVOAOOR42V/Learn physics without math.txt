 This is a jewel of a book. The latest second edition includes additional  material on waves, which addresses a lack in the earlier edition. There are  sections on optics, momentum, kinetic and potential energy, etc.. My  favorite problem, and this is typical of the sort of material presented, is  to decide whether or not a car suffers more damage in  A. hitting an  immovable brick wall at 50 m.p.h.  B. having a head-on collision with an  identical car both travelling at 50 m.p.h. ?  The usual response is to  say B. However, Newton's 3rd law of motion, ("forces always act in  pairs; if a exerts a force on b, then b exerts an equal and  oppositely-directed force on a), maintains that the damage is the same,  i.e., the wall strikes the car with the force of a head-on collision. This  problem, by the way, is particularly juicy - I remember the head of a  university physics department discussing this one at considerable length  with two other physicists! (They more or less agreed, with provisos, that  B. is indeed correct.) The author encourages thinking without  mathematics, to come to terms with the physical reality of what is  occurring. This approach closely mirrors that of Michael Faraday and James  Clerk Maxwell, who felt that mathematics was useful only as an adjunct to  science and no substitute for clear thinking... A marvellous book.
