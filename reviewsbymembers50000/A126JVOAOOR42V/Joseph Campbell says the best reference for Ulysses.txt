 During my initial reading happened to bump into this book in the university library; subsequently learned that Joseph Campbell considered it THE best reference for ULYSSES. My readings of exegetical references for ULYSSES since confirms his opinion. Gilbert apparently was a close friend of Joyce, and was a mouthpiece for him in explaining the many dimensions and symbolic layers of the text. A definite must-have reference for reading ULYSSES. Personally, have enjoyed it very much. Would also recommend Hugh Kenner's later commentaries.
