 My introduction to Fourier mathematics was as a chemistry undergraduate - it was always irritating to keep seeing these equations introduced in FTIR and NMR texts with the apparently obligatory "it can be shown that...". But, of course, it was never shown in a clear manner.       This book is filled with cartoons and rather simplistic explanations, but it also has the nuts and bolts of what the basic underlying assumptions are, and you finish with a set of about 20 revised pages of mathematics which give you a very clear picture, and a comfortable one as well, of just what is involved in the Fourier mathematics.     I give this book high marks and much praise. And also am very grateful to the authors for demystifying a rather abstruse mathematical topic; I feel much more comfortable with spectroscopy having read it, and having now some idea of what is actually going on in the black box of the spectrophotometer.
