 Hello, Listener. With this CD you enter an incredible world of living music. I watched this performance televised in Scotland ~6 years ago; Kennedy is absolutely impeccable, funny, and wildly eccentric. During the  summer session, the floor lights were turned up brightly so that all the  performers, excepting Kennedy, wore sunglasses. It was a spectacle - you  felt the chills going up your spine during the violent wave attacks of the  heat... Kennedy is asthmatic, and described his interpretation of summer as  focusing on "the anger of the heat, the violence of the heat".   But then he also (tongue-in-cheek) described his autumn interpretation  as a perception that the mushroom is not only a psychedelic substance, but  also that Vivaldi had in mind foresight of the terrror of the first atomic  bomb explosion. An unconventional interpretation, but certainly the best  I've ever heard of this classic.
