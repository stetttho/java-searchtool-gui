 Well, well, well.. A master failed to complete his ultimate work! Where  have we heard THAT one before? Let's see... Plato's Timaeus, Joyce's  projected 4th major volume after the Wake, Joseph Campbell's Atlas of World  Mythology... Oh, dear! Well, it's true. The book does frustrate. Right  when you're going to find out 'who did it', the poor man stops writing.   Am I detecting a pattern here? (Writers procrastinate and/or are  mortal.) Nevertheless, this book is OK. And Gurdjieff gives a  particularly instructive exercise for those of you still curious: Pay  attention to your right hand. Lay it flat. Begin to count to ten with one  finger, while you observe the emotional state of a second finger, while  simultaneously observing the physical sensations of a third.  IF you  enjoy Gurdjieff, and feel just plain stark naked or, worse yet, just not  with it (horrors!) without this book on your shelf, THEN do please buy it,  do please. Otherwise, I would pick it up off the shelf, buy a coffee,  peruse it for a few minutes, and see if it grabs me. The biography is  interesting, but "Meetings with Remarkable Men" is better in that  regard, and "Views from the Real World" covers alot more  psychological territory.
