 The caption on the cd cover states "Deep house music mixed by Ben Watt and Jay Hannan."  I'd like to say for the record that this is hardly Deep House music.  I would compare this style music with the likes of Kevin Yost and Harry the Bastard, very jazzy with funk and disco elements.  Both of these mixes are well put together with good quality mixing and a nice music selection.  There's even a few vocals thrown in.  My only complaints of these two sets are the lack of thumpin' bass I prefer in house music and the length of the sets.  Combined you only get just over 128 minutes.  I don't think either of these sets are strong enough for the typical house club, but might be suited for a slightly older crowd.  If you want house music to chill to then this might be for you. CD1 by Ben Watt is the better of the two sets, timed in at 67+ minutes.  This set is closer to traditional house music.  The beats are somewhat thumpin' and if you listen to the set a few times you'll find yourself bouncing to it.  This is a much more danceable set than the second cd.  Cuts of choice are "Always", Jazzy Kinda Sum'n", "Be Encouraged" and "Round In My Mind."  CD1 rates 4.5 stars. CD2 with Jay Hannah is a more mellow set, being very jazzy and easy to relax to.  There are strong disco and funk elements in this set making for a slightly different type of house music. I wasn't thrilled by the short length of only 61+ minutes.  I expect a little more from cds made in the last three years.  Cuts of choice are "Another World", "Ceda Vez", "Feel The Real" and "Beau Mot Plage."  CD2 rates 4 stars. Overall this is a nice double cd set.  The mixing is smooth and the music selection is good.  It leans toward the mellow side but that's not a bad thing.  Just keep in mind these sets won't really make you rush to the dancefloor.  This double cd will make a nice addition to an already existing house collection, but I wouldn't recommend it to a house newbie.
