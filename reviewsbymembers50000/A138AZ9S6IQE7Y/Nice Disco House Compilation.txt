 Here is one of my favorite CD's from the sm:)e label.  Known for house, hardhouse and techno, this label brings many facets of house to the public for consumption.  This title although generic at first glance is a fine addition to any house collection.  The only reason this doesn't get five stars is because of the mixing style of the DJ (who by the way is not listed anywhere on the CD).  Some of the mixing (or lack of mixing) brings this down a notch on my list.  The choice of music is very good.  The cd starts of furious with some real funky Disco.  By cut 4 the house kicks in and goes along o.k..  The two highlights for me are cuts 11 & 12 "Orbit" and "Disco Cubism."  Fortunatly the DJ decided to mix these two beats together the way it's supposed to be done.  Title 7 "Live @ the CBGB" is the only one I may occasionally skip when listening to this cd.  Otherwise this is some seriously good Disco/House and should be sampled at least once to see what its like.
