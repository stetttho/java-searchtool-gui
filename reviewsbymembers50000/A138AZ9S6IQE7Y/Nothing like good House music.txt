 Doc Martin strikes again.  For those of you that have heard "Unlock Your Mind" this album is as good if not better.  Upon listening to this album I was taken back to my days in college.  "What you need" and "Follow me" were two of my favorites back then.  It was nice to hear them again mixed by Doc Martin.  The general tone of the album is NY style, no techno, no electronic and no euro..... just deep, house beats and rhythm with some voice thrown in.  The CD2 commentary was also interesting.  You can get some fascinating info on the origins of House music.  An overall excellent album for the money.
