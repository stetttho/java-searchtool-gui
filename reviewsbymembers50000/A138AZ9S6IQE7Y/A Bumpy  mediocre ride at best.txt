 Being a fan of Little Louie Vega I expected much much more from this cd.  I was very disappointed and I caution anyone looking for the greatness of some other Louie Vega house music works to look elsewhere.  This dance set reminds me of the music dj's play at clubs before midnight, you know, before the party actually starts.  There is no continuity to the set at all and it sounds like Louie was given ten records to mix as best he could.  I hate to think there were other records to choose from to make this set.  The mixing is good but the music selection is less than average.  The only tracks worth mentioning on this cd are "I'm Glad You Came To Me", "I Desire You", and "Somebody Skat'n."  The rest is average or just plain bad.  Tracks 2 & 10 could have very easily been left off this compilation.  This cd would have been a little better if the music weren't mixed, thus the listener would at least know the various tracks weren't necessarily supposed to go together.  I can't even imagine trying to dance to this entire cd non-stop.  Without the three tracks I really liked, the rating would've been my first ever 1 star.  What we have here is a dj's nightmare and just because a skilled dj can mix anything, doesn't mean it's to be done!
