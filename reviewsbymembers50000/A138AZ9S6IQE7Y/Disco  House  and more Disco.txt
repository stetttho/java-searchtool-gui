 Rick Garcia and Mazi do a nice job of including the roots of House music in this two part mix. The mix extends for 72 minutes so you get plenty of music.  The first mix by Rick Garcia is progressive house with disco mixed in. The beats boom and the sound is tight. The best way to sum up this album as a whole is that it goes by quickly. The second mix by Mazi is probably more like Disco with House mixed in. Incredibly he does it well. The beats boom, the mixing is good, the music selection is fine and fits together well. Everything in this cd goes along nicely and even though I tried to find reasons to give this cd less than five stars I wasn't succesful. If you like house music this will fit in your collection just fine. If you're not a HousERaT but still want some music to listen to and chill, this cd should still work for you.
