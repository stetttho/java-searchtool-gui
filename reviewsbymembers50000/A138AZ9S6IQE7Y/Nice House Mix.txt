 Danny Tenaglia does a real nice job with this mix.  Plenty of house music and the beats continue smoothly with the exception of his constant spinning of Cevin Fisher's "The Way We Used To."  He could have done without that and it breaks up the continuity of the mix.  Other than that this is a top notch mix and will add nicely to any house music collection.
