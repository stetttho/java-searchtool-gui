 Danny Tenaglia finally gets it right and delivers a 5 star gem.  Global Underground London is an excellent double cd set that takes you on a tribal house journey into the underground.  You can't really compare these sets with the ones from Athens since they're a totally different feel and brand of house music.  London is strictly deep underground house with a heavy tribal influence unlike the trance/house sound of Athens.  This is wonderfully mixed with an excellent music selection.  The beats are pumpin and the bass is deep.  There are no weaknesses in these sets and this is without question Tenaglia's finest work yet. CD 1 clocks in at over 71 minutes and is excellent expression of deep tribal house music.  There are too many choice titles to list but the numbers are 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, and 11.  This is good stuff and I recommend it to any tribal house heads.  CD1 rates 5 stars. CD 2 clocks in at over 72 minutes and is composed of tribal, underground and even some trance house.  The mixing is quality and the music selection is diverse but excellent.  The tempo of this set is a little slower than cd 1 but still comes off well.  Cuts of choice are "Magical Digital Drum", "Basic", "Phoenix", "Burning", and "Ways of Love."  CD2 rates 4.75 stars. This is an excellent cd for anyone interested in house music.  You have variety, excellent mixing and beats that are deep and forceful.  You shouldn't have any problem dancing to these sets.  Whether you're starting out in house music or a veteran, you'll want to add this to your collection.
