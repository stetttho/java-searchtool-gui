 I've never had the pleasure of seeing Junior mix live so I'm reviewing this as a person that's only heard his cd's.  Since most people didn't hear him do his thing live in NYC clubs, this review may apply to the average non-NYC resident.  This cd set is strictly underground (stuff you'll never ever hear on the radio), so if you're looking for some "popular" house music you should probably look elsewhere.  That said, this is an excellent addition to any house collection.  The beats are booming and flow together nicely with a kinda Trance tone.  In summary, the best way I can describe this 2CD set is that, the music won't make you run to the dancefloor but if you're already out there this mix will keep you dancing.  The only selection that would force me to put down a drink and run to the dancefloor is "Fly Life" by Basement Jaxx.  Other than that there are no real hits in this set.  It's not a CD set to define house music by, but is certainly a nice "addition" to an already existing collection.
