 Once again, the folks at Twisted America have not failed to impress me with their unique brand of house music.  I can't say enough good things about this label and I'll be reviewing many more must-have cds from this people at Twisted. This cd has the euro feel that so many of the Twisted America cds have.  The house music although very deep has more synthesizer than the norm, giving the house a very synthetic, trance sound.  This is like trance without the million bpm, which is right up my ally.  There isn't much bassline to speak of in this cd but the electronic instrumentation more than fills the open space.  The mixing is excellent along with the music selection.  Nothing out of place here, and everything flows along smoothly.  Cuts of choice are "El Ritmo", "Are You Looking For Me?", "Sunrise", and "Latin Blues Pt 1."  This tone and texture of this cd reminds me a lot of the "House Music: Dusk Till Dawn" cd (Nervous Records).  Without a doubt this cd will fit nicely on my HousERaT five star list.  This is an excellent addition to any house music collection and for you trance heads out there this might be a nice change of pace also.
