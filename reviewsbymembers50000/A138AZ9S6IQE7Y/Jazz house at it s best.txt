 Once again I have to blast the people who choose to rate house music on the merits of some lavish career of judging other genras.  Why do you do this to yourselves?  As Eddie said, "Not everyone understands house music."  Try dancing to this stuff a little before you break it down.  What a concept, dancing to house music?  Anyway on to the show.... Kevin Yost does an excellent job of mixing his jazzy blend of house music and he does credit to the Twisted America label.  "Twisted," which does a lot of house music hasn't really done a lot of the jazzy house like say OM records.  I'm glad Twisted went with this set because it really rocks.  The bass is booming, the mixing & tempo is smooth and the instrumentation is soothing. I usually equate this type of house music with sexy since if you get your girl to a party with this stuff playing, she'll probably get in the mood for more than just dancing... wink, wink.  If you like house music but don't always want to hear the aggressive stuff that makes your ears work hard, then give this a try.  People who like this should also check out Mark Farina and David Alvarado.  Overall this is an excellent addition to any house collection.  Nuff said!
