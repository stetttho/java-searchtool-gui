 Let me start off by saying I thought this was going to be a house cd.  It starts out that way but it doesn't end that way.  In fact very little of this set is house music, it's trance.  Not a problem though, Ralphi does a good job with this cd.  Not really what I'm into but it's good.  The first four tracks are house and then it turns to trance until the end of the mix.  If you're looking for a nice house cd this is probably not for you.  If the distinction between house and trance is a big deal to you, you'll probably want to stick with the stuff on my music lists.  Anyway onto the critique..... The first four tracks are pure house/disco.  Nice mixing and great selection of disco beats.  Tracks five until the end is trance.  The mix has plenty of deep beats and the tempo is energetic, even the trace is rather deep.  You'll have no problem dancing to the music in this set.  Cuts of choice are tracks 1 "Big Love", 2 "Set me Free", 3 "Keep the Party Jumpin", 7 "My God is Real", and 10 "The Relief."  There is nothing wrong with this cd if you like the many facets of electronic music.  If you're strictly a house enthusiast then leave this alone as only the first 4 cuts are house music.
