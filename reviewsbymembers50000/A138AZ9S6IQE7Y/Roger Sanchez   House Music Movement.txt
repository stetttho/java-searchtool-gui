 ...If you've seen my other reviews you'll know I really like this series.  Great house music and history for the enthusiast, this series is worth the time and trouble of finding these cds.  In the typical style of Roger Sanchez this set is uptempo, energetic house that will keep you bouncing from start to finish.  The beats are pounding and the bass is deep.  The mixing is quality and the music selection is top notch.  There are a few spots in the first half of the set that one could try to complain about but even then you don't lose the groove.  Some of the old classics don't really move me but the ones included here are good enough.  I was surprised to hear a version of "Din Da Da" that I can actually listen to.  Nice to see some of the old music resurrected with new beats.  Cuts of choice are "U Can't Hide From Your Bud", "Vibe", "Answering Machine", and "Fade II Black."  There are probably another six selections I could mention but I don't want to get to deep into that.  If we break the set into two parts I'd have to say the second half is a little better than the first.  That would be nit picking though so we'll leave it at that.  This is not the best work I've heard from Roger Sanchez but it's a quality mix and rates better than many of the other sets I've heard from other artists.  Cd 2 has an interview with house greats Jackmaster Funk, David Morales and Kenny Dope.  If you have any of the other cds in the series this will be a nice addition.  If you like house music in general you can't go wrong with this mix.
