 Danny Tenaglia the "Twisted" man takes his house overseas with the Global Underground works.  This cd taken from a live set in Athens is a good example of deep underground house music.  It has some flaws but remains a quality double cd set.  The general feel of these cd's are trancy house (house tempo and bass with lots of trance synthesizer). CD1 is the eyesore of the 2-cd combo.  This set should have been 5 stars easy but is plagued by a horrible music selection towards the end.  I like continuity in my house sets and this one has none after track 11.  Without the questionable music selection this would qualify as a 5 star set.  The set lasts over 70 minutes so you get plenty of music.  Too bad, since this was really turning out to be an awesome set.  Cuts of choice are "Moody", "Turn Me On", "System Error", "Dom Dom Jump", "Debajo", and "The Water Song."  As you can see, I really like many of the tracks in this set and it's a shame the last two cuts were included.  This set ranks 4 stars but could have been 5. CD2 is a nice supporting cd.  It probably wouldn't score 5 stars on it's own but accompanied with another 5 star set, wouldn't diminish the score overall.  Again we have the trance house tone of the first cd although a little mellower, but this time without the mistake in music selection.  This set clocks in at over 71 minutes so again you get your money's worth. Unfortunately this set doesn't demand that you dance quite like the first.  Cuts of choice are "Feel This", "Stealin Music", and "Cool Kids of Death."  This set ranks 4.25 stars. Global Underground Athens could have easily been a five star cd however the music selection of cd 1 and the lack of bangin cuts of cd 2, strand this cd in the 4 star realm.  For serious Tenaglia fans or house music junkies in general, check out the Global Underground London.
