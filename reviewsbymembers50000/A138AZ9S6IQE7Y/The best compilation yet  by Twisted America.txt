 Liquid Groove is an independant label that "Twisted America" brings to us in this compilation.  The label features house groups such as H2O, Dangerous Minds, and Lovebeads.  The deep house cuts these groups produce is what this mixed set is made of.  Another words, the good stuff.  Deep thumpin' house music with funky basslines, hype garage keyboards, and plenty of electro to keep the sound full.  Mixed by Oliver Stumm (a total unknown) this is definately a sleeper cd that is likely to go unnoticed by the average person.  Unless of course you're down with the HousERaT and you recognize my desire to get you into the deepest house out there. I've got quite a few of the "Twisted America" works and this without question is the best I've heard thus far.  Over 72 minutes long, you get lots of "Liquid Groove" for you hard earned dollars.  This mixing and music selection is excellent and as mentioned before, you get over an hour and ten minutes of some of the best house I've heard.  Cuts of choice are "You Can Run...But You Can't Hide", "The Future", "Nobody's Business", and just about every other cut in this set.  There's a spot reserved for this excellent cd on my top 25 list.  Thank you Twisted for bringing such a wonderful mix to us.
