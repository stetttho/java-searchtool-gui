 Moonshine Records comes up with yet another good house cd.  DJ Dave Aud puts together a nice set with inspirational themes.  Feeling a little down and need a boost?  Throw this in the player and you'll be on the way up.  This set is funky house with plenty of deep bassline, thumpin' beats and lots of vocals with even a little garage thrown in.  With the inspirational themes presented this cd probably isn't for you if you're afraid of the inside of a church.  Otherwise pick this up and you can jam to this the next time your spirit needs some moving.  The mixing in this set is good along with the music selection.  Cuts of choice are "Reach Higher", "Reach Out To Me", and "Get To Groove."  This isn't a house cd I'd recommend unless you're a spiritual person or someone open to many styles of dance music.  Peace, Love and Happiness Runs the World!
