 The House Music Movement, need I say more?  This is one awesome series of house music cds.  This one features the talents of Oscar G and Ralph Falcon aka The Funky Green Dogs and they do a great job of representing house music here.  The sound of this cd and track selection is definately old school house music.  The mix comes off pretty well.  I can't complain about it.  Tracks of choice are "There is So Much", "Bounce", "Luv Dancin'", Gotta Keep Movin'", and "Dextrous."  The whole cd is good but these bring back memories of house music old.  Boomin' beats and an nice strong pulse, these cuts make you want to move.  Of course with House Music Movement cds you get the cd2 interview with some  of house musics biggest DJ's.  This one features Roger Sanchez and Marshall Jefferson.  You can't go wrong with this two cd set if you like house music.
