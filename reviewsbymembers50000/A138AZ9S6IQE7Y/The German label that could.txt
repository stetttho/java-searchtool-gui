 Here is another bumping CD from the "German" Plastic City label.  This compilation mixed by The Timewriter is yet another hit from this lesser known label.  Maybe it's just me but if you don't understand the essence of House music, why do you bother to rate the genra?  Folks who rate this album (1) star, just aren't getting it.  Anyway, this album sounds fabulous, booming out the 12inch woofers in my car.  Plenty of bass and the mixing is quality.  What makes this cd a gem is the two rare cuts done by The Timewriter himself, "Did my time" and "So much pain inside."  Both of these cuts make this album swing..... Heavy house thumpin' bass makes them a must if you like The Timewriter.  Good luck finding those two cuts anywhere else.  Terry Lee Brown Jr. is also on the cd.  In the tradition of "Deep House" brought to us by Plastic City, this will do just fine.
