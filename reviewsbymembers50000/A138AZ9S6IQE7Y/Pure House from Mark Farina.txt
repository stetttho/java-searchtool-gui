 Mark Farina known for his jazzy house style get's back to the essence with this house compilation.  The is the purest house I've ever heard from this DJ.  This compilation is nothing but house, disco and even some garage elements.  The mixing on this cd is top notch like everything else I've heard from Mark Farina.  The music selection is great and nothing sounds out of place in this compilation.  Track 6 is a funky disco jam "Scrumpin" followed by "Inhabitions" which has a very garage sound.  Track 11 "Let's Go Disco" is a another funky disco cut.  All the music in this set is great so pick this up when you find it.  Mark Farina doesn't disappoint with this mixed compilation.  He seems to put out one great cd after another.
