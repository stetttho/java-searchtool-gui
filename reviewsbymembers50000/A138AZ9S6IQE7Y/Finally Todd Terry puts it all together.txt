 I've been waiting a while to find a mix done by Todd Terry.  Until now all I've only heard him do regular albums.  Well I'm pleased to say this album bounces.  Todd Terry has been doing house music for a long time and finally I've heard a set from him that puts him up with the best.  He's got some really nice house music mixed in this set.  Since he's be making his own stuff for years I was wondering if he'd include some of it in his mixes.  In this mix he does and it works well with the rest of the set.  There is even some vocal house in this set and that goes well too.  There seems to be a taboo about vocal house music, as if it wasn't real house music.  My opinion is some is good and some is not.  The stuff in this set is good and doesn't take away from the mix one bit.  Martha Walsh has been singing to house beats for years and has done more than one selection with Todd Terry.  I'm glad Todd included her in this set.  The one cut in this set that I find myself listening to the most is "Set it Off."  This has a booming beat and is high energy.  Ironic it should come at the end of the album.  After hearing this I wanted another hour added to the 1:12 minutes of Todd Terry genius.  CD2 has more of the House Music Movement history of House music, great for the house music enthusiast.  Blackout baby.......
