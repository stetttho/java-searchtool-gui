 Just when I was beginning to lose faith in Little Louie Vega, I get my hands on a cd that shows there's still some stuff out there to get. This is not my favorite of Vega's work but it's better than his last two cd's I've rated. Funny thing is Erick Morillo came off a little better than Louie on this two cd set. That's a good thing though because the cd1 Vega mix was good, just found it funny that the "unknown guy" put together a better set on cd2. You get plenty of music with 71+ minutes on Little Louie Vega's mix and another 69+ minutes for Erick Morillo's mix. CD1 has a tribal house feel with the deep beats, deep basslines and the conga rhythms. The mixing and music selection are also good. This set reminds me of the Body & Soul vol. 3 cd if you've heard it before. CD1 gets 4 stars. CD2 is more traditional house. The beats and basslines are deep, and the tempo is a little faster than cd 1. The mixing here is also good quality and the music selection is excellent. One could call this a "happy house" mix. I'll be looking for more Erick Morillo material in the future. CD2 gets 5 stars. Give this double cd set a try.  You get two different styles of house music and both sets are good.  Erick Morillo is hot right now so that makes this extra special.  This is one of the easiest Ministry of Sound cds to find so if you do, jump on it.
