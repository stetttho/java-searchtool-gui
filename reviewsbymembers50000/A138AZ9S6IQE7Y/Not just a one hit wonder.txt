 Ever heard of Eddie Amador? No?  Well have you heard the phrase, "Not everyone understands house music, it's a spiritual thing, a body thing, a soul thing?"  Well Eddie gets the credit for that and it's one of house music's premiere anthems.  Here it is mixed in with 13 other great house/garage tracks. With 14 tracks in all the mix is basically house through track 8 then turns garage.  Not every track but the majority of them.  The cuts all have the deep bass I love and the beats go smoothly together.  Eddie mixes the cuts together well and the music selection is excellent.  If you pretend to be into house music then purchase this ASAP.
