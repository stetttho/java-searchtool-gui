 Volume two of the Twisted Secrets series brings us a more progressive house sound than the first installment (see my review of vol. 1).  Although this CD's music selection isn't quite as good as vol. 1, it still delivers a great house music set.  Typical of the "Twisted" label you get a trancey house blend of music with this CD.  Atypical of "Twisted" is some of the funkier, tribal cuts in the set.  This set has the goods I like such as deep bass, thumpin' beats, quality mixing and a good, solid music selection.  The area that brings this CD even with vol. 1 is the length.  You get a total of just over 64 minutes compared to the 51 minutes of vol. 1.  My cuts of choice are "Back To Black", "Keep On Climbing", "Helios", "First Encounter", and "NY Style."  Let me mention that "NY Style" alone can sell this CD, that's how good this tribal house cut is.  If you enjoyed vol. 1 then you'll probably like this volume also.  If you're into the house sound of "Twisted America" CDs then you'll get more of the same goodness right here.
