 This is a real funky house CD.  The beats are tight and deep enough to boom the speakers in your jeep.  This sounds very much like the house sound of the west coast ie: Doc Martin.  If you like house music with some kick and a light latin flavor then this will do nicely. "Burnin" and "Dave on Guitar" are two of my favorites on this CD.  The mixing is good and the variety is wide, not just straight house from start to finish.  A nice addition to any house music collection.
