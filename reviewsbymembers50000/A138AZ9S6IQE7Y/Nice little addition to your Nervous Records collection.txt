 Nervous Records puts together another nice house cd compilation mix, this one done by Jonny D.  This is good cd with all the things I like in house music, strong bass, boomin beats, good mixing and a good selection of house cuts.  This is one of those cds that I'd advise an avid HousERaT to pick up but not necessarily a beginner.  This is a fine addition to an already existing collection but not one I'd start a collection with.  If you've been into house music for some time then this should do nicely. My only complaint about the cd is the lack of demanding cuts, you know, those jams that make you get up and dance at the club even when you didn't actually plan to.  Still, this cd does have a small few of those classics and some other nice cuts including "Bumped Off", "Work Me Goddamit!", "Musek", "Play the World", and "The Bomb!"  Whether you're into house music or other forms of electronic music give this a try.  If you're familiar with the quality products Nervous Records puts out then you'll definately want to pick this up.
