 This is my second review for Erick Morillo and I'm proud to say he doesn't disappoint.  With the exception of Roger Sanchez, Erick is the only other DJ that's received a 5 star rating for a double cd set.  Erick displays a nice variety of house music styles in these two sets.  All the things I like in house music are found here, thumping beats, deep bass, quality mixing and a great music selection.  In all, you get over 145 minutes of jamming house music fun. CD 1 is the party stater cd with funky house, disco/vocal anthems and underground sounds.  Coming in at over 73 minutes you get just the right amount of hits to get folks on the dancefloor.  Cuts of choice are "Bringin' The Funk", "Night @ The Black", "Watcha Perrita" and "Release."  The only cut on the first set I didn't care for was "Bel Amour."  On it's own this would rate a 5 star set but because I'm rating it with another set that's just a little better this set receives 4.75 stars. CD 2 is the late night party set.  When folks are already on the dancefloor and need good music to keep them there, this set get's the job done.  The tone and feel of this 73+ minute set is underground (music you're not likely to hear on the radio).  No vocal house here, just bangin' beats and tribal rhythms with some speed garage thrown in.  I like my house music raw and this set is certainly raw, lacking the top 100 hits everyone has heard.  Cuts of choice are "Moments", "Mr. Jingles", "Wack M.F." and "Harmonizer."  This set has no weaknesses and every track is good.  This set rates 5 stars. Erick Morillo, let me say that again... Erick Morillo!  This guy is two for two in 5 star cds (I gave him 5 stars on the "House Nation" cd with Louie Vega).  If you can get your hands on his work, you're likely to get a shining example of house music.
