 It seems Todd Terry has is name in everything.  This particular album has a nice blend of deep house beats.  The Martha Walsh sample in "Clear away the past" is nice, and the extra version is a bonus.  It would have been nice to have this album include a mix of all the cuts.  I really wish Todd Terry would start doing that more in his album releases.  Overall a really nice album.  There is plenty of good stuff to use in your next party.
