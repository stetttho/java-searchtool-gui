 For those people who love the house sound of Erick Morillo as much as I do, we are blessed on this CD with the talents of one of his protgs Thick Dick a.k.a. E-Smoove.  Not only did E-Smoove put together a very nice compilation but he also wrote and produced all the tracks.  I suspect we'll hear more from E-Smoove in the future. For starters let me state this is not a CD for minors.  The language is very mature and there are many sexual references.  This kind of sexually charged house music is of great interest to me and is just the thing to get a party hyped up.  The beats are deep and the mixing is excellent.  Usually when an artist puts together a compilation of his own stuff, it's usually in track form without being mixed.  E-Smoove continues to demonstrate his genius by mixing the cuts together into an incredible set.  You get a total of 65+ minutes of original house music from one I imagine will be a big contributor to the house music scene for years to come.  The combination of tribal and deep house on this CD creates an excellent music selection and the arrangement of the tracks is also top notch.  The set starts off nice and ends just as well.  Some of these tracks you've probably heard before, but now you'll know and be able to appreciate the mastermind behind them. My cuts of choice are "Touch The Sky", "Welcome 2 The Jungle", "Dark", "Orgasm", "Bounce", and "Mind F..k."  E-Smoove is a skilled technician as well as creator and couldn't have a better mentor than "More" Morillo.  This is a no-brainer 5 star CD and I hope this is the first of many more from Thick Dick.  I've been seduced by "Tribal Seduction" and I'm sure you'll be too.
