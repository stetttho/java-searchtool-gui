 Twisted Secrets is a three part underground house music series from the "Twisted America" label.  All three CDs credit DJ Rob Di Cradle with beatmixing the music.  I've never heard of this guy outside of these three CDs.  The executive producer on all three cds is Rob Di Stefano, who I'm guessing is using the Rob Di Cradle moniker.  Twisted Secrets is a great attempt at bringing underground house to you via CD.  All the tracks listed are from independent label releases of the 12' inch records.  Supposedly they've never been released on CD until now.  Even though these are dated CDs (1997, 1998), they still has some quality music.  I've been sitting on these CDs for some time now trying to decide how to rate them.  Well here goes. This CD is one of the best "Twisted America" CDs I own.  It's also one of the shortest, coming in at just over 51 minutes.  The length almost cost this cd some points but I've decided that this 51-minute ride is still worth the money (especially if you can find this CD cheap somewhere).  Everything I like in house music is here, deep bass, booming beats, quality mixing and an excellent music selection.  The tone and feel of this CD is very much like other "Twisted America" releases, namely "Twist This Pussy 2."  This is like a deep, underground, psychedelic style of house, with lots of electronic tones and background sounds.  The music is very full and seldom will you have empty spaces within the tracks.  My cuts of choice are "In The Jungle", "Tree Frog", "Nassaur Bassed Party", and "MMMM Baby." For the series this CD has the best music selection.  As stated before it's a bit short so if you want plenty of music for you money this may not be for you.  If you like bangin' house music with enough beats to make you dance, then give this CD a try.
