 I think it would have been nice to have at least one cut of Van Helden's own work in this mix.  The beats are deep and powerful but "don't shut me out" and "rythum god's of the underworld" definitely sell this album.  The only negative is this mix contains different types of House.  Some of the cuts are smooth, some have an electronic flavor, while others are the traditional NYC, Underground House that sets the tone for the genre.  I prefer continuity in House mixes and this album seems to lack that.  If you don't mind that then this mix will work fine.
