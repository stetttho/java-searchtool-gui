 Although my focus is mainly deep house music, the HousERaT can get down with the tranceheads also.  Brian Transeau (BT) gets live with the Perfecto trance style that's earned him the title of "Second In Command."  I've been digging this guy for some time  now and his music still seems mystic and magical.  I've also heard him mix up the trance/house on Radio 1, but this stuff here on his album is like nothing else I've heard. This is a two cd set so you get plenty of music for your money.  CD2 also includes a 42 minute mix of the album singles by the one and only Sasha, so that alone should get folks interested in this.  CD1 is not mixed but it has a nice set of trance/perfecto originals from BT.  Cuts of choice are "Embracing The Future", "Deeper Sunshine", "Loving You More (BT's Garden of Ima Dub)", and "Poseidon."  This is a mild trance sound that can easily be mixed with straight house music and the beats are kinda deep too.  If you want to get away from house music for a little bit then try this on for size.  BT doesn't disappoint.
