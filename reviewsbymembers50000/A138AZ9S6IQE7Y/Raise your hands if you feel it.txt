 Before I heard this album Tedd Patterson was unknown to me.  After hearing this the name will always be in my mind.  This is quite possible one of the biggest sleeper albums ever.  Booming from start to finish this cd has it all in house music compilations... good mixing, excellent music, deep bass and attitude.  By attitude I mean the music grabs you out of your seat and throws you on the dancefloor.  This is not a cd with one or two good jams and the rest "filler" music.  Just about any one of these cuts could get you out of your seat and get you asking someone to dance. The cd style is progressive house with some disco mixed in nicely.  The mixing is top notch and the beats go together well.  Nothing seems vastly out of place in this set.  The beats are jazzy, soulfull and beg you to have a good time.  If there was such a thing as "happy house" this would be it.  "Love Changes" is the cut that starts it off with a funky housy Disco beat and a real nasty, dirty, stankin' bassline.  If I heard nothing else but this cut I would have been pressed to buy the album.  The sweet thing is there's plenty more to come for a total of 69 minutes of good house music.  The final cut is a very soulful, jazzy cut called "Love & Understanding," which ends the mix on a very sensual, sexy note.  Throughout the mix you'll hear a man say "Raise your hands if you feel it" and if I'm lucky enough to hear this at a club I'll be doing just that.
