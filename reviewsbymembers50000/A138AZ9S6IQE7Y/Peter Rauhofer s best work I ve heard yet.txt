 Known for all his work on the "Twisted America" label, Peter Rauhofer brings us a 5 star mix on another label.  This set which is mixed by Club 69 (Peter's ... twin) is his finest work yet.  The music selection is top notch and the mixing is excellent.  Later productions by Club 69 have more of a trancy, euro sound but this set is pure house, with no additives and no preservatives.  The beats are deep and boomin', with lots of electronic sounds in the background.  This is vintage stuff that would make you dance your feet off at the club.  Cuts of choice are "Stormy Black", "Clear", and "Holding On To Your Love."  If you find this cd you'd be wise to pick it up.  It's a solid house cd with no weaknesses.
