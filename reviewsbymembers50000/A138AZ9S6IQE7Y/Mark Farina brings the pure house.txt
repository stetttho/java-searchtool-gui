 One day as I was digging through the cd boxes I came across this old jem.  This hard to find cd is one of Mark Farina's best.  In fact this is my favorite Mark Farina mix.  Consistant with the Farina laid back, jazzy house style, this cd is probably the most pure house I've heard of him.  Totalling 62 minutes of pure house music fun, this cd will keep you bouncing with the excellent mixing, fine music selection, thumping bassline and strictly dance tempo. My cuts of choice are "My Life", "Two", "Past", and "I Got You."  All the things I like in a house mix are here, so if you've read any of my other reviews you know this is a jammin' cd.  This cd will have your feet tappin', your fingers snappin' and your head bouncing from start to finish.  This isn't just a cd for dancing, as the smooth Farina style lets you just chill if you like.  So far Farina is 3 for 3 in my book and subsequently 3 for 3 on my top 25 5-star list.  If you can get your hands on a copy of this, jump on it.
