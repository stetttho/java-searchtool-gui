 Are you kidding me?  This cd is one of the most innovative compilations I've ever heard.  There is plenty of latin influenced beats and smooth rhythm, with some Tribal thrown in.  The mixing is top notch and once the tempo is established (it starts out kinda slow), this cd booms all the way to the end.  This is basically an instrumental house cd and is very jazzy.  If you're looking for some crossover, Billboard Top 100's disco, then stay away from this.  If you want house music that's new and fresh then step to this.
