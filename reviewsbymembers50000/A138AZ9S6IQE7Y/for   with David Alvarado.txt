 This is the second CD I've purchased for this artist.  This is also his best work so far.  United DJs of America vol 15 was very good, but this title is better.  I imagine both will get lots of play time in my car.... anyway... This CD is equally as deep as United DJs but this one is a bit more funky.  If you were housin' it on the dancefloor you'd be forced to pound your feet, the beats are thumping so hard. "Stay The Night" really gets the beat pounding and "Spirit of the Black Ghost" follows for a very nice one/two punch combo. Later on in the mix you get "Happiness" and It's Getting Bigger" for another deep combo.  This isn't to take away from the other cuts on this cd because they're all quality House.  The mix flows nicely and the beats are all thumping good.  You won't need to skip any of the tracks in this CD.
