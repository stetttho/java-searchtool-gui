 One of the lesser known house labels (but quality) "Afterhours" comes off with another sweet mix, this time from DJ Heather.  I've done reviews for other Afterhours mixes, (Comp.One & Garden of Eden) and they seem to have a good idea of what's going on in electronic music. This cd has the tone of aggressive house music, not hard house but aggressive progressive, very much in the same vein as the "Can You Feel It" cd by Charles Feelgood.  This has a fast tempo and is very energetic.  No chance of you falling asleep through this set.  There's plenty of booming beats and enough bass for any deep house nut out there.  The mixing is good and the choice of music is excellent.  There is hardly any vocals here but the set still comes of nice.  Cuts of choice are "Mind Magic", "Groove On", Expansion Module", "All In My Mind", "10", "Shake It For Me", and "Window Pain."  This cd has 16 cuts and almost all of them are slamming.  Nothing wrong with this one.
