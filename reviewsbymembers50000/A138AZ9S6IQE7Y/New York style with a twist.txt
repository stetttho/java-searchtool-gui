 Ahhhhhhh..... House music all night long.  Been awhile since I've heard a good house cd with a NY foundation.  Strange thing about this album is that it has kinda a California tone to it, the house music is jazzy.  This reminds me of Farina and Alvarado, but still maintains the NY thumping sound.  Every single track is deep and soulful and the bass is definately in this mix.  DJ Cosmo does a wonderful job of mixing this music and she's someone I'd go to listen to at any club.  If you like jazzy house music with some tribal thrown in, then this is for you.  This cd will keep you shaking your rump from start to finish.  If you can't dance to this, then you can't dance..... PERIOD! nuff said......
