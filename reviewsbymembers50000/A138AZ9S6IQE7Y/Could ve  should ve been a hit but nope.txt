 Hmmmmmmm, where do I start with this third installment?  This reminds me of the story about the little engine that could, only in reverse.  This CD is the little engine that couldn't.  Like vol. 1 this CD is only a mere 51+ minutes long.  I thought the folks producing the series figured out this mistake from the first volume.  Apparently they didn't and the second volume was just a fluke.  Don't be fooled into thinking I give bad ratings just because of the length of a CD.  Vol. 1 received 5 stars because the set didn't have any weaknesses in spite of the length.  This CD is a whole other story.  The mixing, beats, and bass are all good but the music selection drags the rating way down.  Too bad, because this easily could have been another 5 star hit from "Twisted America."  Track #9 "Girls In Love" doesn't belong on this CD no way, no shape, no how!  It almost seems the cut was added as a joke.  Bad move because I didn't think it was funny and including that stupid song ruined what was turning out to be a real funky set.  My cuts of choice are " Arp Impressions", "So Sweet", The Bells of Revolution" and "The Wall."   Most of the selections are the trancey house variety, becoming heavily trance influenced towards the end of the set. This was a good series and the first two volumes were excellent although in some cases a little short.  Considering how this CD ended I'm glad it's the last one of the series.  I've reviewed other sets that were going alone just fine then were sabotaged by a song or two that didn't belong.  If you like continuity in your mixed sets then stay away from those like this one.  Fortunately the bad apple comes at the end of the set so it doesn't break up the mix.  Just keep in mind that instead of having a 51-minute mix, now you have a 45-minute mix plus one song.  This set starts out great and holds it's own until the end.  Then disaster strikes.  Nuff said!
