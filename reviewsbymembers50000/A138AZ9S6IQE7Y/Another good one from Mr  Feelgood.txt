 Charles Feelgood is back at it again after his stellar cd "Can You Feel It."  This cd is also an excellent addition to your house music collection but not quite as good as his first cd.  This is house music with a touch of trance at the end of the set.  You get 14 tracks in all (13 if you only count "Sing it Back" once) covering over 72 minutes of dancing fun.  The music selection is good but Feelgood did a better job on his first cd.  The mixing is also good and the music has some deep funky basslines.  My cuts of choice are "Moving Cites", "Here Comes That Sound", and "Fly."  This is a great cd but not perfect.  If you want more of the same but just a little better, check the first cd "Can You Feel It."
