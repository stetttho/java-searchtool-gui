 After digging through the crates I've stumbled once again upon another great classic. This time we have another of the archived treasures of Mark Farina. Imperial Dub Volume 1 is a journey into the funk house world and Mark Farina delivers with the high quality we've come to expect. This set is pure house music with some intense funk elements as the foundation. There is even some heavy tribal percussion, which adds a whole different flavor from standard, garden-variety house music. In some ways this compares to the "United DJs of America #9" CD featuring Mark Farina, minus the strong disco elements. This set has no disco elements and focuses mostly on house and funk. This set has all the stuff I like in house music, excellent mixing, great music selection and deep booming beats. This quality set lasts over 69 minutes so you get plenty of music. My cuts of choice are "Format", "Hasta Lluego Mi Hermano", "HealingDUB", "We Used To Dance", and "There Is No Revolution." This is not to discredit the titles not listed as this set really has no weaknesses and depending on the day of the week I do this review, I could very well have chose other titles. All the cuts are good and you should have no problem jamming to any of them. This is one of those CDs I'd recommend to anyone interested in house music. This is strictly an instrumental CD so if you want vocals then check elsewhere. Whether you're a house music novice or veteran this CD is worthy of your ear.
