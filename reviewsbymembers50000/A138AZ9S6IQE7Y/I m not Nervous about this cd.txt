 Like deep house?  O.k. go and buy this cd as soon as you can.  This cd from the cats at Nervous Records is an awesome compilation mixed by C.J. Mackintosh.  The smooth boomin' beats start with track 1 "Time For Love" by Kim English.  She's done a a few cuts for Nervous Records and they all slam.  Track 2 "Oohhh Baby" is the ultimate party jam with the deep pounding bass and the rather naughty chorus line.  This will get any party stated.  The beats keep pounding right up to track 5 with the "Gigolo's Anthem" by Gigolo Supreme.  This guy plays a mean saxophone over some boomin beats and he's done some other stuff for Nervous in the past.  Each of the tracks on this cd deserve some comments but I'll stop here. The mixing done on this album is good and the beats go along smooth.  Nothing here sounds out of place and everything rocks from start to finish.  You can't go wrong with this cd or pretty much anything done by Nervous Records.
