 This is an excellent album for House fans. Deep, thumping beats keep the sound moving. "Plastic City" seems to have a few good artists like this and one would be wise to check them out. If you like the pounding style of Terry Lee Brown Jr. then you should like this also. Lots of variety and even a little "New Age" sound thrown in.
