 This is one fine mix done with instrumental and a little vocal house music.  The mix goes along smoothly and the house is pounding and deep.  The DJ (who remains unknown) ends the mix on a techno tip but still does it nicely.  Don't let the generic name of this cd fool you, this is a well done mix that will keep you moving and grooving.
