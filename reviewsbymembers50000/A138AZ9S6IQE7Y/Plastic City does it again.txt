 For those of you that have been graced by other titles off the Plastic City label, this one is a must.  This album has the same feel as "Jigsaw Pieces" by the Timewriter.  The beats are deep with just an air of Electronic mixed in.  The beats are mixed from track to track so it sounds like a continueous mix.  Nice job Terry.  The album starts out nice then finishes on a really "deep house" note. For those looking for a House sound just a little different than that typical NY style House CD, this is a must buy.
