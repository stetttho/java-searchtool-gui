 I'm happy to say my first experience in the French Sessions series was an excellent one.  I've heard for some time now that the series was quality but I must say, if the rest of the series is this good you'll be seeing more reviews.  This set mixed by DJ Deep is just that... Deep!  Many people make the claim of delivering deep house music but DJ Deep is telling the truth.   This is deep house at it's best.  You get plenty of music for you money with this set, clocking in at over 72 minutes.  Everything I like in house music is here, deep bass, thumpin' beats, excellent mixing and an awesome music selection.  The feel and tone of the set is laid back garage and house.  You could listen to this set relaxing around the house or you could just as easily jam to this at the club.  Either way this set gets the job done.  The majority of the selections are vocal and they fit well with the few instrumental cuts.  The set starts out strong and doesn't let up until it's finished.  If one tried to be picky one might say the last track could have been put at the beginning of the set.  Even though the last track relaxes the tempo for a quick minute, you don't lose the groove and the placement of the track doesn't take away from the quality of the set.  My cuts of choice are "Rain", "Do You Want Me", "Seasons Of Love", "Rise Above The Storm", "Love Your Brother", "Come Into My Room", and "Feel The Music." In summary this CD has no weaknesses.  I would recommend this set to anyone that likes dance music.  HousERaTs like myself should put this on their wishlist.
