 This cd had lots of potential in the beginning but I think it ended up being a disappointment.  The tracks are good on their own but they don't belong together in a compilation.  This cd flows terrible, thus my less than stellar rating.  Drum & Bass and House mixed in the same compilation?  Not yet anyway... I look forward to the person that can do it successfully.  For all you houserats out there that want a nice flowing cd with superior beats try the third installment of the Body & Soul series (ironically shown as the cd cover for vol 2 at Amazon.com).  It's a much better mix and the house is much deeper.
