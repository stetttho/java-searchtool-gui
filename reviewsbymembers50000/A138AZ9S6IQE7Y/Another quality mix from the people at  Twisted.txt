 This was a tricky album to rate for the HousERaT. Thumpin' house beats, good mixing, excellent music selection but.... questionable lyrics? Questionable lyrics? Yes! Familiar with Peter Rauhofer, aka Club 69 (and a whole bunch of other names I won't mention here)? Well he's one of the main architects for the "Twisted America" label and a high quality house dj/producer. For the most part I really like his work, however once in a while his lifestyle shines in his work and poses a real turn off for me. Run a search for "Club 69", look at some of the cd covers and you'll understand what I'm talking about. I'm not into alternative lifestyles and don't really care to hear about it in the music I listen to, especially if I'm listening with my girl. If you have no issue with that then you'll be just fine with this set. The cut in question is "Drama" and is a really deep, funky, boomin' house beat but the lyrics disgust me. If this had been the instrumental version of the cut I'd have no problem with it at all. Anyway, the rest of the set is good and certainly deserves 5 stars. You've got deep house with a nice fast tempo. You also have a few familiar names like Tenaglia, Amador and the Funky Green Dogs. You won't have any problems moving your feet to this stuff. My cuts of choice are "House Music", Perfect Love" and then cuts 10 through 16. I've decided not to let my personal preference in lifestyle take away from my rating of this album. I do however feel it necessary to warn the novice. Overall this is an excellent mix with all the things I like in house music. This will make a fine addition to your house collection not withstanding what I've stated.
