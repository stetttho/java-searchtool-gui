 Steve Lawler is quickly establishing himself as one of the new crew favorites in the house music genre. If you know about the HousERaT then you know I like my house music deep. Lawler doesn't disappoint with his third cd Dark Drums Vol #2. All the things I like in house music are here, deep beats, excellent mixing and a great music selection. You get all this in a nice 72+ minute package that shows you some of the good stuff, in this hard-to-find subdivision of house. It isn't easy finding cds composed only of tribal house but Steve Lawler seems to have a nack for it. Cuts of choice are "The Darwins Theory", "Shake", "Sound of The Floor", and "Ill Be Your Friend/Moonraker." This is an excellent mix which displays a great example of tribal house music. For those that found the "Homelands" CD, if you liked it, this one is just as good. Whether you be a newbie or a house veteran this mix has something for you.
