 This is a re-review of the house cd that started it all for the HousERaT. This is a thumping house cd from the west coast master Doc Martin. This 67+ minute mix is live from start to finish. The mixing is excellent with a great music selection. From the very start of the set the music captures your interest and doesn't let go for over an hour. Cuts of choice are "Latin Sequel", Terry's House", "Wickety Wack" "The Way We Used To", Safe Mode Pt. 1", and "Got To Feel It." Actually all the cuts are good but I figured I should name a few. Some of the selections sound just a little different than I've heard in other sets. I believe Doc Martin did some remixing of these cuts or perhaps mixed some of the beats while creating the set. Either way it gives orginality to set and delivers a unique flavor. Doc Martin gets nothing but respect for this job well done. I just wish I could find more Doc Martin goodies. If you're starting out in house or a veteran, this set is a great addition to your collection
