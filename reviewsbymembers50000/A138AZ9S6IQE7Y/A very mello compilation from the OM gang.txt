 Let me start of by saying this would have been a 3 1/2 stars if the rating system allowed.  This isn't a bad album, it just isn't really what I want in house music.  The folks at OM have a history of making good stuff, just keep in mind not all of it is house music.  This mix starts out o.k. then picks up by track 2 "Mo(ve)ments," followed by "Cut Less Supreme" & "Fooling Myself."  The cd takes a turn for the worst after track 6 with a list of jams that are, for lack of a better discription, empty.  The saving grace for the second part of the mix is track 14 "Distance" by West Magnetic.  It's an off tempo jam that reminds me of the classic house jam "Jump" from the early 90's.  Sad thing is it's less than three minutes and really doesn't fit with the rest of the later tracks. This cd is a bumpy ride and isn't one I'll play all the time.  If I were going on a long ride and wanted some background house music to listen to while talking to friends, this would suffice.
