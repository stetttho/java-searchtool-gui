 HTB gets busy again bringing us that smooth jazzy lounge style house music as in Club H Vol. 1.  This cd scores slightly less than Vol. 1 because it's just a little more mello.  It's a good set but not my first choice of house music to get my bouncing.  The style is jazzy and is kinda sexy, and the mood of this cd is one for lounging or cleaning the house, doing paperwork or going on a long drive.  This is not agressive house and is less thumping than Vol. 1.  Still, this is a great cd with nice mixing and a nice music selection.  All the jazz house here fits together well to make a very relaxing house set.  You don't often put together house music and relaxing but believe it or not HTB makes it work.  You get your money's worth with this 70+ minute mix. Cuts of choice are "51 Days", "All This Music", and "He Didn't Know."  If you're into jazz house from the likes of Kevin Yost, or David Alvarado then you should like this cd also.  Keep in mind this isn't really a dance cd as it really isn't strong enough for the clubs, but it's definately a nice joyride into the world of house music.  This isn't a title I'd suggest to start your house collection but certainly a nice addition.
