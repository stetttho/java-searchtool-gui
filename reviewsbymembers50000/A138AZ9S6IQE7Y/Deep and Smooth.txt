 For those that like their house music bumping and soulful, this artist is the man to check out.  This album is a great sample of deep and rhythmic housemusic.  Devoid of the agressive style of techno-house or hardhouse, this album is mello but makes you want to shake you butt just the same.  If you like the base in your music then you'll be satisfied with this.  The latin influence is evident in this album also.  The overall vibe of this CD is "sexy."  If you're going to a house party with your girl or guy, throw this in the CD player on the way there and this will get you in the mood to dance....... maybe even something more......
