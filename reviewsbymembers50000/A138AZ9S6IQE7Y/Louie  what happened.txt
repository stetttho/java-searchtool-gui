 Let me start out by saying I really like Lil' Louie Vega.  In fact I have a few of his cd's.  This is by far the worst of the lot.  CD1 starts with "The Warning" and "Luv Dancin'".  Now if you know anything about House music, you'll know these are two timeless classics.  I knew after hearing these two cuts back-to-back this was gonna be an awesome double cd set.  NOT! You get one more great classic "Follow me" and then CD1 fades from that point on, getting a little worse with each cut.  At the end of CD1 the tone turns Techno.  If you know anything about me from my other reviews you'll know I like my House deep... real deep. CD2? "What You Need", "Got Funk?" and later on "The Buddah Khan Theme."  Besides those cuts this cd is hit or miss.  Either you'll like it or you won't.  Quite a few of these cuts, like many on CD1 didn't move me.  I know this was supposed to be a compilation covering 10 years but I have to believe there were better titles to choose from to make these two mixes. If you need a fix of some good Louie Vega I suggest you get "United DJ's vol 2" or the even more rare "Underground Network NYC."  If these were sold at Amazon, I'd rate both 5 stars.
