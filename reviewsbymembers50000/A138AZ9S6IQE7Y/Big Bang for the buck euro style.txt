 For the money you can't beat this nice, two, thick cd combo from Deep Dish.  Both of these cd's are over 78 minutes each so you get a lot of music.  Trust me, it's good music too. The sound of this double cd set is very euro, in fact if I weren't looking at the label right now, I'd swear this was a "Plastic City" cd.  Both sets are very nice house mixes with a touch of trance.  The house here is very synthetic and spacey sounding a lot like a cross between The Timewriter and BT.  This isn't my first choice in house style but it makes for a very unique house sound that rocks pretty much from the beginning of cd 1 to the end of cd 2.  The mixing and music selection is good, ranging from deep house to disco to trance, all the while maintaining a smooth house tempo.  Cuts of choice are "Dep Lounge 2", "Here I Am", "Listen", and "Tall Stories" from CD1.  "The N.Y. Experience", "Slid", and "Slippin' Into Darkness", rounds out CD2.  Wanna rock to some psychedelic house beats for over two hours?  Take these two cds and call me in the morning.
