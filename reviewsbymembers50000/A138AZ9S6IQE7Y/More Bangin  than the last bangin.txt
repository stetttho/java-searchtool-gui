 My latest review takes us into the fast paced world of DJ Sneak.  Having some of the most energetic house compilations on the market, DJ Sneak is pretty much a guarantee to keep you moving for the length of the set.  Like his compadre Armand Van Heldon, Sneak keeps the high-energy beats coming one after the other.  This is my second Sneak CD and without question I can assure you it's my favorite. This set includes the things I like in house music, deep beats, quality mixing, good music selection and enough tracks to keep you dancing for awhile.  This set clocks in at just over 73 minutes so you get plenty of music for your money.  The style of the set is mainly good old-fashioned, instrumental house music.  If I had to compare the style to another CD it would have to be DJ Heather's "Tangerine" set.  Ironically this set is just as good and gets just as many props from me (see my "Tangerine" review). My cuts of choice in this set are "Wanna Sing", "Locomotion", "Mochico #1" "The Beatz", "Shhh!" and "Don't Move."  I almost hate picking favorites in this set since all the cuts are good.  If you like explosive house music without making the transition over to hardhouse the check this out.  Similar style reviews are done for the "Tangerine" and the "House Music: Dusk Till Dawn Vol 1" CDs.  Take it from the HousERaT, this is a great CD and deserves the excellent rating.
