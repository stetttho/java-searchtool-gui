 One of two titles released so far by Charles Feelgood, this is the better of the two.  "Can You Feel It?" is the perfect title for this album.  The beat of this is really up tempo.  Not so fast as to qualify for hardhouse, but definately some of the fastest progressive house I've heard.  The cd comes out the blocks fast with "Come on Home" then backs it with "Blue Boogaloo."  These two cuts should let you know this is gonna be a high energy, thumpin' cd.  "Sunday Shoutin" is my other favorite on this cd.  If you like pounding, upbeat, house music that's just a little more aggressive than typical progressive house music, then this cd is one you'll want to try on for size.
