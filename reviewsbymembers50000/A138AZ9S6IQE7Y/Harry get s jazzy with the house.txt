 Like jazz?  Like house?  O.k. here is jazzy house for you.  In the same vein as Kevin Yost and David Alvarado, Harry The Bastard brings us more of that funky jazz stuff that seems to make you want to dance as well as just sit and chill to.  This cd has all the things I like in house music mixes, deep bass, thumpin' beats, good mixing and a good selection of music.  HTB delivers in all areas for 70+ minutes of house music jammin'.  The intro for this cd is one of the best I've ever heard.  You're brought slowly into this house groove that sucks you in and keeps you there until the entire set is done.  Many of the selections have a heavy keyboard influnce which reminds me of BT (The Perfecto artist).  The set is basically divided into two mixes, tracks 1-6 and 7-12.  Cuts of choice are "Deep In It", "Space Jazz Carnival", and "Dmare Lechauve", (which I wish was about 3 minutes longer than the 1:37 we get).  This is an excellent addition to any house music collection, and because of the jazzy overtones, many types of music lovers will enjoy this also.
