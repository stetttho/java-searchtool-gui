 House and Trance done right.  This cd is for high octane HousERaTs, with some really aggressive house and trance beats this cd booms.  As I've stated before, if you're familiar with the awesome stuff Nervous Records puts out then jump on this little jem.  Nervous brings us this psychedelic house set wonderfully mixed by DJ Rio.  The overall tone of this cd is boomin' house underground (stuff you'll only hear at the club) with a trance aftertaste.  I'm not really a huge fan of trance but it's so wonderfully blended together with deep aggressive house in this mix that you can't help but like it.  Cuts that make this mix are "Universal #1", "Women Beat Their Men", "Music is Pumping", "Deeper Sound of House", "The Music", "My House" and "Hot 4 U."  Starting to get the picture?  Basically this whole cd slams.  When this 63 minute adventure ended I could only think, "I want more of that."  If you like booming house music that takes no prisoners then you have to get this cd.  You won't be disappointed.
