 First, I want to thank so many of your for your kind words, both here and to me directly.  The response has been very gratifying. The style and approach of the book were chosen deliberately, and while they seem to satisfy almost everyone, they don't delight everyone.  That is to be expected.  I wanted a book that people would read and respond to, and that might affect their behavior.  This was the best way I knew how, and the responses suggest that if it wasn't the best possible choice, it was a good choice. Thanks. The best is yet to come, by the way, next September--I am convinced of it. One final word, to the reviewer who assumed I could not have meant "pervasive" or "synecdoche" in my discussion of stories.  I did mean that the use of this device is pervasive rather than persuasive--the device isn't intended to persuade anyone, but it is very widely used, and therefore "pervasive."  And I did mean "synecdoche" rather than "anecdote," as the reviewer suggests, for the reasons I mention in the text.  Synecdoche refers, among many writers, to the technique of illustrating a larger point with a smaller, specific story. My books are more often criticized for appearing too simple and down-to-earth rather than too complex or ethereal.  In this case, I appear to have confused at least this reviewer, and I try to avoid this. Again, I am delighted that so many of you appear to have benefitted from this book.   I certainly have; oddly enough, its words constantly remind me of what I must do to attract and keep customers.  Just as oddly, this advice seems to  help me immensely. Best wishes to you all, dissenters included, Harry Beckwith
