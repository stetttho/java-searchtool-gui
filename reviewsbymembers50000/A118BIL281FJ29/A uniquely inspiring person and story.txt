 I've had the extraordinary privilege to meet the author and read her books.  I am not a cancer patient, but I know an extraordinary person when I meet one because it rarely happens.  Anyone-sufferer or not-will be deeply inspired by Christine's story, her spirit, her will, and her example.  She can change your life.  And while that is occuring, she makes sure that you, as she urges everyone daily, "don't forget to laugh."
