 It's good to exposed to Gladwell's thinking.  It can stretch you a bit.  And we need to encourage good writing-that is, writing that is clear, intelligent, and crisp.  All that said, there's little other than the above of value.  It's remarkably thin,  actually, especially on reflection.  His apparent point of view is that snap judgments are good, except when they aren't.  And everything he offers suggests that snap judgments-or at least those he discusses-are neither snap nor judgments.  They are conclusions based on years of experience.  In the end, this book dissolves into very little.  You cannot say you learned much from it, or even were coaxed toward deeper understanding and insight.  All you can say is that you may, or may not, have enjoyed the ride.  That books like these are our best sellers may be the most compelling information to glean from all of this.  There's not much here here, to steal and paraphrase from Gertrude Stein.  .   All this said, I will at least scan his next book, simply because the author gets access to some interesting studies on human behavior.  We're better served by his New Yorker articles, not  least of all because they are as long as they need to be to impart the information.    Maybe a 3.5.  And I do hope he keeps reporting, because he covers what others do not.
