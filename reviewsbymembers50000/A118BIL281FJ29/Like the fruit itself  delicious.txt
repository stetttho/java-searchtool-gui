 For twenty years I have given this book to recent high school graduates, carefully inscribing each book to encourage them to see what McPhee reveals here.  What he reveals most vividly is the idea that there is no such thing as an uninteresting subject; there is only an uninterested reader.  What also impressed me, decades ago, was the notion of connectedness, and the idea that one thing-an orange, a diamond, iron, oil, lead-could reveal everything about our world.  Finally, he deserves five stars because he never gets in the way of his subject, and he has moments of such brilliance-his devotional to Otto, the restauranteur, still ranks as a great moment in writing, fiction or non-that everyone should read him.  My favorite of a shelfull of McPhees, with the Headmaster in a virtual dead heat.
