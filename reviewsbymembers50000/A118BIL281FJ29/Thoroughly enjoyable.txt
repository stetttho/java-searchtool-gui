 Manchester is readable, which helps many of us who try to see this era through modern eyes, and struggle.  Without question, he has little regard for the papacy during this period, and one wonders how many of the two and one star reviews here are from Catholics.    But I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  The title suggests something close to genius, and there are many moments in the book that approached that.  We need more books like this.
