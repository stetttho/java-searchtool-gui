 Confession: I read too little fiction.  That said, when I overhear a whisper comparing a writer to Fitzgerald, I listen, because there are so many moments in Gatsby, not least of all the final lines, that make a reader-or at least this one reader-long for those moments of genius, or something close.  But.  I actually found myself thinking the Mcinerney was aware of the Fitzgerald comparison-and how could he not be?  If you write fiction about the rich in America, you have to be aware of the parallel!-and tried now and then to channel Fitzgerald, and to write a few flourishes that compared with F. Scott's best.  But if I was aware of the writer's effort, that suggests the problem: his effort was transparent and strained, and he failed.  Granted, it's not fair to say an author isn't Fitzgerald, and therefore deserves no better than a three.  But this book falls even shorter than that, to this reader.  It verges on pulp, and there's not one observation he makes were I-or many other readers-might go, "Wow!", that moment we live for as readers.  There's not one of those, and there are too many others where I found myself racing to the book's conclusion and its end-of my diappointment.     This is it?  This is worthy?  Not to me.  They will make a pretty bad movie of this, Jay will cash in, and the rest of us will wait to see if someone-anyone-in America can write a truly worthy novel.
