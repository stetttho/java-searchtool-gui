 I am being generous with my two stars, in deference to the man who wrote Harvest.  Simply put, Neil needs a lyricist, and perhaps a muse.  Listening to this, it seemed Neil looked around at what was clearly in view from his chair-his daughter, his guitar, his memory of the guy who sold him his ranch-came up with a tune and a hook, and then stuck with his first draft.  In acting, they call this mailing it in, and Neil mailed these lyrics in-or at least that's the better view to the one that suggests he has become lyric-deaf after all his years.  This could've been a four.  It just needed some words.
