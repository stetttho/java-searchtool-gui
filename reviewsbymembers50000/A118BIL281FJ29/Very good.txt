 We need to encourage books like these.  Collins' teams research exhaustively, look deep, and help readers understand what makes a difference in business, day by day and year after year.  His work has inspired thousands of companies to define their purposes and visions; that's a good result, especially as I see peopple realize the value of getting clarity on who they are and why they come to work each day.  I wish Mr. Collins would resist the tendency to find metaphors to encapsulate ideas.  The Hedgehog Concept seems more annoying than helpful, as does Rinsing the Cottage Cheese.  In doing this, he seems to be pandering to popular preference.  I'd just say to him, don't do this in the future.   These are good books, and we need more of them, and you don't need flawed metaphors to communicate what you have learned.
