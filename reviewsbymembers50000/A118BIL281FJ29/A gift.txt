 For its story of Otto alone, this book is a treasure.  Every lover of wonderful storytelling/reportage/writing should read this.  As McPhee might, I will say nothing more-except to apologize, because he would express that sentiment more artfully.  Here's hoping there are a couple more McPhee's coming along.
