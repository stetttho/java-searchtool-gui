 We need to encourage books like these, even if they are imperfectly executed, as this one clearly is.  Dr. Ambady's research is interesting, and reason enough for this reader to value this book, given my interest in the phenonemon of stereotypying.  My biggest concern may seem unrelated to this book.  It's that the New Yorker magazine for years was a source authority.  Now, in the magazine's effort to appear vital, interesting, and compelling, they are eager to support authors whose conclusions are merely speculative-as Gladwell's clearly are.  I am grateful to be exposed to ideas like these.  I would be far more grateful if there was more rigor attached to his conclusions.  Instead, I am left with the sense of ideas that may or may not be signficant, and with the sense that I wished the new New Yorker and its best writers were more like the old ones.
