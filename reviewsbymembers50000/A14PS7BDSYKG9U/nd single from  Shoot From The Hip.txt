 This is the second single from the brilliant Shoot From The Hip that once again finds Sophie Ellis Bextor using her gift of the Proper English language to good use. She to me comes off as intelligent  and that is missing in the music world today. The highlight for me is a Club Mix for the track "I Won't Change You" by Solaris. Their club mix(7:40) takes the pop song into a more house/trance feel that works wonders with her smokey vocals. One of her best remixes done for her songs. The cd comes with the album version and the bonus track "Yes Sir,I Can Boogie". She is awesome.
