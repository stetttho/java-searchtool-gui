The Miami Remix(7:12) of "I Heard A Rumour" is tracked onto the 1st disc . There should have been a third disc of remixes because so many were left off. There should have been a remix on here of "More Than Physical" or "A Trick of The Night" or even "Shy Boy" or "Long Train Running" or "Robert DeNiro's Waiting".Oh well it still is a great collection of hits by the best UK girl group.
