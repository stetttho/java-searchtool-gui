 This is one of my favorite singles so far this year. This is the latest single for remixer /dj Armand Van Helden and this track comes off as a New Wave dance track. The basis for the song is 2004 Electronica music but the feel vocally is one of 1980's dead pan style that reminds me of the stylings of The Flirts and Vanity while in the Vanity 6 girl group. Childhood memories!!!!!   The mixes are all electro in vibe with the Serge Santiago mix being the most straight ahead house mix. All great mixes.  1- Radio Edit (3:27)  2- Original Club Mix (7:49)- best mix  3- Serge Santiago Remix (9:10)  4- Solid Groove Hear My Rub Mix (6:15)  5- Solid Groove Hear My Dub Mix (5:55)     Excellent vocals from Spalding Rockwell.
