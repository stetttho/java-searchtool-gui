 This cd features Pink at her best. She continues to grow with every song released and is far from her jeep/queen vibe of her last cd. This cd is from the UK and comes with two remixes. The John Shanks mix(3:12) is a radio mix that adds more of a live feel to the song. More guitar and drums are added to the mix for  a more broader appeal. The Maurice Joshua "Nu Soul Mix" continues his style of remixing R&B songs to fit the house groove. Like his work with Destiny's Child,Cleopatra ,Mary Mary and Kim English - he gives this mix a retro/Wah Wah guitar feel that works very well. The mix (6:03) is very well done and does surround the song with a more urgent feel. You also get a radio mix and video to the song as well.
