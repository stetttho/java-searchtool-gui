 Finally Atlantic got off of their behinds and put this major pop record out on a cd single with the remixes that were dance floor favorites. This song went to the Top 20 on the club Play chart but was a number one Dance Airplay track for over 6 weeks on that chart. So when this cd single was released it went in at number one Dance Sales knocking George Michael's "Flawless" out. The cd single comes with 5 full dance mixes and 2 radio versions of 2 of the full mixes, They range from flat out house to a reggae inspired house mix. My favorite mix is the Low Tide mix which is most like the original in sound and vibe and is the reason for the 5 stars alone. Excellent mix. 1- E-Smoove Mix (7:17) 2- Lenny B. Mix (5:40) 3- Low Tide Mix (5:09) 4- Bastone & Burnz Mix (6:20) 5- Dj Volume 's North Bank Mix (6:03)--this mix along with the Low Tide Mix features the vocals of Spragga Benz which are not on the other mixes. 6- Lenny B Radio Edit (3:13) 7- Low Tide Radio Edit (3:14)   A fun cd of remixes. The Low Tide Mix being the best.
