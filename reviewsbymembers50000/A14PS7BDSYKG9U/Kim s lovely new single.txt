 I bought this cd for the Pulsedriver Vs. Beam remix(7:11) and it didn't disappoint at all. The song finds Ms. Wilde in great form  and this song is too good. This is from Best Of collection  and the remix is Euro/trance all the way. By the end of this mix you will be singing "You are loved, you are loved " over and over again in you head. Too catchy!
