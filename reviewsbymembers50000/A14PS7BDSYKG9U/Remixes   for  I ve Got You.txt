 This cd single features remixes for Marc Anthony's ballad "I've Got You". This cd comes in 7 mixes and are quite good with the Ibiza club mix being flawless. Track 1 is the album mix(3:49) and track 2 the Richie Jones Schoolyard Mix(3:49)-quite good. Then track 3 and 4 are done by Chris "The Greek" Panaghi and are starightfoward house mixes. The club mix(7:00) and mix show edit(5:28) are very well done. Okay now if you loved Kings Of Tomorrow's "Finally" as mixed by Masters At Work then the Eric Kupper Ibiza mix is your mix. Mixed with fluttering guitars and pianos and live percussion to make Salsoul proud this mix is just drop dead awesome. The club mix(7:45), mix show edit(5:44) and the dub mix(8:02) are just flawless music. This song only got as far as #22 on the club charts but along with "Backfired" by Masters At Work Featuring India are among my favorites of the year so far.
