 This cd single comes with 10 remixes---8 vocal mixes and 2 dubs and run the spectrum from hip hop to trance to aggressive house to a little bit of old school house. This is the latest single from Brandy and was produced and features Kanye West on rap. Shock to see that it barely cracked the Pop top 40 (36) and came in the top 20 r&b. But she is doing quite well on the dance charts--debuting at number 2 on the sales charts and still climbing the club charts. I really like all the mixes and although sometimes the vocals are a bit fast (pitch control!!!!) for what the original version is .   Tracks:  1- Extended Mix (4:57)- features the FULL Kanye West rap.  2- One Rascal Mix (6:01)- a bit of a slower r&b mix from Albert Cabrera from The Latin Rascals.  3- Bill Hamel Club Mix (7:13)- a slower trance house mix. Okay but not the greatest mix here.  4- E-Smoove Classic Club Mix (7:14)- beautiful bass driven house mix that is what Eric "E-Smoove" Miller does best. Very aggressive.  5- Ford Trance Mix (7:40)- features a typical trance keyboard loop that really is the loop for "Yeah" by Usher.Listen!  6- Alan Smithee In Blueblackness Mix (9:59)- a bass and acoustic guitar driven Ibiza Masters At Work kind of mix.  7- TKC Club Mix (7:59)- the big room mix . My personal favorite.  8- Ford House Mix (6:39)- a older sounding house mix that has drum rolls straight out of Technotronic's best songs. Very Nice.  9- Bill Hamell Clubbed Up Dub Mix(8:58) 10- Thick Dick Dub Mix (8:04)- E-Smoove 's drum driven tribal and much faster dub mix.     A great collection of remixes. A bit bit too many mixes but at least Atlantic is putting this cd single out which is a plus !
