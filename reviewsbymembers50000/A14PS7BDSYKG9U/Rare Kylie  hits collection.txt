 This is the hits collection put out by Arista /BMG Heritage to show America the Kylie that BMG had from 1994 to 1998. This collection features the European hits "Confide In Me" in its full length version,"Put Yourself In My Place","Where Is The Feeling"(in remixed form),"Some Kind Of Bliss", "Did It Again"and"Breathe". The songs are less dance and more pop to almost alternative rock in stance. The other songs are from her two BMG collections or b-sides or rare tracks. The track "Where Has The Love Gone" is the Roach Motel Mix(9:25) and is rare --for all the Kylie Remix.... "fans" . This is a collection of songs from her years between her PWL and EMI days. It shows growth on her part and faith on the fans part for following her to wherever Kylie wanted to go.
