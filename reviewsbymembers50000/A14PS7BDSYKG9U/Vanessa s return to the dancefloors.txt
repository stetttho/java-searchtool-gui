 This is Vanessa Williams first dance track since "The Way That You Love" from her Sweetest Days collection over a decade ago. This is from her new remake cd and this is the first commercial track issued. This is the remake of the classic by The Stylistics and showcases Vanessa's soulful/jazz vocals. The remixes are very different from one another. Pop house to break beat 80's to flat out trance to ambient are all the mixes. My favorite mix is the Mr. Mig mix-- if you like the mixes by Johnny Budz for Darren Hayes and The Roc Project then this mix is for you. Tracks: 1- Junior Vasquez Mirrorball Club Mix (8:23)-- pop house mix-- not like his usual tribal house mixes. The one I guess most US dj's are playing. 2- Mr. Mig Retro Breaks Mix (7:26)-- best mix because it suits the vocals the best. 3- Ford Club Mix (6:20)-- lovely Euro sounding trance mix. The most uptempo of the mixes. 4- Junior's Chill Out Mix (5:45)-- similar to the same kind of mix for the latest Dannii Minogue track "You Won't Forget About Me". I guess Ambient is on the way back.     An excellent return to the dance floors for Vanessa. Currently in the top 25 of the club charts. Excellent.
