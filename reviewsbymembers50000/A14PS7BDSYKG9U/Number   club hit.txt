 This so far is the biggest hit for Sarah on Billboard's Club Play chart. The cd comes from Australia and the main buying point for it is the inclusion of the massive mix by Junkie XL for "World On Fire". This mix (12:24) is just beautiful from the Cure like guitar work to the thumping aggressive house beats to the lyrics and vocals of Sarah McLachlan everything works. Robert Smith would be proud. The cd is actually for "Stupid" and it comes in the original radio version (3:26) and Hyper remix(7:55) and they are more typical of what Sarah McLachlan does. Stunning stuff. Buy this cd for the remix of "World On Fire" and you won't be sorry. A++++
