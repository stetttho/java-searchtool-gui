 This cd was issued in 1999 from the UK and puts together a collection of songs that were huge on the pop charts in the UK and US as well as dance floor favorites and a few obscure stuff as well. For me the selling point was "Thorn In My Side" by Eurythmics and "People Hold On" by Coldcut with Lisa Stansfield that are not avaiable elsewhere on cd . The remix of "Thorn In My Side " is so radically different I assume Annie Lennox recut her vocals to suit the mix better. You get some well known tracks like "Ride On Time" , "Funkytown" and "Love Come Down" to more club only tracks like "Beat Dis" and "Theme From S-Express". An excellent collection of full dance mixes.    Tracks:  Extended Eighties: 1- Black Box - Ride On Time (Original 12" Mix-- with Loleatta Holloway on sampled vocals from "Love Sensation") 6:27 2- S-Express- Theme From S-Express (Original 12" Mix) 6:01-- a huge number one acid house sampled track. 3- Bomb The Bass- Beat Dis (Extended Dis Mix) 6:00-- another sample heavy number one dance track. 4- The Beatmasters & Cookie Crew- Rok Da House (12" Remix) 6:48-- hip house club track. 5- Pseudo Echo- Funkytown (Dance Mix)6:37-- original non house mix of the Lipps Inc. disco cover that was major pop hit in 1987. 6- Coldcut Featuring Lisa Stansfield- People Hold On (Original Full Length Disco Mix) 9:29-- number 6 in the US dance charts and made Lisa a dance floor favorite. 7- Evelyn "Champagne" King- Love Come Down (12" version)6:11-- huge pop and number one dance and r&b smash from 1982. 8- The Stranglers- Skin Deep (Extended Mix) 7:16-- alternative dance track that reached 49 on the club charts. 9- Eurythmics- Thorn In My Side (Extended Mix) 6:57-- radically different from original version. Mixed by Mann Guiot. A++++Mix !! 10- Blow Monkeys- Digging Your Scene (Longer Mix) 6:14-- retro sounding Top 40 pop hit. 11- Terence Trent D'Arby- Sign Your Name (Full Length Mix) 5:49--- slow pop hit from 1988.    Excellent collection- buy for Lisa Stansfield and Eurythmics!! Worth it for just those two songs.
