 I am giving this cd 4 stars because of the fact that the mixes on this cd lack Dido's vocals on any of the mixes.I know most of the reviews state this as well but I don't see how you can hire a remixer and have one of the best new singers around and no VOCALS! The mixes are quite excellent to begin with and the first one is by the groups own Rollo & Sister Bliss. This mix is similar to their previous work for their own songs- trancy/"I Feel Love" sound . The mix is 7:43 and good.The second remix is by Alex Neri -the Club Rah Mix(8:48) and even better than the first. More vocal bits are included but not enough . Great mix . Then you get the album mix of "We Come 1" featuring Maxi Jazz . Brilliant song .My only complaint is a lack of vocals.
