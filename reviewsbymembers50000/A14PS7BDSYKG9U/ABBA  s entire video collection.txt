 I recieved this DVD as a Christmas gift and watched it all in one setting. This is the DVD of their video output from "Waterloo" until they broke up in 1982 with "Under Attack" . There are 35 videos on this DVD and I finally get to see all the videos that were never really shown in the US. The best videos include "The Day Before You Came","Chiquitta" with the huge snowman,"The Winner Takes It All","Super Trouper","Ring Ring","SOS","Mamma Mia","Eagle" ,the beautiful "Happy New Year","Voulez Vous","Money Money Money" and "Fernando". The videos show the couples as happy in the beginning to their break up not only in song but visually as well. The DVD comes with a very informative booklet about every single video and all but a few were directed by Lasse Hallstrom that showcase not only his talents as a future movie director but the group's fun and serious sides as well. The DVD also features a 21 minute photo gallery where you can use your remote to change the music to 6 different "radio" type channels so that there are at least 6 different songs going at anytime while the photos flash by. Buy this DVD and enjoy not only the music but finally see the faces of Agnetha,Bjorn,Benny and Frida in action.
