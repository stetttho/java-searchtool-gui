 This is the first single for French singer Cherie and it is a great song to start with. The original version is a radio favorite on the Radio & Records Top 40 with the song being a more rock slanted affair. The remixes though bump up the energy a lot more. The mixes range from a more Foreigner sampled mix by Dave Aude("Urgent" was sampled) to a more aggressive house mix by Mike Rizzo to a more underground tribal type mix from the remix team of Dummies to  a  more busy NRG type mix from Silent Nick. All mixes(1-4) have the full vocals - the Mike Rizzo and Dummies mixes putting more of a spotlight on them than the other two. Great set of mixes. Here is the track listing:  1- Dave Aude Club Mix(7:24)  2- Mike Rizzo Club Mix(8:01)  3- Dummies Club Mix(7:47)  4- Silent Nick Club Mix(5:55)  5- Dave Aude Dub Mix(8:37)  6- Dummies Dub Mix(7:25)     A huge club track and sales single already. Great mixes.
