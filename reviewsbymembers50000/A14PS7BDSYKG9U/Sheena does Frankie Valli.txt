 This is one of 4 remixes released from her "Fabulous" cd. This is the dance version of "Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You" and this cd comes from Japan. The main draw is the 8:28 DJ Soma Grow Sound Mix. This starts out as aggressive house then filters into a more circuit/retro disco type mix. This follows her remixes of "Giving Up Giving In" and "Don't Leave Me This Way". I now have to find the remixes for the Donna Summer classic "Love Is In Control" and I will be happy. Buy this cd it shows that Ms. Easton still kicks butt as a singer.
