 Most of the songs on this cd are barely 4 1/2 to 5  1/2 minutes in length so if you are looking for longer mixes (not here). The main reason I bought this cd was for a remix of "hero" by Enrique Iglesias which is about 4:50 in length(is there nowhere in the world you can actually find a full mix of this song on cd?). I have most of the other tracks on here -Madonna's mix I think was on the import of "Don't Tell Me" and could have put the promo mix of GHV2 on here but oh well. The Britney Spears mix (6:16) is the only approaching a 12" mix length in my opinion which is really good considering it is Ms. Spears. But this cd is a very good idea of what the Thunderpuss sound  sounds like .
