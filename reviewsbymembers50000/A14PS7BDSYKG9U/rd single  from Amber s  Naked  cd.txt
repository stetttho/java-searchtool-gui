 This is the 3rd single from the newest cd from mega dance act Amber. This song is one of clever observations and I think for the first time a noticable accent vocally. The release of the cd single proves that Tommy Boy knows she will sell well so that is a good show of support for her. The cd features 3 radio mixes and 3 full 12" mixes. The dance mixes range from nrg to underground house. The radio mixes are very well done but the selling point is the Al B. Rich Club mix(10:17) which is a mixture of nrg with a nice house mixture . I like this mix the best because it basically is what Amber mixes should sound like.Intelligent and straightforward. The DJ Encore Club Mix(7:23) I had to listen to several times in order to like it. The vocals are mixed down a bit and to me not the Amber we know and love. The mix is good but not as good VOCALLY as the Al B. Rich mix. The That Kid Chris Dub Mix(9:13) is what is it says--a dub. This is the most aggressive mix on the cd and no doubt what most dj's are spinning. This just shows Amber growing as an artist when she can release a song like this and still go huge on the dance chart.The front cover reminded me of Kristine W!
