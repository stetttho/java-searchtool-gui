 The reason I bought this cd was because none of the songs (except"Hold On" and "Can I Get A Witness") were released on cd except for a very short time on vinyl 12". The former lead vocalist to the gospel group Sounds Of Blackness had put out one very successful cd in 96/97 and finished her second for A&M  when after only releasing two 12" singles "Love Is What We Need"(#2 on the Billboard dance charts) and the remake of Brainstorm's disco classic "Lovin' Is Really My Game"(#1 on the dance charts)the label decided to not release a full cd of material. So this cd put out on her own Its Time Child label features the dance remixes of her dance hits. There are three mixes of "Lovin Is Really My Game" by DJ Mijangos(10:21),Steve "Silk" Hurley(7:17)and Thunderpuss (10:27). The Steve Hurley mix is very disco with lots and lots of strings while the thunderpuss mix is well a thunderpuss mix(over the top-ina good way). Also featured is "Love Is What We Need" with mixes by KCC(8:52) and Mousse T(10:09) . The Mousse T mix is the best one  in my opinion. "Let Your Will Be Done" is now a featured track off her new cd and is really gospel in its message. It features Ricky Dillard and comes  in two mixes -Steve "Silk" Hurley(7:34) and Xavier Smith(6:28). The "Silk" mix is very r&b house in style while the Xavier Smith mix is similar to the two step sound of Craig David which is okay. The other tracks are "Hold On" (6:00) and Can I Get A Witness" (3:47) mixed by Mousse T. A very good collection of club  songs by a great gospel vocalist.
