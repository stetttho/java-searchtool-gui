 This song is the latest European dance track to cross to the US radios. The song released earlier this year got as far as number 29 on the club charts and 8 on the sales charts. So naturally radio finally found the track and played it now to a more favorable reaction to the US audience. The trance track comes with 4 remixes that are excellent. The song is more aggressive in sound than most trance records - it is the vocals that really carry this song. The song is one of pleading for mercy from a lover to not go. The mixes are the Extended mix(5:56),the W.O.S.P. remix(7:25),Peter Luts remix(7:42) and Jimmy Goldscmitz remix(6:05). The best mix is to me the Jimmy Goldschmitz mix because it takes the song to a different place than the other mixes. Just a great mix drama and music. Huge radio hit.
