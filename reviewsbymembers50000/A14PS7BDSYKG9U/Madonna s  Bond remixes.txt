 This is the theme to the new James Bond movie Die Another Day and it finds Madonna extending her tour of electro music on this track. This cd single features 5 full remixes and they are very well done to jaw dropping . Track 2 is the Dirty Vegas Main Mix(10:08) and very similar to their own "Days Go By". Track 3 is the Thee RetroLectro Mix(6:59) by Felix Da Housecat. To me this is the best mix on the cd. It has the feel of the original and then some. Very keyboard driven and even more distorted vocals! Track 4 is the Thunderpuss Mix(9:25) and very trance like and more subtle than most of their mixes---excellent. Track 5 is the Deepsky Mix(7:27) by J. Scott G & Jason Blum. Not my favorite mix because the strings don't really go with the vocals or the vibe of the song. Track 6 is the Brother Brown 's Bond -Age Club Mix (7:51) and not as house driven as the other mixes. Second best mix on here. The original version is a extension of "Music" and lyrically one of Madonna's most cryptic lyrics. The song and remixes are [good]!
