 I have to agree with the other reviewer that for people to sit and complain that this album is too different than Fever means mostly that you are some one who doesn't like an artist to try different styles of music good or bad. As a huge Deborah Harry fan this is what I have come to expect with my favorite artists -in that they are not afraid of either being considered a complete genius or a complete fool with new stuff and so on but at least the effort is made not to be a one note artist. Buy Kylie's 2 DeConstruction cds- Kylie Minogue and Impossible Princess and see how she tries to expand herself out onto new horizions and also read some of the reviews that this cd is getting in Entertainment Weekly, Rolling Stone,Spin,Billboard and every other music mag out there- it has gotten very positive reviews -- more so better than most "Important" releases like Norah Jones and the like. The songs still get better with each listen. I bought the import when it was put out last year and bought the US version with the bonus tracks. From "Slow"-track 1- all through "Sweet Music" -track 5- they slam hard as dance tracks. "Loving Days","Someday","Obsession" and "Red Blooded Woman" continue to flourish under repeated listens. "Chocolate" better be put out as a single- the sexiest song Kylie has ever done. The 2 new tracks "Cruise Control" b side to the new "Red Blooded Woman" cd single and "You Make Me Feel" work with the other tracks. This is a bit different from the happy gay dance music that most fans want from her but listen to it a few times and it gets better each time. Try it and you will see.
