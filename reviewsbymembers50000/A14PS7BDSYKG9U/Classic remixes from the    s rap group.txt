 This is an import cd of remixes from the Grammy Winning afrocentric rap group from the early 90's Arrested Development. The 4 hits are included : "Tennessee", "People Everyday", "Mr. Wendal" and "Revolution" from the Malcolm X movie. The mixes are great hip hop 90's mixes and the Perfecto mix of "Mr. Wendal" was a number one club play track and the main reason I bought this cd. Classic rap tracks from a very short lived rap act.  1- Mr. Wendal (Perfect Mix) 5:43  2- People Everday (Metamorphosis Mix) 4:57  3- Tennesse (Pirate Radio Mix) 6:10-- a bit annoying the scratching on this mix( I thought the cd was skipping but it wasn't)  4- Ease My Mind (Another Perspective Mix) 4:13  5- United Front (Noises In My Attic Remix) 4:43  6- Fishin' For Religion (Remix) 4:42  7- Revolution (Another Perspective Mix) 4:18  8- People Everday (Maroon Mix) 3:38  9- Tennessee ( Back To Roots Mix) 5:19 --a much better mix than track 3.  10- Mr. Wendal (Hip Hop Drum Attack Mix) 5:16- I love this mix a lot.   The sound quality (volumewise ) should have been a bit higher but still a great cd. From the UK.
