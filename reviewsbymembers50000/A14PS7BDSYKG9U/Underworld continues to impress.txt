 This single is the new one from the UK's legendary dance outfit. I bought this single from  Amazon.co.uk and the cd is part 2 . This recently got to number 2 for 2 weeks and I picked this cd for the John Ciafone remix. The first track is the original version(9:09) and more harder in sound than the remix . It shows a growth in the progression of the act. The John Ciafone Remix(7:33) is a little more stripped in sound and more ambient in feel but still aggressive house wise. Just a brilliant piece of work. Excellent!
