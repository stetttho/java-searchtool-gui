 This is the 3rd release from the latest Seal cd and this time the track "Love's Divine" is the release. On the heals of the 2 major Club Hits- "Get It Together" and "Waiting For You"- Warner Brothers once again puts out a maxi cd single with some great remixes.The cd comes with 3 set of remixers taking the song from hard underground house to almost light nrg house. The mixes are: 1- Deepsky Club Mix (8:48)-- a almost dub mix 2- The Passengerz Sanctuary Club Mix(8:55) 3- The Passengerz Radio Mix(3:56) - both good mixes 4- Murk Light-N- Lovely Mix(7:38)-almost a nrg house mix-not as dubby/tribal as their own stuff(a lovely mix almost as good as their work with Todd Terry With Shannon on "It's Over Love") 5- Murk Dark-N-Dirty Dub(8:44)- TRIBAL mix!!!!!   I don't quite understand Club Dj's now obsession with Seal now but when you get three winners in a row you can see how. Excellent yet again.Seal sounds so beautiful on these remixes.
