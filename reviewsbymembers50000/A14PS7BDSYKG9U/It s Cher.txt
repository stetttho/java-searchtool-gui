 This cd is  a budget cd of song songs from her MCA days. This is not the full cd by any matters. But I still enjoyed this cd a lot. If you are just starting out looking for older Cher material then try this one. But if you are looking for more rare material try several of her anthology cds that go into more detail---there are a lot. I bought this for the price and the simple collection of songs.
