 This follows in the line of non dance acts doing club remixes to either jump start a failing career or a expansion of the form of music they want to do-- take your pick. Following Jewel,Duncan Sheik,Bette Midler,Linda Eder,Stevie Nicks and now you can add The Pretenders to that list. This is the remixes for the song "Time" and they are remixed by Junior Vasquez in a 7 remix set. The remixes are not typical Junior mixes in that they are more trance/laid back in the feel of the music. Most of the mixes are the same in sound and feel so choose which one you like the most. Tracks are:Radio Mix(3:30),Mixshow(6:40),Earth Anthem(10:09),Ambient Mix(6:09),Earth Beats(6:40),Tribapella(6:40),Earthstrumental(10:09) and the funky album version(3:59). It is weird for  the hard rock vocals of Chrissie Hynde to work so well with the house beats of this mix. I guess just hearing Chrissie Hynde sing is enough for any song.
