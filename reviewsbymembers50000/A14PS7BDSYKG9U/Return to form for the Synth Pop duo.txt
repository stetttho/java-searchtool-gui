 This is the latest classic by Andy Bell & Vince Clarke better known as Erasure. This song did very well in Europe and now it comes to the US via a great cd single. This maxi cd recently hit number one on the Dance Sales Chart on Billboard and that was the first time since 1988's "Chains Of Love". The song seems likely to also reach number one on the Club Play chart as well and that hasn't happened to Erasure since 1987's "Victim Of Love" their only number one so far. So what is making the song so successful is the fact that it classic Erasure-- pop /dance music with real lyrics. Following Blondie and Duran Duran as classic acts with great new singles-- "Breathe" will also be likely ignored by top 40 radio as well like those two were. The main reason for the cd single are the 3 remixes here. They are very well done --especially the Manhattan Clique remix. That is the best mix of the song.  1- Breathe ( Radio Mix) 3:45 2- Breathe ( Album Mix) 3:50 3- Gone Crazy (Bonus track) 3:24 4- Mr. Gribber And His Amazing Cat (Bonus track) 2:43 5- Breathe (Acoustic Version) 3:58 6- Breathe (Pete Heler's Pheta Mix) 7:13--- very electro inspired mix. 7- Breathe (LMC Extended Mix) 6:12--- the most classic sounding Erasure mix on the cd single. Very NRG/Euro club mix. 8- Breathe (When Andy Bell Met Manhattan Clique Extended Mix) 7:19--- beautiful remix. Most normal house mix with bits of trance thrown in. A+++++ remix.   BUY!!!!!
