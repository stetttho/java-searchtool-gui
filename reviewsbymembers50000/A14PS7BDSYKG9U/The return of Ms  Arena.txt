 This is the first club track from the Australian superstar singer since "Chains" was mixed by Tony Moran . This single is from the remixer Ray Roc who has done mixes for Cher. This single comes with 5 full mixes and 2 radio mixes. The Radio edit(3:44) and Original Extended Mix(9:00) are excellent house mixes. The song is one of a woman who will not be put in a bad relationship and is ready to not look back at the man who hurt her. This mix and the Chillout mix(6:00) and Filterheadz Luv Tina Mix(8:00) give off the drama of that and more without going over the top. She sounds like a 1970's disco diva(France Joli/Teri DeSario) in that she lets the words and meaning get her point across and not theatrics. The best mix for me is the Johnny BudzBreaks radio edit(4:04) and 12" mix(6:46). It's like 1980's electronic/freestyle type music. AWESOME! This is soooo good on so many levels. Then you get the Max Reich remix(8:53) which is a nice house mix.Just a great cd single that hopefully give Tina a chance to come back to the US with a new cd. A+++++++++.  Hit number 4 for 2 weeks on Billboard's Club Play Chart!!!!
