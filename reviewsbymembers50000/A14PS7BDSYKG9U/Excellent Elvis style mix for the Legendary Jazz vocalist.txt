 This is the lead track off the Verve Remixed 3 collection and this time it is the late Sarah Vaughan doing the Peggy Lee/ Madonna classic (depending on how old you are) "Fever" . The dance remixes are by Adam Freeland and they come off as inspired by the Elvis mixes for "A Little Less Conversation"/"Rubberneckin" in that they are not housed up but  electro mixed for a new generation of club people to enjoy. This was a top 25 club hit recently and when you hear the mixes you will see why.  Tracks:  Fever 1- Adam Freeland Extended Remix (7:03) 2- Adam Freeland Remix (4:39) 3- Original Version (2:48)   Excellent remixes.
