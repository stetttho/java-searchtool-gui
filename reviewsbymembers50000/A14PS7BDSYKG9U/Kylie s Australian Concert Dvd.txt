 This DVD is  great for those who haven't seen her in concert before. It sort of like Cher and Bette Midler with more dance and costume changes. The DVD comes with a Bonus Feature of backstage footage and interview with dancers and muscians and managers that was fun to watch. The dancers are mostly made up of Italian men and women so it was kind of hard to understand them at times. The show consists of over 20 songs and clocks in at 1 hour and 46 minutes. The show spans her entire career from the huge hits "I Should Be So Lucky","Hand On Your Heart","Can'T Get You Out Of my Head" and  a medley of PWL hits to rare stuff like "Confide In Me","Put Yourself In My Place","Loveboat","Butterfly" and  her solo version of "Kids". Plus to me the highlight is the bump and grind /pole dance version of Olivia Newton -John's "Physical". Excellent. The Dvd also included the Video to "Spinning Around". So this is an excellent start to see Kylie in concert when she decides to come to the US and do some dates here.
