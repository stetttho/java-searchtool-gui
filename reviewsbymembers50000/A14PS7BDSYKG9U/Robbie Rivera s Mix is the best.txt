 This song was a huge success for this Australian act a few years ago and in the Uk last year and came to the US earlier this year in the Import form by Different Gear and that only went as high as #37 for 2 weeks . Now comes the US release with all new mixes for the fragmented US club scene. First off the original song is all drum and bass and distorted vocals  to now all house mixes. The Different Gear Mix(8:36) is what most radio mix shows are playing and it is quite excellent as a straightforward house mix . But it is the Robbie Rivera Vocal Mix(7:19) that is just tremendous. When I first heard this mix it made me stop and totally listen to it. From the retro keyboards to the techno riffs to the edits that was placed in this mix it is the best mix for this song. The vocals suit this mix like the original---rough and hard. This is the mix that took it to number one on the dance charts. The Robbie Rivera's Tribal Session Dub(7:28) has most of the vocals and excellent. The John Creamer & Stephane K mix(9:51) is a dub with little vocals and not my favorite at all. Buy for the tremendous Robbie Rivera's Vocal Mix you will not be disappointed.
