 ...This song recently hit number one on the Billboard dance charts and it was no secret why. Along with Loleatta Holloway, Donna Summer,Jocelyn Brown and Martha Wash very few "DISCO" artists have continued to hit the charts after disco died in 1981. But this is her second number one for the Logic label and it rocks. The song is about finding love with someone who was always there but was probably just a friend . The mixes  frame Gloria's vocals to a T. The Hex Hector/Mac Quayle mix (8:56) is the most straightforward in house of all the mixes. Excellent mix. The Cruz & Bagz Vocal mix(10:19) is more stripped down in sound and vocally she is more front and center on this mix. Beautiful!!! The Silentsoundz Dub Mix(7:27) is just that a dub mix. And finally the wonderful Mike Rizzo Global Club Mix(6:39) is to the point and to me the best mix here. Try hard to get this cd because it if worth it.
