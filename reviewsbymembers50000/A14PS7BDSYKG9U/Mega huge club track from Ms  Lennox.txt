 This single recently spent 2 weeks as the number one club track on Billboard's Club Play chart- the only other single so far in 2003 to do so was "Dark Beat" by Oscar G & Ralph Falcon. This is the belatedly released cd single from J Records but worth the wait. The cd comes with 6 remixes plus the original version. The time listing for each track is a little off from what the times really are but no big deal. The first remix is by Mac Quayle (6:15)and is a really good straight up house mix. The next mix is the Goldtrix Club Mix(6:33) and is kind of a wondering type of mix. It just seems to flow with the flow and that is all it does. The best mixes are by the hot guy at the moment The Scumfrog. His Club Mix(8:30) and Knob Dub Mix(6:51) are what took this song to the top of the Dj's lists and charts. The background vocals are pushed to the front and bring them to a more aggresive stance that is missing from the others almost like "Missionary Man". To say this mix is fiery and incredible is an understatement. Incredible also doesn't come close. The next mix is the great Gabriel & Dresden Club Mix(10:08) and this is one of their better mixes . They take the same background vocals and make them sound like "Cool Blue" or any great song from the Touch collection. Great mix. The final mix is the Shanghai Surprise vocal mix(7:03) and begins as a nrg/tea party mix but moves into a deeper groove. The final track is the original album mix(5:11). A great cd single from Annie Lennox. Now how about J Records puuting out Monica's "So Gone " on cd single now!!!!!!!!
