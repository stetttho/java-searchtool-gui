 This is the fourth number one club play single for Murk on Billboard in 2003. This cd single is a mixture of deep house,tribal and all the great stuff you have come to expect from Oscar G & Ralph Falcon. The cd single comes with 5 mixes(2 radio mixes and 3 12" mixes). All are excellent mixes--they are:  Alright  1- Murk Radio Mix(4:00)  2- Callea & Rispoli Radio Mix(4:00)  3- Murk 12"  Mix(8:08)  4- Callea & Rispoli "Come Rich Two" Mix (7:42)- best mix in that it is more mainstream house in vibe and can play on radio and work as well.  5- Southside's Bangin' On The Drum Mix (10:02)- deep tribal mix    Murk as usual are incredible- although their  songs might sound the same this is still above anyone else out there.
