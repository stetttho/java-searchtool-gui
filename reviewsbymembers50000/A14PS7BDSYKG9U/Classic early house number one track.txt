 I bought my first issue of Billboard magazine back at the end of 1986 and they had the year end chart listed and this track always fascinated me because of the singer's name- Dhar. It was like Claudja Barry - a very unique name. I was looking through other cd singles on Amazon and found this song listed. I of course bought it. The song was a number one song back in June 1986 for 2 weeks and went to number 2 sales as well. This is a early house track with its pumping bass and keys but is also a slight freestyle song with some latin elements thrown in. The cd single comes with 5 mixes and there is not a bad one in the bunch. The best for me is the Jump Back Rap mix (track 5) that is a cross between Thea Austin in "You're the Worst Thing For Me" and a Ru Paul track- very catty. This song came out before Gwen Guthrie's "Ain't Nothin' Goin' On But The Rent" but both have the same theme- this woman will not be paying for her loser man--MOVE ON!! Track listing: 1- Club Mix (8:22) 2- Radio Mix (3:37) 3- Dub ( 7:25) 4- Dubette (5:06) 5- Jump Back Rap (3:07)   Excellent classic dance track. A++++
