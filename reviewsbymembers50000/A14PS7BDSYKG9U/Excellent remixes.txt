 This is the third club single in a row for Simply Red and this is a great new single but not as incredible as the last two:"Sunrise" and "Fake". This is the classic song that has been done over way too many times but the original version works the best here. Mick Hucknell sounds at ease with this song. The remixes by Love To Infinity are good but a bit harder than what they normally do. The best mix here is the Antillas mix. Flawless stuff- a bit of a trance mix with some house thrown in. I like this mix the best because the vocals are put front and center this time not like the Love To Infinity Mixes.   1-Single Edit(4:18)  2-Love To Infinity Radio Mix(4:47)  3-Antillas Full Vocal Mix(4:15)  4-Love To Infinity Master Mix(6:06)  5-Love To Infinity 12' Mix(8:10)  6-Antillas Full Vocal Mix(9:37)   All mixes feature the full vocals of the song.
