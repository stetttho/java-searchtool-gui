 The cd single of Cherish features the 6:18 remix of the classic song. It is really an extended mix with very little overdubs and edits to it . The song is just now a couple of minutes longer and that is a good thing too. The b-side is "supernatural" and that is 5:12 and very funky. If you want a remix of this song then buy the Red Hot & Dance cd that was out almost 10 years ago.Quite good too. The remix of Cherish was not released to the best of my knowledge in the US (never hit the billboard dance sales chart-everything she releases hits the  club or sales chart if out). So buy and enjoy. Cd is from Germany.
