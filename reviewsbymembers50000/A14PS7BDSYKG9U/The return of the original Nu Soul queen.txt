 What can I say about 2004. Already Blondie has come out with one of the best cds of their career and now my favorite r&b singer Teena Marie has released such a great collection of songs. Like Deborah Harry -Lady T back in the day would fuse different types of music from her love of Jazz to rap to flat out dance to slow jam quiet storm type of music. You can see her influence in Alicia Keys, Angie Stone,Floetry, Erykah Badu and all the nu soul type of girls out now. Teena was one of 3 r&b female singers to produce and write their own albums:Patrice Rushen and Angela Winbush the other two. The new cd is mostly a ballad type/to mid tempo affair with no real club/dance tracks but who cares when she sounds so amazing.The first track "Still In Love" is in the top 30 on the black charts and actually has climbed higher than new stuff from Aretha,Patti, Luther and Prince and the fact that Teena was never a huge as these stars shows the love that r&b radio has for Lady T. The best songs for me are "Honey Call","Baby I'm Your Fiend" which I saw her perform a few years ago on a Montell Jordan hosted Motown show and was part of the Black Rain cd that I guess became La Dona. Also great are the duets with Gerald Levert on "A Rose By Any Other Name","Off The Chain" with Baby,"The Mackin' Game" with Mc Lyte and Medusa and also the incredible slow jams of "My Body's Hungry" and "I Love Him Too" with Dee Dee O'neal that are true classic r&b and yet very new. I have waited since 1994 when Passion Play was last released for new music from Teena Marie and hopefully it won't take that long again. There is just something about Teena's voice and lyrics that set her off from most singers in any form of music- she is passion and poetry all in one. Just incredible.Buy!!!!!!!!!
