 This is the first US single release from "Living Proof" and topped the Billboard Club Play chart and also went to number one on the Dance Maxi Sales chart for 12 weeks. The mixes are by Almighty, Illicit and Thunderpuss and are quite good. The Almighty Mixes come in extended and radio mixes. The full mix(8:46) is the best mix here and similar to their excellent mix for "Believe" which showcase the vocals I think better than any other mixers who've done remixes for Cher. Just absolutely brilliant from second 1 to the finish. The Illicit mixes also come in Extended and radio mixes. The radio mix is best while the full mix (8:09) sort of buries the vocals under the beats. Not my favorite mix and almost like their work for India.Arie and Stevie Nicks. The Thunderpuss Mixes come in radio and extened form for the club mixes. The Club mix(8:43) is okay but it is their Sunrise Mix(8:25) that truly rocks. This is one of the best mixes that the Barry Harris and Chris Cox have done in awhile. Excellent cd single full of remixes.
