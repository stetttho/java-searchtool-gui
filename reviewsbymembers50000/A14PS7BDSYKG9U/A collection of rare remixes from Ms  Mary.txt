 This cd features remixes of songs from her cds "Mary","Share My World" and "No More Drama". These mixes mostly were available on cd singles on import only or promo mixes. So to have MCA finally ... put out this collection is great. So here are the songs on this 72 minute cd. Track 1)No More Drama (Thunderpuss Remix) 9:18 Track 2)Family Affair(Spanish Fly Remix) 7:51- A Great house mix Track 3)Everything (Curtis & Moore Remix) 7:06 from 1997-disco type remix that uses the "You Are Everything" sample to great affect. Track 4)Rainy Dayz (Thunderpuss Remix) 7:57-Starts out as a Thunderpuss mix then goes to an early 80's funk mix that keeps Ja Rule on this mix - truly rocks. Track 5)He Don't Think I Don't Know (HQ2 Club Mix) 8:25-Trancy/house mix similar to his work for Deborah Cox/Tamia Track 6)Your Child(Junior Vasquez Remix)7:32-- rare promo only remix that was number one on the dance chart. Track 7)Never Been(Al B. Rich 2 Step Groove Remix)5:36---Just like the title states it is a 2 Step/ UK garage mix. Track 8)Dance For Me(G CLub Remix by Gerald Elms) 7:11--UK house mix that was a hit earlier this year . Track 9)Give Me You(Extended Nino Radio Mix by Phillip Larsen and Hiten Bharadia)6:43--a different mix than the one I already own and is very good but not much of the Elton John sample left. Track 10)Let No Man Put Asunder(LP Version) 4:20--not the Maurice Joshua mix but I already have that mix.Great First Choice cover and as close to an original club song from Mary as we'll ever get.       Just a great collection of rare club mixes.
