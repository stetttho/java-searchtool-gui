 This is the follow up to the top 5 cover of "Nasty Girl" and Inaya Day puts up the latin music for her second number one single "Lift It Up". This is a better more uplifting song theme wise than most club songs out now. It is the latin music that is part of most of the mixes that works the best. For me the best mixes are the Cruz  & Francois Vox mix and the Pierpressure mix. Excellent. Tracks:  Lift It Up 1- Original Radio Edit (3:52) 2- House Radio Edit (4:10) 3- Cruz & Francois Vox Mix (9:40) 4- Dj Paulo & Jamie J. Sanchez Mix (8:19) 5- Foundation Mix (8:32) 6- Pierpressure Mix (9:59) 7- Cruz & Francois Rican Mix (9:15)  Excellent Latin house dance track.
