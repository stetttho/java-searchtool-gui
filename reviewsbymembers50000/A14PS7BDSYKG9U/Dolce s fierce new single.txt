 This is the follow up to her number 2 club hit "Fire" and this one showcases more of what Dolce can do vocally. The song is one of a woman showing another woman that if she gets rid of her "bad man" she will no longer have any trouble or sorrow. The mixes are by Orange Factory and the even better mixes by E-Smoove. The tracks 1,2 and 5 are by the team of Orange Factory. The Original mix(9:22) and Dub mix(9:22) are more uptempo house . They give the song more energy and could work in peak hours of club play. The best mixes are by E-Smoove and his Soul Stomper Mix(7:15)is the best mix of the song. In his classic style of house mixes he puts forth one of his best mixes ever. This mix folds Dolce's vocals to a more retro sounding mix that would still sound good in the 70's Disco era or 20 years from now--just classic! The Thick Dick Dub(8:00) is good as well. This is hopefully a start to a long career of great dance singles. Plus check out the cover--She looks incredible.
