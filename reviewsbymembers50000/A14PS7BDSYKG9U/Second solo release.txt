 This is the second release from the Dave Gahan solo effort Paper Monsters. This cd comes with 4 versions of "I Need You" plus 2 bonus tracks. The first 3 tracks are the radio mix of "I Need You"(3:33),"Closer"(4:08) and "Breathe"(4:56) that are moody as any Depeche Mode tracks ever were. The remixes are the Ladytron Detoxxmixx(4:01) and is the electro mix of the mixes. The Jay's SummerDub Mix(6:25) is a jazzy/house type mix with little vocals. The best remix is the Gabriel & Dresden Unpluuged Mix(10:13) and is the best mix they have done since Jewel's "Serve The Ego". I cannot tell you how incredible and hot Mr. Gahan always sound under a great house mix. This mix should take him to the higher parts of the Billboard Dance Charts. Awesome remix and song. Better than "Dirty Sticky Floors " and that got to number 3 for 2 weeks on the club charts.A++++++++
