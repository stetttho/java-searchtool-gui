 I first bought the original version of this cd back in February 2002 and when a newer version with expanded songs came out I bought it again. Her voice is just incredible and so are the songs . This now has 4 huge UK singles on it :"Take Me Home"(#2),"Murder On The Dancefloor"(#2),"Get Over You"(#3) and "Music Gets The Best Of Me"(#14). This cd features a rolicking live version of "Groovejet" but to me the  best tracks are still not released. To me the BEST song is "Is It Any Wonder" and this was put a B-Side to "Music Gets The Best of Me" and should have been the single instead. If she can become huge in America hopefully Universial can get a clue and release the song with new mixes and maybe hire Tom Moulton or Frankie Knuckles to do a classy remix!!! "Lover","Move This Mountain","By Chance" ,"I Believe" ,"The Universe Is You" and "Everything Falls Into Place" just  are too good. This cd hopefully will be the start of a long and fruitful career.
