 This was originally issued as a 12" single back in 1988 as "Weekend/Just Wanna Dance" which were the A-side/B-side tracks done by Todd Terry. The first track is basically a Todd Terry remix to the number 9 hit from 1983 by the girl fronted Class Action which featured Chris Whiltshire. This was already an old track because it was originally a disco hit for Phreek . The Class Action original versions which are tracks 3,4 and 5 are mixed by the Legendary Remixer Larry Levan. These mixes take from the Salsoul sound (in part from First Choice) and is very classic disco sounding. The Wam Bam Mix is the 1988 Todd Terry remix of the Class Action version with all the vocals. The other track "Just Wanna Dance" was the track that was listed first on the Billboard charts so I assume this was the main song that DJ's played. This and the Wam Bam Mix for "Weekend" sound dated. They were the "underground" mixes that were house music during the late 80's and early 90's. Not bad but not classic sounding either. I am giving the 5 stars for the original Extended version of "Weekend". If you are looking for a classic club track to play then this is your single. Beautiful!!!!
