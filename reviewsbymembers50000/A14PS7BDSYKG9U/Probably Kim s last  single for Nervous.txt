 I love Kim English and think she is one of the best dance artists of the last few years. Along with Kristine W ,Amber and Ultra Nate she just shows maturity that most dance acts don't have. This is probally the last track for Nervous she will have released because she wants out of her contract with the label so they remixed this track originally found on the cd single of "Everyday" to great fanfare. The original Maurice Joshua Mix is the best--- still the Guido Osorio mixes are very energetic and quite good too. The radio mix(3:50) ,Club Mix(9:13) and dub mix(6:59) are in the same vain as Thunderpuss and that is quite good. This is the mixes that went to number one on the Billboard dance charts. The Jon Cutler Mix(7:24) is similar to the original mix in that it is more retro house in sound than the Guido Osorio mixes. Kim English Rocks.
