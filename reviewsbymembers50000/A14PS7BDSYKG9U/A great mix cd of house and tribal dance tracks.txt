 The main reason I bought this cd was to find a copy of Georgie Porgie's "Love  Is Gonna Save The Day" and you get it on here. This cd is mixed by Dj Joe Gauthreaux and features gospel/house tracks in the earlier tracks to more agressive type dubs by the end. Most tracks run from 5 1/2 to 8 minutes in length and are mixed very cleanly from one to the other. Tracks: 1)Georgie Porgie- Love Is Gonna Save The Day(Georgie's Original Mix)6:21 A number one dance track(his first and quite uplifting in performance 2)Donna Washington-We're Going Up(Gospel Flavor Mix)8:08 3)Ellepi-Cream E.P.
