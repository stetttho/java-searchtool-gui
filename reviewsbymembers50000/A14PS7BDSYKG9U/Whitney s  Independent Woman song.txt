 The woman finding strength in putting her man to the curb is nothing new ----try old country music and classic R&B  for fine examples. But with "It's Not Right But It's Okay" the remixes really put this song into orbit. The Thunderpuss Mixes are what made this song gel and it just seems better with each listen . These mixes were put on to the "Heartbreak Hotel " cd single along with the somewhat okay mixes by Johnny Vicious. This  cd now features Club 69 mastermind Peter Rauhofer doing quite a good job as well. The real find is the over the top mixes for "I Will Always Love You" by Hex Hector. They are right up there with some of his best mixes.
