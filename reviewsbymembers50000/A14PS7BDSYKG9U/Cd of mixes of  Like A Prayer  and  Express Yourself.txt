 This cd is from Australia and features the full 12" mixes of "Like A Prayer" and "Express Yourself". These are two of Madonna's best songs ever and hold up quite well. The mixes of "Like A Prayer" are done by Shep Pettibone and also by Bill Bottrell. The Shep mixes include the 12" Dance mix(7:55)-the only true house mix here,12" Extended Remix(7:27)-more R&B in sound and the Churchapella mix(6:09) that is acapella .Then the Bill Bottrell mixes come in a more guitar /funk R&B sound similar to Prince at that time . The 12" Club Version(6:38) and 7" edit(this mix-5:45- is on the "Immaculate Collection)are the mixes that hold up better. Then you get the full mixes of "Express Yourself" also by Mr. Pettibone. These hold up quite well and are true house classics.The Non Stop Express mix(8:02) and the even better Stop & Go Dubs(10:52) are looped with great editing and a kick butt song of course. The last mix is a more soulful radio friendly R&B mix-the Local mix. This mix is 6:28 and is one of Madonna's best mixes of the late 80's.This is before she became a jeep queen on "Erotica"/"Bedtime Story"and shows some idea of that thought in 1989. Excellent cd.
