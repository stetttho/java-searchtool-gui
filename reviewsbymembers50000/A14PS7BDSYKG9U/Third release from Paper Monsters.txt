 This is the 3rd release from the Dave Gahan solo release that has been less successful than hoped. All three singles didn't live up to the Depeche Mode chart success but that doesn't mean that they aren't good. This single came in at only the Dance sales chart and this time no club. The single for "Bottle Living" comes with 3 remixes ,the album version and 2 more songs. The reason for the 5 stars is the Tomcraft Vocal mix(7:47)--it is a very aggressive house /electro mix in which the song and the vocals are boosted up to more energy than the other mixes here. TREMENDOUS!!! Dave sounds incredible in this mix- one of the best dance mixes done for one of his songs. The Machine Head Lyric Mix(6:04) and the T. Raumschmiere Full Length Vocal Mix(5:19) are very good as well but are like the original version very moody and dark. "Hidden House"with the Alexander Kowalski Mix(5:15),which is very good house mix and "Hold On" Radio Mix ( 3:52) round out the rest of the cd. A great cd single of mixes for an overlooked cd.
