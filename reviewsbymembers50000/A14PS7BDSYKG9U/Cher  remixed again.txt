 This is the 3rd US commercially released single from Living Proof. This is actually the 5th single to be released worldwide following "The Music's No Good Without You", "Alive Again"(Germany only),"Song For The Lonely" and "A Different Kind Of Love Song". The cd features 2 songs remixed to different degrees of success.I am giving this cd 5 stars only for Cher alone. I would have chosen "Alive Again" or "Love One Another" as the main track for release but I am not Warner Brothers. The track "When The Money's Gone" was already a dance floor hit in the mid 90's by the producer of this song -Bruce Roberts and then covered by him for the Flawless movie as a duet with Kristine W and Elton John. So for the 3rd go round you get the remixes by Brother Brown with the H & H Vocal Mix(8:06) and Dynamo Mix(7:37). The H& H mix is not a bad mix but the second mix the Dynamo mix is weird. It is like Cher is fronting Kraftwerk or some euro 70's electronic act. The Passengerz club mix(7:20) is very well suited to the vocals of this song. The Thick Dick Vs. Cher Bootleg Mix (8:09) is a vocal dub. I think it samples the Stella Browne remix of "Gotta get Thru This" by Daniel Bedingfield. The best mix of this song is the Manny Lehman Vocal Mix(9:26). Part Nrg/Big Room  this mix is what Cher is all about. The second track is a remake of the number one club hit from 2000 by Amber. The lyrics are more secular this time and suit her very well. This comes with 3 mixes. The Eddie Baez Club Mix(8:49) is more laid back and slower in house style. The J Star Club Mix(8:49) is house with a slight trance thrown in. The best mix is the Glenn Friscia & Lamboy Club Mix(9:43). This suits Cher more than the other mixes here. Great remix.
