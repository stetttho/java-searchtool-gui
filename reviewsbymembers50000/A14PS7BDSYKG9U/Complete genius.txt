 This is the first track from the remixing group known as Scissor Sisters and it is a  work of complete genius. Coming off their steller remixes of "Good Boys" for Blondie and "Flamboyant" by Pet Shop Boys I decided to try their single for myself. It is a dance remake of the totally boring Pink Floyd. This version has a male/female falsetto vocal and reminds me of "Supernature" by Cerrone in that it is genderbending dance music at it's best. The last two mixes:Paper Faces and Hughes & Spier are mostly vocal dubs but tooooo good. The best mix for me is the Fatboy Slim mix. Excellent and full vocals.The listing is: 1- Album Mix(4:25) 2- Fatboy Slim Extended Mix (5:01) 3- Paper Faces Mix(8:25) 4- Hughes & Spier Mix(6:58)   The full cd is also really good. Hopefully Scissor Sisters will continued to put out great music for themselves and remixes for others. A++++++++ .
