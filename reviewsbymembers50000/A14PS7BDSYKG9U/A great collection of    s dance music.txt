 I've had this cd for several months now and have played it from time to time. The songs are somewhat dated in sound for a few but like the Donna Summer mix just gets better every year.I originally bought the UK 12" for $5.00 in 1993 and that was a steal back then and to finally find it on cd is a thrill. The late Patrick Cowley somehow topped the original 1977 mix is a mystery to me.To me the original "I Feel Love" is the most influential dance song of all time and this mix is even better!!! This cd is full of rare 12" mixes of classic songs by E.G. Daily,Jennifer Holliday,Gloria Gaynor,Eartha Kitt(scary cat sounds begin this mix) and Phyllis Nelson. Plus you get Nrg classics from Dead Or Alive,The Flirations,Menage,Cliff Richard and Maria Vidal. Plus you also get cover versions of pop songs by Chimira,Chyp-Notik ,Blonde Ambition and Jeanie Tracy. My two favorite songs are the mixes of Limahl for "Neverending Story" and the disco mix for Amanda Lear's genderbending "Follow Me". This song is weird but incredibly hypnotic. The Pet Shop Boys Track is a single mix but other than that to have all these mixes on two cds from Canada is well worth the price.
