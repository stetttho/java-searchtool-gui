 This is the second part of the single for "Cry Me A River" and it comes with another remix plus 2 house mixes for "Like I Love You". The first track is the Johnny Fiasco Vocal Mix(6:43)and is very well done. It nicely mixes house with Justin's vocals very well. The best songs are the already number one Billboard club tracks for "Like I Love You". The Basement Jaxx Vocal Mix (6:03) keeps a lot of the original version(Blips, Acoustic guitar and drums) while adding a whole lot of what Basement Jaxx does best- their quirky house style to the mix. The best mix though is the flat out beauty that is the remix by Deep Dish. The ZigZag remix (7:06) just is aggressive and yet works the whole song up to a new level of energy. Too Good!!!
