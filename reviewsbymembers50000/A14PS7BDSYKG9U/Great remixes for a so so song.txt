 First off I bought this single because it went to number one on the Billboard Club Play chart and only for that. I've heard so much bad stuff about the song which to me is similar to Michael Jackson's recent releases of OH WOE IS ME type songs. So the basis of this review is the remixes and only that. I love the house mixes a lot and you get two incredible mixes here. The Thunderpuss Mix (7:42) just is really well done.  It moves from their aggessive style to then an almost Giorgio Moroder Type of music near the middle. Incredible. The Full Intention Club Mix(7:02) is more suited vocally to Whitney's Vocal on the song. Very Retro  in style and feel with heavy bass through out. Excellent. The P. Diddy Mix is why it gets 1 star off. It features a sample of KRS-One's "Step Into A World(Rapture's Delight)" which sampled Blondie's superior "Rapture" and this mix is sort of like Michael Jackson's "They Don't Care About Us" and that is not good at all. The house mixes to me save this song from oblivion.
