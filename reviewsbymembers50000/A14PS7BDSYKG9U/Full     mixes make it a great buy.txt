 I was always curious about the music of Colonel Abrams since I began keeping track of the Billboard Club Chart in late 1986. In 1987 Colonel Abrams went to number one for 2 weeks with "How Soon We Forget" and I have always wanted a copy on cd. This collection has 5 full 12" mixes on it. Colonel Abrams has 4 number one dance records on the Billboard charts :"How Soon We Forget","Trapped" and "I'm Not Gonna Let You" plus his other chart topper was listed as Colonel Abrams (LP). The voice is a mixture of Teddy Pendergrass and Johnny Gill.The collection also highlights some of his ballads as well. But the main reason to by is the 12" dance mixes. In a time when club music got played on black radio this is a time I wish still coninued today. The 12" mixes for "The Truth" (7:50),"Trapped" (6:30),"I'm Not Gonna Let You" (6:50--absolutely incredible),"How Soon We Forget"(7:49-early chicago type house mix) and the mid tempo club hit-#46-"Over And Over" (6:22) are worth the price. "Speculation" was a club single but no 12" was included. Cd runs around 63 minutes long. Great 80's dance music.
