 This is the Uk cd single release of the moderately successful release in the States of the former Gospel singer Stacie Orrico. Now a favorite of the TRL crowd comes the single that came in the UK charts at #11. The reason and only reason to buy this single is for the FULL 8:25 Thunderpuss Remix!!! The original song was produced by Dallas Austin & Matt Serletic and that was a okay version. The remix was a number one Billboard Sales Chart hit in the edited US release and this remix is not one of Thunderpuss' best work. The other track "Until I Find You" is okay. An okay track from an artist who shows some promise to be the next Amy Grant.
