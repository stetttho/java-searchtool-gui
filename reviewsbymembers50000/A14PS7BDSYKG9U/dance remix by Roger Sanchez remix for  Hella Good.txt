 This is the cd for those of you looking for the full length mix of "Hella Good" by No Doubt. I know there is another cd out there but this has the 7:13 Release Yourself mix by dance remix legend Roger Sanchez. This mix went to number one on the Billboard dance charts and for good reason. The mix keeps the guitar from the original and adds live drums and a kicking house groove to the mix. But front and center is Gwen's vocals that really work to a house beat. Excellent mix. Plus you also get the "Stank" remix of "Hey Baby" that features Outkast and Killer Mike to replace Bounty Killer from the original mix. This mix(4:03) is good too but the selling point to this cd is the house mix to "Hella Good".
