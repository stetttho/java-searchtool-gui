 This is the new single from Tom Stephan otherwise know as Superchumbo. This song is just one of the best tribal mixes I've heard in a long  time . This is the followup to the huge European  hit "The Revolution" and features Pet Shop Boys back up vocalist and veteran  Sylvia Mason-James on lead vocals. There aren't that much lyric wise involved to the song but she sings it with so much conviction. It somehow remined me of the girl group Sweet Sensation and that is a good thing for me. The mixes come in the original radio mix (3:32),Mouth-watering mix(9:33) and Tantalizing Dub mix(9:09) by Mr. Stephan himself. The Greg Ortiz's "Oh So Irresisible Mix"(10:41) is excellent but a minute of just acappella vocals are a bit much. The best mix is the Adam Freemer Aquatic Dub mix(7:57) that begins almost disco like with live congas the becomes more mainstream house to then all tribal with loopy keyboard riffs. Brilliant.
