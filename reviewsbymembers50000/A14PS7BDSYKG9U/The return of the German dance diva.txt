 This is the first US release from Billie Ray Martin since "Imitation Of Life" in  1995/96. She has released several singles and cds since then so like Kylie she returns on a new label and with an old song. This song was originally released in 1999/2000 in Germany and Australia  to some fanfare but now comes the American release of "Honey" that features 1 new mix and 2 previous mixes. The new mix is by Above & Beyond and like their work on Perpetuous Dreamer's "The Sound Of Goodbye" it is a marvel of the drama that exudes from this trance mix. The radio mix(3:30) and Club Mix(7:21) put forth her rich vocals in a haunting light. The Best mix is the Chicane mixes. The radio(3:32) and Club mix(8:52) are classic Biliie Ray martin all the way. I don't think they entire vocals are on the club mix so I guess it is a vocal dub but it is so well done. It stands right up there with "Your Loving Arms" and "Running around Town" as her best work.The Deep Dish mix(11:09) is good but too much effects sometimes distract from the vocals. The Deep Dish & Chicane mixes are the original mixes. This song went to number 3 on the Billboard club Charts. This is her first release for Nervous records and I guess they want an intelligent singer to take the place of the departed Kim English. Hopefully a full cd will be released. Look out for her 1995 cd Deadline For My Memories. Gives Kristine W a run for her dance floor money.A++++++++++
