 This is the first single from the lead vocalist of Depeche Mode --- Mr. Dave Gahan. This single "Dirty Sticky Floors" hasn't broke through on radio yet but is a huge club single. The Mixes included are by Junkie XL,The Pasengerz ,Lexicon Avenue and Silencer. The Junkie XL Vocal Mix( 10:44) is a great trance/ house mix. The Passengerz Dirty Club Vocal Mix(7:25) is the one most clubs will be playing. It is the wonderful bassline and vocals of Mr. Gahan the work best. He always sounds so good under a great house mix!!The Lexicon Avenue Vocal Mix(10:31) is similar to the Junkie XL mix but gives a harder bassline the focus. The Silencer Remix(6:38) is basically an electro style dub mix. You get 2 bonus tracks-"Stand Up"(5:28) and "Maybe"(4:52) that are great as well. This is a great start musically for Dave Gahan .
