 I've never been to a White Party or really know what one is but I enjoyed this cd very much. The main reason for buying it was to find a copy of "Caught Up" by DJ Disciple and it is here. This cd is mixed by Brett Henrichsen and he does a good job of letting the songs go for more than 3 or 4 minutes unlike most mixed cds do. The songs are more popular(on Billboard charts)but also contain some rare finds too. A good cd to play for your own party.      Tracks on cd: 1)Dolce -Fire(Orange Factory Original Mix) 8:12 2)X-Union-Freedom (Unity Club Mix) 13:13  Very tribal 3)Jessica Folker-To Be Able To Love (Jonathan Peters Club Mix)7:04--very good mix by Mr. Peters(Not really a big fan of his work. 4)DJ Disciple Featuring Mia Cox- Caught Up(Guido Osorio Vocal Mix)8:08  Full Vocals -#1 on dance charts 5)Kim English-Everyday (Hex Hector & Mac Quayle Club/dub Mix)9:54-A mixture of both mixes-A rare mix 6)Gioia- Free To Be (Liquid 360 Anthem Mix) Great seeing former Expose lead singer back in action. In good voice too! 7)Guido Osorio Project Featuring Angelica Deno-Runaway(Main Mix)8:32 -more nrg-ish house in sound. 8)Aubrey-Stand Still (Kinetic Journey Mix)6:10 A shorter mix but still a great song nonetheless-#1 club hit 9)Abigail-Set Me Free(Andy &The Lamboy Mix)8:25---Also a number one club hit for the dance veteran. ty.
