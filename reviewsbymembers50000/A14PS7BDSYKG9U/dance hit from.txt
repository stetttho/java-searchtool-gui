 This Madonna cd features 2 remixes of "Open Your Heart" . The first mix is the vocal 12" mix (10:35) and is too long and should have been around 6 or 7 minutes long.That is my only complaint of the cd . The Dub Mix is 6 1/2 minutes and shows that a shorter tighter mix works best. This song was the first Madonna track that went to number one when I began tracking Billboard's club charts in late 1986. She had a few before "Open Your Heart" and many after it(27  #1's in all)so you can trace her progress of her career from song to song. Some songs are classics and some are not ("Hanky Panky -not)--this remix is close but way too long,
