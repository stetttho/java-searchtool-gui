 Following the footsteps of Celine Dion,Tina Arena,Lara Fabian and Shakira comes the latest foreign superstar to come to America with a dance record. This is the first English language release for Italian superstar and sometime Spanish singing star Laura Pausini. The song "Surrender" follows closely the strategy of Lara Fabian in that she gets the royal remix treatment with no less than 7 remixes presented here. The mixes range from flat out house to trance to ambient. The first mix is by Mike Rizzo and his Global Club Mix(8:45) is the showcase mix here. It is underground yet mainstream in house. Very well done. Track 2-Ford's Club Mix(7:44) and track 3-Nick Fierce 's Polarbabies Club mix(8:04) are the best mixes and come in the Euro/Trance/House mixes. They suit the energy of the vocals best and the music is strictly for the European like DJ's . The Lenny Bertlodo Club Mix(8:34) is the most underground house mix here. The Eric Kupper Extended Mix(5:52) is like a lost Celine Dion mix in that it is only for the radios to play.The last track is the Mike Rizzo Global Dub mix(5:44). Hopefully this single will the first of many to come from Ms. Pausini.
