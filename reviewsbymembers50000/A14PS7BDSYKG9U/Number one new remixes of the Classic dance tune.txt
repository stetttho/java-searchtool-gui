 This song recently spent 2 weeks at number one on the Billboard club play chart . One listen to the mixes and you can hear why. They bring the original mix to the new century. And as a bonus you get 2 great new mixes for "Crazy" as well. God bless Warner Brothers for keep putting out cd singles.  1- Killer ( Peter Rauhofer Remix Pt. 1) 7:41  2- Killer ( Peter Rauhofer Remix Pt. 2) 9:10-- both mixes are the main reason it went number one on the dance charts. The Pt. 2 remix being the more aggressive mix of the two.  3- Killer (Morel's Pink Noise Vocal Mix) 8:19  4- Killer (Dj Monk's Remix) 8:18--- begins almost as an acoustic remix them deepens up the house vibe then goes into an almost hip hop style house mix. Excellent mix.  5- Killer (Jim Albert's Loneliness Is A Killer Mix )7:59--- vocal dub mix.   6- Crazy  (Ananda Project Vocal Mix) 6:55-- retro sounding live instruments kind of mix.  7- Crazy  (Orange Factory Mix)5:55-- excellent mix.   Another number one dance single for Seal--- 4 in a row. A++++
