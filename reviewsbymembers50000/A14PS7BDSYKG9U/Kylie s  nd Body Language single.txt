 This is the Australian cd single for "Red Blooded Woman" and so far is the only cd to have a remix of the song. The cd somes with 2 mixes of the track-single version and the electro dub-like mix(Whitey Mix-5:19) that is great. You also get the bonus tracks "Cruise Control"-which is on the US Body Language cd and "Almost A Lover" which is really good. The main reason to buy is the inclusion of the FULL length Chemical Brothers remix for her number one club track "Slow". This mix is over 7 minutes and sleeks around almost as good as the Radio Slave Mix. Excellent track.
