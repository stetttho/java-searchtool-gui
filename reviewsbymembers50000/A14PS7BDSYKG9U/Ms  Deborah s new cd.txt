 This is the third release from Canadian R&B songstress Deborah Cox and it is her best yet. It is a mixture of jeep tunes,3 ballads and 2 house tracks. The best track on the cd is the ballad "Hurt So Much" which is very much like "Unbreak My Heart" by Toni Braxton. The rest runs toward current R&B trends with the best tracks being the first single "Up & Down(In & Out)", "Oh My Gosh", "Giving It Up" ,"Play Your Part" and "2 Good 2 Be True". The dance tracks are the latest club track and I think Ms. Cox's first from scratch house track "Mr. Lonely" and a single edit of the huge club hit "Absolutely Not".BUT  there is a  special limited edition cd out that was not from here(Amazon.com) but from another retail store that I actually own. It features a second disc of remixes of "Mr. Lonely" and "Up & Down(In & Out)" . This cd features FULL 12" MIXES !! The mixes are by Hex Hector & Mac Quayle(10:07),Junior Vasquez(10:42) and Widelife(11:21) of "Mr. Lonely" and the mixes by Godson(4:41) and Hector & Quayle(6:31)  of "Up & Down (In & Out)". Amazon .com doesn't sell this version so be on the look out if you really want those rare mixes!
