 This is the latest track from Ralphi Rosario & Abel Aguilera who record under the name Rosabel. Following their number one singles "Don't You Want My Love" and "The Power" and their top ten remake of "And I Am Telling You I'n Not Going" comes the blandly titled "That Sound"----there have been so many tracks titled The or That Sound on the dance charts it is amazing! Well onto this track,title aside: it is a dark and tribal affair for the mixes done by the Rosabel mixers themselves. There are 4 full length mixes along side track 1 which is a radio mix. Track 2 Nitrogen Blast Mix(7:55) and track 3 the Darkstrumental Mix(5:14) are very hard in sound and rife with looping keyboard effects that would keep the underground crowds happy. Track 4 is the Masculine Mix(6:33) is to me the lightest and poppiest of the mixes. I really like this mix a lot.The final track is the Dark & Sexy Dub Mix(7:30) and features to me the best mix of all of the ones here. It features computer vocals alongside an uncredited female vocalist. Excellent. This too was a number one on the Billboard club play charts.
