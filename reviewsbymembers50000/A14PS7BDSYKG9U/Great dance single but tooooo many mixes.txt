 This single was released last year and charted on Billboard as Robbie Rivera & Axwell Featuring Suzan Brittan but for the US cd single release it is just under the Suzan Brittan name. The cd comes with 14(that is right 14!!!!!!) mixes. Some are radio,dub and 12" vocal mixes and run the entire spectrum of dance  music. This was a number one Billboard hit. This is the track listing:  1- Johnny Budz Radio Edit(3:40)  2- Johnny Budz Club Mix(5:09)-these mixes are latin/breakbeat in style and are good.  3- Mr. Piraz Radio Edit(4:12)  4- Mr. Piraz Club Mix(5:59)-these mixes are Daft Punk like house mixes- with a loopy vocal loop thrown in.  5- Mr. Piraz Dub Mix(5:00)  6- Robbie Rivera Radio Edit(3:48)  7- Robbie Rivera Club Mix(6:41)  8- Robbie Rivera Funk Dub Mix(6:42)-these mixes are more piano house driven-almost a filtered house mix.   9- Axwell radio Edit(3:49) 10- Axwell Club Mix(6:31)- these mixes are a harder house mix 11- JJ Radio Edit(3:54) 12- JJ Club Mix(7:22)- the best mixes here. More bass driven house mixes -if you like Maurice Joshua- this mix is yours!!!! 13- Dj Scotty Radio Edit(3:53) 14- Dj Scotty Club Mix(7:44)- these mixes are more NRG/Techno house driven.   This is a great cd single but it could have been a bit shortened without all the radio mixes. But still good.
