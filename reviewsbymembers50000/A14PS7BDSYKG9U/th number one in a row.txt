 This is the latest single for the legendary duo Murk --Oscar Gaeton and Ralph Falcon. This follows their success of 5 number one club play singles in 2002/2003 and this is no different. This time though vocals are handled by Greg "Stryke" Chin and they suit the song just fine. The mixes run from aggressive rock house to tribal to a little bleeps and horns through in . All good mixes included.They are:  1- Murk Original Radio Edit (3:33)  2- Peter Rauhofer Timeless Club Mix (7:17)- more Murk than the guys do themselves.  3- The Scumfrog Remix (7:42) - excellent mix- best on here and shows the reason this guy should do a Blondie remix for "Undone"- come on Sanctuary.  4- Chab Vocal Mix (8:41)  5- Southside's 4 AM Remix (9:33)- the bleeps and whistles and congas!!!  6- Murk Original Mix (6:12)- Excellent.    Full vocals on each mix. This cd is another winner for Tommy Boy.
