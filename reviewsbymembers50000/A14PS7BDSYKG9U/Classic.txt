 This album I bought in  1980 and it hold up as her best record ever. The clash with the Chic producers over Diana's decision to remix the album herself and put her vocals up front must have worked because there is not a  bad track on here. The two huge hits are "Upside Down" and "I'm Coming Out" and they continue to be sampled by different rap songs 20+ years after they were released. There is nothing better than listening to Tony Thompson's drum solo on "I'm Coming Out". "My Old Piano" was released in the UK only. "Tenderness","Give Up" and "Have Fun(Again)" are classic Chic disco and hold up well. This album has been played alot over the 22 years of ownership. Diana's best record.
