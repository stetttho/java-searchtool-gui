 This the English language debut in America of Mexican superstar Paulina Rubio. She has had a long career in Mexico since she was a small child and now comes her first US single "Don't Say Goodbye". The song is one of pleading for her loved one not to leave her and it is very well done. The cd single comes with 2 full length 12" mixes. The first is the Spanish Fly Club mix(6:38) and is the best mix here. It is bass heavy -wah wah guitar retro disco in style. It suits the songs lyrics very well and compliments Paulina's limited vocals best. I love this mix a lot. The Flatline mix(8:58) is very good but mostly a dub mix. This song to me is right up there with Bette Midler's "To Deserve You" and Betty Boo's "Catch Me" in its heartbreak feel and style. Just too good.
