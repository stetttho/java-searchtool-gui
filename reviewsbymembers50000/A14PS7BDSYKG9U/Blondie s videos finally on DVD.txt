 With the release of Blondie's Greatest Video Hits this marks the first time that a collection of Blondie videos are released on DVD. This DVD is basically The Best Of Blondie with 3 bonus tracks. First off the sound(5.1) and picture are tremendous and this brings out more music than what was previously released on the cd versions of the songs. This is the list of videos: 1)In The Flesh 2)X Offender 3)Denis(The FACE is too gorgeous!) 4)Detroit 442 5)(I'm Always Touched By Your)Presence,Dear 6)Picture This 7)Hanging On The Telephone 8)Heart Of Glass 9)Dreaming 10)Union City Blue 11)Atomic 12)The Tide Is High 13)Rapture Bonus Videos---- 14)The Hardest Part 15)Island Of Lost Souls 16)Maria A great collection of hits but my only gripe with this DVD is that a DVD can hold 2 or 3 hours or more- then where are the other videos from the Eat To  The Beat collection or Nothing is Real But The Girl or even the remix videos from 1995 of Atomic and Heart Of Glass?!?  Oh well buy and watch the face of the most beautiful woman God has ever put on the earth.Essential stuff!
