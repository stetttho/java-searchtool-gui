 There is not much I can't say about how good this cd really is .  It just kicks major dance music [rear] on every cut. "Love At First Sight","Dancefloor" ,"In Your Eyes", "Fever" and every song just gets better with each listen. The lovely Ms. Kylie is really at the top of her game. Plus you get two bonus tracks "Boys" a very Vanity 6/Prince type song and "Butterfly" from her last Cd "Light Years" are welcome additions. Buy it now!
