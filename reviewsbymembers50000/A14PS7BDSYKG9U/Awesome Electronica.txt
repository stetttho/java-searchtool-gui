 This cd was released to most countries on the EMI label but for the US market on the smaller Electrovenus Records. The mastermind behind the cd is Paolo Cillone & Claudio Camaione and they do a fine job of making this a killer collection. The main reason for my buying this cd was the track "Uncontrollable Love" with featured vocals by GOD herself Ms. Deborah Harry. The track which comes in the original and even better FR/Action Remix (5:34) are what Daft Punk would kill to be making. Debbie kicks ... as usual. Then you get the very sexual track "On The Prowl" that features raunch queen Lydia Lunch. Plus you get a weird remake of "Don't You Want Me","Nacht Des Leguans" which a tribute to Iggy Pop,the gay themed "Fly With Me","Go With a Bang" ,"Hurt Me" and "You Can't Make Me Do That" which was written by the late Dee Dee Ramone as killer tracks. The cover of this cd is bound to get attention but hopefully so will the music. BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!
