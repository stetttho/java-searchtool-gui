 I've been a fan of tanya's since I first saw her on Solid Gold in 1980 performing "Pecos Promenade" and have been a faithful buyer of her music since then. So to get a new cd from her is quite an achievement in that she had in that time to settle her dispute with Capitol Records over lack of promotion and just general lack of attention from the label itself. The fact that her last album only produced 2 hits ("Little Things" and "Riding Out The Heartache" which only got as far as #44 on the country charts) is disappointing because "Complicated" is one of her best. So onto this album ---it is also one of her best in that every song is a potential hit waiting to happen. The first cut "A Memory Like I'm Gonna Be" sits as of October 5 ,2002 on the country charts at only #48--hopefully counrty radio will get off its "We no longer play older artists " crap and pick it up. The best song on here is "Borrowed Wings" and if this is not a number one hit country radio sucks huge. It is one of the best ballads she has ever recorded and the fact that Vince Gill is on back up makes it even better. The album is a mixture of what Ms. Tucker does best - a little rock("Old Weakness(Coming On Strong)" to ballads ("Oh What A Love" to "Over My Shoulder") to the gorgeous country gospel of "Waiting For The Sun" every track from the first note to the last rings true. If you like her then buy this cd -it is like a visit from an old long lost friend.
