 This is the newest release from what most of the US knows as the "Blonde From Abba"- Agnetha Faltskog's newest cd is a collection of pop songs from the 60's that most people really wouldn't know were old songs. The cd is a more quiet and orchestral type of cd- it almost reminds me of a 60's era Cher/Dusty Springfield album. There are no gay dance happy Abba songs on this cd so don't complain . The first track "My Colouring Book" sets the mood for the whole collection- very moody and introspective in nature it is beautiful to hear how mature and great her voice has become. The best songs for me were the first single "If I Thought You'd Ever Change Your Mind" which hit # 12 on the UK charts,"Sealed With A Kiss", the spoken word drama that is "Past,Present and Future","A Fool Am I", "The End Of The World"-made famous by Skeeter Davis, "What Now My Love" and the best vocal I have heard from Agnetha on the stunning "Sometimes When I'm Dreaming". Just a great cd from the first to the last song. A++++ work. Hopefully it will come to the US and work it's magic.
