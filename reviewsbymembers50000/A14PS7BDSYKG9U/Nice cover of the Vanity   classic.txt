 Not many people have tried to do a straight up cover of Vanity 6's 1982 radio banned classic "Nasty Girl" but dance diva Inaya Day tries. This version is the US cd single (the Australian one has different mixes) and features 4 very well done mixes. This version is sung as if Brenda Bennett was the lead singer of Vanity 6 instead of Denise Matthews. BIG vocals. The sticking point for me and if you know the original version -- is that Ms. Day never utters the line that got the song banned from radio and the cover of so many stories-- "I need 7 inches or more" . Why that was not included is beyond me. It seems that Vanity in 1982 had more guts or sleeze than Inaya Day did in 2005. The mixes range from flat out bass driven house to tribal house.  Tracks:  Nasty Girl 1- Full Mix (5:01) 2- So Phat Remix Remix (6:07) 3- Peter 's Reconstruction Mix (9:48) 4- Rauhofer's Sleaze Mix (8:17)    Excellent mixes and vocals but not enough guts to try and do the original the way Prince made it to begin with.
