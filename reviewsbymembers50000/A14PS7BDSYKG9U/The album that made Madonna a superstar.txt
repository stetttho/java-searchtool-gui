 This was Madonna's second release and the one that made the freakishly huge star that she remains to this day. The hits from this cd are the classic "Like A Virgin","Material Girl","Angel","Dress You Up" and "Love Don't Live Here Anymore". The cd also features some of Madonna's best non hits like "Stay","Over And Over" and my favorite "Shoo-bee-doo". This cd also features the original 12" mixes of "Like A Virgin"(6:08) and "Material Girl"(6:07). My only gripe is that if Warner Brothers was going to put 12" mixes of the songs then include "Angel" and "Dress You Up" as well. Oh well - this was produced by Nile Rodgers after his work with Diana Ross, Debbie Harry and David Bowie and shows his growth at working and allowing the artist a chance to grow too.
