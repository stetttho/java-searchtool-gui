 I have been searching for this cd for many many years. The main reason was to get the dance mixes of the songs that really pushed Michael over the top in 1982/83/84 with Thriller. This cd features only 2 full 12" mixes plus the lp versions of the others. "Billie Jean" is 6:21 and "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'" is 6:29. The lp mixes are 4:54 and 6:02 respectively and they just add bits to both. "Billie Jean" adds a whole vamp vocal from Michael. "Beat It "(4:16),"Thriller"(5:56) and "P.Y.T."(4:01) are all original lp mixes. This is well worth it for the awesome "Billie Jean". The sound is incredible--but I played it off my dvd player. Just a tremendous collection of five classic songs. A+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
