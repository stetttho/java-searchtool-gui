 I've been a fan of hers since I first heard "Something To Believe In " and have went back to buy her first few cds. This is one of the best Christmas albums that I've heard in a long time. I actually bought this last year and brought it out this year for another go round. It just got better. The cd features 3 original songs "Christmas Stays The Same","Christmas Through A Child's Eyes" and the Vienna like "The Bells Of St. Paul". The medleys of "Here Comes Santa Claus/Santa Claus Is Coming To Town" which shows off her jazzier/uptempo side while her Christmas Medley of "I'll Be Home For Christmas/Let It Snow/Silver & Gold" showcases her ability to make old songs her own. But the best songs are the classic Christmas songs like "The Christmas Song", "Ave Maria","Silent Night" ,"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas" and "The Little Drummer Boy". The 2 best tracks are the emotional almost black gospel versions of "O Holy Night" and "Do You Hear What I Hear" that are tremendous. An excellent Christmas album to listen to for years to come.
