 This is the third club track released from Jewel and it is her third number one club track on Billboard. The song is one of the troubles of the world as seen through Jewel's eyes and the quirky way she sees things. So for a dance record it is not your typical LA LA LA type of song- deeper than that. The mixes are from house all the way to drum and bass. The first 2 remixes are mainstream house mixes that work the vocals the best:Markus Schulz Club Mix(6:49) and Mike Rizzo Remix(8:04) are great. The Scumfrog Extended Re-Hash Mix(7:40) is what most club djs are playing- it is mostly the dub of the song with the line "Hookers and Hash" being lopped for most of the song. Excellent.The Boris & Beck Club Mix(6:29) messes with the vocals a bit but is the best mix here. The tracks 5,7 & 8 are all Bastone & Burnz mixes to a varying degree of success. Their Club Mix(7:12) is house but the way they mix the vocal in(it is slowed down a bit) doesn't work that well.Their Del Moody Mix(5:24) is better and is a more mid tempo type of mix while their Drum & Bass Mix(5:35) really shows off the potential of their work best. The track 6 is the Markus Schulz Coldharbour Mix(9:51) and is a beautiful trance dub mix of the song. Another club winner for Jewel.
