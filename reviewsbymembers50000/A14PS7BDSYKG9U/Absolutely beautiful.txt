 This was originally released on the Groovilicious label before it went under with Strictly Rhythm and then picked up for release by Robbins. This cd single is gorgeous- the vocals, the mixes the song -everything is just amazing. The amazing part of this is that I actually like a Jonathan Peters mix for once. Usually he over powers his mixes with bee type sounding music but the vocal mixes are perfect for the song -he produced as well. The best mix for me though is the Robbie Tronco mix. Disco if ever there was a mix. From the strings, real percussion to the retro vibe of the mix Reina comes off as the star still. This is my introduction to her and I like what I hear. She sounds almost like Mariah Carey with a bit of India which is really good if you asked me.   1- Jonathan Peters Radio Edit (4:15)  2- Robbie Tronco Radio Edit (3:49)  3- Jonathan Peters Sound Factory Mix (11:08)  4- Jonathan Peters Mix Show Mix (6:05)  5- Jonathan Peters Tribe-A- Pella Mix (8:23)  6- Jonathan Peters Dub Mix (9:23)- the bees have arrived on this mix.  7- Robbie Tronco Club Mix (8:17)   A beautiful cd of great mixes and an even better voice. A++++
