 This cd single features the Track Masters Mix with Nas that was not on her remix collection. The first track is the Nas featured track and is only 2:51. The next two Track Masters are Jennifer only in track 2 (3:14) similar to the original with no rap and track 3 (3:14) and instrumental. Quite good if you like Diva Jeep music. The real find for I guess everyone who bought this is the Thunderpuss mixes for the ballad from her movie Enough. This features some of the best vocals from Jennifer in her short career. The original in its "Theme From Mahogany" type style of ballardary gets turned into a fierce independent statement in remix form . The Club Mix (8:51) is pure Thunderpuss in that it hits you over the head and never stops in it's energy level. But for me the Tribe-a-pella mix(7:50) is more pulled back in style and to me works even better to showcase the urgency in both the lyrics and vocal performance. "Alive" recently topped Billboard's Top 12"/Maxi singles sales chart and peaked at number 2 on their club play chart. Excellent mixes and song to match.
