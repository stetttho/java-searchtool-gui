 This is the album that launched her to the world and she has never looked back since. This album I orginally bought in late 1983 and again on cd in early 1987 and is one of my favorites because she isn't trying to be anything but a dance artist and the songs showcase a vibrant energy that most of her later work doesn't have. In 1982 the dance community got the first glance at her with the 12"s of "Everybody","Phyical Attraction" and "Burning Up". The came "Holiday" in 1983 and the rest is history. "Holiday " remains my favorite Madonna song of all time because she is at ease and happy and that energy in any form of music is very very rare . This new remastered cd features the 12" mixes of "Lucky Star"(7:15) and "Burning Up"(5:56) which were mixed by then boyfriend Jellybean Benitez. Classic Madonna from start to finish.
