 This is the second time around in the UK for this single but this time it comes with remixes that were not on the original. The song "It's My Life" was a number one club track for the original artist Talk Talk in the 80's and this time around Gwen Stefani kinda makes this song her own- I still like the original better. The cd single comes with "Bathwater" which is remixed as well. Here are the tracks:  1- It's My Life (Original Mix) 3:46  2- Bathwater (Invincible Overlord Remix) 3:07  3- It's My Life (Jacques Lu Cont's Thin White Duke Remix) 6:59-also did a mix for "Hollywood" for Madonna. Electro type mix.  4- It's My Life (Chocolate O'Brien Remix) 5:43- house mix- what most dj's probably played in the clubs. Full beautiful vocals. Suits the retro vibe of the original mix. My favorite mix  5 & 6 are the Videos for the songs.    This was a promo only release in the US and reached #16 on the club charts.Excellent remixes.
