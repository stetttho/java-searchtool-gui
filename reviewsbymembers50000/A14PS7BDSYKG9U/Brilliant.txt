 This is the second single from Timo's new cd and is better than "To Get Down". This single also ... topped Billboard's Club chart and that is Mr. Maas' first to do so as an artist. This cd is fron the UK and features two brilliant remixes of the song. First off it features the toasting/talking style of MC Chickaboo ,whom I have never heard of before but is a welcome addition to the song. The mixes are by Scanty which takes the song on a little more aggressive house/techno stance that is for the underground or more rave induced crowd. This mix is 7:44. The second mix is by Roger Sanchez and his S-Man's Heartbreaka mix is more mainstream but still a little out there in style. This mix is what most American DJ's have been playing and is a little bit more aggressive that what Roger Sanchez is used to producing as a remix. This mix is 8:43 and the best mix for my taste. You also get a video and single mix of the song too. I also think it nicks a bit from Pat Benatar's "Heartbreaker" chorus too.
