 First off I am giving this cd 5 stars solely on the love of Taylor Dayne's voice and her collection of classic dance songs. But this cd features 20 ---that's right 20 remixes of her new song "How Many". This is way too long so my advice is to listen to a little bit at a time and not the entire 20 in one setting like I foolishly did. The song recently went to number 6 on the dance charts and the mixes range from NRG to hard house to Big Room mixes to euro trance.    Remixes:  Disc 1:  1) Original Mix (4:07)  2) Big Bang Edit (4:08)  3) Guido Osorio Club Mix (9:04)-house mix  4) Lifestylus Deep & Heavy Mix(9:39)- Deep/dubby vocal mix  5) Fiburn & Urik Club Mix(8:48)-- Best mix on disc 1  6) Menergy Sound Factory Vox Dub(7:54)  7) Guido Osorio Dub Mix (6:36)   8) Fiburn & Urik Dub Mix (6:15)  9) Lifestylus Dub Mix(7:27) 10) K-Peble Mix(9:34)-- aggressive but yet a hint of disco .    Disc 2:  1) Vibelicious Radio Edit(3:48)  2) DJ Manolo & Gene Therapy Mix(9:32)  3) Big Bang Mix(8:15)---Tribal!!!  4) Bet Boyz Vocal Dub(5:50) - piano driven hard house mix  5) DJ's Inc. Mix(9:36)- Thunderpuss Big room style remix with her vocals held longer and has more intense energy on this mix.  6) Nocturnal Minds Mix(8:47)- Euro/trance  mix -second best mix  7) Vibelicious Anthem Mix(9:00)- a mixture of tribal and trance-almost like a classic Junior Vasquez mix.  8) Wes Wallace Dub(6:22) -trance  9) Eddie X & Spritual Being Mix(7:46) - too busy and the find a way to trounce Taylor's vocals which is a hard thin to do. 10) The Larry K Classic Club Mix(7:43)--The best mix of this cd single. Just like a Cher remix!      This cd is way too long so don't be discouraged to listen to them all because they are from one of dance music's best singers ever.
