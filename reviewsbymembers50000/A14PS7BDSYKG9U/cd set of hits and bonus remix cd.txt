 This is yet another collection from Donna Summer and you can not complain about the songs on here because they are all classics. The 2 cd Anthology is a better compilation than this but I defy you to find a bad song here at all. The main reason for me to own this collection is the 2 new songs that are on Disc 1 -"That's The Way" and "Dream-A-Lot's Theme(I Will Live For Love)" that reunite her with the legend that is Giorgio Moroder. The second disc also contains the 12" mixes for "Dream-A-Lot's Theme(I Will Live For Love)" (12"Extended Remix-9:16) and You're So Beautiful(The Ultimate Club Mix-10:50) that are sure to be classics as well. Hopefully Donna will try and put out a new cd of brand new material or if there is another compilation from Universal in the next few years then try and put out a box set of ALL(and I do mean ALL) the 12" dance mixes that Donna Summer has ever put out----I know I will buy it.
