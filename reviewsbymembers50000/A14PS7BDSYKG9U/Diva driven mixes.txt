 This is a recent number one on the Billboard Dance charts and follows the  female fronted kick men to the curb mixes of recent years like Whitney's "It's Not Right But It's Okay" and Pusaka 's "You're The Worst Thing" but not to me with the awe inspiring results as those. Track 1,2 and 3 are by Dezrok and come in the single mix(3:37),Club Mix(11:32) and more stripped down and best mix the Dark Drama Mix(9:32). The original mix by the Act themselves (10:07) is very trance/house style. Not as deep or underground in feel this mix is quite good. I like this  and feel that it is good but I've heard it before.
