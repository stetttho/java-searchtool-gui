 This is the 2 cd import for the Ultimate collection of Toni Braxton's hits. Disc 1 is a greatest hits collection of basically every Toni Braxton track that has hit the pop/r&b charts from the beginning with Babyface on "Give U My Heart" from the Boomerang soundtrack to the huge black and dance hit "Hit The Freeway" in 2002. Everything you want of her hits is here. But for me the main reason to buy this cd was the second disc of mixes that are very rare. The Frankie Knuckles Full 12" mix for "Unbreak My Heart" was not on the commercial 12" and as far as I know only on this cd. "Hit The Freeway" and "He Wasn't Man Enough" are also never released on cd before this cd. "How Many Ways" is the great R. Kelly remix that was only on cassette single when it was first out.   Here are the times for the remixes on disc 2:   1- UnBreak My Heart (Frankie Knuckles Franktidrama Club Mix) 8:40   2- You're Makin' Me High (Salaam Remi's Mix) 4:19   3- How Many Ways (R. Kelly's Mix) 5:46   4- I Don't Want To ( Frankie Knuckles Franktified Club Mix) 10:59   5- Hit The Freeway (Goldtrix Club Mix) 7:17   6- He Wasn't Man Enough (Forces Of Nature Mix) 5:50---a UK garage (2-step ) remix.    You can't go wrong with the singles and remixes of the great Toni Braxton.
