 This is the Australian cd single for the second single for George Michael's new album. "Flawless (Go To The City)"  is a thing of beauty. The original track was done a few years ago by The Ones and in the US it was put on Strictly Rhythm and available on the compilation The Cuts Vol. 2 . The cd single features 4 mixes and each one are beautiful. The original version comes in at near 7 minutes (6:51) and tells the story of a small town boy needing to go to the city and be himself or coming out and doing what he can't at home. It is a great lyric and music put together. The Shapeshifters Remix (7:06) is a vocal dub but the The Sharp Boys Hot Fridge Vocal Mix (8:03) matches the original version in style and feel. The Boxer Mix (5:56) is a little more electro in feel and is also a vocal dub. The song and music are complete genuis. Another number one club track for George Micahel. Just a stunning piece of work and Pride. A++++++++
