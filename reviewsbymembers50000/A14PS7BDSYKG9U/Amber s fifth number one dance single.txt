 Following the former number ones "Sexual","Above The Clouds","Love One Another" and her last single "Yes" comes Amber's fifth number one club track "The Need to Be Naked".This cd features 3 full mixes with 2 radio mixes for an excellent cd single. Track one is the original radio edit(3:50) and sounds like the bassline from "Relax" from Frankie Goes To Hollywood was used here. The Thunderpuss mixes are next. Track 2 and 3 are the Thunderpuss Radio edit(4:00) and Stripped Mix(8:47) and are quite good and very  much like a Thunderpuss Mix should be. For me the Thunderpuss Tribapella mix(6:04) is my favorite because it is more percussive and more of the background vocals are pushed upwards to a greater effect then the Stripped Mix has. Track 5 is the Guido Osorio's Virgin Mix(9:11)and is the BIG room mix of the cd. Very much to me bigger and loopier keyboard effects and overall production add to a really great mix and year for Mr.Osorio who in 2002 has finally come into his own as a remixer.
