 This song is like the "Dive In The Pool" series of like minded songs that have come around in the last few years. The basic idea of the song is a call and respond vocals by legandary club diva Jeanie Tracy who last performed with Rosabel on the number one track "The Power". The song's music is latin with horn samples from Gloria Estefan's "Oye" but no label credit is given but it is "Oye". Also there is a sample from Debbie Harry from Hairspray where she goes "1-2-Cha Cha Cha" --listen you will hear it too. The first 3 tracks are basically the same mix with the Big Room Mix a bit harder in sound. The Tony Moran /Warren Rigg mix is a little more smoother in sound but still latin and with less samples. A nice set of remixes but not as great as "The Sound","Don't You Want My Love" or "The Power".
