 This cd is from germany and features the album mix of "Alive Again" as well as the album mix of "When You Walk Away" that was to be a US only bonus track from "Living Proof". Oh well the selling point for me was the Warren Clarke (9:12) mix only found on this cd . This mix is much harder in its house sound than the uk's Almighty mix(which suits Cher better).This mix is what is on the american dance charts now(peaking at #19)and is so far only on this cd single and nowhere else. It's Cher so either you like her or you don't so buy it or not but it is really goood!!
