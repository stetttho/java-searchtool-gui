 From the fact that this should be a cd full of club tracks and that it isn't is kinda weird. The title track by remixers Wide Life is pretty good but should have come in a fuller version. The remixes stated here are all single radio remixes for Kylie,Sting,Duran Duran and the mix up mix for Fischerspooner vs. Billy Squier that is quite good. This also serves as an intro to newer Capitol/EMI acts like the incredible Jamelia from the UK,Ok Go(great song) and long time artist Liz Phair who offers the better single "Extraordinary". Dance tracks from Ingrid,Basement Jaxx,Junior Senior and the classic Elton John "Are You Ready for Love" round out the cd. I wish the remixes would have been full length but I am giving it the 4 stars for Jamelia- she is incredible.
