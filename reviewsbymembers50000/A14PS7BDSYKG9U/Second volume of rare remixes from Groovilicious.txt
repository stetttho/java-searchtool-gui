 God Bless Groovilicious /Strictly Rhythm for this second volume of unmixed together remixes of vinyl only singles. Like volume one this has recent and a few just released tracks that are hard to find until now. I really like the format of this series of cds and wish other labels would do something similar too. Track 1)Aly-Us -Follow Me (Full Intention Club Mix) (6:46) This is the 2002 new remix of the 1994 underground classic .#8 on chart. Track 2)Aurora UK- Dreaming(Goldtrix Lullaby Mix) (7:30) If you like Tracey Thorn then this is your mix . Just lovely and the follow up to their cover of "Ordinary World". Track 3)Circuit Boy Featuring Alan T- Rewind(Extended Mix)(8:06) Just about the cattiest and funniest song I've heard in quite awhile. All about the 80's.Brillantly funny.Yoko Ono is 80! Track 4)Klea- Tic Toc(Club Mix)(6:38)Jomanda like vocals .Retro! Track 5)K.M.C. Featuring Dhany- I Feel So Fine (Vision Extended Mix)(6:38) Hit number 5 on dance charts and quite trancy in feel. Track 6)Kreo-Burn For You(U.F.O. Extended Mix)(5:02)Very Electro in sound and hit number 12. Track 7)Lil Mo Ying Yang-Reach( Lee/Cabrera Remix) 2002 UK remix of the late 1995 number one classic. This recently topped the UK dance charts. Track 8)Oris J Presents Delsena- Triipin'(Agent Sumo's Body & Seoul Mix) (6:08) Sounds like an R&B vocalist trying to do house music. Weird mix and song. Track 9)Psycho Radio-In The Underground(Original Mix)(6:22) This recently went to number 9 on the dance charts. Track 10)Sono-Blame(Gomi's Revenge Mix)(8:51) Different remix than the one on volume 1 of this collection . More aggressive and filtered than the original extended mix.#1 on the dance charts. Track 11)The Ones- Flawlwss(A Touch Of Class Reremix of Phunk Ivestigation Mix)(6:40)Computer vocals and wah wah guitars make up for a genius remix and song.
