 I had ordered this cd because I was looking for the remix of "Butterfly" and a Vocal mix of "Spinning Around" which is on here. First off I actually bought "Light Years " for my brother earlier this year(from amazon.co.uk) and listen to it before I gave it to him. This cd is more disco in feel than her new "Fever" cd. You get the hits "Spinning Around","On A Night Like This","Plaese Stay" and "Your Disco Needs You" plus even better non hits like "So Now Goodbye","Under The Influence Of Love","Light Years","I'm So High" and the beautiful (and rare)ballad "Bittersweet Goodbye. "Kids" with Robbie Williams and "Butterfly" which was released on a small label in 2001 are here too. A great album of disco dancing fun by Kylie.     Disc 2 features remixes of tracks from the cd that are great too. "Spinning Around" comes in the vocal mix by 7th District and a dub by Sharp. "On A Night Like This" comes in two mixes :the Rob Searle dub mix and the Bini & Martini piano driven 6:35 mix. Missing is the superior Movtiv8 Mix but I have it. Then 3 mixes of "Please Stay"- A dub by Hatiras and a single and 12" mix by 7th District again. This is really good too. Then the 9 minute Sandstorm dub of "Butterfly".I just bought an American cd single of "Butterfly" from another on line place that features the vocal Sandstorm mix as well as mixes by Illicit and E-Smoove that are even better. And lastly you get the Casino radio mix of "Your Disco Needs You". A really good price for both the full cd and bonus remixes. The cd is from Holland.
