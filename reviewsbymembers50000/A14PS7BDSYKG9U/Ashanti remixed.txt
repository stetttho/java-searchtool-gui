 This is the UK cd single for the huge "Rock Wit U(Awww Baby)" track. The cd comes with 3 remixes plus the original radio version. The Taz & Vangard remix(4:24) and the J.D. Remix(3:54) are R&B/hip hop in the vibe. The Taz & Vanguard mix features a new rap by Taz while the J.D. mix features vocals by UK group member J.D. aka Dready from the So Solid Crew. Each are equally good. The highlight of the cd is the Jay Hannan Lazy Dog Mix(6:30) that is pure heaven. The house vibe with a deep heavy live bass is a great counterpoint to Ashanti's sweeter vocals. When the male voice states "Let's Rock" and the house music kicks out it is a thing of sheer beauty. It is a R&B /Soulful type house mix. A+++++ remixing.
