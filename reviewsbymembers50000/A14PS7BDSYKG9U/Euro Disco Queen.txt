 I had first become aware of Madleen Kane in 1981 when she performed on Solid Gold doing "You Can". I had never seen her before and thought she was beautiful(I was 11 at the time) and was curious about her and the song. I bought the 45 and in the mid 90's finally found a 12" vinyl of the song. The remix on the 12" and the 1981 Billboard Top Dance Hits cd was around 5:35 and the version on this collection of hits is 6:56  with a different beginning and end parts. I love the new version. I also read a couple of books about the disco era and most were praising her music as smart and different than most disco. I think she is in the same boat as Grace Jones and Linda Clifford in that they did great work but it never really crossed over to the POP charts.The best songs are the NRG mid 80's "I'm No Angel" and "Ecsatsy" written by Ian Anthony Stephans(who did High Energy for Evelyn Thomas) and Paul Parker - a great dancer singer himself. I thought the disco records of "Rough Diamond" and "CherChez Pas " were incredible. But "Playing For Time" and of course "You Can" still shimmer after 20 some years. These were produced by Giorgio Moroder and show the influence of his work with Blondie on "Call Me"- producing a more rock/dance vibe on these classics. You can see that Madleen looks like a Bond girl- she was a supermodel in the 70's/80's but the music is what I bought this cd for and it doesn't disappoint at all. Great disco and nrg music.
