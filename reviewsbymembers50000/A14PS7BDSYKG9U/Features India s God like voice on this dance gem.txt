 This cd single is the second single from Masters At Work's "Our Time Is Coming" collection. This song features the incredible talents of India on the vocals and along with classics like "To Be In Love","Love And Happiness","Runaway","Can't Get No Sleep" and "I Love The Nightlife" to name but a few of their magical collaborations this new one fits in with their best work. The song is typical MAW production of actual live instruments and disco/retro vibe that has been keeping me buying their remixes for years. Lyrically nodding their hat to the 1981 Debbie Harry classic of the same name -India is fed up with her man and tells him where to go. The cd comes with 3 mixes:Radio(3:38) and two full mixes by Joey Negro. These mixes match the original disco feel of the original and then some. The Club Mix(8:17) and Dubfired Mix(7:47) are just incredible to hear India in such a great form it is breathtaking to listen and dance to . This song got as far as 18 on the dance charts in Billboard probably because their was no Thunderpuss mix or underground mixes to sell out for but just a simple song with a great vocalist and retro mix to simply fill the dance floor.Buy it for the voice of India .
