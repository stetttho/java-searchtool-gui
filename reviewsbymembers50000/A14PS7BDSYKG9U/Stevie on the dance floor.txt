 This is the remixes of the rock/pop outing by Ms. Nicks that puts it up there with some of her best dance hits like "Stand Back" and "I Can't Wait". This cd comes with 3 sets of mixes that show that no matter where or what Stevie Nicks sings works. The 2 Tracy Young Mixes are trance style mixes and are just brilliant. The vocal club mix is 10:27 and the dub is 8:08. Trance trance trance. The Illicit mixes come in a Cher-like mix (7:49)that is good and two dub style mixes. The Vocal Dub Mix(7:32) is the best mix on this cd. Very aggressive yet with aliitle 80's flair thrown in for great effect. This mix kicks major... The Dub Instrumental mix is the same mix as the Vocal dub but no Stevie on it. Then you get a Extended album mix (6:35) for those who like the album mix. This was a number one club hit and hopefully the artist and record label will consider more remixes when thinking of releasing more singles in the future for releases.
