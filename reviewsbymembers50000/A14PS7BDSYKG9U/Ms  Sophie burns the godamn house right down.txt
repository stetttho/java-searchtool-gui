 This is the first US release (but 2nd in the UK ) for the lovely Sophie Ellis Bextor. I had bought the import in February of 2002 and fell in love with not only the song but her voice. So much so that I bought her Read My Lips cd in it's original and newly expanded versions. This should be coming out in the US soon so we can play catch up with this song. Written with New Radicals and producer guru Gregg Alexander the song is just magical. The cd comes in 4 versions and not a bad mix here at all!  Track 1 is the radio edit(3:37) and track 2 is the Extended Album Version(5:32) and in a word very Salsoul! DISCO!!!  It is then followed by track 3 the Jewels & Stone Remix(5:39). These guys did the remix to her first single "Take Me Home" and really make it even better. The Parky & Birchy Remix(7:24) is from the UK cd single and to me still the best mix of the song. Retro yet very contemorary in sound . Just came in the Billboard dance chart and hopefully will become the smash it deserves to be. Gorgeous!!!
