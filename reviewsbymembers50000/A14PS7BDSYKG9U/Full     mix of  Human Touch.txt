 I have been a somewhat fan of Rick Springfield since "Jessie's Girl" in 1981. I would play records during my catholic school art class on Fridays and would always be asked to play Rick Springfield a lot. I really wasn't that impressed with him as a child but as I listen to his music now at age 33 it seems more complex than I remember. The first 5 songs are what I would consider New Wave Classics even if he isn't. "Love Is Alright Tonite","Jessie's Girl" and "I've Done Everything For You" rank up as some of the best with Blondie, The Cars ,The Motels and Berlin as new wave /power pop classics. Excellent. I really did love his song "Human Touch" and it is here in it's 7:13 full 12" extended glory. I really loved this song and "Affair Of The Heart" which was more dance than what he did. The hits of "State Of The Heart","Souls","Bop Til You Drop","Love Somebody" and "Don't Walk Away" bring back fond memories. Rick Springfield was really better than most people remember him for and this cd shows that. Excellent 80's music.
