 This movie stars Treach from Naughty By Nature fame as a hit man that is the best there is. The movie tells of his father killing his mother then himself so he is no stranger to violence. This brings him into contact with a white mob type guy who brings him in and teaches him the ropes along with others like him- but he is the best there is. Then the boss hires him to kill his girlfriend  but is told if he hears from him by a certain time then to spare her. But when he does so anyway  all hell breaks loose in one of the funniest fights sequences I've  seen in a long time. There is also a love interest with a Goverment agent and what most people seem to be talking about--Treach's full frontal nude scene that highlight this movie. Violent but funny. The best part is the cooking cornbread while having to go out and do a hit while trying to contact the meat/pick up guys. Very funny.
