 This is the live concert given by Blondie for the BBC's The Old Grey Whistle Test in 1979. I am pretty sure this is the same program that has  also  produced several bootleg lps back in the day as well as have the live versions of "I Feel Love" that was on the "Union City Blue" maxi cd from 1995 and the live version of "Heroes" on the Blonde & Beyond cd from 1993. This dvd is only 40 minutes long and features the group with Frank Infante  and Nigel Harrison in the line up. The sound is great as well as the picture. The only gripe about the concert was that you really couldn't see Debbie's face until around "Union City Blue" - in that either it was hidden behind her hair or the lighting was a bit dark at times. And my second gripe is the end of "Sunday Girl" was cut off. If this was for tv then I am assuming it was the end of the show and the credits rolled at that time but it was great to see them perform the song because there is no video for the song--plus loved the guys playing bagpipes . The other scary part was seeing Clem Burke in the lame suit!!!! But watch him play drums and you will see that he is one of the best rock drummers ever. There are only 11 tracks on the dvd and a bit short but any chance to see vintage Blondie perform at all is worth the 5 stars and any amount of money. "Picture This","Shayla","Union City Blue" and "Pretty Baby" were great to see performed live. A+++++ just for the fact that Debbie Harry is on this dvd.
