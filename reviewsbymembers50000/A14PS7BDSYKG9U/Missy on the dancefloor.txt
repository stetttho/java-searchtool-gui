 These remixes took Missy Elliott to number one on the Billboard Club charts. These mixes are by Fatboy Slim and Mousse T. The Fatboy Slim mixes are the radio(3:31) and 12" mix(6:42) and are a little more house than Mr. Cook normally does. The Best mixes are the Mousse T's Pogo Extended mix(5:04) that is very guitar rock in vibe and the Royal Garden Extended(5:19) that is the reason it went number one . This mix is very very house yet very rap vibed as well. The remixes do not knock down the language and for a club mix that is rare. Check out the House mixes for "American Life"- censored. There is the Mousse T original Alternative mix(3:47) and original version(3:54) that are fun. This is the meanest fun song(for me) since Vanity 6's "If A Girl Answers Don't Hang Up" More mixes than the UK single.
