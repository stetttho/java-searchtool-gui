 This is the latest single from Kylie's HUGE cd Fever and this cd doesn't feature a happy disco mix among them. The remixes instead put Kylie in a more aggressive electro mode. The best mix is the Ashtrax Mix(5:02) and puts on a more aggessive bottom to the rhythm track. Much more electro vibe going here. This should be shortened and released to radio. The Robbie Rivera's Hard and Sexy Mix(6:59) is basically a dub mix. That is my only fault in that I've heard Robbie Rivera do vocal mixes and there is not one here. The mix is very tribal/bleepy type house in style. It is very well done and features parts of the vocals for indentification. This so far sits at number 20 on the Billboard dance charts.
