 This song has been floating around for sometime now on bootleg records and now comes the commercial release of "Rapture Riders" that is now on the US dance charts and has 2 videos done for it.    This is a mix of the classic moody Top 40 track by The Doors "Riders On The Storm" and the number one 1981 Rap classic "Rapture" by Blondie. It was featured on the Sound & Vision European issue last year and was brought over onto the US version as well. This cd single is from Holland/Germany and so far is the only commercial cd single issued for this track. It was put together by Mark Vidler and is pure genius. It is a mixture of the rhythm track from "Rapture" and mostly the vocals of Jim Morrison who sounds tremendous under a dance beat. It is set up like the rap/sung collaborations now--  song then rap then song then rap. It is pure genius.  1- Rapture Riders (Radio Mix) 3:50  2- Rapture Riders (Full Version) 5:41  3- Rapture (1981 single version) 4:57  4- Rapture (1981 Original 12" Disco Mix) 9:59    A+++ from just the idea to the actual song.
