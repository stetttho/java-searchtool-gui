 Betty Boo came out in the US with her only number one Club Play track "Doin' The Do" in 1990/91 and followed it up with "Hey Dj" and "Where Are You Baby" then released her second cd Grrr It's Betty Boo in 1993 with the hits "Thing Goin' On" and the absolutely beautiful "Catch Me". She never hit outside the club charts and was part of the late 80's early 90's hip house movement that fused rap with a house beat that isn't really done anymore. This cd is basically a new version of her first cd Boomania with remixes. All the songs mix rap with singing which at the time was not done. Think of Betty Boo as a 1 woman Spice Girls or what rap is now- part song part rap. The Remixes are the European only Norman Cook(Fatboy Slim) mix of "24 Hours"(5:35),"Where Are You Baby"(Peter Lorimer 12" mix-6:37) and "Doin' The Do" (12" mix- 5:38). The mixes for "Doin' The Do" and "Where Are You Baby" are different than the mixes released in the US on vinyl and maxi cd singles- so they are rare. The Megamix(7:16) is a mix of all the four hits she had off the Boomania cd. If you can find her second cd buy that as well. "Skin Tight" is still one of the fastest and best female raps I have ever heard. Excellent cd. I love Betty Boo!!!!
