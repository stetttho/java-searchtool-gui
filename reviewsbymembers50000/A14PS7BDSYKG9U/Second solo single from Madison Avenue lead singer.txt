 This is the follow up to the gorgeous single "I've Got Your Number" and this is Cheyne at a little more sensual song than her previous singles. The cd single comes with 3 full remixes and they are stunning. The best of the bunch is the Sweeter Than Bee Pollen Remix- this mix begins with strings and morphs into a Kraftwerk type electronic vocal style that goes into full electronica house with both the real and electronically altered vocals of Cheyne going through out the song. Just stunning stuff. Here is the track listing:  Taste You 1- Radio Edit 2- EMC Remix (8:10)- beautiful bass driven house mix 3- Sweeter Than Bee Pollen Remix (8:55)- stunning remix 4- Alley Cat Remix (5:18)- garage/two step mix   I've Got Your Number 5- Original Version    Buy for the Sweeter Than Bee Pollen Remix alone. A second great solo single from Cheyne Coates. A++++++
