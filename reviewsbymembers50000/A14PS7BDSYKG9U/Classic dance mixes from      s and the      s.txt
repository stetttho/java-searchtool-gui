 Holy crap- why can't the US release cds like these. This collection comes from the Canadian label Hi Bias and is a collection of 2 cds of classic dance mixes. There are longer mixes for the Nancy Martinez and Nu Shooz mixes but I really bought this cd for the mixes of Club Nouveau ,Levert and The Time and I will admit to liking the JJ Fad track when it was originally out. The songs are mostly from the Warner/Atlantic labels and maybe next time a cd like this is released try and get other labels involved- but that is just a thought. Here is a track listing for the cds:   Disc 1 1- Deee-Lite- Groove Is In The Heart (Meeting Of The Minds Mix) 5:10- number one for 3 weeks in 1990. 2- Tom Tom Club- Genius Of Love (Original Vocal Version)7:26- a huge Black and Dance single in 1981/82 where it was a number one club track.
