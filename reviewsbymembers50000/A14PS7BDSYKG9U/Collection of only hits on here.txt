 As the owner of probably every Blondie hits collection(and there are way too many over the last 20 some years)comes the collection of just hits. There are no b sides or remixes or any rare hidden vault stuff here. This cd features 7 number one hits:Heart Of Glass(US & UK),Sunday Girl(UK),Atomic(UK & US dance chart in 1995),Call Me (US & UK),The Tide Is High(US & UK) ,Rapture(US) and Maria (UK).You also get In The Flesh which hit number 2 in Australia in 1977 and from Blondie's first lp the classic hits X Offender and Rip Her To Shreds. From Plastic Letters you get Denis(#2 in the UK) and (I'm Always Touched By Your)Presence,Dear(#10 in the UK). From Parallel Lines  the evergreen of One Way Or Another(#24 in the US) and Picture This (#12 in the UK ) and Hanging On The Telephone(UK # 5).From Eat To The Beat you get Dreaming (#27 in the US and #2 in the UK)and Union City Blue (UK # 13)and The Hardest Part(US # 84) . Island Of Lost Souls from The Hunter (US # 37 for 2 weeks) and Maria (only # 82 in the US). This is a great beginner lession on all the music that this band helped create and for those that think No Doubt and Madonna are an original idea-- take a listen and hear Deborah Harry and the guys  and see where it all began. Deborah Harry is God!!
