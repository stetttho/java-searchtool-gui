 This is the German cd single that I'm sure most people are buying because it features the 9:17 mix by Thunderpuss of "No More Drama" which is all DRAMA in its remix form. It starts out fast then the hip hop of the original kicks in with Mary J. testifing to her fans of her new found sobriety and then the music picks up one more time and all gospel hell breaks loose. One of her best songs ever as well as one of Thunderpuss' best remix efforts ever! Just gorgeous.
