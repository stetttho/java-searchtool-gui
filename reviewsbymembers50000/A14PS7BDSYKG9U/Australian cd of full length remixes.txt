 This cd features the full remixes of the #1 dance track by Angie Stone. The song is built around a sample of The O'Jays "Backstabbers" and has a very retro feel to the song. The cd comes with the Club and Vibe mixes by Hex Hector and Mac Quayle. The club mix(9:54) is very much in tune with Mr. Hector's mixes for Deborah Cox,Tamia and Toni Braxton. DRAMA! It has a trance house feel to the song and works the feelings of being lost/then empowerment of the lyrics to great effect.The Vibe mix (7:55) is disco disco disco. Strings and live guitars and percussion filter this mix to excellent effect. The best use of the sample from "Backstabbers". Best mix on the cd. Then you get the Pound Boys "Bootleg" mix (7:51) that is very good and somewhat similar to the Vibe mix in retro feel. Plus the track "Brotha" is included in it's Spen & Karizma (7:40) mix. More harder and stripped down in sound than the other mixes(like their Basement Boys work) to showcase the song about black empowerment. A great cd from Australia.
