 This is the first number one dance track for the Canadian duo Esthero and the song that took them there is "O.G. Bitch"-- the song is a profanity laden fun filled track about telling someone's nemesis that they are not the best but a knock off of the original-- the one and only Original Bitch. This song in it's original version sounds very jazz influenced and vocally comes across as Nelly Fertado like . The mixes range from electro dance to mainstream house to aggressive underground. All mixes feature the full vocals. Excellent.   1- Original Version (4:26)  2- Smitty's Deep Guitar Remix (5:44)  3- Smitty & Gabriel D. Vine's Garage Party Mix (7:04)- deep bass lines on this mix.  4- Moody Ass Bitch Mix (6:06)  5- Speakeasy Mix (6:25)- my favorite mix. Has a spoken vocal part not on the other mixes.  6- The Orange Factory Mix (7:23)  7- Bill Hamel Club Mix (6:53)-- electro rock type mix that would make Blondie / The Cure proud.  8- I Love You ( Non Album Track) (5:56)--very jazz influenced .    A mean and funny song right up there with Pusaka's "You's The Worst Thing For Me".A++++++.
