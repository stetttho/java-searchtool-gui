 I know that this group has had 2 collections out---the Once And Twice Upon A Singles Collections ----but to me the real find on this cd are the disc of remixes. The first disc is a great starter for those who don't know who Siouxsie is or really sounds like so you get some of the early punks hits like "Hong Kong Garden","Isreal", "Arabian Knights" and "Happy House" . Then the early to mid 80's classics like the beautiful "Dear Prudence",the kick ... "Cities In Dust" and "Peek A Boo" to more 90's fare of their only top 40 single "Kiss Them For Me" ,"Stargazer" and "Face To Face" from the Michelle Pfiffer fronted Batman Returns.  For me it is the remixes that make this cd really special. I really have only a few of these remixes on cd so to have them all is excellent. The only downfall is that "Fear (Of The Unknown)" is not here but I have a promo cd single with more longer mixes than the commercial cd. Remixes: 1) Spellbound (Extended 12" Mix) 4:42 2) Song From The Edge Of The World (Columbus Mix) 7:37 3) Kiss Them For Me (Kathak #2 Mix) 9:46 - a longer mix than what was released on the commercial cd single in 1991. 4) Peek-A-Boo (Silver Dollar Mix) 8:13 Excellent remix!!! 5) The Killing Jar(Lepidopteristic Mix) 8:07 6) Cities In Dust(Eruption Mix) 6:49 Tremendous mix ! 7) Dazzle (Glamour Mix) 7:06    Great drum work 8) Stargazer (Mambo Sun remix) 7:20  Techno/trancy suits Siouxsie's vocals like "Sex Drive" did for Grace Jones. 9) Face To Face (Catatonic Mix) 4:53 A dub mix  that should have featured the entire vocals. Only gripe about cd.    So along with Deborah Harry,Kate Bush and Chrissie Hynde - Siouxsie and her Banshees  continue to be one of alternative music's most important female voices still.
