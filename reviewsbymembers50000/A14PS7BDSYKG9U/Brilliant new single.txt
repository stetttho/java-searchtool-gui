 This is the newest release from the long time GREAT dance act Pet Shop Boys. This is one of their best singles yet. It comes with 3 12" mixes and a demo of the sly "Flamboyant" single. The mixes range from electro to retro to aggressive techno house. All excellent mixes. The mixes are:  1- Tomcraft Extended Mix (6:26)- electro  2- Sister Sisters Silholuettes And Shadows Mix( 6:13)- retro house with a guitar vibe and the cowbells from Lipps Inc. "Funkytown" thrown in. They are on a roll  with the remixes they have done after doing "Good Boys" for Blondie.  3- Dj Hell Remix (6:34)- techno house vocal dub  4- Demo (4:25) beautiful  Plus you get the video. A+++++ set of remixes. Not one bad one here. Excellent!!!!!!!!!
