 This is the first solo single from the lead singer of the Australian dance act Madison Avenue and it picks up where her "Don't Call Me Baby" and "Who The Hell Are You" left off. First off Cheyne (she has dumped her last name Coates) still has the quirky Crystal Waters type vocals that are good or bad however you take it. For me she is a great talent. This single is similar to her two number one singles with Madison Avenue in that the subject of the song is a woman putting a ladies man in his place. Funny lyrics and the quirky vocals work very well. The remixes are the highlight of this cd single with the Rogue Traders mix being just one of the most incredible for 2004. Buy it for this mix alone. The rest are bass heavy house mixes that are great. Here is the track listing:  I've Got Your Number 1- Original Mix  2- Rogue Traders Remix (7:10)- the guitars and electro vocals make this remix rock hard. 3- 16th Element Remix (7:36)- mostly a vocal dub mix . 4- EMC Remix (6:02)- the most Madison Avenue sounding remix here. Very heavy bass driven house mix.    Excellent start to Cheyne Coates solo career.
