 This is the first US release from her new cd "Freak Of Nature" and like "I'm Outta Love" was huge on the club charts and did not even dent the Hot 100 at all. "One Day In Your Life" comes in two remixes that are both quite good. The first mix is the M*A*S*H Classic Mix (7:41) and is American house in its feel. The mix is slower in beats than the Almighty mix and is very well concieved. But for me the best mix is the Almighty Mix(7:44) and is one of their best. To me it is a harder and more agressive sound than what they normally mix. The keyboards swirl more harder and there is a great almost acappella part near the middle to showcase her voice to nice effect. Just a wonderful song and to put remixes that actually work with it is a plus .
