 This was the second cd release on the 32 Jazz label for Deborah Harry and The Jazz Passengers and was recorded at a Jazz festival in Spain hence the title Live In Spain. This was released around the time of the death of Debbie's mother and was dedicated to her. The music follows the weird fusion of classic jazz,bohemian type free flow ideas and the pop style of Debbie all put together in a great package. The best tracks and trust me they are all incredible songs are the "Bullmoose Boulevard" which is like a marching band type song about sailors,"Fat House" and "Samba Uber Alles". The ballads are where Debbie shines the most on like "Wednesday Afternoon","When The Fog Lifts" and the live versions of "Dog In Sand" and "Maybe I'm Lost". Just a great cd of funny and serious jazz tunes from Debbie and her second great band The Jazz Passengers. A+++++++++
