 This is the Australian cd single for the huge number one track "Dilemna" and it features 2 mixes of different quality. The album mix(4:49) is still the best mix here but the G4Ce Full Vocal Mix(5:57) comes close. This mix is drum and bass and suit the song better than the Jason Nevins mix. This mix pumps up the energy and puts the chemistry between Nelly and Kelly Rowland to great effect. The Jason Nevins mix(4:30) took me a while to get used to.It is house but the start of the mix doesn't really suit Nelly's rap until the music slows down a bit. The cd also features an unreleased track "Put Your Hands Up" that is quite good too but has a lot of explicit lyrics.
