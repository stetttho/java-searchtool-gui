 I am in love with the Almighty remix team- they have done excellent work for Deborah Harry, Cher, Sheena Easton, Anastacia, Diana Ross,LeAnn Rimes,Elton John and so on and so forth. This is the remixes for the single "If I Thought You'd Ever Change Your Mind" that went to number 12 on the UK charts. The single comes with 2 mixes from Almighty: The 12" Vocal Mix (7:11) and the Dub Mix(7:10) that showcase the song and the vocals very well. I am sure most hard core dj's won't play it but it is a beautiful remix.So if you like the remix for "Believe" you will love this mix as well.
