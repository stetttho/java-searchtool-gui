 This is the 3rd attempt by the huge Japanese star Seiko to try and break into the US market- Columbia with Donnie Wahlberg and A&M with Robbie Nevil so this comes on the Flora/Hip O /Universal label. This track "Just For Tonight" comes with 5 mixes by the same remixer. The last 2 tracks work best :the Mark's Right Now Vocal(7:15) and Mark's Message Vocals (7:55) each bring a heavier bass line front and center and bring the vocals up in the mix a bit higher than than the track 1 mix does. They are Nrg in sound with a bit more trance thrown in for good measure. The reason for the 4 instead of 5 stars is the Mark's Rampant Vocal(7:52) and Radio mix(3:32) which are like those horrible Jonathan Peters mixes like "In These Shoes" for Bette Midler where the vocals are buried under pounds of heavy keyboard riffs that it sounds like the vocals are not there at all just some humming. Seiko 's vocals are to be the star of the mix not the overboard music. The Rampant Dub mix(7:15) was good because there were no vocals in the first place.The tracks 4 & 5 are worth the price. This hit number 15 on Billboard's club chart.
