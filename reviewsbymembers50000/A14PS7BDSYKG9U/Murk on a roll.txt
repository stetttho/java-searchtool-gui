 This is the 3rd single this year to hit the club charts for the guys. Following "Dark Beat" and Some Lovin' " comes the Gospel house that is "Rise Up" . This is the follow up to the number one hit of 2002 "You Got Me(Burning Up)" and finds them on Star 69 label instead of MCA. The Cd comes with 3 mixes that are very well done. The Peter Rauhofer Universal Club Mix(8:10) is the best mix here. Just tremendous !!! The Junior Vasquez Earth Anthem Mix(10:13) is TRIBAL. The final mix is the Murk Club Mix(9:10) that almost matches the intensity of the Peter Rauhofer mix. Great single that is very religious in vocals and lyrics.
