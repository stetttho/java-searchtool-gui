 I first watched this movie on cable several years ago with my brother and have waited for it to be on DVD. Like the other reviews - this is an old kung fu movie dubbed not like most kung fu movies- where all is supposed to be serious but this time in the Troma tradition for the fun of it. If you watch it you too will chant "Tuna Melt Tuna Melt" or "Unganda no Ugaanda" . The perverted little brother, the lead actress' foul mouthed mother, Elvis, fish face woman, the farts when wrestling and of course the burping woman who hums. This movie is one of the few where I fell off the couch laughing so hard. This is the funniest movie I have ever seen. Too good.
