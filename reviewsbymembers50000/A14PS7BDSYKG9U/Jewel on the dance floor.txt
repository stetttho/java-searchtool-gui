 This cd single of Jewel's latest single "Serve The Ego" finds Atlantic records following their joining of non dance acts and remixers to once again excellent results. Like Bette Midler,Tori Amos ,Duncan Shiek and Linda Eder Atlantic records dance GURU Johnny DeMario takes a track and puts some of the best remixers on the job. The first remixes are by Hani  for track 1 the Hani Num Club Mix (9:12) and track 5 the Hani Num Dub Mix(8:50). The Club Mix features Jewel as an electro queen with computerized vocals and it takes about 4 1/2 minutes to start singing. Track 2 the Mike Rizzo Club Mix(8:17) and track 7  the Mike Rizzo Dub Mix(6:33) are flat out house mixes and with the kicking percussion and keyboards --it makes for the mainstream clubs a welcome  inclusion to the dancefloors. Track 3 the Wayne Rodriguez  Club Mix(8:20) and track 6 the Wayne Rodriguez Dub Mix (6:55) are more hard house and aggressive in style. The mixes suit the coldness of the vocals quite well. But for me the best mixes on this single are the Gabriel & Dresden Club(9:05) and Flashback(9:25) mixes. These mixes begin with retro keyboards and is very guitar and bass driven . Not unlike Madonna's "Ray Of Light" in the energy level. The lyrics of the song are about female power and each vocal mix puts Jewels vocals upfront and center. Very well for a folk artist doing the club remixes route.
