 This is one of my favorite dance songs from the last few years. The song first off is very well written and not too over the top vocally . This is Lara's first and I guess so far only US single to be released here. The cd comes with 3 mixes that are quite lovely too. The first remix is by David Morales and to me there are no other mixes on this cd that even come close to the brillance and beauty of it. One of his best mixes (right up with his mix of Sheena Easton's "101")that is truly disco personified . The strings,live piano and just retro sound should and probably would have been huge in 1978/79 at the height of disco. Then you get the remix by Hex Hector which I am sure is what most dj's played and took to number one on the dance charts. Just lovely. Then you get the Thunderpuss mix which is one of their more subtle mixes ever. This mix is my second favorite on the cd. Classic dance song and remixes.
