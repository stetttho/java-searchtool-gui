 The main reason I bought this cd was the fact you get part 1 & 2 of the uk single of the same for the price of 1 cd. For those who want the "blue monday" mix of "Can't Get you Out Of My Head" it is here. You get the Ruff & Jam and Twin Masterplan full 12" mixes of "Love At First Sight" as well as a edit of the scumfrog mix too. Plus the non lp track "Baby" that is too good not to be on the full cd. So buy the Australian cd single and enjoy the savings. The songs are [cool] as usual too.
