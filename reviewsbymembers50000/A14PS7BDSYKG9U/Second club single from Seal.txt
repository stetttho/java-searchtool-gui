 This is the second single released from Seal's latest cd and it like his first single "Get It Together" --- remixed to great effect. The Burnin'Thick Dick Vocal Remix(7:45) is mixed by E Smoove and features a more guitar  driven house mix that is the best mix on the cd. The Passengerz remix(7:11) and the BHQ Vocal Mix(7:24)and the 29 Palms Remix(8:18) are really well done house mixes. The Machine Head Remix(5:29) is a great non house mix similar to  "Crazy" and the Wide Horizon mix of "Get It Together" in that it is really what Seal is- a little altenative /r&b and dance all mixed together. Excellent dance mix. This song is used already in commercials and is on the Hot 100 and already climbing the club charts .
