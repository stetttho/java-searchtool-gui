 This is the second number one on the Billboard Club Play chart for Tom Stephan aka Superchumbo. This time around he uses the vocals of William Brett and out comes the tribal house effort "This Beat Is" . Now when I first heard the vocals I thought he was saying "There's Bees All Over My Body" which is not correct but at times it could be true -but really the hook is "This Beat Is All Over My Body". The cd comes with 6 mixes-4 are full 12" mixes. The first 4 tracks are by Tom Stephan himself and they are the This Body Mix(9:38),Acappella(2:33),This Beat Mix(9:28)which is a little more stripped down and the Acid-pella (2:33). This is an excellent example of tribal house at the top of its form. Beautiful mixes. The Victor Calderone Tribal Mix(10:35) is good but a bit drawn out while the Peace Division Deeper Mix(7:54) is the best mix on the cd. Trippy keyboard effects and a deeper bass make it groove a bit harder than the original. Excellent dance track. A++++
