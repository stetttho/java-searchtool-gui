 I bought the cassette in 1981 and have looked for the cd for a long time now so I finally found this and there is truly 1 reason for this cd to even to be released- the 11:37 minute disco mix of "The Main Event". This was a huge step for Barbra in that she finally went and followed most of the acts in 1979 and did disco. This song went as far as #13 on the disco charts and even crossed over to the black charts. The rest of the cd is blah - in that I only play the disco version and that is all.
