 This is the first track from Sophie's newest cd. This song was atop ten hit in the UK and it is more electro in the feel of the track. The cd comes with the incredible Groove Collision Remix(6:38) that juices up the electro vibe of the song. The song is one of trying to get through the hardships of the world in one piece and this mix brings that out clearly. The breadown is straight out of a early 80's hit "I'm In Love" by Eveyln "Champagne " King- too good.You also get the bonus track "The Earth Shook The Devil's Hand" that is excellent as well. Brilliant.
