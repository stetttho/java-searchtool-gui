 This is the second single from Armand Van Helden's New York: A Mix Odyssey mix cd. This time it is the sample of Gary Wright's "Comin' Apart" that drives the single. This cd single as 2 radio mixes plus 4 full length dance mixes that range from electro to break beat/freestyle to flat out aggressive house. Each mix takes the song a bit higher in the energy of the mixes here. Here is the track listing:  1- Original Radio edit (3:08) 2- Deekline & Wizard Break Radio mix(3:42) 3- Original 12" mix (6:21) 4- Deekline & Wizard Break mix (8:11)-- my favorite mix. This is the break beat/freestyle mix. I love near the end of the mix the remixers put in a little message to the listener to thank them for listening to this mix. Beautiful. 5- Cagedbaby Pace mix (7:14)- aggressive bass driven house. 6- We Deliver 001 mix (6:40)- best house mix.    An excellent second single for Armand.
