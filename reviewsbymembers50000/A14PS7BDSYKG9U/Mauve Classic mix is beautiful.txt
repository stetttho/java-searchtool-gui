 The reason for the five star rating is the absolutely beautiful Mauve Classic Club mix for Kelly Clarkson's "The Trouble With Love". It is like a lost David Morales or Masters at Work mix with a lovely guitar solo in the middle. I am not sure if the vocals have been done over for this mix but they seem more gospel--aka black- than the original. This mix (8:27) is the main reason to buy. Kelly shines on it. The second remix is the Bimbo Jones Dub Mix(6:38)and is okay but nothing special. Stick with the Mauve mix. Hopefully RCA will release "Anytime" and mix it like "Unbreak My Heart " was mixed so well for Toni Braxton. Kelly Clarkson is incredible.
