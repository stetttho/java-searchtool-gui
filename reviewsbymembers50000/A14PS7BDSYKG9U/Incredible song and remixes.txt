 This is the 6th release from Dance Diva Reina and this is one of 2004's best dance tracks so far. The song was produced by Jack D. Elliot who has done remix work for Britney, Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync and written with Janice Robinson and Tina deVaron. This cd single on Robbins is even better than her last single "No One's Gonna Change You" and that is quite a lot to say. There are basically 3 main dance mixes on this cd and they range from big (and I do mean BIG) house ,radio friendly and a "I Feel Love" inspired club mix. The song is one of hope and love and the vocals -depending on the mix- are very emotion filled.  1- Jack D. Elliot Radio Mix (3:38)  2- Tony Moran & Warren Rigg Radio Anthem (4:28)  3- Guiseppe D Groovin' Radio Mix (4:00)  4- Tony Moran & Warren Rigg Club Anthem (9:49) - big house mix  5- Jack D. Elliot Club Mix (6:00)- radio friendly house mix  6- Guiseppe d Groovin' Mix (7:54)- techno house driven Donna Summer inspired mix. Best Mix.  7- Tony Moran & Warren Rigg Instrumental Anthem (9:42)  8- Guiseppe D Groovin' Mix Instrumental (7:52)  Gorgeous mixes and song and vocals. A++++
