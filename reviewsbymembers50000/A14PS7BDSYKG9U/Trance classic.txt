 I was curious about this single for the longest time because of the fact that it on the dance chart for 18 weeks and only got to number 41(for 2 weeks). That is longer than some tracks that go number one for several weeks. This is it's chart progression:47,45,46,46,49,48,48,47,47,42,46,46,41,42,44,41,42 and finally 49 . Also this song went number one on the Dance Airplay Chart on Billboard as well. So this song is from the master mind remix duo of Gabriel & Dresden and was a number 11 hit in the UK singles chart as well. There is a import cd with 2 more mixes but the mixes here are the best anyway. The Radio mix(3:34) and the Sweeping Strings Mix(10:42) are the best for clubs. I assume that most hip djs wouldn't play this track because it is a pure trance song and there is no house mix included is not right. This will be a classic to play for years to come unlike some hip flavor of the moments mixes out now. The Armin Van Buuren Remix(9:54) has even less of a bassline and is the choice for European leaning djs or dance music fans. I have never seen a dance record stay so long on the club charts for so long without hitting bigger- a classic.
