 This is the cd single for the US release of "Enjoy The Silence 04" and if you didn't tell me that a couple of the mixes are new I would swear that they would be the same as the original mixes. The Ewan Pearson and Richard X mixes are the ones I am talking about. The new mixes are not as aggressive as the newer mixes done for classic songs by Yaz, Information Society and other artists of the like. These mixes range from a slight house mix (Timo Maas) to electro driven ones (Ewan Pearson & Richard X) to a more aggressive rock slant by Mike Shinoda . Also included are the new house mixes for "World In My Eyes" and " Something To Do". Both are also very well done. Here is the track listing:    Enjoy The Silence: 1- Mike Shinoda Reinterpretation Mix (3:32) 2- Timo Maas Extended Mix (8:42) 3- Ewan Pearson Extended Remix (8:39) 4- Richard X Extended Mix (8:22)   World In My Eyes: 5- Cicada Mix (6:18)   Something To Do: 6- Black Strobe Remix (7:11)-- which is a dub mix.    Overall a great set of new mixes of a classic band and song. A++++ for me.
