 ... the fact that this isn't all house remixes but this is still a good remix collection. While not up to the remix collections cds of Chaka Khan, Blondie or Jellybean but not as worthless as the Deboarh Cox or Amber ones this is a review of some older tracks done over by remixers other than Daft Dunk themselves. The selling point for me was the inclusion of the house mix for "Face To Face" that was number one on the club chart on Billboard. Plus the fact that this isn't a mixed cd is a major plus for  me. Here is the track listing and times for each song.  1- Ouverture (2:41)  2- Aerodynamic (Daft Punk Remix) (6:10)  3- Harder Better Faster Stronger (Neptunes Mix) (5:11)  4- Face To Face (Cosmo Vitelli Remix) (4:54)  5- Phoenix (Basment Jaxx Mix) (7:52)  6- Digital Love (Boris Dlugosh Remix) (7:27)  7- Harder Better Faster Stronger (Jess & Crabbe Remix) (6:00)  8- Face To Face (Demon Remix) (Demon Remix) (6:59)- house!!!  9- Cresendolls (Laidback Luke Remix)(5:22) 10- Aerodynamic (Slum Village Mix) (3:36) 11- Too Long (Gonzales Version) (3:14) 12- Aerodynamic (7:47) 13- One More Time(Romananthony's Unpluuged) (3:39)- sounds like a lost Prince outtake. 14- Something About Us ( Love Theme From Interstella 5555) (2:14)   Not a bad set of electro/house and acoustic mixes from the French dance act.
