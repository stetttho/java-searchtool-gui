 This cd single features the 12" Formal and The Casual Instrumental  mixes for "Dress You Up". The 12" Formal mix (6:15) begins like New Order's "Blue Monday" and is mixed by John "Jellybean " Benitez,who mixed most of Madonna's early dance songs. This mix really makes a great difference in the feel and sound of the song. The Casual Mix (4:36) is an instrumental  version of the 12" mix. Good for a mid 80's remix. To me though the best song is "Shoo-Bee-Doo" which is the lp version from "Like A Virgin". It had been awhile since I had heard the song and really thought it was one of her best early songs.
