 This is the second massive solo single from the Dangerously In Love cd. The cd comes in 3 versions- the massive album version that features Sean Paul and 2 house mixes. The Maurice Joshua Nu Soul Mix(6:14) is one of his better mixes. This time he keeps a lot of the middle eastern flavor of the original and matches it with a scorching bass line that moves the song and the vocals along. The Junior Vasquez Club Anthem Remix(8:50) is equal parts nrg/house and soulful house with bits of Sean Paul mixed together. The vocals are a bit mixed down but when the chorus hits it is all forgiven because it works extremely well by then. The Maurice Joshua mix is the best mix on the cd. Number one club single.
