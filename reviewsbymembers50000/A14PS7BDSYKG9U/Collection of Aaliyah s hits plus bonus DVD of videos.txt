 This is the first collection of hits from the late singer and they represent her groundbraking work with Timbaland and Missy Elliott as well as R. Kelly. The cd features her hits like "Back And Forth","At Your Best(You Are Love)","One In A Million","Are You That Somebody","Try Again"-her only number 1 pop hit, "More Than A Woman " and "I Care 4 U". The cd features "New" tracks that are quite good. The new hit "Miss You" is included as well as future hits "Come Over" with Tank and "Don't Worry". But the real find is the DVD included with this collection. It features the videos of "One In A Million","Are You That Somebody","Try Again","We Need A Resolution","More Than A Woman","Back In One Piece" with DMX,"Four Page Letter","Got To Give It Up" and "Rock Tha Boat". Plus there is the commercial for the Aaliyah cd and a 22 minute interview/behind the scenes look at the singer. The picture quality of the DVD is not the best it could be it is nice to own a collection of videos along with the hits of Aaliyah. It is sad to never see the potential she would have been if she was never killed. Enjoy the music and videos of the coolest R&B singer.
