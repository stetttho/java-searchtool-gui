 The cover and inside pictures of Madonna show the onetime Material Girl as the 70's rich girl/SLA brainwashed victim and bank robber. That is my only guess as to why she is pictured with so many guns.     Now onto the music. This cd keeps on with what she was doing with Music. In that she tries to balance the line between dance/ personal statements and commerical music of now. The only drawback is that she begins most songs with the same beginnings it isn't until she sings that each song takes on its own life. The title track is her look on her celebrity and what makes Madonna  well Madonna. This version includes a four letter word that wasn't necessary to include . The best tracks are "Hollywood","Mother & Father","Easy Ride","Love Profusion","Nobody Knows Me" and the personal "Nothing Fails". This is a personal collection of songs  from Madonna. The only other weird point is the rap. She has taken a lot from Debbie Harry but not Debbie's rapping skills.
