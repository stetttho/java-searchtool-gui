 I bought this cd collection solely for the fact it had the incredible "Heaven" by the much missed dance act The Chimes and the great vocals of Pauline Henry. As a dance music freak I have most of these mixes in the first place but a lot of the mixes I never owned on cd before so like the other reviewers sure you can find fault with the collection of songs but read the liner notes because they state that they did it on purpose to get people interested in the series. So here is what is on the cds and where they went on the US dance charts.    Disc 1: POP 1- Dead Or Alive- You Spin Me Around (Like A Record) (Murder Mix-8:00). This classic dance track only reached number 4 on the US dance charts in 1985 but still keeps coming back all the time because it is still a killer song. Stock Aitken Waterman's better produced tracks. 2-  S-Express- Theme From S-Express (12" Mix- 5:57)-- this mix has a different beginning than the one that on most compilations and cd single for the track. This was number one for 2 weeks in 1988 and was part of the acid house movement and sample and paste mixes of the late 80's. Still fun to hear all the samples -- especially the "Feel The Spin" one from Debbie Harry. 3- Wham- Everything She Wants (Remix-6:27) This reached number 7 in 1985 and is a darker track than what Wham was known for. 4- Terence Trent D'arby- If You Let Me Stay (Michael Brauer Extended Remix- 6:01)-- this was the first single from his first cd- The Hardline According To and was neither a huge pop or dance track. It only reached number 47 and was on the dance charts for one week but still a very soulful dance remix holds up better than most of the cds more "trendy" or house mixes. 5- The Chimes- Heaven (Physical Mix by David Morales- 8:24)--  huge number one dance track here in 1990 but was a major pop in in the UK in 1989. Pauline Henry shines through out the track.  6- Daryl Hall & John Oates- I Can't Go For That (No Can Do) (Robert Wright Dance Mix-- 6:00)-- Original 12" that has been on  few other cds but is always nice to hear. This was basically a number one pop,black and dance hit and not hard to see why. 7- Shalamar- Friends (Album Mix- 5:00)-- a nice track from the lp of the same name and this track never hit the US dance charts. 8- Shakatak- Down On The Street (UK 12" Mix--4:45)-- this is a Uk Jazz type act with a lead vocal that sounds like Basia. It reached number 27 in 1984 on the dance charts. 9- Colonel Abrams- Trapped (Timmy Regisford 12" Mix-6:28) This was a major dance track in 1985 hitting number one and was the first single from his classic Colonel Abrams lp. 10- Curiosity Killed The Cat- Misfit (Scratch Mix- 7:02)- was not a major dance track with it only peaking at number 43 but like the Terence Trent D'arby track it holds up better than most tracks. Very funky and very British . 11- Level 42- Something About You (Shep Pettibone Remix- 7:58)- also a number 4 dance track in 1986 and like the remix for "Shout" by Tears For Fears it takes the original mix and puts some hip hop scratches and edits through out the remix. Very well done. 12- Swing Out Sister- Breakout (N.A.D. Remix--6:59)- again this was a major pop it and reached number 12 on the dance charts in 1987 . The remix is very hip hop influenced with a nice balance with the original jazz flavored mix.    Disc 2: Club  1- Donna Summer- I Feel Love (Patrick Cowley Megamix- 15:51) This was never a major hit in 1982 in the US but the fact that the late Patrick Cowley took what I would consider the most important dance track ever and took it to an even higher level. It has now been on a lot of compilations but still the fact it is still in print should say how much people want this mix. A+++++ remix.  2- Inner City- Big Fun (Magic Juan Remix-7:39)-- a major number one in 1988 for the house dance act lead by Paris Grey. Still a fun track to dance to.  3- Farley "Jackmaster" Funk Featuring Daryl Pandy- Love Can't Turn Around" (Original Mix-- 5:37)-- Not sure if this is an edit because I looked it up and there a few mixes and they are all over 7 minutes long. The lead vocals are so over the top it is not funny but to hear Mr. Pandy go from the throaty gospel desperate vocals to the highest of high is amazing to hear. An early house track which only got to number 15 in 1986.  4- Freeez-IOU (Megamix by Jellybean and John Robie--8:40) A MASSIVE track in 1983 that is still sampled today. John Rocca is a tour de force vocally on this song. Number one for 2 weeks.  5- Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam with Full Force- I Wonder If I Take You Home (Extended Version-6:52)- Released before the full lp was this is a girl group classic dance track. Produced by Full Force this was a number one dance track on the club and sales charts. Massive r&b track as well.  6- Stock Aitken Waterman- Roadblock (Uk 12" Mix--6:57) Reached number 9 in 1987 and was nothing like the Kylie/Bananarama/Dead Or Alive tracks they were known for. This a rare groove dance track they got from Bananarama's "Mr. Sleeze" track. There are a few different mixes but this one has more female vocals on it.  7- Eric B. & Rakim- Paid In Full (Seven Minutes Of Madness: Coldcut Mix-- 7:06)- the foundation for MARRS "Pump Up The Volume" track. The duo actually dislikes this mix but was their biggest UK hit and reached number 3 on the dance charts in 1988. Was the backside to the bigger black radio hit "Paid In Full".  8- Bomb The Bass- Beat Dis (Extended Mix- 5:52)-- like S-Express this was also a number one dance track in the US and a sample happy /edits type remix.  9- Art Of Noise- Beat Box (Diversion 1 mix--8:05)-- their only number one dance track in 1984 and was also a huge black radio hit. A mix of classical type music and hip hop. Very arty still. 10- Was(Not Was)- Out Come The Freaks (12" Vocal Mix-- 7:11). A much more club CLUB track than what they are known for. From 1981 this reached number 16 on the US dance charts.    Disc 3: Soul & Funk  1- Cameo- Single Life (Extended Mix--6:33)- from the Good , Bad & The Ugly whistle to the quirky keyboards this is a funny and highly danceable track-- reached number 26 on the dance charts in 1985.  2- Indeep - Last Night A Dj Saved My Life (Vocal Mix--5:39) The MUCH covered song still is a great track. This was number 2 for 6 weeks in 1982/83 and is still funny to hear the toilet flushing on the song.  3- Rockwell- Somebody's Watching Me (Vocal 12" Mix-- 4:53)- with a Michael Jackson vocal to aid Rockwell's fake accent this is still a killer track. Reached number 3 in 1984 and still a childhood favorite.  4- The Temptations- Treat Her Like A Lady (Special Remix-6:08)-- a number 13 dance track from the Motown legends. A true 80's dance track. From 1985.  5- Booker Newberry III- Love Town (Long Version- 5:16)-- reached number 66 on the US dance charts. I do not know much about this song or artist but it is a r&b dance track.  6- Lionel Richie- All Night Long (All Night)  (Vocal Mix-- 6:17)-- a number 5 dance track and  a massive number one pop and black hit. A very rare up tempo song from the usually ballad driven artist.  7- Oliver Cheatham- Get Down Saturday Night (I think this is the Get Down In The 90's mix from 1989--7:08). I know this is not the original 12" mix from 1983 because it has a slight house feel too it. I own the original version and that runs 7:33 and is more string driven disco music. Still a great song. Never hit the US. A UK ONLY act.  8- Central Line- Walking Into Sunshine (Larry Levan 12" Mix--7:50)-- Another UK dance act but this song reached number 5 in 1981 and is a dance classic. Remixes by the legend Mr. Levan it is a more positive dance track. Deeper bass line plus a much samples hookline make for a classic track.  9- Ready For The World- Oh Sheila (Louil Silas Extended Mix- 6:49) A Major number one dance, black and pop hit from 1985. The fake British accent is still killer. One of my all time favorite songs from the 80s. 10- Quincy Jones with Dune- Ai No Corrida (Full Length Mix- 6:17) This is the lp mix and this was a version of the Chas Jankel track that would later be a hit for himself. This reached number 3 on the dance charts in 1981. From the major Grammy winning lp The Dude. 11- Stephanie Mills- The Medicine Song (Mark Berry Extended Mix- 6:31)-- her only number one dance track from 1984. KILLER bass line and vocals. 12- Bar-kays- Sex-O-Matic (Mark Berry Dance Mix-6:25)-- a number 15 dance track in 1984 and is a more New wave/The Time type dance track than what they are known for. A classic example of 80's remixing.    This is a fine collection of songs. Some are rare mixes and some are on every other cd collection but they are mixed together very nicely and to finally have "Heaven" on cd is worth the money and the collection.
