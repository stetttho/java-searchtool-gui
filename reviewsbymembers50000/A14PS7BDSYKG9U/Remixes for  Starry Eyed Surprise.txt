 This is the first mainstream US hit for legendary DJ Paul Oakenfold and this comes with vocals by Shifty Shellshock of Crazy Town. The reason I am giving it 4 stars is that the remixes do not contain any of the vocals of the original. The original mix is more laid back and the remixes take the song to a more trance and aggressive house mixes. The Josh Wink Re-Inerpretation Mix(8:43) is the trance mix of the 2. It is very well done and is probably what most club Dj's are playing. The Oliver Lieb Mix(7:52) contains some of the vocal and is my favorite mix.This has most of the vibe of the original mix.
