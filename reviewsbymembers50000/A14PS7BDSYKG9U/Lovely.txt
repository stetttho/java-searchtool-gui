 I was given this cd from a friend from my local library and took it home to listen to it. I am not that up on Christian music so this is new to me. I think about as much gospel music that I have is Amy Grant. But to me this cd is like if Dido met Natalie Merchant and went to Church. It is very new age/rock/dance in style and form. The best songs for me are "Prelude" ,"Be Still My Soul","Simply I Love You", "Run To You" and "True Story". I really liked her voice and was surprised at how much I enjoyed it.
