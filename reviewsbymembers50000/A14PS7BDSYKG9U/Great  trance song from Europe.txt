 This cd is the original 2001 release and doesn't have the Robbie Rivera mix(not sure where to find that mix)but not to fear it is still worth the money.The track from the mind of Armin Van Buuren and features lead vocals by Elles de Graaf that are quite distant in  feeling. The cd features 2 remixes of varying trance/house degrees.The first remix is the Above and Beyond Club mix(7:14) that is the more european trance mix of the two. Very well done and is also garnering some club play in the US but trance mixes don't command DJ's respect here as they do in Europe. Then the second mix is Armin Van Buuren's Tribal Feel Vocal mix(8:45) that is more agressive trance with some tribal sounds thrown in for great effect. Some critics find fault with the icy feel to the lead vocals  but it worked for me. Originally released in 1998 but picked up from Europe by Nervous in America in 2001 but finally topping Billboard's Club chart in 2002 it shows that this song is this good to survive and hit 4 years after it's original release.
