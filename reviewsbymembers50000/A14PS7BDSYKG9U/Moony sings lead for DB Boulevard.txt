 This cd features 4 -12" mixes and 2 radio mixes. First off this song features Moony (Monica Bragato) on lead vocals and like her other singles -- "He's All I Want" and "Dove" features THAT VOICE that is just incredible . The song is very positive in lyric and bright music wise. The original comes in a radio and extended mixes. The original 12" (5:40) is sunny and fluffy as a summer day. It is euro trance all the way. Very retro in feel and sound. The A.T. Mendoza Mix (6:01) is the best mix of the bunch. It makes it sound a bit harder in overall sound and puts Moony front and center of the mix. The next mix is the Lange Mix(6:27) and is more of a vocal dub mix(some vocals but not the entire song). This mix is more agressive trance in that a faster beats per minute scoot the song to a more energy moving feel. Very well done too but I wish the entire song would have been on it too. The last remix is the Quiver's Vocal Remix(7:44) and to me is American house all the way. This mix features a slower house beat than the other mixes and I am quite sure is what most US dj's played here. This song was released on Epic Records here as a promo so if you want more mixes than the UK release buy this Cd from Germany. Also a number one hit on the Billboard club charts.
