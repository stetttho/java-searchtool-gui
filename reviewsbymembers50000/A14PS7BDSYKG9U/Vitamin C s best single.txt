 This is the remix cd for "Last Nite" that is a remake of The Strokes track off their first cd that mixes Blondie's "Heart Of Glass" to great effect. The original version(3:54) is more musically Blondie than the other mixes. The This Is Radio ElectroClash-Williamsburg Edit(3:45) and the I Like That Mix by Count Caligula (5:40) don't feature most of the vocals but are electro in mixes. The final mix is the incredible Manhattan Clique mix(6:05) that is a thing of genius. This is a true work of putting the ice cold Debbie Harry type vocals with a NRG type of house mix. The lyrics,vocals,music and whole being of the song come together in this mix. This is her best track ever.A++++++
