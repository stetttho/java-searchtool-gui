 This is the US cd single for the latest track off of Jennifer's new cd. This is one of a few cd singles now being released by Sony in the US to help kick start the market back up. This single is "I'm Glad" and comes in 2 versions the original album mix(3:42) which is good and the stunning Paul Oakenfold Perfecto Remix(5:46) which hit number 4 for 2 weeks on the Billboard club play charts. This mix is featured on a more expensive import cd so for this price you can't go wrong. The track only got as far as 32 but is still one of her best.
