 I am not that big of a Sinead O'Connor fan but these remixes are very well done. The song was originally featured off her Lion & The Cobra cd and was a huge college radio hit. Now in 2002 come the remixes that went to number 3 for two weeks on the Billboard dance charts. The cd comes in 2 parts and this is disc 1. The disc features 7 mixes plus the video of "Troy". Track 1 and 4 are mixed by Push and come in the trance like mix similar to "Silence " by Delerium featuring Sarah McLachlan- in fact most of the trance/euro house mixes infuse Sinead's vocals down to an almost Sarah McLachlan type vocal performance. The Push mix(7:57), the Rob Searle Mix(8:38) and Pulsedriver Mix(7:21) are the examples. The Andi Durrant Remix(10:34) is very laid back and ambient like- almost like the original version. This mix features the full on vocal attack of the original. For the more adventureous clubs. The best mixes are the John Creamer & Stephane K Mix(12:57) and Kay Cee Laidback Mix(8:40). These mixes are just incredibly well done in that they put the intensity of the vocals and match it with the music as well. The John Creamer & Stephane K mix is tribal and very underground in sound and the vocals work extremely well in this mix. The best mix is the Kay Cee Laidback mix because half way there is an acappella break down and it is just Sinead's fiery voice you hear. These two mixes make her sound like a warrior going off to battle. Intense!
