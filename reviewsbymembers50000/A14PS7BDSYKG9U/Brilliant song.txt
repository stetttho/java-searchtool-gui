 This is the first track off Kelis' new cd and it finally breaks her wide open in the US market. The single "Milkshake" produced by The Neptunes tries to put R&B back into a dance groove that has been missing with all the sound a like rap and R. Kelly type ballads. Already a number one club record on Billboard's Club Play chart it is top 3 Pop and R&B . This cd single comes with 4 full length vocal mixes that range from house to sort of hip hop/house mixes.  The mixes are: 1- Milkshake (radio version) 3:05 2- X-Press 2 Triple Thick Vocal Mix(9:30) 3- DJ Zinc Remix(5:59)- a bit more techno. 4- FreQ Nasty's Hip Hall Mix(6:24) with rap by Spoonface-best mix 5- Tom Neville Remix(6:26)- best house mix  Just a brilliant song from top to bottom- a little inuendo never hurt no one. Too bad Arista didn't put out a US single.  CD from the UK.
