 I heard this song on music choice (which is a digital music channel) and fell in love with it because of both the song and her voice. The song in its original form is retro disco and the best mix on the cd. You get two full 12" mixes:one by John Creamer& Stephane K that is very much like their mix of Iio's "Rapture" and then a mix by Full Intention that more aggressive than what their normal disco/house mixes of past. I saw Moony on Top Of The Pops last month(the first for me since she really hasn't been on her covers of Angel Moon or Db Boulevard) and she looked beautiful and actually sang live too. A great song and hopefully more from ms. Bragato in the future.
