 This is the fourth single to be released by Ms. Bextor and it continues her growth as an artist. She has a rich smokey type voice that makes sound very smart and her songs do show off her excellent songwriting ability to great affect. This track hit #3 on the uk charts and features the single mix and the Max Reich vocal mix(7:50) of the title track. I bought cd 2 from amazon.co.uk the first week it was released and have played the remix non stop. The remix is more agressive house in sound than her previous retro/disco feel of her past 3 releases. You also get 3 postcards of the beautiful Sophie to keep or to send to someone(I'm keeping mine). Excellent song and remix from an artist who I hope will eventually be released in the US.Enjoy the voice.
