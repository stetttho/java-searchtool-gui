 These are the FULL length mixes for the theme from Queer Eye For The Straight Guy show from Bravo. This is Widelife with vocals by Simone Denny. This track recently hit number 5 on the Billboard club play chart and really should have been higher. The hooks , the retro vibe,the diva vocals and now great remixes make this song a classic. The basic idea of the song is a positive one and it comes through on all the mixes.  1- Original Version (2:45)  2- HQ2 Club Mix(7:32)  3- Jason Nevins Big Room Mix(9:30)  4- Jason Nevins Hands Up Mix(6:42)-both mixes are the best ones because they pump a harder dance groove and suit the song so well.  5- Barry Harris Interpration Mix(9:28)- a little more disco vibe than his Thunderpuss mixes.   Excellent cd single and remixes.
