 This is the reissue of the 1977 classic remix album . I originally recieved the vinyl record as a present from a freind and there was a similar cd like it before but this is the remastered version that features the remixes of disco legend remixer Tom Moulton. The booklet comes with liner notes from Mr. Moulton and he provides insight to his style of remixing in the 1970's . The songs are from the rich Philadelhia International label and he took older tracks from their catalog and remixed them to their DISCO glory. The most revered track is the first track "Love Is The Message" (11:30)by MFSB that has become a huge classic on the dance floors of time. The second track is the theme from the Soul Train show "T.S.O.P.(The Sound Of Philadelphia)"(5:45) and is quite an excellent show of what was dance music in the 70's . The best tracks are "Dirty Ol Man"(8:19) by The Three Degrees and "Don't Leave Me This Way"(11:03) and "Bad Luck"(8:00) by Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes. These songs feature the GOD like voice of Teddy Pendergrass and are just breathtaking in their beauty. The other tracks include longer mixes of "Love Train"(6:14) and "I Love Music"(9:43) by The O'Jays and "I'll Always Love My Momma"(9:44). The bonus track added to this collection is the remix of "Do It Anyway You Wanna"(5:35) by People's Choice. This cd is an excellent start for the novices of disco music or a great find for the ones who loved disco since childhood.
