 I recieved this cd as a Christmas gift and had the original cd when it was first put out in 1989 and since I have been a fan since 1980 when I first heard "Heartbreaker" and bought In The Heat Of The Night and everything up to her newest Go cd - I was very happy to see that there was a DVD attached to this collection. It also made me mad at Capitol in that in 2002 Blondie released a new Greatest Hits cd and DVD and the dvd isn't as good as this collection. You get 25 classic videos with commentary both just audio and also visually with Neil & Pat making fun of themselves ,bandmembers,costumes and hairstyles for added fun. The videos are somewhat dated in look but not in sound or style. There is also 4 live tracks- "Heartbreaker" and "I Need A Lover" from 1980 that showcase a somewhat rawer and tougher looking Pat that really was a highlight for me. The 2 other videos are newer performances of "Hell Is For Children" and "Heartbreaker" from 2001. So if you are a new fan or an older one the cd if you don't have it is great but it is the DVD that really makes this collection special. Pat still rocks!
