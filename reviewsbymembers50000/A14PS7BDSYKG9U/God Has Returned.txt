 This is the first single from the much delayed new Blondie cd. It comes after the close of Beyond Records, the lawsuit from ex producer Craig Leon and the fact that this groundbreaking group has no record deal here in the USA at this moment. Signed to Sony International and Epic Australia comes the awesome new single from Blondie. Written by Deborah Harry and Kevin Griffin and produced by Jeff Bova ---this song is pure electronica that Madonna wishes she could make. It starts off with a slinky almost Depeche Mode type beginning then kicks into the falsetto vocals that made "Heart Of Glass " and "Rapture" huge dance floor dramas. The single comes in 4 versions. The first 2 are the album(4:18) and Giorgio Moroder(4:06) radio mix. They are a mixture of electro and straight ahead rock/dance. The best mixes are the full dance mixes by Dead Guys and Scissor Sisters. The Dead Guys Ghost Mix(7:14) adds hand claps,a real bass guitar,eerie backing vocals,Debbie's vocals computerized during the little rap in here to just blow that dance floor out. If you love the Motivo mix for Simply Red's "Sunrise" or the Oakenfold mix for "Hollywood" for Madonna or any really great electro track than this is your mix. Just absolutely perfect beyond words. The Scissor Sisters' Guad Myax ya Extended mix(5:15) pulls the song while still electro in vibe to a more grinding beat than the others. Added vocal bits will have you singing along. Once again at age 58 Deborah Harry not only shows how to do a dance record but just blows all other fakers to her crown away with this record. This must be a huge number one club single in the States or else. Buy  now you won't be sorry.A+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++!!!!!
