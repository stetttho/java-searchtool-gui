 I bought this single because it went number one on the Billboard dance airplay chart. This song has 10 mixes that has just very little differences between the mixes. There is no house mix but just the same sounding trance driven beat. I am giving it the 4 stars although I shouldn't because of the lead vocals. I like the song and the vocals of Evi Goffin but there should have been about only 5 mixes on the cd. Here is the track listing: 1- Radio Edit (3:08) 2- Extended Mix (5:35) 3- Peter Luts Remix (8:48) 4- Cor Fijneman Remix (6:59) 5- Jan Vervloet Remix (7:34)-- my favorite mix 6- McCullen Outlaw Mix (7:16) 7- McCullen Vs. Moldenhauser Remix (7:41) 8- Pulsedriver's Vox Remix (6:56) 9- Pulsedriver's Dub Mix (6:00) 10- Ronald Van Gelderen Remix (8:30)    Not bad but wished the label would have put on some different type of club mixes . That is all.
