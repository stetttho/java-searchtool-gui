 This single follows the flawless "Sunrise" up to the number one place on the Club Play charts on Billboard. This cd is from Holland and features the remixes that took it there. The best mix on this cd single is the Phunk Investigation Exte-Club Mix(7:03)- it begins as a typical house mix, kicks in with a keyboard lick right out of "I'm In Love" by Evelyn Champagne King and then morphs into a string laden disco mix with a Chicago house piano line right from 1987. Then the vocals and background vocals work the magic of this mix. There is even a percussion break down that is too good for words. Incredible mix!!!This is the rest of the mixes:   Fake: 1-Radio mix(3:43) 2-Album Edit(3:15) 3-Love To Infinity Radio mix(4:37)-beautiful 4-Love To Infinity Club Mix(7:00)- a vocal dub mix 5-Phunk Investigation Radio Edit(3:02) 6-Phunk Investigation Exte-club mix(7:03) 7-Phunk Investigation in Electtica Dub Mix(7:07)- harder house mix than the vocal mix.   The Phunk Investigation vocal mix is tremendous and the reason for the 5 stars. Flawless. Look out for the remixes for "You Make Me Feel Brand New" next!!!!!
