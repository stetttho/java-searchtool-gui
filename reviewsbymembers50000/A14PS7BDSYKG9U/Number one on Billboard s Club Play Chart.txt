 This is Jewel's second attempt at the dance market and it is also her second number one dance track. The song produced with Shakira's producer Lester Mendez finds the folk singer singing about trusting ones self to get by. "Intuition" comes in 8 mixes that go from awesome to good. The first remixer up is Todd Terry and in his usual fashion he houses up the song with a deep bassline and keys to boot. The In House Mix(5:41) and Tee's Freeze Mix(5:39) are straight ahead house vocal mixes. His Tee's Kat Mix(5:39) is a good dub. The second remixer up are the duo of Gabriel & Dresden who did a great job of mixing "Serve The Ego" last year. Their 1st mix is the Hi-Tek Digital Mix(10:50) that is not unlike those Junior Vasquez marathon mixes he did for Dolly Parton "Peace Train" and K.D. Lang "Theme from The Valley Of The Dolls" in which the music begins hard and fast only to drop out under the vocals to then pick up after the vocals are done. It worked for Junior and it does on this mix too. Their second mix -Rhythm Club Mix(8:17) takes out the beginning fast part and kicks in to the hip hop style beat of the other mix and then kicks up to the faster beat later. This mix would have worked better than to just keep the hip hop beat for the entire song- maybe just an extended original mix and that would be that. The Lo-Tek Analog Dub Mix(10:30) is upbeat house all the way. The next mixer is Markus Shulz's Coldharbor Mix(10:21) which is probably the mix most clubs are playing. Not that much vocals but an great mix . The final mixer is Ford and his Extended Mix(7:17) is my favorite mix here . Flat out trance this mix gives Jewel the drama that the other mixes don't have. All keys and loops work the song over the top . Just a beautiful mix. Well Done!!! So hopefully Atlantic will continue to release more remixes from Jewel because her growing club fans will want more.
