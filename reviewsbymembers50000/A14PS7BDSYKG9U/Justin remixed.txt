 This is the 2nd single from the now solo Justin Timberlake and it is quite good. The main reason I bought this and the 2nd part of this single are for the remixes. The cd comes with 2 full length remixes that are really well done. The first track is the original Timbaland production (4:50) that remains the best version here. Then you get the Dirty Vegas Vocal Mix(7:45) that is similar to their own song and their remix of Madonna's "Die Another Day". Then you get the Bill Hamel Vocal Remix(6:48) . This mix is the best mix because it is very trancy yet underground for the hardest of DJs. Excellent...
