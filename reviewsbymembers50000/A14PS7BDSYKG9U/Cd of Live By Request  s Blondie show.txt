 This is the cd version of the Live By Request show that Blondie did for the A&E channel. The cd sounds amazing and the songs are songs requested by fans who could call in  or email the show. The one problem with the cd is the fact that "Undone" which is on the DVD version and " Maria" are missing from the cd - they were on the TV version and can not understand why they are not on here. The songs sound great as usual with "Good Boys" shining the most. The power of "Union City Blue", "Rip Her To Shreds", "One Way Or Another" and "Dreaming" still ring true. "Accidents Will Never Happen" is mistitled and the song writer for "(I'm Always Touched By Your ) Presence Dear" should  read Gary Valentine  but both are flawless versions. The best track is the almost bluegrass version of "The Dream's Lost On Me" which on No Exit was country to begin with . All that was missing was Alison Krauss and it would have been bluegrass- this version is very stripped down and so beautiful. The cd isn't as varied as the Blondie Live cd from 1999 but the sound is better. A+++++ as usual.
