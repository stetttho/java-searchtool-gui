 This is the second cd in the Australian cd single set for "Mixed Up World". The single comes with remixes from her past hits collection. The mixes are: 1- Mixed Up World (LP Version) 3:49 2- Take Me Home- Sneaker Pimps Remix(4:41)-not as good as the original mix. 3- Murder On The Dancefoor- Phunk Investigation Vocal Mix(8:34)-more harder in the house mix than the other disco mixes done. 4- Get Over You-Almighty Pop'd Up Mix(7:14)another beautiful Almighty Mix. 5- Music Gets The Best Of Me- Flip 'N Fill Remix(6:05)- so far the only mix I have seen of this song.   A great ep of club mixes from Ms. Sophie Ellis Bextor.
