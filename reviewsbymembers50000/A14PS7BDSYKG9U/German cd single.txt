 I bought this cd single for the full 12" mix of the Victor Calderone remix for "Desert Rose". The American cd single didn't feature it so I bought the import. The tracks are as following:Desert Rose Radio Mix(3:54),Melodic Club Mix(9:20)and the Melodic Radio mix(4:44) plus Brand New Day (Murlyn Mix-5:01). The Victor Calderone  mix fuses House music with Middle eastern type music very well. Was a top five club play track in 2000 and spent 9 weeks atop the Sales Dance Chart.Great song.
