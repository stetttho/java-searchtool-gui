 This is the UK cd single for the HUGE number one around the world by Beyonce. The first track is the original album mix of "Crazy In Love" (3:55) that has the horns and attitude that makes this song a classic. The next track is "Summertime" which despite featuring P.Diddy I still like. The main reason for buying for me is the Maurice Joshua Nu Soul Remix(6:27). Maurice Joshua has been mixing Beyonce since Destiny's Child's "Bills,Bills,Bills" and seems to frame her very well in the club mixes that he does. Excellent guitar and bass work on this mix. Classic!!!
