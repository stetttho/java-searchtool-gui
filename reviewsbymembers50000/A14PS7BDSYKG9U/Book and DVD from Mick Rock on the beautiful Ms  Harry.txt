 This is a book of classic rock photographer Mick Rock on this time his photos of God herself- Debbie Harry. It starts in the early part of Blondie's career- 1974 and goes up to 2003 with the main focus being 1978-1980 which were that main part of Debbie's career with Blondie the first time around. You get some never before shots and some that are famous. The cover of the Book was a shot taken for Bob Guccione's Viva but later was the cover of February 1980's Penthouse magazine. Awesome stuff. The newer pictures show Debbie looking as glamourous as ever. Check out the dvd- but be careful when taking the dvd out not to unglue the holder it comes with from the book. The dvd runs around 21 minutes and is basically an interview with Mick Rock about the pictures and some with the 2003 photo shoot with Debbie . Also fun to watch is the fact that Debbie curses on this dvd and when Mick curses all his stuff is bleeped out. A great book of photos and a fun dvd to go with it. A++++.
