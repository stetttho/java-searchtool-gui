 This is the return of the legend that is David Morales. This is the first single off the upcoming 2 Worlds Collide cd and this track is a collaboration with vocalist Lea- Lorien. The song is very classic Morales in that it has the beautiful strings, keys and bass that he does so well along with a straight ahead actually structured lyric driven song. The mixes are mainstream house and for me one of the best cds singles of 2004. Tracks:  1- Stereo Anthem Mix (10:35)  2- Stereo Dub Mix  (9:20)  3- Stereo Dub Instrumental (9:21)--- tracks 2 and 3 have the feel of Diddy's remix of "Heart Of Glass" by Blondie- much more euro sounding mixes.  4- Extended Mix (7:48)  5- Radio Mix (3:37)    A great return for David Morales. A++++
