 This follows in the line of non dance acts like Jewel,Duncan Sheik,Bette Midler,Stevie Nicks,Sheryl Crow and Sarah McLachlan to have club mixes done for their rock or pop songs. This is one of the best yet.The cd comes with 4 full remixes,3 radio mixes and the original moody album mix. The original mix is a guitar driven song about trying to take the time for a relationship to grow and that is given new urgency in the club mixes. The Passengerz Tuff Club Mix(8:03) and radio mix(3:59) are excellent house mixes that truly up the vibe of the song. The Chris Cox Penetrating Club mix(8:56) is more like a regular Thunderpuss mix (which he was a part of) and that really works for the song. The best mixes though are tracks 4 and 5. The Sean Konnery Resportator Club Mix(6:57) and radio mix (4:10) bring equal parts house,trance and a bit of techno together in a great mix that really shows off the vocals and lyrics. The best mix for me though is the Dave Hernandez Club Mix(7:26). A bit slower and laid back than the other house mixes -this mix broods like the original and that is too good for words. The best mix on this cd. Plus you get the High Bias radio mix(3:40). A great start for Michelle Branch's dance career. Single came in at number 2 on the Billboard Dance sales chart. A++++++++
