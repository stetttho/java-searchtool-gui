 I am giving this cd single 4 stars because essentially there is only one remixer doing the work here- it would have been nice to hear another house mix but the Jason Nevins Global Club Mix (8:07) is still worth it. The original is more in line with Taylor Dayne's "I'll Be Your Shelter"- which I still feel like Anastacia still sounds like a lot. It is more rock in vibe and that is carried onto the remixes by Jason Nevins. The Mixshow mix(5:35) and Global Radio Edit(4:16) are great but the full length mix is only available here on the US cd single. The house mix keeps the guitars going through the more club friendly beat and that is good . Still no major radio play for this song but debuted at number one dance sales and a really huge pop hit around Europe and the rest of the world. Just wishing there were more remixes to hear and play. Still better than most dance records.
