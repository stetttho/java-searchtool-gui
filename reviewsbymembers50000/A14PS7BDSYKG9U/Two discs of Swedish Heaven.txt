 I first became aware of ABBA in 1979 when my sister was pen pals with a girl from Sweden and she became a ABBA freak. She dumped them in 1981 for Adam Ant but I still loved them. I have all of the full cds and the Box Set but never bought any  "HITS" cds until this one. I've had this for over a year now and play it from time to time. This is a 2 disc set from 1972 to 1983 . Disc 1 has the HUGE hits "Waterloo","SOS","Mamma Mia", "Fernando","Dancing Queen","Money Money Money","Knowing Me Knowing You","The Name Of The Game","Take A Chance On Me","Chiqutita" and the Bjorn fronted killer "Does Your Mother Know". Classics !!!  Disc 2 begins and ends with "Voulez Vouz" in lp and rare (6:07) Disco remix. The hits on this disc are "Angeleyes","Gimme Gimme Gimme(A Man After Midnight)","I Have A Dream","The Winner Takes It All"(Best ABBA SONG ever),"Super Trouper" ,disco #1 hit"Lay All Your Love On Me",the gorgeous "One Of Us", "When All Is Said And Done"(last US Top 40 hit),the creepy "The Visitors" and "Thank You For The Music". Equally classic stuff. These songs not only hold up but garner new fans every year. Most people think that the songs were happy Eurotrash but dig deeper and listen to the heartbreak and happiness that these songs exude still after all these years. Enjoy the rare 12" of "Voulez Vouz" which sits very nicely with my rare Disconet mix of "Lay All Your Love On Me",which is not included.
