 This is a collection of the songs that made Kylie Minogue famous . This is the cd that she is not happy with --especially the cover-- so you get most of her huge hits from 1987/88 to 1992/93. The first disc are the original single mixes of songs like "I Should Be So Lucky","Got To Be Certain" ,"The Loco-Motion","Je Ne Sais Pas Pourquoi","Step Back In Time ", "Shocked", "Made In Heaven", "Give Me Just A Little More Time" and the lovely "Tears On My Pillow". Also included are 2 duets: one with Jason Donovan "Especially For You" and one with US soul singer Keith Washington , whose own huge R&B song "Kissing You " went top 40 in America. But the best part of this cd is the inclusion of a second disc with remixes. Most of these remixes are very rare and haven't either been released or put out on import only. Remixes: 1)Hand On Your Heart (W.I.P. 2002 Mix) 6:05 -- new house mix 2)I Sould Be So Lucky (Original Extended Mix) 6:05 3)The Loco-Motion (Oz Tour Mix) 5:42--- Incredible house mix 4)Made In Heaven (Heaven Scent Mix) 4:45--Dub mix 5)Wouldn't Change A Thing(The Espagna Mix) 5:49--I have this mix on a promo cd from the  US . 6)Step Back In Time(Phil Harding/Ian Curnow Mix) 6:45-- unreleased disco type remix that is excellent. 7)Shocked (Harding/Curnow Mix) 7:32 ---Kick [tail] rock guitar/house mixture 8)Word Is Out (Summer Breeze Mix)7:47--Mega rare mix,a little bit ambient and laid back in vibe. 9)Celebration(Techno Rave Remix) 6:43--Japanese only remix that is like the title states very  techno rave in feel. 10)Better The Devil You Know(1995 Movers & Shakers Altenative 12" Mix) 6:29 --Unreleased mix ,in the euro/house style 11)What Do I Have To Do (1996 Movers & Shakers 12" Mix) 8:48 --1996 house remix of her 91 hit.       The booklet features all of her single covers and excellent information about charts success and early pictures. An excellent start for those who never heard of Kylie until "Can't Get You Out Of My Head" or for the freaks who must own every remix known to man.
