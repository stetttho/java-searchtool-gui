 This song recently hit number one on the club charts and was finally released on cd by MCA but it did't cross to the Top 100 chart. This is Res' second single("Golden Boys" her first)and showcases both a great new talent and the remixers. She has been compared to Chrissie Hynde vocally--not really sure about that one but hopefully she can have her long career. The remixes are: Robbie Rivera's Vocal Mix Part Two(6:53)which is my favorite mix because it keeps the sloping jazzy feel of the original in the dance mix. Second mix is the DJ Guiseppe Mix (8:13) that is a bit pop/house but still underground feel to it.Then you get the Bastone & Burnz Remix(8:59) that is what most DJ's play--very aggessive and loopy keys add to the drama of this mix.Excellent.Then you get a ... mix by DJ Encore(5:52)-I don't like it very much. The final track is the Robbie Rivera dub mix(8:06) that is quite good for a dub mix. Buy it for the first 3 mixes because you can't lose with any one of them.
