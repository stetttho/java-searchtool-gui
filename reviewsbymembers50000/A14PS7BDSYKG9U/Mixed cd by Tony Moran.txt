 I bought this cd for one reason only and that was the track by Becky Baeling."Getaway" was a number one Billboard Club track from earlier this year and was only a promo only release- so this is the first cd to feature a full remix of the song. The cd is beat mixed by former Latin Rascal himself- Tony Moran and is part dub,house,latin and vocals all mixed together.Here is the track listing for the cd:  1-Junior Jack- E Samba (Original Club Mix)4:22  2-The Carreros-Dulce Del Piano(Latin Explosion Mix)3:28  3-Becky Baeling-Getaway(TM's Private Anthem Mix) 6:52  4-Alma Matris-Rapido(Giangi Cappai New Yorker Mix) 3:46  5-6th Element- Together(Malinconik Mix) 3:24  6-The Patriot- American Life(American Tribal Anthem )8:42- it states produced by Tony Moran and Warren Rigg but I swear this is really Madonna on FILTERED vocals. Excellent Mix  7-Obelix-Lick My Bass(Original) 2:42  8-Kevin Aviance-Give It Up(The Tribalist Mix)7:46-his best song!  9-Laurent Wolf-Royal drums Afro Dynamic 4(Iyo Original Mix)2:13 10-The Orange Factory- White Horse(Original)5:11- Laid Back remake- all techno/blippy keys on this version. 11-Praxis featuring Kathy Brown- Turn me Out(Turn To Sugar)  (2003 Escape Vs.Guido Mix) 5:11 12-Angelo Kortez Featuring Alan T-Drums(Kortez Protribe Mix)3:41 13-The Sicilian & Reina-Vivo Per Lei(Tony's Lovin' Milan Mix)8:40 14-Luzon- The Bagiuo Track(Original Mix)6:54   Total time for the cd is 72:55 and it is a nice mix cd .
