 I really didn't know what this song sounded like for quite awhile last year because it was so hard to find to buy. I first heard it on Music Choice on digital tv and read about in Mix Mag from the UK. Then finally Groovilicious records finally got wise and put it out in America and it spent 4 weeks at number one on the Billboard dance charts making it the number one song of 2001. The cd comes  with 3 mixes that are quite good to kick ... brilliant. The first remix is the absolutely stomp ... too good for mere mortals original mix. This mix is rife with trippy keybords and male vocals that would do Depeche Mode and New Order proud. Just one of the best mixes I've ever heard.Very progressive and to me reminded me of "Glad To Know You " by Chas Jankel (WAY AHEAD OF IT'S TIME). Then you get the Terry Lee Browne mix that is good. More guitars added and most reviews tend to pick this as the best mix but no way is that true in my opinion.Then you get the looping Victor Calderone mix which to me almost comes close to the original in perfection. Over 9 minutes and one of his best mixes to boot.
