 This is the second release fron the American Life cd and it finds the Material Girl doing some more self searching. This cd single comes with 5 remixes and a radio edit. This is Madonna and most .... will buy this no matter how good or bad the mixes are. The Radio edit(3:42) is good but needed the "Push The Button " part on it. The Jacques Lu Con't's Thin White Duck Mix(7:09) is good electronica with most of the vocals.The Micronauts remix(6:25) is good as well but is basically a dub mix. The Paul Oakenfold Full remix(7:01) is the second best mix here. It is electro with a lot of house thrown in and features the entire vocal of Madonna. The Deepsky's Home Sweet Home Vocal mix(7:34) is okay but doesn't feature any of the vocals except the "Push The Button" part. Disappointing!! The best mix is the Victor Calderone and Mac Quayle Glam Mix(9:22) and what most Club DJ's are playing. This track is more aggressive than some of his latest stuff and features the entire vocal of Madonna on it. Just another side of Madonna in her never ending trying  and doing  and being all career.
