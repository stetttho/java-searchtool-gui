 This is the remixes for Madonna's newest single "American Life" and  it vastly improves on the original version. The mixes range from hip hop to trance/electronica to flat out house music. The best mixes of the song are by Missy Elliott,Paul Oakenfold and Part 2 of the Peter Rauhofer American Anthem mix. The Missy Elliott American Dream mix(4:49) is typical Missy and that is saying a lot becuase she is so much a genius. The Paul Oakenfold Downtempo mix(6:32) is the best mix here. It gives Madonna the chance like "Justify My Love" and  "Erotica" to get more r&b/rap influenced than normally done. It is very different from his normal type of mix but it works. The Felix Da Housecat Devin Dazzle Mix(6:10) is crap. It tries to move the vocals to a more upbeat type flow and makes her sound weird. The Peter Rauhofer part 1 American Anthem mix(10:41) is electro and does the same vocally as the Felix Da Housecat Mix with a tad better results. His part 2 Mix(9:06) is what will take this song to number one on the club charts. The vocals are at normal speed and she sounds aggressive. The weird thing though is that the original mix -the rap sounds out of place but on the remixes they are to me the highlight--weird ! Then you get the new mix by Richard Humpty Vission of "Die Another Day"(6:01) that takes the Bond theme into more electro type vibe. That said this is Madonna and is you love her or hate her this cd single is a good feel for what not only Madonna wants to do(She gets final say over all mixes done) but also what is the state of Club music in 2003.
