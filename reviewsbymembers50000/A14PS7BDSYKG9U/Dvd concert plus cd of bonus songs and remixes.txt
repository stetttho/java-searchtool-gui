 I bought this collection for the second disc of remixes included here.The real find though is the DVD concert that is the main selling point. Although not as polished as a Cher or Kylie - Beyonce comes off as a hardworking,great voiced young diva waiting and eventually showing the crowd her talent for dancing ,singing and of course like every good diva -the glamour that goes into concerts like this. She changes outfits several times and looks great in each one. This is basically a concert of her Dangerously In Love cd with a Destiny's Child medley thrown in for great effect. Love the Bob Fosse- Sweet Charity  number during "Yes".    The cd is the main point of me buying this and in it you get a new cover of the Classic "Wishing On A Star" made famous by Rose Royce /The Cover Girls(depending on if you are a 70's or a 90's music fan) plus two new songs. The remixes are for "Krazy In Love"(Maurice's Nu Soul Mix- 6:29),"Baby Boy" (Junior's World Mixshow Mix-6:38) and the new and so far only on import remix for "Naughty Girl"(Caldrone/Quayle Club Mix- a full 9:39). Missing is a remix for "Me,Myself And I" but still a great little ep of new stuff and mixes.
