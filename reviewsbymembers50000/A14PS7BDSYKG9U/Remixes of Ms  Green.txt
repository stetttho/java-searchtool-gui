 This is the cd single that features remixes of the huge club single "Emotional Rollercoaster". The original version is more in line with Erykah Badu then Madonna but then a remix hit never hurt anyone. This cd features  Awesome remix by Junior Vasquez. His Earth Anthem Mix(10:37) is one of his best mixes in quite some time. It is a mixture of deep and aggressive house and yet entwined with  a touch of trance.  The next mix is the That Kid Chris mix(8:53) and this too is quite good. It is a little more mainstream but could work the harder club rooms too. His best work since his wonderful mix of Marc Anthony. The next mix is by Above & Beyond. Their mix (9:35) is Euro Trance/House and it is sooooo well done it is scary. Almost as good as their mix of Perpetous Dreamer "The Sound Of Violence". Finally there is the Rob Rives Dub mix(6:58) and that is good but it is a dub. This song is one of a woman who is tired of being lead along by her partner and wants something better. A great collection of remixes especially by Mr. Vasquez. Beautiful. Already a #1 club hit.
