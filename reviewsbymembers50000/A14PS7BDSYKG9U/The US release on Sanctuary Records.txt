 This is the US release of the so far only worldwide release of the new Blondie cd The Curse Of Blondie. I have previously reviewed the import version and still think this is one of their best albums. I have bought the UK,Australian and Argentinian cds as well as the cd singles for "Good Boys" from the same countries as well as a promo cd single and commercial 12" single from the US with mixes by Norty Cotto. The release will follow a blitz of the group on TV with apperances on VH1 Divas Live,The Today Show, The View,Craig Killborn,Good Day Live and others . Track "Good Boys " is the lead single and so far sits at number 7 on the Billboard Club Charts. I have played this cd since I first got it in September and it still sounds fresh and alive. There are at least 5 singles off this cd: "Undone","Rules For Living","Background Melody(The Only One)","Shakedown" and "Songs Of Love" to follow "Good Boys". This really doesn't have a bad track on it and if you love smart,fresh, daring and really great music then you will love this cd a lot. Unlike most music out there today it isn't cookie cutter teen music or rap or goth rock. It seems to be alive and fun and yet keep what Blondie is all about. "Hello Joe" is more of a love song to Joey Ramone and "Desire Brings Me Back" still reminds me of a Doors song and "Golden Rod" still rocks the hardest . Buy it for the fact it is really a great collection of smart and fun songs from the best band on the planet. Blondie still rocks!!!!!!
