 This is the latest single by dance diva Suzanne Palmer on the Star 69 label and it is a great cover of the number one track from 1987 by Miami female trio Company B. Now first off this is in no way better than the original version but it is so well done that this too is a classic release.   The track reached number 10 on the Billboard dance chart and to me should have been higher. Plus the fact that this cd single was often delayed before finally being issued out 2 or 3 months after the song had peaked. The track is a more forceful vocal and club mixed than the 1 mix version of the original. There is your Tribal mix, mainstream house mix, your underground mix and your Big room anthem mix. All work with Suzanne's much stronger blacker vocals and yet you still miss the sexier vocals of the original version.   Tracks: Fascinated 1- Radio Mix (3:54) 2- Eric Kupper Club Mix (7:08)-- both 1 & 2 are Eric Kupper produced and mixes tracks. 3- Offer Nissim Remix (9:34)- more underground and aggressive mix. 4- Dj Escape & Gomi Remix (9:26)- more bass driven, bleep type mix plus has the killer sample of the original version around the 5 1/2 minute mark. Best mix for me. 5- Dj Paulo & Todd Dutkevitch Creative Mix (9:07)-- more tribal /drum driven mix that sort of gets a bit more sweeter keyboard driven as well. Nice mix. 6- Johnny Vicious Big Room Anthem Mix (9:24)-- more techno-trance/disco version. A much more BPM driven remix.     Another great dance track from one of the US's best dance artists.
