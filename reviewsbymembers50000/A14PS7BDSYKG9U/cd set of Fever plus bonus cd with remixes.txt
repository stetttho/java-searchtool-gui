 Almost a year after the UK release of Fever comes the new 2 cd set of her hugely successful cd. I bought this from Amazom.co.uk and this cd features the first disc of Fever. The main difference from the original Fever is the inclusion of the new radio mix for "Come Into My World" that is only on the cd single. The rest of the cd still holds up well and continues to sound incredible. The hits are "Can't Get You Out Of My Head"(#1 for 4 weeks UK/# 7 US), "In Your Eyes" (#3 UK),"Love At First Sight"(#2 UK/#23 US) and the newest single "Come Into My World (#8 UK). But there are still more hits off this cd if EMI or Capitol will see fit. To me "More More More", "Burning Up" and especially "Your Love" could be huge hits. Then the cd comes with a second disc of mixes. You get the rare "Can't Get Blue Monday Out of My Head(4:02), "Love at First Sight" (Scumfrog's Beauty & The Beast Vocal Edit)-4:27 ,"Can't Get You Out Of My Head" (Tim Deluxe's Dirty Dub Mix)-6:51, "In Your Eyes" (Roger Sanchez Release The Dub Mix)-7:16,  "Love At First Sight"(US Radio mix by Ruff & Jam)-3:46 and only a promo for US radio stations, "Come Into  My World"(Fischerspooner Mix)-4:17 and very electronica. The final track is the track from the Scooby Doo soundtrack the very catchy "Whenever You Feel Like It" (4:05).    This cd shows the strength of Kylie and hopefully she will continue to grow as an artist.
