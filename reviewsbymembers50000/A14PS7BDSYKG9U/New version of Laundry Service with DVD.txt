 I bought this cd because I really love Shakira and her voice. She is clearly very influenced by not only her Latin roots but her love for rock music especially punk and new wave. She just shows so much talent for her lyric writing and her voice is not your typical one- to me a cross between Grace Jones and Siouxsie. The hits are here with "Whenever,Wherever " ,"Underneath Your Clothes" and "Objection (Tango)" the main attraction. But the best songs are the non hits like the Hedwig like ballad "The One" ,"Fool" and "Rules"--- future hits. Dance numbers like "Ready For The Good Times" and "Eyes Like Yours" really show off her clubbier side. You get Spanish versions of "Whenever Wherever" and "Objection" plus new mixes of them too. The Afro Punk Version of "Objection(Tango)" which is similar to the one she performed on the MTV Video Awards really is better than the B-52's influenced original version. The Acoustic version of "Underneath Your Clothes" I think she also performed on Top Of The Pops. Plus the 2nd disc is a DVD of her performance from the MTV Video Awards as well as MTV's Making the Video  and full video of "Objection(Tango)" that showcase her sense of humor and beauty very well. The music on here hopefully will show the US what the rest of the Spanish speaking countries already knew: Shakira rocks.
