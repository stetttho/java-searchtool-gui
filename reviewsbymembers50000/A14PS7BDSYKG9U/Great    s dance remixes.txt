 This cd comes from Holland and is basically filled with EMI released dance music from the 1980's . All the songs are 12" mixes except for the Debbie Harry track for "French Kissin" which is the lp version. The 12" mix for "French Kissin" is over 7 minutes. This cd is one of several in a list of Maximum 12" cds from the Disky label. Not a bad selection on this cd. Track listing:  1- Talk Talk- It's A Shame (12") 7:00--hit number 12 on the dance charts in 1984.  2- Culture Club- The War Song (Extended) 6:18- one of their last big top 40 hits from 1984's Waking Up With The House On Fire ---this hit number 7 on the club chart.  3- Duran Duran- The Reflex (Dance Mix) 6:32--their first number one pop hit . This reached number 15 club in 1984.  4- Dusty Springfield- In Private (12" ) 7:12--produced by Pet Shop Boys in 1989 this track is up there with their work for Liza also in 1989. NRG house mix.  5- Ian Dury- Hit Me With Your Rhythm Stick (1991 Remix) 6:49-- not the original 1979 version but quite good.  6- Debbie Harry- French Kissin' In The USA (LP mix) 5:11-- a huge college radio hit in 1986 and hit number 57 pop. This went to number 44 club sales that year. Classic Debbie!!!!  7- Go West- We Close Our Eyes (12" ) 6:02-- hit number 5 club chart in 1985. NRG dance at it's best.  8- Heaven 17- Let me Go (Extended ) 6:13-  a major dance track of 1982/83 going to number 4. Very Euro sounding while having a slight hip hop beat thrown in. Excellent.  9- Kim Wilde- Love Blonde (12") 5:00- Excellent track from Kim's early days. From 1983 it sounds like The Cure's "Love Cats " to me.  10- The Belle Stars- 80's Romance (12") 6:47--- excellent remix for the all girl UK group. Great slice of 80's flashback music.    Excellent collection.
