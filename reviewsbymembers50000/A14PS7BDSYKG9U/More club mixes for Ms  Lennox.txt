 This is the cd single for the club freaks to get their hands on the mixes for the "A Thousand Beautiful Things" track plus if you don't have the US cd single with mixes for "Pavement Cracks". This cd is one for the track "Wonderful" which has club mixes and is climbing the charts but there are no club mixes on the cd here. The mixes for "Pavement Cracks" are the INCREDIBLE Scumfrog mix(8:28) and the good Goldtrix mix(6:36).The mixes for "A Thousand Beautiful Things" are by Gabriel & Dresden and the newer team of Bimbo Jones. The Gabriel & Dresden Tech Funk Mix(9:09) is typical of their recent work for Duncan Sheik and Jewel in that they take a pop songs and goose it up with loopy keyboard effects and underground feel and make a whole new understanding for the song. Beautiful. The best mix though is the Bimbo Jones Stealth Mix(7:52). This mix is part house and trance and the vocals are front and center. Incredible mix that really shows off their remixing abilities. Another dance club winner for Annie Lennox. A+++++++++++++++++++++
