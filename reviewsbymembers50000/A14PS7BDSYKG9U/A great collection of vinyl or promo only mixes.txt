 I'm not the biggest of Jessica simpson fans but I really enjoyed this cd a lot.It is missing her duet with future husband Nick Lachey on "Where You Are" but I already have it. The cd comes only with 7 songs and therefore the EP in the title. The first song is "I Wanna Love You Forever" and comes in single and Extended Soul Solution mixes. The Extended mix is 9:28 and a little nrg/house. Matches the over the top vocals. Then you get 2 mixes of "I Think I'm In Love With You by Club 69 main man Peter Rauhofer and Lenny Bertoldo. The Peter Rauhofer mix(9:19) is a promo mix that I guess is only found here. Not as good as the Lenny Bertoldo mix. This mix (9:39) was only on 12" vinyl and hit #31 on the club charts. This is very in tune with the song and vocals presented by Ms. Simpson. Then you get the Jermaine Dupri So So Def Mix featuring Lil Bow Wow of "Irresisible". This mix (3:34) was a huge hit on TRL and then you get the Hex Hector Club mix(8:53) and this I swear features a vocal sample of Debbie Harry from the UK only mix cd "Beautiful" of "Sunday Girl".Best mix on the cd. Then you get the Chris "The Greek" Panghi ang Guido Osorio Mix of "A Little Bit". This mix (7:48) works very well too. I think the concept of this cd is that Sony is trying to release a collection of promo and 12" vinyl singles on cd in this form similar to what Arista did to Lisa Stansfield in 1998 with all her promos on her Remix Ep. If so please release other artists from Sony Labels too in the future.
