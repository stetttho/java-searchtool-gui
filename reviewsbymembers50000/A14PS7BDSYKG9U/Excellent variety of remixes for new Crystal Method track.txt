 This is the latest remixes for the legendary dance act The Crystal Method. This single features a different type of remixes for the more adventureous dance fan. The mixes range from really aggressive house to a a mixture of electro/freestyle. The vocals are by John Garcia and he sounds like AC/DC or some heavy metal vocalist doing dance music-weird but really interesting. These are the mixes:  1- Erick Morillo Main Mix (7:03)  2- Erick Morillo Dub Mix (7:03)--both mixes very aggressive house.  3- Deepsky's Green Absinthe Dub Mix(8:12)  4- Nu Breed Remix(6:58)-full vocals  5- EK's Spider In The Corner Alt. Dub Mix(6:11)    This hit number 3 on the Billboard Club Play Chart and Dance Sales Chart. The Erick Morillo mixes are the best here. Excellent.
