 This is a collection of the both sides of Mariah Carey's career- part disco queen and part hip hop jeep diva. The fact that most artists wouldn't even bother to redo some of the vocals to make a remix work in either club or hip hop style makes her a friend to the genre that she works in. She still is recieving major Club support with her latest single "Bringing On The Heartbreak" (number 5 club single) shows club djs support when most of radio abandoned her. This is troubling to me when lesser vocalists like Jennifer Lopez and Thalia scored hits on radio with male rap artists guesting or saving a record this is what Mariah was doing since the mid 90's. Oh well the cds are Disc 1: the House Mixes and disc 2 :the hip hop mixes.  Disc 1:   1-My All (David Morales "My" Club Mix 7:09   2-Heartbreaker/If You Should Ever Be Lonely       (Junior's Heartbreaker Club Mix) 10:18   3-Fly Away(Butterfly Reprise) (Flyaway Club Mix) 9:50   4-Anytime You Need A Friend(C&C Club Version) 10:54   5-Fanasty(Def Club Mix)11:15   6-Honey(Classic Mix)8:06   7-Dreamlover(Def Club Mix)10:45   8-Emotions(12" Club Mix) 5:50   9-Through The Rain(Hex Hector Radio Edit)4:08    Missing are the house mixes of "Someday","Loverboy","Joy To      The World"and "The Roof" but still a great cd 1."Dreamlover"      and "Emotions" not on cd before this cd collection.  Disc 2:   1-Fanasty (O.D.B. Version) 4:52   2-Always Be My Baby(Jermaine Dupri Mix)with DaBrat&Xscape 4:41   3-My All/Stay Awhile(So So Def Mix) with Lord Tariq & Peter        Gunz   4:45   4-Thank God I Found You (Make It Last Mix) with Joe & Nas 5:09   5-Breakdown(with Krayzie Bone & Wish Bone) 4:45   6-Honey(So So Def Mix) with DaBrat & JD 5:13   7-Loverboy(Remix) with DaBrat,Ludacris,Twenty II & Shawnna 4:31   8-Heartbreaker(Remix) with DaBrat & Missy Elliott 4:38   9-Sweetheart 4:23  10-Crybaby(with Snop Dogg) 5:21  11-Miss You(with Jadakiss) 5:10  12-The One(So So Def Mix) with Bone Crusher 4:38  13-I Know What You Want (with Busta Rhymes &The Flipmode Squad      4:12--huge radio single in 2003-no. 3 pop.    Missing are the even better two step/garage mix of "Loverboy"      or the original mix of "Someday" by Shep Pettibone.   This collection is a reminder of the hit days of Mariah and     hopefully there is more to come in the future.
