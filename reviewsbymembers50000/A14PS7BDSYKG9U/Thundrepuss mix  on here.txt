 This is the second single from Shakira in English and it is even better than "Whenever Wherever". This cd is from the UK and I did actually buy it from Amazon.co.uk and that is that. The cd comes with the Album mix (3:39) that has burned up the radio for months now. it is just an incredible song lyrically and vocally as well. The main reason I bought this cd was the Thunderpuss mix of "Underneath Your Clothes". BIG DRAMA from this mix !This mix is one of their best work in awhile and it shows. From the loopy keys to the slowdown near the middle to complete force of energy you get from this mix is astounding. At 6:52 it is one of the shorter mixes they have done and that is good- not too much vocal looping here .Then you get the album version (4:28)of "Ciega,Sordomunda" which is good too.
