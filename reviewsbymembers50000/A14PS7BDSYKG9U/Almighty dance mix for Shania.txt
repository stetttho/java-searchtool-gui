 The reason I bought this single was for the Almighty mix for the track "Thank You Baby". I am such a huge fan of the remix team called Almighty Associates. They have done mixes for Deborah Harry,Cher, Hannah Jones,Le Ann Rimes,Kylie Minogue,Sheena Easton,Anastacia and a boat load of people. To me they have never done a bad mix. This mix(6:31)puts the country queen in a tea house club setting. Very NRGish type house mix that works wonders with the faux strings from the original. Excellent . You get also the pop mix from the UP cd and a live version of "Any Man Of Mine".
