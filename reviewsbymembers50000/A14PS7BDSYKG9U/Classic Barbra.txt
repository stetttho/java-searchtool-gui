 This album is a very personal album for me in that I got it as a birthday gift for my 10th birthday in 1980. I think this is the best album of her career. The huge hits include "Woman In Love"(#1 for 3 weeks),"Guilty" (#3),"What Kind Of Fool"(#10) and "Promises"(#50). The whole album is just incredible. From the non hits of "The Love Inside" to "Life Story" to "Run Wild" to "Never Give Up" to the EPIC ballad " Make It Like A Memory" which I swear Guns 'N Roses copied for "November Rain"-- the songs and the vocals are very emotional. Just an incredible job by Barry Gibb. He went on to produce huge hits for Dionne Warwick,Kenny Rogers and Diana Ross but none feature the emotion and beauty as the Guilty album. Incredible.
