 This is the first number one Club track hit for the duo of Friburn & Urik. This song is probably their best song they have done. The cd single comes in 5 mixes . The Electribe radio(3:42) and full mix(6:39) are my favorite. It is just as the title explains a electro type of remix. Then you get the Tribalistic radio(3:50) and full mix(9:23) and it too is very Tribal house in style. Then you get the wonderful Peter Bailey mix(7:17) and this is too the point and with a lot of energy. I swear the vocals are a distortion of the Grace Jones track "Slave To The Rhythm" where she goes "dance to the rhythm". I don't know because there is no credit given. A number one Billboard dance hit.
