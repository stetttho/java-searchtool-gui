 This DVD features every video from "What Have You Done For Me Latley"  to "Runaway". The videos and songs show Janet's growth from the sister of Michael Jackson to a mega star of her own doing. The videos are weird to see the fashions but the hold up well. To the movie house fanasty of "Nasty" to the black and white of "Let's Wait awhile" to the freak show of "Escapade" to the big dance /production extravaganzas of "When I Think Of You" and "Alright" through the military vibe of "Rhythm Nation" the videos showcase her and the music. Best videos to me are the longer version of "Control","Miss You Much" and the laid back "That's The Way Love Is " which features Jennifer Lopez in a cameo. Hopefully Virgin will release a new dvd with songs from "If" to "Son Of A Gun" or whatever else is released.
