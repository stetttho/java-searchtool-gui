 This is the latest cd from Kylie Minogue and it is part Donna Summer dance then morphs into a Marvin Gaye sexual type of album. The first 5 tracks are pure electro dance that really groove the songs to a great dance vibe. There are references to Lisa Lisa, Dead Or Alive and INXS among them. "Slow","Secret(Take You Home)" and "Sweet Music" groove hard. Then by track 6-"Red Blooded Woman" and the very sensual "Chocolate" the sexual vibes starts taking over. "After Dark","Someday" and "Obsession" are great examples. This is one of Kylie's best collection of songs--she used a lot of different producers but it is a cohesive collection from track 1 to the very last note. Not as disco as Light Years or as commercial as Fever but still very at the top of Kylie's best work. Will be out in the US in February.
