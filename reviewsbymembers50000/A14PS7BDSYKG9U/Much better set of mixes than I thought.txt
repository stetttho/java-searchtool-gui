 I bought this cd single because I needed the catalog number. What I got was a great surprise. Those who know the mixes of Benassi Bros. then you know that they mostly sound the same: loopy hard technolike keyboards that loop over and over and are very short. This is what their Sfaction mixes sound like. The best mix though is the original Extended mix which is a bit Euro /Disco in sound and is a gem. The vocals are by Sandy who has done work with K.M.C. and others . She shines on this song. This track reached number 4 on the Club Play chart. Here is the track listing:  1- French Original Radio Edit (3:20)  2- French Sfaction Radio Edit (3:35)  3- Original Extended Mix (5:42)  4- Sfaction Mix (5:21)     Excellent.
