 I bought part 1 and part 2 of this collection plus the Old School Nation cds and they were all incredible to hear the older songs again. This collection- Retro :Active- Rare & Remixed is from the Hi Bias Canadian label. Most of these songs would be considered modern rock/ college radio classics. There are sone huge hits but the majority are not mainstream.   1- A-Ha- Take On Me (Extended Version) 4:48- hit number one on the pop charts but never for I don't know what reason hit the club chart- the beginning is radically different and then the song kicks in. Classic.   2- Camouflage- The Great Commandment (Extended Dance Remix) 5:58- massive club single at the end of 1988- number one for 3 weeks on the club chart in December. The video is great with it's Metropolis theme is great to see.   3- Erasure- Blue Savannah (Out Of The Blue Mix) 6:43- only got to number 44 on the dance charts but was a huge college hit. This mix was not on the cd single.    4- Vis-A-Vis- Shadowplay (Shadow Mix) 5:48- not a big club track but the single is very Depeche Mode like. Moody!   5- The Screaming Blue Messiahs- I Wanna Be A Flintstone(Extended Mix) 5:22- huge college hit in 1987- features samples from the cartoon classic. Fun song.   6- The Spoons- Symmetry (Extended Mix) 6:48- don't know too much about this song but it is very Euro in sound. Great song.   7- Inxs- Burn For You (12" Extended Remix)6:09- great early song from Inxs. Black background vocals- slower groove. Got to number 33 on the dance chart in 1984.   8-  The Dream Academy- Life In A Northern Town (Extended Mix) 5:19- I never knew there was a dance mix. It is a great extended mix with extra chants thrown in.   9-  The Other Two-Tasty Fish (Pascal Mix 12") 5:17- from the remaining two New Order members. House style mix.   10-  Echo & The Bunnymen- Bring On The Dancing Horses (Extended Mix) 5:49 Ian McCulloch at his moody and depressing best. HUGE modern rock classic from 1985. Great mix.  11-  The Cure- Boys Don't Cry (Resung & Club Mix 86) 5:32- a newer mid 80's version of the 1980 classic . Not that different vocally from the 3 versions out from 1980 and 1991 remixes. Just a more 80's style remix with overdubs that wouldn't be put on remixes now. Still a great song.  12- The Beloved- Your Love Takes me Higher(The Pod Went Pop Mix) 8:13- a house mix for the great UK act. Hit number 9 on the Club Chart in 1989 and is very very rare.  13- Book Of Love- I Touch Roses (Full Bloom Version)5:33- Hit number 8 on the Club Chart in 1985 and was a massive college radio hit. Weird video though. Great dead pan vocals.    This is a great collection of rare dance mixes. Great modern rock classics.A++++++
