 I actually recieved this song as a gift in January of this year from a friend and was wondering when it would come to America . Well it is July and the US is playing catch up. The song comes in two D'N'D mixes (radio-2:42 and full version -4:44) that are the original garage/two step versions. The vocals sound sped up compared to the house mix and are best for the radio. The songs is very catchy and will be embedded in your brain soon. The Stella Browne vocal mix by mixers Danny Harrison and Julian Jonah is a great house mix. The mix (7:38) is for the house crowd and make his vocals more normal speed for the mix to work and it does. An excellent song that grew on me. I first heard it on the BBC shortwave radio top 20 countdown and on Top Of The Pops where he performed it unplugged in the beginning of 2002.
