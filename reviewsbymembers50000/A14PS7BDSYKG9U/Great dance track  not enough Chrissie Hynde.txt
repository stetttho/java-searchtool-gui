 I am giving this a 3 star review even though I like most of the mixes. The problem is that it supposed to feature the vocals of Chrissie Hynde from The Pretenders and she is featured on just 1 on the full 12" mixes. This song hit number 4 club and number 1 dance airplay on Billboard and the majority of attention was on Ms. Hynde doing club music. Oh well- there are a lot of mixes to still choose from.  1- Radio Edit (2:45)- Full on Chrissie  2- Geradeaus Mix (Radio Edit)- 3:31 (German Vocals!!!!)  3- Extended Version (6:04)- only Full vocal 12" of Chrissie!!!  4- Robbie Rivera Juicy Dub (7:27)- most club worthy track.  5- Tom Neville Remix (7:19)- some Chrissie vocals.  6- Tom Neville Dub (6:40)  7- Geradeaus Extended Mix (7:25)  8- Geradeaus Instrumental Mix (7:25)  9- Geradeaus Padapella Mix (5:59)  10- Chrissie's Acapella (:42)  11- Computer Girl Acapella (:27)  12- Geradeaus Acapella Edit (:28)  Not bad but still it would have been better if some of the remixes had more full vocals to choose from.
