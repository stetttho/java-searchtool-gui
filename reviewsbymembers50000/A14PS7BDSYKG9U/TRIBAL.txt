 This is the first single of Murk Boys and Funky Green Dogs honchos Oscar Gaetan & Ralph Falcon under their own name. This song recently spent 3 weeks at number one on the Billboard Top club play charts and it is not hard to see why. The cd comes with 3  mixes and they are just awesome. The radio mix(3:45) and the MurkMonsterMix(9:23) feature full vocals .The mixes features what is a kick [butt] beat that at times sounds like a heartbeat beating. The vocals are by Oba Frank Lords. The Murkstrumental mix(9:25) is just as good but no vocals. This song and remixes are sure to be classics for years to come. BUY it now!
