 This is Volume 2 in the cd from the Hi Bias Canadian label of 1980's club mixes. Like Volume 1 this cd is very Alternative Dance leaning. This cd doesn't feature as many major pop hits as volume 1 but these are a little more rare in the scarcity of the records. Here is what is on the cd:  1- The Human League- Human (Extended)  5:02- this for I have no clue why was a number one Club Play track in 1986 for 3 weeks. It is the Human League's biggest charting single on the dance charts and the fact that it isn't too different from the original version I don't get. Lovely version but number one for 3 weeks?!?!  2- A- Ha- The Sun Always Shines On TV (Extended) 8:26- hit number 6 Club in the beginning of 1986. Follow up to "Take On Me".  3- Tears For Fears- Shout (Dub Mix) 6:47- there is a longer mix on the Songs From The Big Chair reissue cd. This is a remix with a decidely hip hop flavor . Number one for 2 weeks in 1985.  4- Blancmange- Don't Tell Me (Dance Remix) 6:51- hit the dance charts twice in 1984 (number 63 and 44 four months apart). Light and dancey.   5- Howard Jones- Look Mama (Megamamamix) 9:15- super rare mix from 1985.  6- Figures On The Beach- No Stars ( Unreleased Original Mix) 6:02- super rare mix again. Very up tempo mix from the alternative rockers.   7- OMD- So In Love (Brand New Extended Mix) 5:39- radically different from the original version. Very much more club feeling than before. Hit number 16 club in 1985.  8- Fuzzbox- International Rescue (The Orgasmatron Mix) 6:03- fun remix from the all girl UK group.  9- Q- Lazzarus- Goodbye Horses (Extended Version) 6:25- absolutely gorgeous remix for the song that was the b-side to the Debbie Harry classic remake of "Liar Liar". Now if the label does part 3 then please include the mega mega rare mix for Debbie Harry NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 10- The Dream Academy- The Love Parade (12" Mix) 6:12- a more dance version of their second hit. Up tempo and very breezy sounding. 11- Alphaville- Jet Set (Jellybean Mix)6:29- never hit the chart. Great remix from the legend that is Jellybean Benitez. 12- Yaz- State Farm (Madhouse Mix) 5:24- The original hit number one in 1983 for 3 weeks with Nobody's Diary. This is the 1991 remix that was a edit on the cd single and full remix on the Maxi cassette single of Situation 1991 remix. First time on cd.     This is a great cd of original and rare mixes from a lot of 1980's alterantive club artists. A+++++++++++++
