 This is the latest single from legendary mixer and producer Tony Moran and this time he features longtime Dance Diva Deborah Cooper on lead vocals. This song should be a huge radio hit if mainstream radio actually played real dance music. The song's theme is a song of friendship and love and forgiveness. Ms. Cooper's vocals are the selling point of the song -- very strong and confident through all the mixes. The mixes are all state of the art 2005 club music. The best mixes are the Offer Nissim mix and the original Tony Moran/Warren Rigg mixes.  Tracks:  Live You All Over---- 1- Tony Moran & Warren Rigg Radio Mix (4:07) 2- Tony Moran & Warren Rigg Vocal Mix (10:17) 3- Gomi & Escape Remix (9:50) 4- D-Formation Remix (9:31) 5- Offer Nissim Remix (8:22)-- perfect. He gets better and better with each mix. Check out his own singles. 6- Tony Moran & Warren Rigg Dub Mix (9:20)   Currently number 2 on the Club Play chart on Billboard. Excellent actually lyric driven dance music. A+++++ for Deborah Cooper.
