 This is the second new single from DJ Shadow and recently hit number one on Billboard 's Top 12"/Maxi single sales chart. Otherwise I wouldn't have bought it because I don't know much about the artist so his music is new to me. The first track is the remix and with more guitars and hip hop elements and the rap of Mos Def--- the mix is only(3:51) but very intesesting. The Radio Edit(3:38) and Album Instrumental (4:59) are more trip hop in feel. The best song is the track "100 Metre Dash" which combines elements of drum & bass with actual live jazz elements like the drums pattern. The fault is that there should  have been a second remixer to give the song a different vibe than just DJ Shadow. Very good.
