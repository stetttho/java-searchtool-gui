 Masterminded by dance legend Eric "E-Smoove" Miller and Erick Morillo-who put forth an excellent female fronted house song. Vocals are by former Love Tribe and sometime Thunderpuss front person Latanza Waters and here she sings very much about becoming Insatiable when she hears music. The 2 mixes are mainstream house and filtered Euro house in style. The E-smoove Vocal 12" mix features full vocals and is the best mix here. Very mainstream  in style. Just one of the best dance songs out there in awhile. The Junior Jack VS. Kid Creme Vocal Mix (9:45) is really a dub with just one passage of vocals on the entire mix. This mix is very charming. Excellent and hard to find. Out on the Sondos/Multiply  X  UK label.
