 Celeda continues on this song to create positive songs to sing about life. In the tradition to his classic songs "Be Yourself" ,"The Underground","Music Is The Answer" and "Let The Music Use You Up" he continues to showcase his voice to great effect-a complete song would be better but oh well.The cd comes with only 3 tracks-2 full 12" mixes and a 18 second acapella mix that are very well done. The first remix is the E-Smoove Mix(8:47) and is the original version because he also produced the song as well. The mix is harder than the usual mixes he does and brings up the beat to favor more underground clubs.The second remix is the Airmale Remix by Rainer Pototsehnig and is 10:12.This mix is a little more mainstream house but still a little bit underground too. It is similar to the mixes for "The Underground" and are my favorite.This track is already #3 on the Billboard dance charts and hopefully more will come from Celeda in the future.
