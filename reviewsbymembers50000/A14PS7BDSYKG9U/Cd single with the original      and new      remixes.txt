 This cd is from the UK and features the new mixes for a song orginally released in 1991/92 on the Invasion label. In 1992 the song originally got as far as number 4 for 2 weeks and was the number 50 song for the entire year of 1992. Now 10 years later the song is dusted off and put back out for another go round the dance floor.The new mixes are by Superchumbo and Low End Specialists. There are 2 Superchumbo mixes - The Roach Remix(8:51) and the Leadhead Dub Mix(9:13). The Roach mix is very percussion heavy -tribal I guess is the term and features vocals by Abraxas who sounds like Celeda or Kevin Aviance a little bit. Very well done and this mix is I am sure is what took it to number 1 on the Billboard charts. Then the Low End Specialists "Chernobyl Remix" (8:07) is more atmospheric and not quite trancier but somewhat a bit spacier/dubbier in sound if that makes any sense. Then come the original mixes.Track 4 is The Beloved 's Factory Flashback Mix(8:33) and early 90's house all the way. Very excellent work from John Marsh but his group The Beloved were one on my favorites back then too. Then track 5 and 6 are the original mixes by Fierce Ruling Divas themselves. Track 5 the Original Atomic 91 mix(4:04) and the Rise Up And Work NYC Mix(5:25) are what I guess was considered Techno /Trance in the early 90's. A bit dated in sound but still worth a listen. The final mix is the Sweet Mix(5:20) done by Moby that is  very piano and heavy bass driven in sound. Quite unlike his stuff now but in tune with his early work. So this song is available on Tommy Boy Silver in the US but so far I haven't seen the cd od it yet-so if you're looking for the "You Gotta Believe(Atomic Slyde) " on cd so far this UK cd single is your best bet to find it.  Available on React Records.
