 This is the second number one song of 2003 for the duo of Oscar Gaetan & Ralph Falcon(after "Dark Beat"). This time they are joined by CLUB DIVA  Kristine W and they redo their early 90's hit . This cd comes in 4 Full length mixes and 2 radio mixes. The remixes begin with the Murk Miami Mix(8:21) and this is very underground in sound. The mix is very well done. The next mix is the Southside Remix by Charlie Solana & Edgar V. (7:48). This mix is very bass house driven and very good as well. The Peter Rauhofer Reconstruction mix(10:05) is the most club vital mix here. It is house/tribal/a little trance all thrown together. But the best mix is the Gomi Big Mix(8:08). This mix best showcases the vocals of Kristine better than the other mixes. She sounds like the Kristine we know and love. Just a masterful job of remixing by Gomi. This is Kristine's 6th released single and her 6th number one dance track. She is loved by the dance community. She is now signed to Tommy Boy records alongside Amber for 2 of Club's best and smartest artists. BUY!
