 What can I say?  This VCR was junk from the moment I took it out of the box.  It kept spitting the tape back out everytime I put it in! The clock wouldn't set right, and the picture quality -when it worked- was mediocre at best.  I sent it back and went with a Sony...  I'll see what kind of luck I have with that one...
