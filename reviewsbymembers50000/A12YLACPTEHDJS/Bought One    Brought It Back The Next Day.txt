 I too was enticed by the relatively low price ($40 Can).  I brought it home, set it up and put in a DVD.  Right away, I noticed something wasn't right when the player would "jump ahead" to Chapter 2 instead of starting at the beginning of the disc.  It did this with several DVD's.  My next complaint was the freeze-ups and pixellation on the screen.  Sometimes the unit seemed to "get stupid" and wouldn't respond to the remote.  That, along with reading these other reviews, was enough to convince me to pack everything back up and return it to Wal*Mart.  Not surprisingly, the customer service rep said that a TON of these things came back for the same reasons.  Live and learn I guess.   Stay away.  Typical mass-market junk.  I'm going to try a Toshiba or Sony or something else.  Caveat Emptor.  Don't be enticed by the low price and small size.  You get what you pay for and I gurantee you'll be sorry.
