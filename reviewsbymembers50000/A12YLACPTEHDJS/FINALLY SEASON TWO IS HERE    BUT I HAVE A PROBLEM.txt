 I'm glad they decided to go ahead and release Season 2 of the A-Team...  My only complaint is that there seems to be a problem with one of my discs.  Disc 1, side 1. "Diamonds in the Dust", totally locks up my player(s) and starts to pixellate right around the 40:00 minute mark.  I've contacted Universal with my problem, to no avail.  Has anyone else out there had this problem too?  People are also reporting playback problems with Knight Rider and Magnum P.I...  Also, Universal seems to have "dumbed down" this set, releasing it by awkwardly putting all episodes on 3 discs instead of 4, and supplying cheap plastic cases.  Come on!  I was just wondering if anyone else out there has experienced playback problems?  I have a one year old JVC, a Panasonic, and of course my DVD-ROM drive, and the disc hesitates in the same spot on all three of my players...   Other than that, at least we DID get season two.  I hope they get their act together for season three.
