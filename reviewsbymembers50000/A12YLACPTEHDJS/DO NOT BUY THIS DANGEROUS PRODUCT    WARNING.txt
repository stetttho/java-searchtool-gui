 Well, what more can I say about this lousy piece of junk that most others haven't already said?  What amazes me is that Underwriters Laboratories even allowed their seal of approval on this thing!  Why on earth a national recall was never issued remains a mystery.  Mine too exploded, after only the SECOND USE!  I could hear a faint cracking sound, but chalked it up to the metal expanding as it was heating up...  Well, the sound got louder and louder until BANG!  I happened to be standing near my stove, preparing the rest of my(now ruined)dinner, and it's a wonder I wasn't seriously injured by the flying glass and sharp fragments that flew in every direction.  It's almost as if a bomb had gone off.  I had gobs of food, glass particles, and the remains of what was once a toaster oven scattered all over my kitchen walls and floor.  It took me nearly three hours to clean everything up, and I finally ended up calling out for Pizza.    NEVER AGAIN Toastmaster.  What happened to the quality products you used to build?  I think I'll stick with Hamilton Beach, Cuisinart or other well-known brands now.  Oh sure, I called their customer service hotline, and they wanted me to (get this) REPACKAGE THE OVEN and send it back to them!!! I'm like, ya OK, whatever.  I just threw everything away and purchased a nice Hamilton Beach toaster oven (model 31169) that has served me well for several months now.  Stay well clear of this thing.  It's obvious there's a serious design flaw somewhere.  I'm currently in the process of seeking legal advice about this, and reading these other reviews makes me believe that there's enough grounds here to launch a class-action lawsuit against Toastmaster for knowingly selling a defective, dangerous product.  Never again.
