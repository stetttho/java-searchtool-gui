 I too owned this particular model, and by pure chance, so did my neighbour.  Mine stopped working after 6 months, in which I followed the directions and kept the unit clean.  My neighbour's stopped working after 8 months.  Instead of throwing them away, (there were no service centres nearby, and B&D's shipping charges were insane) I took my tester out to see where the trouble might lie.  Much to my surprise, there was no power reaching the charging base of the Dustbuster, so I immediately focused my attention on the charging unit.  I separated the wires from the charging base and put the tester to work. Sure enough, there was no power coming out of the charger!   The verdict?  It wasn't the BATTERIES after all, it was a defective charger.  (just like the other reviewer said).   I did some more research on this, and found that there were several Dustbusters made (maybe hundreds?) that seem to have had faulty chargers.  Why B&D never issued a national recall remains a mystery, but it makes perfect sense that maybe they didn't know about this issue?  If they did, then they looked the other way, hoping that the problem wasn't too widespread. I remember the salesman at Sears saying that quite a few of these models came back for the exact same reason. (Dustbusters in Canada have a 2yr warranty) I think there was a quality control issue at their plant in China, and interestingly enough, the newer Dustbusters have a different charger on them.  We shall see if this problem has been resolved, as I've just purchased another one (model CHV9600-see my review) and will take note of how long that one lasts me.  My first Dustbuster purchased in 1990 lasted 8 years, and all models after that have given me trouble!
