 I have owned many Dustbusters over the years, and by far, this is the best one yet.  Lots of suction power, and thanks to the new "cyclonic action", the filter pretty much cleans itself.  A nice change from the old (and dirty) cloth filters.  Picks up pet hair, cat litter, dustbunnies, crumbs, etc without the slightest problems.  The attachments include an upholstery brush and crevice tool for cleaning between the sofa cushions or other hard-to-reach areas.    My only concern-and this is something that remains to be seen-is whether or not the charger will last.  As I mentioned, I've owned a few other Dustbusters over the years, and they all developed problems with the charger after about year old.  (this comes with a 2 yr unlimited warranty).  I noticed that B&D has switched to an integrated type of charger, as opposed to the old style that had a connecting pin which connected directly to the vacuum or the charging base.  That means if the charger does go bad, you can't replace it.  You basically have to purchase a whole new Dustbuster.  I'll post a follow-up within 6 months to let you know how things are going.  Other than that, a nice vacuum and wonderful addition to your home.
