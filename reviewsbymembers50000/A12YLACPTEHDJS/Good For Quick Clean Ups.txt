 A nice little hand-vac for quick, light messes, either wet or dry.  I thought I would give Hoover a shot after having gone through two Black and Decker Dustbusters that both quit after only a few months old.  This one has an unconditional one-year guarantee.  If it quits working or develops trouble, Hoover will refund or replace it, no questions asked.  The only drawback-and this is common with hand-vacs in general-is that it lacks the "oomph" for big messes.  That's why these little gadgets are best suited for only light-duty work such as picking up dustbunnies or spilled cereal.  Also, the charging base is quite different from the Dustbusters I've had, and I couldn't always tell whether or not the vacuum was seated properly on the charging bracket.  It would be handy to have some sort of light indicating that it is indeed charging and seated properly.  The filter is washable and re-usable and made of long-lasting material.  Everything cleans up nice and quick and the vac is lightweight and easy to use.  If you come across this one on sale, give it a try.  I'm fed up with having to replace my Dustbusters every 8 months, so I thought I would try this brand, and so far, so good.  My next option was to try a Dirt-Devil, but I've never had much luck with their vacuums so I passed it by.  Hoover is a well-known company that stands behind its products and they have a toll-free 1-800 number should you have any problems, or need to order replacement parts.  I think you'll be pleased.  Give it a try.
