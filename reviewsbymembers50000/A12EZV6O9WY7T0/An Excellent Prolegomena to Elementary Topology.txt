 I am trying to teach myself topology and find good elementary books in this subject rather slim in number. That is why I love this book. I can actually understand it.  Weeks' clear prose and entertaining style make thinking about space an enjoyable activity in itself.  I only wish a complete course could be written in this manner. Readers should not gain the impression that this even begins to scratch the surface of topology.  It is more like an entertaining survey to motivate one into delving further into this wonderful subject.   By the way, I was suprised to realize that cosmologists have been confusing curvature with omega all this time. If something so fundamental can be mistaken how many other things in physics might be clearer with a sound topologic training?
