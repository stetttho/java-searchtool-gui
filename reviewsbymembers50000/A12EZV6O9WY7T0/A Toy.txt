 Get serious, Handspring!  I bought a Visor Deluxe (green) when they first shipped.  I have had it for a year and tried to use it on rounds in my medical practice.  I found the construction flimsy and not rugged enough for the hospital environment.  Inevitably, one day it fell from my scrub pocket onto the floor.  Although the unit looked okay, the touch screen didn't work from that point on.  Tech support told me to return it for repair which I did.  For $80, I received a refurbished unit since apparently they recycle them.  I was a long time user of the HP200LX.  When the Visor came out thought I was "stepping up" to the new palm technology.  After experiencing the palm, I prefer my old HP.  The HP200LX by the way has NEVER let me down even after being dropped several times.  The HP200LX batteries also last about 3 months whereas the palm has only lasted about 20 days.  For serious business, I'll stick with the HP200LX.  If I want a toy, I'll pick up my Visor Deluxe.
