 Well, I can't believe I read the whole thing!  This lumbering behemoth of a novel is as addictive as junk food and just as satisfying. I congratulate Mr. Hamilton on synthesizing nearly every urban myth and legend in our demon haunted world into a witch's brew that is barely recognizable as contemporary civilization.  It is however ourselves in a distant mirror whether he meant it to be or not. Instead of ESP, we have "affinity," instead of satanism, we have the possessed, Quinn Dexter as vampire, etc.  Some tropes are literally present like ghosts and ghouls.  Then there is a mish-mash of contemporary physics, distorted from the pages of the New Scientist. Do we have a sci-fi "War and Peace" here?  By weight, certainly.  Mr. Hamilton excels at the short story which keeps this novel on track, episode after episode with a common theme. Whereas his tactics are good, he fails miserably with strategy.  The deus ex machina ending, for example, is predictably simple minded.  Overall one is left with no take home message, no noble revelations about existence, and one rollicking good entertainment.   Just like the possessed, I kept wishing this monster of Hamilton's would just die --  put out of its misery by some well meaning critic.  Alas, no Captain Calvert was forthcoming to save us from its possession.  Like a soul from the beyond, it just kept coming back, book after book, episode after episode, with no redeeming resolution except perhaps reveling in self-indulgence. Wave after wave of white fire scouring our eyeballs out. At the end, it left me empty and depressed.  Maybe faith is all we need in the end, we will just have to wait for the sequel.
