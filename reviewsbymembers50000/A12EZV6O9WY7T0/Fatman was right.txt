 Granted the book is exaggerated but I can find no book that catches the flavor of existential angst of internship as well as House of God does.  I go back to it (and the movie) like it is an old friend, the only one that truly understands what I go through daily as an attending physician.  Yes, folks, it doesn't get much better beyond internship!  There is a lot of denial amongst doctors which leads to alienation. Shem is probably one of the few who have given us the truth. Medicine is a hard path to take in life and much has changed since managed care took over.  I wish another Samuel Shem would come along to write a Revisited contemporary version of House of God in which the doctors are played by the patient's insurance representatives. They would go on daily rounds discussing how they can refuse every test, medication or procedure that their patient requests. In this revised House of God, the real doctors never see their patients because they have to spend all their time down in medical records filling out endless insurance forms and complying with federal regulations. Fatman would be very happy.
