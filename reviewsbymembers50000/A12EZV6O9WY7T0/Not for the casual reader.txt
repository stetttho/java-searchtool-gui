 This work is seminal.  Every philosophy after Hegel is either a reaction to him or a footnote.  His method has achieved scientific verification in the past century in the areas of developmental psychology (Margaret Mahler), in historicism, in embryological development, and theology (Tillich).  It shows that wisdom is timeless and although written 200 years ago, Hegel's truth is valid and not subject to fashions as they so often are in philosophy.  This said, I have to say it is not rewarding to read this book unless you have familiarity with German idealism through Kant.  Also, a thorough reading of Hegel's Logic is a prerequiste.  Few people will understand this book without reading it in the original German as Hegel himself reframes the German language into a new way of thinking. I think all great philosophies shape the language they speak in profound ways. That is why it is so difficult to understand Hegel in English translation.  You would have to create a whole new philosophy along Hegelian lines made for the English thinker. This is the daunting task of all translators. There obviously are concepts in Western thought that are portable across "platforms" and this is why translating Hegel happens at all in English.  However the way concepts are used, the "process" of the concepts -- the "syntagms" -- is not entirely the same in both languages. I wrote my master's thesis in philosophy on this work.  At that time I could think Hegelian with the best of them but have lost the skill.  Now I can't even understand what I wrote 20 years after the fact without going back to school.  I have not been speaking Hegelian since then. A pity.  So, to get the most out of it, read this book in a structured environment where one has easy access to help. It will change your life as it has mine.
