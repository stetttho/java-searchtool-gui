 I have not yet finished reading this book but my excitement over its brilliance forces me to comment.  This book is shear magic in its ability to explain very difficult and strange phenomena in an intuitive and simple way.  I have read the authors' book SpaceTime Physics as well as GR by Schutz and can do the tensors and all that; yet I am in awe of the ability these authors have of succeding at the near impossible. Using the study of black holes as the motivation for GR study is perfect. I love the choice of the variational principle to cut to the heart of the math. I recommend this book to anyone for self-study who has a smattering of calculus (not much is really needed).  I am looking forward to studying Kip Thorne's membrane paradign book next.  Gentlemen, kudos in the highest!
