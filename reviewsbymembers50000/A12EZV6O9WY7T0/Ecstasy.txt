 This is a wonderful collection of CDs. The early music includes plain song, male and female chant, and instrumental pieces. The package is gorgeous with Bizantine fresco art work on each jewel case. For those contemplating purchase, the group is composed of previous releases: Canticles of Estacy, Voice of Blood, O Jerusalem, Symphoniae, Ordo Virtutum, and Saints. These total $117.28 if you buy them individually so there is a real savings here. Those who are new to early music are in for a treat. This is music so old it is new, and as has been said, could be music of 900 years into the future. It is so other worldly, you are easily put into a meditative state. There is enough music here to fill your whole day with ecstasy.
