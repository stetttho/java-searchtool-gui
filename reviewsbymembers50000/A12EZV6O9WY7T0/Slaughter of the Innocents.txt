 I read FOG and AOS several years ago and the story haunts me even today such that I want to reread it (having given the two novels to a friend saying "You gotta read this!")   The thing that hooks me is Bear's moral dilemma of innocence playing in the hands of inscrutable forces beyond our comprehension.  In FOG, the innocent are the creatures of our planet -- not just human -- who die for no reason or maybe just because they exist.  Then in the tail end of AOS, we are given three races of creatures who were a product of the evil race's home planet.  In a very memorable scene, Bear lines up the shark like land walker, the stocky biped, and the triangle headed one we saw in FOG who are met by our protagonists.  In communicating with these sentient beings, the humans are appalled to see that these (to me lovable) creatures are completely innocent of any wrong doing executed by the evil race (who have become sort of gods who live in the planet and care for it).  So in the end the innocents are sacrificed again all to satisfy the unimplacable and unimpeachable Law.   I find AOS and FOG terrifying in that it speaks to the fact that it is always the innocent who suffer in war or ecological species extinction.  We should all read Bear and contemplate the innocents (plant and animal) who are being brought to the slaughter every day in our planet's ecology and in our lives.   I think that is what Bear wants us to comtemplate in my humble opinion.  That is what haunts me about these books.  Why do the innocent always suffer?  Who speaks for them?
