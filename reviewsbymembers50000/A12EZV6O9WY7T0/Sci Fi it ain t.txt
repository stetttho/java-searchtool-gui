 To be fair about this work:  The author is a bit like the one who wrote "Zen in the art of motorcycle whatever."  He is working out the grief of his brother's death noted in the preface and his process takes the form of social criticism, specifically the nature of utopia. It's a bit like B.F. Skinner's "novel" Walden Two which is about another utopia. I think the author is probably a brilliant man and should write an expository book on his new age ideas.  I am reading his sequel "Standing Waves" which is Part 2 of 2.  I hope he makes up for the spad work we had to go through in Part 1.  The only reason I read it is due to his ideas being interesting if not derivative.  But that is okay, nothing is original anyway. But trying to make this into sci fi entertainment was a mistake I'm afraid.  He would do better to SHOW us than TELL us his ideas in some form of ACTION! For pete sake!  The book has no plot that I can see, the characters are flat and unengaging and what little action there is is incredulously ignorred by these self-obsessed trust-victim academics who discuss The Great Books while their space habitat is about to be destroyed. When I was in philosophy grad school I learned it is better to talk through books than about them.  "Oh, would you like to have a mushy before the concert begins?  Oh, dear, don't mind the flotilla of space ships bearing down to kill us.  We'll get around to them by and by. Just sit back and enjoy the show." (sic)  Reading this book was like sitting through that god-aweful movie "My Dinner with Andre" that came out when the wealthy of this country were meditating on their navels while social unrest threatened to tear the U.S. apart.  Talk about alienation!  Mr. Hendrix you've got it bad. Sorry about your brother but try to write a story next time.  You will get more people to listen to your ideas if you entertain them -- intellectually -- like Voltaire.  Oh, there I go naming names again!
