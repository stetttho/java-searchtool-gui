 I'm sorry but my taste varies from the other reviews here.  I actually like Satie's pieces as little classical miniatures. That is why they are so charming. I do not like waiting several seconds for the next note and not being able to recognize which piece I'm listening to because it is hanging in the air like a zen koan. While I agree that Leeuw's avant garde interpretation brings out mystical qualities, they are of the same sort as listening to water drops from a faucet. I can meditate on that but would I want to?  I gave it 4 stars because what he does, he does very well in his own weird minimalist way. Would I buy the recording again if I had the choice? Not!
