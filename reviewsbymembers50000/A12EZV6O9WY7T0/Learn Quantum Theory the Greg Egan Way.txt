 Quarantine is a brilliant page turner.  I love the science fiction private-eye sub-genre but what surprised me was Mr. Egan's intuitive grasp of quantum theory.  I would recommend this book for the enjoyable story but also to anyone who is about to embark on learning quantum mechanics.  People who study it always complain that QM is all mathematics with very little intuitive grasp.  A few authors have quantum insight like Feynman but even he said that no one truly understands the quantum world (siding with Neils Bohr). Well, Egan manages to make the implicit manifest in the "normal" world for us.  At the same time he gave me a mystery that kept me guessing. A great read!  I am now primed to read all of his books especially his short stories.  Check out Greg's home page for a real treat!  Greg, you are brilliant!
