 Sorry Charlie, not this one.  The best track on this album is POWDER KEG.   All other songs seems cliched.  Like CD says in the ROOTS REMAIN boxed set,  "...it kinda got lost in the shuffle."  Best thing to do is to  buy the CD at the lowest price possible for the sake of listening to POWDER  KEG.
