 I am not going to say that this CD is bad or good because like a lot of  CDs, they kinda grow on you.  It is a mite too early to judge.  Like Eric  Clapton's From The Cradle CD, it was okay to begin with, but after  "five long years" this album is a classic.  I reckon this album  will be the same.  To you fans out there, don't be too quick to judge! You  have two legendary artists that knows their stuff.  Give it time and let it  become part of your life's soundtrack.
