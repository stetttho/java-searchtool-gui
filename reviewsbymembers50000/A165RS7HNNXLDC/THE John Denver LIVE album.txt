 From FAREWELL ANDROMEDA to THIS OLD GUITAR, every track was sung with love. The great rapport that John Denver has with his fans are SO great. Listening to that album is like sittin' by a campfire with many of your best friends. There are no faults with this CD. Well maybe just one. The bonus tracks has some songs that were already included in the show, but others than that, the CD is PERFECT. I especially loved BOY FROM THE COUNTRY. ROCKY MOUNTAIN HIGH took me well above the stratosphe. I loved that part when he sang the last verse ("Rocky Mountain High......Rocky Mountain Highhhhhhhhhh.....Rocky Mountain Highhhhhighhhhhhhhh...dooo dooo dooo!!") I first bought this album in LP format way back in 1975, shortly afterwards, I bought the cassette and in 1993, bought the CD(less two songs..grrrr!!!) When the expanded version came out, all hell broke loose. I think I bought the first one out of the shipping box at the music store. It's something I'll always treasure. One for the ages. AN EVENING WITH JOHN DENVER belongs up there with ALLMAN BROTHERS BAND LIVE AT FILLMORE EAST. Nuff said.
