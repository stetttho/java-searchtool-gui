 After every listen, I have to pinch myself, bang my head on a concrete  block, run into a wall and knock myself silly into believing that the music  was created by actual human beings, not perfected technology.  I cannot  find any fault with this album!!  The epic proportions are stupendous.  If  you want to go and buy a live album, the buck stops HERE.        If I had  to be quarantined for the next 100 years, THIS is the album I will take  with me.        I am a collector of their music and I have approximately 25  hours worth of ABB live (69-71 only) and can get a good idea what all other  concert performances by the ABB was like during that era, but they will  never match the legend of the 3/11 - 3/13/71 Fillmore Shows.  Please stop  me from yapping along, there's guys in white coats ready to take me  away........
