 Sleigh bells jing-a-ling, Jing, jing, jing-a-ling Everything's all right, What happy sight, Santa's ridin' ol' sleigh bells Jing-a-ling, Christmas seems to glow, Holly and mistletoe And the whitest kind of snow.... I was 7 years old when I got my first record player that Christmas and along with an album (vinyl) called Gene Autry - Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer.  Sleigh bells played on side 2 and after the first listening, the essence of Christmas was so clear. After many years of playing the LP every Christmas, it became so scratchy and worn.  You can hear the pops and crackles and it is just so gol-durn awful to listen to.  I never could bring myself to part with it.  I still have it after 40 years.  The record cover is pretty worn and the label in the middle of the vinyl is streaked with markers.  A reminder of my childhood.        Two years ago I was at a record store and I saw a CD titled Santa Claus Is Coming To Town and noticed that it had the song, Sleigh Bells!  I bought this CD and what did I listen to first? SLEIGH BELLS!!!  So clean and pristine.  Tears of joy welled in my eyes...      My mom and dad have been gone for several years now, so every Christmas, I pull out this CD and listen to Sleigh Bells and immediately all memories from life and Christmases past comes hurling back.  I'm not going to say anymore because I can't see what I'm typing....MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!
