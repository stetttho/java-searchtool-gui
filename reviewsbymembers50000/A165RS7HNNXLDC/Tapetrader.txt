 I have mixed feelings about this album, the reason being is because I have this show on tape.  It probably would be good for newbies who is just starting a tape collection.  Because I am an ABB fan, I am like the taxpayer, whether I like it or not, I pay my taxes, likewise for the CD.  Twenty years from now, this CD may grow on me, but for now, the FILLMORE EAST legendary shows remains supreme.  The earlier albums have class to them whereas this one seems hastily put together and put out on market to fulfill recording contract obligations.  Their last studio album was in 1994 when WHERE IT ALL BEGINS was released.  The ABB really needs to put out a new studio album soon; I can't see that happening anytime soon given the bad feelings the band members have.  I am stuck in a time warp and happily listening to the ABB when they were in their glory years.  If you are a bonafide tape trader, by all means, stick to tapetrading unless you are like me.
