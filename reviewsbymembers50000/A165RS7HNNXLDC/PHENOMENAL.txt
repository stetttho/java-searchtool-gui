 Amazing CD!  It's a must for every Delaney And Bonnie collector. It's a shame that "HOME" is no longer available on CD.  There is a RARE recording called GENESIS.  I understand that the songs are actually demos.  I have the LP.  To my knowledge, it is not available on commercial CD.  So much time has passed by that I think every recording should be released on CD.
