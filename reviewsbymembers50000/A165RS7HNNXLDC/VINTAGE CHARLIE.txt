 I have been a CDB fan for who knows how long. This album shows Charlie at his lean and basic best. For a first solo album, it is not a bad CD to listen to, though it gets a little embarrasing to listen to at times. Charlie sounds like he is trying so hard to make this album a success which is quite understandable. The best cut on this CD has to be "39 Miles From Mobile." If you listen to it in a vacuum, you could swear that it is part of the Fire On The Mountain song repitore.  The following album, "Te John Grease and Wolfman" fares a little better and it sounds like he is more comfortable with singing. The third album, "Honey In The Rock" is the definite icing on the cake, the definitive CDB. I have to admit that this album is better than Fire On The Mountain because the songs on Honey In The Rock was sung with all out soul. The fourth album, "Way Down Yonder" shows a marked maturity from his earlier album and it rocks! Why the HECK aren't "Te John Grease And Wolfman," "Honey In The Rock," and "Way Down Yonder" reissued on CD??? There's too many people out there that thought Charlie began his recording career in 1974, which is in fact, in 1970!!
