 The best studio album since Eat A Peach.  Still, the band is not the same without Dickey Betts, I agree; however, when you have TWO great lead AND SLIDE guitarists, in one band, you really can't complain!  Derek Trucks and Warren Haynes has their own style of playing, but does not stray far from the ABB sound. That's what's most important.  The highlight of this CD is "Instrumental Illness."  I could swear that it's a Dickey Betts composition!  Any artist that can write instrumentals in the ABB fashion has a permanent place in my book.  I'm looking forward to the live CD the ABB is releasing in March, 04.  What's next? There better be another studio album in '05!!
