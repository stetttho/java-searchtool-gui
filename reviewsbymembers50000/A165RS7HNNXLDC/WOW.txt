 Go into a studio and mix up guitars, bass, drums, vocal and ecetera and you will get fabricated music.  This CD is not fabricated, I repeat, NOT fabricated.  It's hard to believe that such perfection exists!  My discriminating ears have FAILED to find any fault with this CD.  To the newbie:  Don't start off with their first album nor their second!  Buy this CD FIRST, second, buy EAT A PEACH.  By then you'll be wired to buy EVERYTHING by this group.  Ohhh, what I would have given to be there!!  This is the BEST live album.  PERIOD.  NO BUTS!
