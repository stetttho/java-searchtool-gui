 Out of all the songs on this CD, King Curtis' WHAT ARE YOU DOING NEW YEAR'S EVE and THE CHRISTMAS SONG tops them all.  These instrumentals that takes me back to a simpler time where black is black and white is white. Listening to it makes my eyes misty and my throat choked up and feeling all giddy inside.  The King Curtis - Duane Allman combo captured the true meaning of devotion to their craft - making real beautiful music.  Getting this CD is worth it if you want to listen to those majestic songs!
