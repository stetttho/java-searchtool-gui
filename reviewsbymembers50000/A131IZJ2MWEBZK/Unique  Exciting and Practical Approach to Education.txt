 "Creating A Year-Long Theme: A Teacher's Journey" is a unique and exciting adventure into using a unified concept for an entire year of teaching.  Ms. Coyne, a teacher who developed and implemented her own theme-based teaching methods, provides valuable insights into using themes to improve education.  This book does not focus on the value of theme-based for education.

And, per Ms. Coyne, theme-based teaching unifies the classroom, engages students in learning and provides meaning to studying diverse topics.  "Creating A Year-Long Theme: A Teacher's Journey" focuses on providing plenty of suggestions and concrete guidance, including worksheets and step-by-step instructions, for implementing theme-based teaching.  Ms. Coyne's practical approach ensures that the theme is integrated across all subjects.
