 Call Me Gene is a nice primer on genetics - both in plants and in humans.  The book is very easy  to read and contains good exercises for children to practice their new-found knowledge.  Drs.  Bailey and Eskeland have  simplified this sometimes-exotic subject into terms that we all can   understand.  And the illustrations are simple but informative at the same  time.  The main subject  is the "gene" - DNA and how it provides  information for cells and how it replicates itself.  But  there are also  short segments at the end on cloning, genetic testing and its purposes,  forensic  medicine, and genetic engineering in plants.  This is a subject  that all children need to learn in  order to make wise decisions in the  coming years.  Segments of the book can be used for very  young children,  but in general the target is late elementary or middle school.  A  religious-based  alternative book is My Name is Gene by the same authors.
