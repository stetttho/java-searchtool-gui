 Individual schooling was once the norm with small one-room schools.  With increasing  population, group teaching was needed to keep pace with the growth.  Now, according to  Dr. Bennett, we need a leap forward in  education - use our new technology to return to  individualized teaching.  	 Computers as Tutors should be read by all educators and parents for  applicability to their  own  situation.  Why not try a pilot program - even  for just one subject like math - in your own  schools?  After reading Dr.  Bennett's research results, you will wonder why we have not  taken this  approach earlier.  - The Science Spiders Newsletter
