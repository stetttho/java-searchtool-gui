 "Casino Royale," which appeared in 1953, was Ian Fleming's first published novel.  It introduced readers to James Bond, a character who is now firmly ensconced as an icon in the popular imagination.  So how does it hold up now, 41 years later, after the character of Bond has been reduced to a self-regarding poseur in film after film?  Unfortunately, not that great, especially when compared with the stronger novels in the series. Here we have Fleming finding his voice, and also feeling out the character of Bond, who is not fully realized.  The brilliant descriptive gifts that Fleming shows later in the series (it is already more pronounced in the second novel, "Live and Let Die," published in 1954), the ability to bring characters to vivid life, to capture the tension of Bond's life as an agent--in other words, the techniques that a novelist acquires with practice--are seen here in rather primitive form.  The plot is disjointed, with the villain eliminated only two-thirds of the way into the book.  And the last third--well, it contains some writing that is downright embarrassing, especially compared with the talent Fleming shows in later works like "Doctor No" and the magnificent "You Only Live Twice."  Again, this is an apprentice novel. As for the character of Bond, he is most unappealing here.  He lacks the humor and personal likeability that Fleming gave him as the series progressed; here, he is a humorless, dour, arrogant man, and when Fleming injects the last chapters with bogus melodrama, it makes Bond even less interesting.   That is not to say that "Casino Royale" doesn't have its good points, but they are relatively small compared to its shortcomings.  This is worth reading for Bond fanatics only.
