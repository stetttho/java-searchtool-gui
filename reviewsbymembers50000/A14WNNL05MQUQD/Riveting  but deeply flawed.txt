 Norman Lebrecht's "The Maestro Myth" is one of the most unique and controversial books on classical music ever published.  In it, Lebrecht chronicles the lives, careers and conflicts of several important maestros (many notable conductors are left out) from Hans von Bulow to Sir Simon Rattle.  I can scarcely think of another book on classical music that is as unputdownable or consistently fascinating, yet I had some strong reservations after finishing "The Maestro Myth." Though the stories are invariably fascinating (with the exception of one excruciatingly dull chapter entitled "The Search for a Semi-Conductor"), there never seems to be an overall central idea or theme to "The Maestro Myth," despite its subtitle: "Great Conductors in Pursuit of Power."  Very often, Lebrecht's writing is simply a collection of unflattering or embarrassing facts about various well-known musical personalities.  Also, Lebrecht can be extremely inconsistent.  Sympathetic towards Hans von Bulow, he follows it with an inexplicably nasty attack on Bruno Walter (who is portrayed generously and kindly in Sir Georg Solti's memoirs--and Solti was not one who minced words) and then ends with ten pages of bizarre sycophantic raving for Simon Rattle.  In between, he compiles the usual litany of grievances against Toscanini and writes a hyperbolic and often blatantly dishonest thirty plus page attack on Herbert von Karajan.  There are other examples.  The bottom line is that Lebrecht often lets sensationalism interfere with fact.  That is the biggest drawback to "The Maestro Myth." That said, "The Maestro Myth" is well worth reading, indeed required reading, for anyone interested in the politics and tumultuous insider dealing involved in the 20th century conducting world.  Fascinating overall, "The Maestro Myth" needs to be read with a grain of salt.
