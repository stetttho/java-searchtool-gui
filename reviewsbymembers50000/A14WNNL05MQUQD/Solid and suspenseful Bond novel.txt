 Ian Fleming's fifth James Bond novel, "From Russia, With Love" (1957), remains one of the most popular and exciting in the series.  Here we see all the attributes that made Fleming such a remarkable thriller writer--the brilliant descriptive passages, the superb characterization, the ability to inject tension and suspense into the narrative until the inevitable explosion of violence.  "From Russia, With Love" has it all, and then some. The plot is among Fleming's most ingenious.  SMERSH, the Soviets' dreaded counterintelligence agency, hatches to a plot to kill Bond and humiliate the British Secret Service.  Using an unwitting girl and a valuable piece of Russian hardware, the Russians lure Bond to Istanbul, setting the plot in motion.  Along the way, we meet the grotesque Rosa Klebb, head of torture and murder for SMERSH, and Red Grant, SMERSH's chief executioner.  Grant, in particular, is a chilling character, a bloodthirsty psychopath with a lust for killing.  When Bond crosses his path, Fleming produces some of the most gripping writing of his career.  Fantastic stuff. All in all, "From Russia, With Love" is a superb thriller, though I found the narrative rather slack during Bond's time in Istanbul.  That minor quibble aside, this is a must-read for Bond fans and one of Fleming's finer accomplishments.
