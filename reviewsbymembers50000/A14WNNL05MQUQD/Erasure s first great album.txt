 Erasure, the English synth-pop duo of Vince Clarke (ex-Depeche Mode and  Yaz) and newcomer Andy Bell, debuted in 1986 with "Wonderland,"  an enjoyable, though spotty, collection of simple, danceable pop songs.   With "Wonderland," despite many brilliant highlights, Erasure was  still finding its voice and the Clarke-Bell songwriting team was still in  its earliest stages (Bell's only contribution to "Oh L'amour" was  the title and a couple of the album's other songs were written entirely by  Clarke).  But by "The Circus," the partnership had solidified and  Erasure's forte was clear: writing melodic, hook-laden pop songs devoid of  the angst or gloom so characteristic of other '80s synth-pop bands.  On  "The Circus," everything clicked, and the songwriting was among  their most consistent.  "Hideaway," "Don't Dance,"  "Victim of Love," "The Circus," "It Doesn't Have  to Be" and (of course) "Sometimes"--where is there another  album released in the '80s so full of intelligent, finely crafted,  brilliantly arranged pop songs?  I can't think of one.  Alas, the boys  would follow up with 1988's dreadfully inconsistent "The  Innocents" and 1989's OK "Wild!" before going on to make  their finest records in the '90s.  But if you want an early Erasure album  that sounds like a greatest hits collection, buy "The Circus."
