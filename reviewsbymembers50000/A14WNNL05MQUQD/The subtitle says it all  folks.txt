 Ah, the GOP.  Masters of lying and dirty campaigning.  Puppets of big business.  Enemies of the US Constitution and the middle and lower classes.  Evangelicals with a murderous, quasi-fascist theocratic agenda.  Draftdodging chickenhawks who like to slaughter our soldiers for Halliburton.  Stealers of elections.  Infantile, sanctimonious pseudo-patriots. What's not to love about these guys?  Today we live in a one-party state, enmeshed in deceit, treason, and cronyism, and their lies and scheming get worse by the hour. This book makes for an invigorating reminder of the disaster that is the Republican Party, and also the disaster that is "President" George W. Bush.  Everyone should read it and keep it in mind this November, when the Democrats will prevail--despite the best efforts of the Republicans  to steal the election.
