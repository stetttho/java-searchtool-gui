 Despite the inclusion of a couple of overlong, pedestrian ballads ("Ribbon in the Sky" and the abominable "Superwoman"), this is one of the finest hits collections ever assembled by any artist.   Three of Stevie's four new songs ("That Girl," "Do I  Do" and the searing "Front Line") are first rate, while the  fourth (the aforementioned "Ribbon") is one of those sugary,  saccharine Stevie ballads that everyone but his most devoted fans can't  abide.  However, from "Living for the City" to "Master  Blaster (Jammin')," these are some of the most innovative, original,  fully realized pop/soul songs ever recorded.  I cannot recommend this  collection highly enough.
