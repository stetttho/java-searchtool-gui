 If you are going to buy one Roger Waters CD, let this be the one. Waters' most ambitious, focused, fully-realized solo CD is also one of the best albums of the '90s, but it is not for the faint of heart. Waters' views on modern life, war and commerce are well-known, but his vitriol and contempt were never more concisely articulated than here. This work rivals "The Wall" as Waters' best-ever work, and, unlike "Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking" or "Radio KAOS," this album even has something missing on Waters' other solo albums: melody. Wit, lyrical black humor and some dazzling free-form guitar work courtesy of Jeff Beck--this is, quite simply, a must-have.
