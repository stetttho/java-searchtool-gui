 The orchestrations are dull; the melodies limp. Schonberg seems, with each successive show, to have a harder time coming up with the compelling, romantic melodies he's known for. With "Martin Guerre," he's pretty much out of ideas. But, most embarrassing of all, who ever told Alain Boublil that he has what it takes to write lyrics in English? The lyrics in "Miss Saigon" were truly stupid (how many words can you rhyme with "ass"?), but the "Martin Guerre" lyrics are just as bad--the lyrics in "Martin Guerre" are obviously not the work of someone for whom English is his first language. Perhaps they should bring back Herbert Kretzmer as their lyricist in the future. And take a little time off so Claude-Michel can come up with some good melodies this time, instead of the pseudo-Lloyd Webber of "Martin Guerre."
