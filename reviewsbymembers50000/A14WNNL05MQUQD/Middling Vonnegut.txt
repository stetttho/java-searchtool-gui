 "Timequake" is, its author claims, the last "novel" he will write. If so, it's a respectable way to end his literary career. Not really a novel, "Timequake" is something of a memoir/social commentary mixed with short bits of fiction featuring everyone's favorite homeless SF writer, Kilgore Trout. Vonnegut looks back on his life, marriages, family and friends and the state of our modern world while using Trout to illustrate the incredible stupidity and self-destructive tendencies of mankind at large.  Many of the stories are touching, as are the episodes featuring Trout. Several parts are laugh-out-loud funny. Vonnegut takes his by now familiar shots at greed, war, ecological destruction and meanspiritedness. There is a definite air of sadness that hangs over this book, but one has to admire the high polish and craftsmanship of Vonnegut's prose. He will be missed. Overall, "Timequake" is a quick, witty, satisfying read, though no "Slaughterhouse-Five" or "Sirens of Titan."
