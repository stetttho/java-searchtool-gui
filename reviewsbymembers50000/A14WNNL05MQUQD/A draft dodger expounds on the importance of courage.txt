 Dr. William J. Bennett, Ph.D., J.D., professional scold, hypocrite, pathological overeater, and one of the nation's most renowned high-roller gamblers, has once again graciously pried himself away from his Fox News appearances and all-nighters at Atlantic City casinos to lecture the American public on its duplicity, cowardice, and lack of restraint.  And boy, should we be grateful! "Why We Fight" is the latest missive from this intellectual titan and paragon of virtue, and in it, Dr. Bennett, who (like so many saber-rattling superhawk Republicans) managed to skip out on service in Vietnam to go to grad school instead, reminds us of our greatness as a nation and of our pristine innocence as a player on the international stage.  He encourages resolve, toughness, and fanatical devotion to President Bush's agenda.   I, for one, am glad that the good doctor was able to put down his fork and wrap his sausage-like fingers around a pen for a change, because "Why We Fight" is just the sort of message we non-millionaire Americans need.  This is two-hundred pages of absolutely crystal-clear moral clarity.  In fact, morality doesn't get any clearer than this.   I highly recommend "Why We Fight" because, after all, who is more qualified to lecture others on fulfilling their patriotic duty than a draft dodger?
