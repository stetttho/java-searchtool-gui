 Virgil Thomson once described a recital of Wanda Landowska playing Bach on the harpsichord as being "as stimulating as a needle shower."  Well, the same applies to another female master of the harpsichord,  Blandine Verlet, who here performs Bach's "Partitas," among the  most intricate, demanding works ever composed for the keyboard, with a  mixture of white-knuckled control and breathtaking expression heard only in  the performances of people who are in absolute control of their  instruments, on every level.  And Verlet is indeed, since the death of  Landowska, sans peer as an interpreter of Bach on the harpsichord.  This is  music of surpassing sublimity, performed with grace, wit (yes, wit),  passion and even restraint by a truly astounding musician.  Bach performed  to perfection--could there be a better reason to buy this CD?
