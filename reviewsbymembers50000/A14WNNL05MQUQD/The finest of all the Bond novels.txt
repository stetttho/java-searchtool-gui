 "You Only Live Twice" (1964) was published the year of Ian Fleming's death, and, as with its predecessor, the superb "On Her Majesty's Secret Service," it is suffused with doom and death.  It is unlike any of the other Bond books, with a pervasive gloominess that was as much the result of Fleming's rapidly declining health and unhappiness with the world around him as it was the result of Bond's clinical depression after the tragedy that finished the last book. Bond, recovering from the death of his wife, is falling to pieces.  Taking the advice of a friend, M sends him on a vital mission to Japan, which he hopes will restore Bond's spirits.  What seems at first to be a rather placid visit soons turns dangerous as Bond agrees to accept secrets about the Russians in exchange for carrying out a delicate mission for the Japanese government.  What he encounters is the culmination of the previous two Bond novels, and the last half of the novel is virtually unputdownable. This is the best writing of Fleming's career, and his descriptions of Bond's disintegration are surprisingly moving.  The final hundred pages or so are horrifying and gripping; never before had Fleming demonstrated such mastery of his craft or technical skill at setting up a denouement.  The tension becomes almost unbearable. "You Only Live Twice" is not an uplifting book, but it is a vital book in the Bond series, and much better than its successor, the pale and posthumously published "Man With the Golden Gun."  Those expecting slam-bang action will have to wait until the middle and final chapters, but the rewards are worth the patience.  This is a fine novel, but I wouldn't start here if I were just discovering Fleming's Bond novels.
