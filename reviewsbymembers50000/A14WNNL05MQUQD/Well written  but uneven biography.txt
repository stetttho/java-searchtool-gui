 I've always wondered why people would bother to spend considerable amounts of time and energy researching, interviewing, compiling facts and writing biographies of people they obviously intensely dislike.  Marion Meade's disdain for Woody Allen is almost palpable on every page of this book.  Basically, she presents Allen as a contemptible, meanspirited, self-absorbed, self-loathing misanthrope capable of teutonic cruelty and with nary a redeeming quality.  So the question is: why bother?  Sure, her subject is full of flaws (big surprise) and probably won't be publishing a guide to successful relationships anytime soon, but he does deserve better than this.  That said, this book isn't your usual Kitty Kelley trash.  It is meticulously researched and gracefully written, at times insightful and illuminating and extensively annotated.  The author has done her homework and written this book with considerable effort and care.  However, I couldn't get over the fact that she seems to more or less hate Woody Allen, even while describing the factors in his childhood and background that might have led to the behavior she condemns.  This is, however, the best of all the Woody Allen biographies (the others were poorly researched or simply sycophantic), and worth reading, if one reads with an open mind.
