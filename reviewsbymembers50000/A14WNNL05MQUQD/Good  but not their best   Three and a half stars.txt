 "Very" was a departure for the Pet Shop Boys.  After the mournful, melancholic "Behavior," "Very" shows their  more playful, lighthearted side.  It has been acclaimed as a pop  masterpiece since it was released, and Rolling Stone deemed it  one of the  essential releases of the '90s.  I have to disagree, but only a little.   "Very" is a good record, with several witty, intelligent,  brilliant songs--but, for me at least, something's missing.  The first five  tracks are absolutely fantastic, some of Tennant and Lowe's finest work,  but the sixth, "Yesterday When I Was Mad," leaves me cold, and  from then on, with the exception of "The Theatre," the record  never rises above pretty good for me.  "One and One Make Five"  has a nice house groove and the hi-NRG "One in a Million" is  fairly exciting, but "Very" lacks the end-to-end first rate  material of "Behavior" or "Bilingual" or  "Nightlife."  I've never liked "Young Offender" or even  the Village People cover, "Go West."  What is good on  "Very" is among the Pets' very best, but there are some stylistic  throwaways here that are less than compelling.  "Very" is still a  fine album, and let's face it: Pet Shop Boys on a bad day are vastly better  than most bands on their best day.  For me, the follow up to  "Very," "Bilingual," was the Pet Shop Boys' finest  hour.  You can order it at Amazon.co.uk, because for some reason it isn't  available here.
