 Like most pipe smokers, I have a passion for pipe history, trivia, and tobacciana.  Our hobby can become consuming, and this aspect of pipe smoking is evident in Jeffers' "The Perfect Pipe."  Trivia and anecdotes abound.  Unfortunately, so do recycled facts about pipe making and the inevitable list of famous pipe smokers.  All in all, this is a solid introduction to the hobby.  But do we really need yet another chapter on how briar pipes are made?  Or another witty quote on smoking from Mark Twain?  I don't think so.  I would have liked more information about various tobaccos (a history of, say, My Mixture 965 or Prince Albert would have been welcome), or perhaps about the tobaccos of choice of these famous smokers.  Alas, I get another chapter on how to pack a pipe.  For beginning smokers, this book is a fine introduction.  For more seasoned and experienced devotees, Richard Carleton Hacker's books on the subject offer more stimulating reading.  "A pipe in the hand proves that there has been no mistake--you are undoubtedly a man." -- A.A. Milne.  That pretty much sums it up.
