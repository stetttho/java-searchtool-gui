 Karl Bohm (1894-1981) was one of the 20th century's outstanding operatic and orchestral conductors.  His repetoire consisted mostly of German music, from Mozart to Berg.  Bohm headed the Vienna State Opera on two occasions and was one of the most sought-after guest conductors alive during the last 26 years of his life.   In this fascinating documentary/performance of Bohm conducting Beethoven's 7th Symphony, several aspects deserve mention.  One is Bohm's rhythmic precision, as the slightest deviation from his inner sense of time causes him to correct the orchestra (often with a certain tactlessness).  Also remarkable is Bohm's supple, fluid conducting style, and the way he molds the orchestra to emit the sound he hears in his head.  Finally, there is Bohm's personal interaction with the orchestra.  Bohm was not a Toscanini-esque screamer, or a tyrant of the Fritz Reiner/George Szell mold.  It is obvious, however, that the orchestra is intimidated by Bohm.  From the moment Bohm swaggers nonchalantly to the podium, his attitude towards the orchestra is one of superiority and dominance.  Watch the maestro as he singles out an unseen player immediately after beginning the rehearsal, staring him down and pointing him out with a stern finger.  Watch Bohm, in his insinuating, purposefully provocative way, make the pricipal flute play his part over and over again in front of the entire orchestra (not to mention the cameras).   The video consists of the rehearsal for the first movement, then a full peformance of the entire symphony.  The performance is extraordinary in every respect, as one would expect of Karl Bohm.  The camera work is superb and there is interesting commentary on the history of the 7th symphony as well.  This is an excellent film for those interested in great music and great musicians.
