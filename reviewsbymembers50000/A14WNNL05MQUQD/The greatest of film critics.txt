 Stanley Kauffmann was born in 1916 and worked at various jobs (actor, director, novelist) before sending in an unsolicited review to The New Republic in 1958.  They accepted it, and soon Kauffmann was TNR's full-time film critic.  Except for short stints as drama critic for The New York Times and as a book reviewer for TNR (during which Pauline Kael served as the magazine's film critic), Kauffmann has retained his position ever since.  Today, at nearly 86-years-old, Kauffmann continues to write literate, penetrating, lucid essays for TNR.  He is, quite simply, the greatest critic the world of cinema has produced to date. "A World on Film" was Kauffmann's first collection of film criticism.  Consisting of reviews and essays written between 1958 and 1965, it amply demonstrates the insight, passion and probity of Kauffmann's approach to film.  It also displays his extraordinary talents as a writer.  Each review is a finely-crafted work in itself.  While Pauline Kael tended to ramble (and ramble) in her reviews, departing far from the subject at hand in order to write about herself, Kauffmann is focused and concise, saying in a few words what most critics say in several paragraphs.  His assessments are fair and evenhanded; Roger Ebert once aptly described Kauffmann as the "sanest of critics."   In short, "A World on Film" is a fine introduction to Kauffmann, film criticism and cinema circa 1958-1965.  It also makes for very pleasurable reading in itself.
