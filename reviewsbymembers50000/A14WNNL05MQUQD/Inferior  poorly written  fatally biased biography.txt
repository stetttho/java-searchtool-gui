 While I sympathize with many of Karl Evanzz's conclusions about Elijah Muhammad, I find this biography both unprofessional and beneath something even Kitty Kelley would write. Regardless of your feelings about either Muhammad or the NOI, he's worth a well-written, honest, balanced biography, but this isn't it. That book is "An Original Man: The Life and Times of Elijah Muhammad" by Claude Andrew Clegg III--well-written, well-researched, intelligent, honest and balanced. First-rate, unlike "The Messenger." Check it out.
