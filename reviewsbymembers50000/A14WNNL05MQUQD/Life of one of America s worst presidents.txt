 George Bush was a paradox.  Prep school- and Ivy League-educated son of an aristocratic, rich Connecticut US Senator, he transplanted himself to Texas  and (with a resounding lack of success) tried to re-invent himself as an  old-school Texan.  He lost two consecutive attempts to become a US Senator  himself, and would have been a completely forgotten political wannabe had  it not been for the charitable help of Presidents Nixon and Ford, who  appointed the "wimp" to some key positions, which obviously made  Bush think he was competent enough to become president, because he then ran  in 1980.  After being destroyed by Reagan in the primaries (and denouncing  Reaganomics as "voodoo"), he then received some more remarkable  charity when Reagan picked him for his running mate.  After eight years as  Vice President, Bush finally won the presidency (although he never would  have won if he hadn't have been Reagan veep) and soon proved as incompetent  at that job as Dan Quayle at a spelling bee.  In short, Bush was a  politically unsuccessful, rich New Englander who happened to have been  picked for the right jobs by a couple of America's other worst presidents,  and was then able to become President himself.  An uninspiring, dull story  and an OK book at best.
