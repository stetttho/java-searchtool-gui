 "Moonraker" (1955) was the third of Ian Fleming's James Bond novels, and it is a good example of Fleming in fine form.  A solid, suspenseful plot; an evil, over-the-top villain; M puffing away impatiently on his pipe; and Bond, ready for action and maybe a little love.   Sir Hugo Drax is a national hero in Britain, and is donating millions of his own pounds to create the Moonraker rocket, which can hit any city in Europe and, therefore, protect England from invasion by any enemy.  But when M discovers that Drax cheats at cards, a plot is set into motion that will eventually lead to Bond uncovering the tycoon's true designs.   This is a perfectly respectable entry in the series, but does not attain the heights of, say, "Casino Royale" or "You Only Live Twice."  There is less action than one might expect, and the suspense sometimes sags.  But still, this is a solid thriller and I recommend it to anyone interested in the original Bond novels.
