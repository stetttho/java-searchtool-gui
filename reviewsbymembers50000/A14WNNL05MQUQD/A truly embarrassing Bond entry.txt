 "Tomorrow Never Dies" is the absolute lowpoint of the Bond series.  A moronic "plot," half-baked action sequences and characters that serve no purpose, this is vastly worse than even "A  View to a Kill," "Moonraker" or "Man With the Golden  Gun."  This film should never have been made.  Brosnan is the weakest  of the Bonds, and his entire point in making these movies seems to be  having an opportunity to strike poses for two hours.  The sets and  direction of this movie make it seem like it isn't even taking place on  Earth; there should be at least SOME semblence of reality, even in a James  Bond movie.  However, there is none here.  A waste.
