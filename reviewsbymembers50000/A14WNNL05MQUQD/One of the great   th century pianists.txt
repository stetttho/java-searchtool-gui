 This is a superb collection from a man who was, by any measure, one of the supreme keyboard artists of the 20th century (and whose life was criminally shortened by medical malpractice at a Moscow hospital).  Gilels' versatility is evident, and his rich tone, elegant phrasing and thundering virtuosity are undeniable.   That said, I would like to take issue with a few of the previous reviewer's statements.  First, to say that Gilels didn't tour much "during the Soviet years" (the only years he was alive; when else would he have toured?) is patently false.  Gilels was one the best-travelled performers of his time.  Second, to say that he was not a typical "Russian" pianist is an extraordinary statement.  Gilels was trained by Heinrich Neuhaus (that most Russian of teachers) and was criticized when he made his 1955 New York debut for a lack of subtlety (which he was to remedy within a few years) that was widely attributed to his narrow, exclusively Russian training.  Finally, to say that Gilels made few recordings is ridiculous.  The man's repertory was huge (from Bach and Scarlatti to Shostakovich and Prokofiev) and he left a recorded legacy that few pianists can rival.   Hopefully in the future, reviewers will do a little homework before making ignorant statements.
