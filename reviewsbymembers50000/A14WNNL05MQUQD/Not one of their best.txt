 Erasure followed up the megasuccessful "The Circus" with 1988's "The Innocents."  While the album was even more successful than its predecessor, spawning three monster singles and going to #1 on the British charts (not to mention being a respectable hit stateside), it showed that Erasure couldn't put out an album every year and maintain a high level of songwriting consistency.  While "The Innocents" has some undeniable classics ("A Little Respect," "Ship of Fools," "Chains of Love" and "Weight of the World" in particular), the rest of album ranges from good to filler.  The real star of "The Innocents" is the arranging talents of Vince Clarke.  Stephen Hague's shallow production makes this album seem extremely dated today, but on certain songs, it works perfectly.  All in all, a mixed bag.   Luckily, after 1989's "Wild!" (which, though not perfect, is a much better album than "The Innocents"), Clarke and Bell started a winning streak with 1991's "Chorus."  Since then, they have yet to release an album that is less than great.  Like fine wine, Erasure gets better with age.
