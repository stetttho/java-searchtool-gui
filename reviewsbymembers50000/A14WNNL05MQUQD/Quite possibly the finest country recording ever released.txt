 From 1972 to 1982, George Jones, while enduring several highly public  personal troubles, recorded a group of songs that rank among the very  finest country recordings ever made.  Several of these songs are included  on "Anniversary," which has been acclaimed as a masterful  compilation since its release.  All the sadness, frustration, loneliness  and longing that are hallmarks of George Jones' artistry are captured here,  during the time he lost Tammy and went through life in an alcoholic haze.   This is art imitating life at its most devastating, and proof (if any was  needed) that George Jones is, hands down, the greatest country singer who  ever walked the earth.  This is true country, not the fake, manufactured  product that calls itself "country" these days.  This is also The  Possum's finest single album, though he made several fine LPs during this  same era (most notably "Alone Again").
