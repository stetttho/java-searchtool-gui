 Do you hate gays?  Are you a religious zealot?  Do you worship Ronald Reagan?  Do you you lie awake at night, wishing Bill Clinton would die a  horrible, painful death?  Do you think Spiro Agnew "got the  shaft"?  Are you racist?  Sexist?  A Fascist?  Love the military but  never took the time to actually join it?  Then read "Right From the  Beginning," by the "Thinking Man's David Duke," Pat  Buchanan!  It's a must read for all of America's "Angry White  Men"!
