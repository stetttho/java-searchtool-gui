 Dr. Gray Sweeney, professor of art history at Arizona State University, is a widely acclaimed expert on 19th and 20th century American art. "Masterpieces of American Art" is probably his best-known work, and is a fascinating, enlightening and engrossing introduction to the subject. With numerous large reproductions of the paintings and well-written essays on the historical, artistic and biographical contexts of the works and their creators, this book is a worthwhile addition to any library.
