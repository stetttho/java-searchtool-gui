 Rick Wright, Pink Floyd's keyboardist and (many forget) co-writer of some of their best-known songs, makes his solo debut here on "Wet Dream," a laid back, melodic, atmospheric jazz-inflected pop record.   This album not only offers a very pleasurable listening experience (while  breaking no ground musically), but also offers insight into something too  often overlooked by Floyd fans: Wright's importance as a composer/musician  in creating the classic Floyd sound of "Dark Side" and "Wish  You Were Here."  One only has to listen to the later Floyd records on  which Wright had little or no involvement ("The Wall" and  "The Final Cut") to see how different their music sounded.  And  while there was fine stuff on both "The Wall" and "The Final  Cut," most Floyd fans would agree that their peak in creativity was  between '73 and '75--the years when Rick Wright was a key player in forming  the Pink Floyd sound.  I recommend this album highly as a must-have for  Floyd fans and as an accomplished musical statement in itself.
