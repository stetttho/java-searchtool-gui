 Pet Shop Boys finished the decade how they began it: with a brilliant,  emotive collection of songs that serve to remind listeners that these are  two of the finest pop craftsmen to come along in quite a while.  What has  kept the Pet Shop Boys relevant long after they were consistently scoring  hits on the charts is the fact that they continue to write witty, poignant,  melodic pop songs, regardless of their commercial viability.   "Nightlife" is no exception.  Lyricist/vocalist Neil Tennant  compared "Nightlife" to the old Frank Sinatra albums like  "In the Wee Small Hours," and there is an uncertain, unsettling  emotional undercurrent to these songs, almost all of which concern  themselves with unrequited love, discontent, confusion and desire.   Keyboardist/programmer Chris Lowe matches his partner's lyrical concerns  with a restrained, elegant musicality that covers everything from the  piano-based balladry of "The Only One" and the housey rush of  "Closer to Heaven" to the touching, Asian-inflected  "Footsteps" and the Village People-styled "New York City  Boy."  If one doubts that intelligent, finely crafted pop music is  still being produced in this era of boy bands and busty teeny boppers,  "Nightlife" offers a resoundingly positive answer.
