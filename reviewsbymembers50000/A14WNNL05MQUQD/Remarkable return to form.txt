 After 1995's expansive, experimental "Erasure" album, and its  subsequent poor sales and decidedly mixed reception (even among fans),  Erasure returned to their roots on 1997's "Cowboy."  The emphasis  here is on hooks, melodies and catchy arrangements (Andy Bell said  "Cowboy" is "ultrapop")--nothing deep, nothing  innovative.  And it works perfectly.  With Vince Clarke's melodic gifts  still in fine form and Andy Bell's voice as clear and pristine as ever (in  addition to his romantic, occasionally awkward lyrics), "Cowboy"  is the fourth straight near-perfect pop album from Erasure.  Some bands  fade creatively as the years go by--Erasure continues to improve.  From the  crashing, shimmering opening chords of "Rain" to the last emotive  note of "Love Affair," this is one of music's finest songwriting  collaborations doing what they do best: writing classic pop songs without  angst or apologies.  If you're new to Erasure, "Cowboy" is the  perfect place to start.  If you're an Erasure fan already, it will remind  you of why you fell in love with their music in the first place.  Either  way, buy "Cowboy"--you won't regret it.
