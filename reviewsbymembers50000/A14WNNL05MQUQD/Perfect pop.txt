 When Erasure released "Chorus" in 1991, they were the number one band in the UK and one of the most successful synth pop groups of the era.  Having already scored 15 hits on the British charts and topped the LP charts three times (twice with "The Innocents" alone), they began the Nineties from a position of considerable commercial strength.  An ominous wind was in the air, however, as Nirvana and the grunge movement exploded out of Seattle just as "Chorus" rose to its inevitable #1 position.  Erasure would survive the early grunge years, releasing several more hits and topping the LP charts twice more before the arrival of Oasis and the guitar-based Britpop movement stalled their career with the release of their eponymously titled "Erasure" album in 1995.  "Chorus" was something of a departure for the duo.  Following 1989's hugely successful "Wild!" (and its rather notorious world tour), the band took two years off, writing ten of their finest songs.  "Chorus" was a synth-lover's delight; a pure analog aural feast for the ears.  Vince Clarke's arrangements are more subtle and assured, as are his partner's vocals.  Andy Bell's lyrics are among the finest of his career, and there is nothing on "Chorus" short of superb.  Not since "The Circus" had the band released such a consistent set.  "Chorus" proved them to be more than a bouncy, campy singles band: they were pop craftsmen of the first order.  Here was a darker, more introspective album than any of their previous releases, and they would maintain this more thoughtful stance until the release of 1997's nostalgic (but magnificent) "Cowboy."   In short, "Chorus" is one the best pop albums of the 1990s and ranks among Erasure's finest work.
