 Synthesizers.  Blipping computer sounds.  Hi-NRG beats.  Campy arrangements.  Extravagant live shows.  Erasure is truly a band like no other, and their enormous (though now waning) popularity over the last 15 years is one of the more remarkable (and unlikely) triumphs of popular music.  But beyond all the outrageousness and eccentricity, what accounts for their enduring success?  The answer is, quite simply, astonishing pop songwriting. Since his days with Depeche Mode and Yazoo, Vince Clarke has established himself as one of the finest pure-pop craftsmen on the planet.  Andy Bell is a diva of the first order, a superb vocal melodist and, at his best, an excellent lyricist.  The matching of Bell's brilliant vocals and unusual sexual persona with Clarke's absolutely unbeatable talents with the pop hook has produced some of the most consistent, memorable and finely-wrought songs of our time.   "I Say I Say I Say" was Erasure's last hugely successful LP.  Released in 1994 after a three year break, "I Say" returns Erasure, after a greatest hits collection and an EP of ABBA covers, to what they do better than virtually anyone else: the writing of melodic, catchy pop songs.  "I Say" is one the finest albums of their career, without a single weak song in the set and several of the best ("Take Me Back," "I Love Saturday," "Man in the Moon," "Always" and "Blues Away" in particular) of their career.  Martyn Ware's production sometimes sounds like the soundtrack to a mid-90s video game, but accentuates Vince's sublime arrangements.  A truly unusual sounding album. Though their career would suddenly (and rather inexplicably) begin to stall with the following year's release of the eponymously titled "Erasure" (unquestionably their masterpiece and one of the supreme pop albums in history), "I Say" is Erasure at their very best and proves that great pop music is timeless.
