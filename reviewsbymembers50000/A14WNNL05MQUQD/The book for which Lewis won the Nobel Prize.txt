 "Babbitt," published in 1922, was the second straight publishing phenomenon for Sinclair Lewis, who had become a household name in 1920 with "Main Street."  By 1930, Lewis had published three more notable novels ("Arrowsmith," "Elmer Gantry," and "Dodsworth"), declined the Pulitzer Prize in a fit of pique, and finally became the first American to win the Nobel Prize for Literature.  The 1920s were his prime years, and none of his novels was more renowned than "Babbitt," which merited special recognition from the Swedish Academy when Lewis won the Nobel Prize. So what is one to make of this novel now?  It can be dreadfully dull, and could (indeed should) have been cut in half.  It wanders around in search of a plot, and though many of its insights can be funny, overall one has to marvel at how genteel the literature of 1920s was in order to make this book a national sensation.   Basically, it is the story of George F. Babbitt, a solidly Republican, supremely self-satisfied, deeply stupid real estate man, who has a sort of midlife crisis in the course of the novel before returning desperately to his earlier state of censorious complacency by the last chapters.  Lewis designed him to be an exemplar of his class, and many thought he was.  The term "Babbitt" became a popular way of referring to chubby, materialistic businessmen.  And then, by the 1940s, the novel had largely faded into oblivion, except in college classes or high school reading lists. Why?  Quite simply, because it's not a particularly good novel.  It is a reasonably well-written slice of satirical social commentary, and little more.  Today, it is merely a cultural relic from the twenties, kind of like the abominably bad "Great Gatsby," which dilettantes rave over as if it were actually a good novel.  It isn't, and neither is "Babbitt."  But for those interested in how America saw itself just before the Great Depression, books like these might be informative.
