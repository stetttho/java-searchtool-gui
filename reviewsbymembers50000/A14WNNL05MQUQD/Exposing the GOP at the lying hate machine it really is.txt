 Al Franken must be commended for his ambition.  To write a book about the lies of the Republican Party would be a multi-volume task, but Al has done a remarkable job of limning the blatant and exuberant dishonesty of the Right in a mere 300-plus pages.   The simple facts are that the Right in America is determined to undermine our freedoms, strip away civil rights, destroy Social Security and Medicare, and institute an all-white evangelical Christian theocracy.  They seek to silence dissent and use the tactic of lying on a Goebbels-like scale to undermine those who don't toe the party line.  Their true religion is fascism and they are defenders of the faith.   The constant and relentless telling of lies is the heart of their strategy.  When one has no genuine credibility, lies are the only recourse.  Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, Bernard Goldberg, Andrew Sullivan, Robert Novak, Tucker Carlson--all the Propaganda Ministers of the Bush regime are professional liars who are fanatically devoted to The Cause.  The depths of their duplicity and immorality are carefully examined in "Lies," and it's a truly enlightening experience to understand the agenda of our conservative media. This is one of the most important books of our time, as we face an incredibly important election this year.  In 2004, we will decide whether democracy in America is worth keeping, or whether the cowardly millionaire draft-dodgers who are slaughtering American soldiers for their own corporate gain will continue to lead us down the road to serfdom.  Read Al Franken's "Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them" and make the right choice.
