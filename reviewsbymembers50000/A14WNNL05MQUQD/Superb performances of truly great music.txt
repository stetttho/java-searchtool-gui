 Johann Strauss II is that most rare of composers--a writer whose works gain rapturous popularity with the public while also garnering the praise of the most austere critics.  Strauss was the most popular and financially successful composer of his time, travelling the world with his orchestras and making millions (yes, millions) from both his waltzes and his operettas.  Meanwhile, musicians on the level of Hans von Blow, Richard Strauss, Johannes Brahms, and Richard Wagner marvelled at the fertility of his melodic gift and the brilliance of his orchestration.  For a composer, this is the ultimate dream, and none have so totally achieved it as Strauss.  Perhaps Gershwin comes closest. In these wonderful performances from the early 1990s, Frans Welzer-Mst, then the wunderkind of the conducting world, performs Strauss' finest waltzes with the London Philharmonic.  If you are going to buy only one Strauss recording, let this be it.  Welzer-Mst and the Philharmonic completely capture the joy and vibrancy of Strauss' music, and these renditions are possessed of an unusual rhythmic vitality.  Perhaps it was the youth and enthusiasm of the conductor, but this is as fine a Strauss recording as I've ever heard.   The waltzes of Strauss capture the romantic neverland of late-19th century Vienna better than any other music.  Of course, that world never actually existed, but listening to Strauss' music, one wishes it had.
