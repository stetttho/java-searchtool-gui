 "The Man With the Golden Gun" was published in 1965, the year after Ian Fleming's death, and was his last work of fiction to feature the character of James Bond.  After the magnificent "You Only Live Twice" (1964), which carried the Bond series to a level beyond its previous heights and remains Fleming's finest novel, many readers had high hopes that Fleming's final Bond outing would be of high quality as well.  They were bound to be deeply disappointed. This is the worst published fiction (albeit posthumously) Fleming ever wrote; indeed, it is, by common consent, the worst of all the James Bond novels (including the much maligned "The Spy Who Loved Me").  Even some of John Gardner's later forays from the 1980s are better than this.  Fleming is clearly uninspired, even bored, and the limp plot is in no way helped by the character of Scaramanga, who, rather than being menacing, is reduced by Fleming to an obnoxious, stupid, loudmouthed bully.  Easily the worst villain Fleming ever conceived. This was written in the last months of Fleming's life, and it may have been a rough draft.  Let us hope it was very rough.  It probably should never have been published, but it is not worth reading unless one is a Bond completist.
