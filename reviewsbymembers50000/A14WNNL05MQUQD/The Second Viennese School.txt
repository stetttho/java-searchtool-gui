 Schoenberg, Berg and Webern.  Three of the most daring, courageous, extraordinarily gifted and controversial composers in music history.  Herbert von Karajan takes us beyond the realm of tonality in these justifiably revered recordings with the Berlin Philharmonic.  Karajan achieves a lushness with this music that fans of tonality will appreciate, while the groundbreaking aspects of the compositions themselves are never lost in what has been described as "Karajan's beautiful sound."  Particularly outstanding are the recordings of Berg and Schoenberg (the Webern "Passacaglia" is one his earliest compositions, and was more or less his dissertation after studying with Schoenberg).  This is a fantastic recording and should be in the home of any serious music fan.
