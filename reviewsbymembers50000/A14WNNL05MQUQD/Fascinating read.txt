 Richard Nixon was the closest America has ever come to electing a Fascist to the presidency.  His neurotic, spiteful contempt for his country and his  office were truly mindboggling to behold.  He would sink to virtually any  depth to destroy enemies and, more importantly, further himself.  All these  die-hard Republicans writing worshipful reviews of this book should bear in  mind that no-less a Republican icon than Barry Goldwater disdained Nixon as  "the most dishonest man I have ever met."  Inevitably, Nixon was  his own worst enemy, as his self-destructive, self-loathing personality  triggered the greatest disaster in the history of the presidency:  Watergate.  That said, however, "RN: The Memoirs of Richard  Nixon" is about as compelling an autobiography as you're going to come  across.  Nixon was a key player in many of the great conflicts of the  century, and his accounts of his political life make for truly fascinating  reading.  The glimpses into the personal side of Nixon reveal a cerebral,  compulsive man, ill-equipped to deal with the dark sides of his own psyche.   These insights are what makes "RN" by far the most gripping  presidential memoir yet written.  Camille Paglia once wrote of this book  that Nixon's fall and unprecedented disgrace unleashed a "Proustian  flood of remembrance"--and "RN" is indeed Proustian, as  Nixon recounts, almost obsessively, virtually every conceivable detail of  his political life in well over a thousand pages.  His desperate attempts  to perform damage control on his legacy aside, "RN" is an  extraordinary self-portrait by one of the most important players in 20th  century American life.
