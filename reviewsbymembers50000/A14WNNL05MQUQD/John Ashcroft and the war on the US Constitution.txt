 Why does John Ashcroft hate the constitution?   Could it be because it guarantees freedom of religion, when Ashcroft would prefer an evangelical Christian theocracy?  Could it be because it guarantees freedom of speech, and Ashcroft feels speech should be reserved solely for those who donate to the Bush-Cheney '04 campaign? Could it be because the constitution doesn't differentiate based on sex, class, or color, when Ashcroft differentiates based on each of these categories? Could it be all of the above?  Of course it could.  And it is.  Four more years with Reich Minister Ashcroft as our attorney general, and the constitution could be reduced to a modern version of the Nuremberg laws. Boy, would he love that.
