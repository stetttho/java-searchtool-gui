 From his years in Depeche Mode and Yaz and through all his records with Erasure, Vince Clarke has had one of the most remarkable (and successful) songwriting careers in pop music.  His forte has always been the three  minute pop single, packed with melody, hooks and intricate arrangements.   With Andy Bell, his writing took on a more acute sense of popcraft, and  Erasure was the most consistent feature on the British singles charts from  the late 80s on, charting more than thirty times since 1987.  In 1995,  however, Clarke and Bell unexpectedly abandoned their usual frenetic,  dancefloor formula and made this, their longest (71.5 minutes), most  ambitious undertaking.  While Andy Bell's voice has never sounded more  angelic, and his singing has never been more confident and assured, the  star of this album is quite obviously Vince Clarke, who unveils a stunning  array of soundscapes, melodies and hooks, fresh from his dome-shaped  backyard studio.  This is quite a startling turn for Erasure fans, but it  works 100%.  This is the most rewarding and challenging, albeit least  typical, album in the Erasure canon, and a true feast for Clarke fans.  The  album has a dreamy, subdued feeling, without the usual dance-crazy singles  Erasure is best known for.  It also wasn't much of a hit with the fans--it  barely cracked the British top ten album charts and its singles, while  still hits, didn't storm towards the pole position like they had in the  past.  Perhaps that's why the boys returned to their classic style on the  follow up to "Erasure," "Cowboy."  However, everyone  should count themselves fortunate that they ever made this gem in the first  place.  They'll probably never make another one like it, so immerse  yourself in this: one of the most unusual, unique and extraordinary pop  music releases of the '90s.
