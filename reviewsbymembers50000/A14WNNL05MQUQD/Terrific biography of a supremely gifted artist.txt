 Meryle Secrest's book is one of a kind (so far): a story of Stephen Sondheim, the man, rather than simply Stephen Sondheim, the artist.  No other book has attempted to do this, and Secrest does a fine job.  This  book is an absolute feast for Sondheim fans, because the Great Man himself  reveals several illuminating insights into his own life, conflicted  personality and peerless work.  I read the other reviews here at Amazon,  and people seem to be missing the point--this isn't a critical biography,  but a personal one.  And it is one of the very best books written about  this enigmatic, thoroughly fascinating man.
