 Rudolf Bing (1902-1997) is best remembered as the general manager of the Metropolitan Opera between 1949 and 1971.  During this time, he established himself as a celebrity in the US and re-established the Met as arguably the greatest opera house in the world (though Georg Solti's decade, 1961-1971, at the Royal Opera is still reckoned as its best).  By the time of his retirement at 70, Bing had left an indelible mark on the international music scene. But, surprisingly, the most interesting parts of this memoir are the pages concerning Bing's life before the Met.  He served his apprenticeship in various adminstrative and management roles at opera houses in Germany and Austria before coming to help at Glyndebourne in the early thirties; by 1936, he was the general manager.  In the mid-forties, he founded and organized the Edinburgh Festival, before taking over the Met at the age of 47.  These early chapters form a revealing portrait of life in the European opera houses of the early 20th century.   Upon arriving at the Met, Bing's memoir loses steam, at least to this reader.  There are several fascinating anecdotes, especially of his problematic dealings with Callas and Karajan, but the last two-thirds of the book are much less riveting than the first.  Overall, however, this remains an invaluable document for those interested in classical music and the history of opera, and is well worth reading. On a sad note, it should be remembered that Bing spent the last twelve years of his long life being robbed blind and taken advantage of by his grasping (and mentally unstable) second wife, whom he barely knew, suffering as he was from Alzheimer's.  Their marriage was annulled by the state of New York and he died, alone and forgotten, in a nursing home, his bills generously paid for by the Metropolitan Opera.
