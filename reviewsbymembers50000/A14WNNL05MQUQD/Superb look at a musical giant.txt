 Bruno Walter (1876-1962) was one of the 20th century's truly colossal musicians.  When he died, at nearly 86 years old, he was (with the exception of Otto Klemperer, who died 11 years later) the last in the long line of great European maestros who had directed some of the most legendary operatic and symphonic ensembles in the history of classical music.  Walter served from 1901 to 1907 as Gustav Mahler's assistant at the Vienna Opera (having served as his vocal coach earlier in Hamburg) and later premiered "Das Lied von der Erde" and the Ninth Symphony.  He served 11 illustrious years as music director at the State Opera in Berlin and was recognized as one of the supreme interpreters of his time in the music of Mahler, Schubert, Wagner and particularly Mozart.   This video was filmed in 1958 during a rehearsal in Vancouver, British Columbia.  Walter, at 82, is in fine form throughout, displaying his experienced musical insight, acute ear and a profound knowledge of the score, which he conducts from memory.   The music being rehearsed is Brahms' Second Symphony.  Also included is an interview with Walter conducted in his garden by Los Angeles Times music critic Albert Goldberg.  The interview is interesting, but a tad bit unctuous.  Isaac Stern once said of Walter, "There was a gentleness to Bruno Walter--an APPARENT gentleness.  Because he was one of the most stubborn and iron-willed of people.  But there was a certain courtliness about him."  This is evident in the film, as Walter politely but firmly corrects the orchestra and pulls from them the sound he hears in his head.   Anyone interested in orchestral conducting or in seeing a legendary maestro doing what he does best will enjoy this film.  Apart from musicians, however, I can't imagine who would be interested in it.
