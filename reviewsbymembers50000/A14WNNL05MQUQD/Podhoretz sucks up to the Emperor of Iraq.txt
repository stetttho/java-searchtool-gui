 Yeah, Dubya is a "great president."   On the economy, he has the worst record of any president since Herbert Hoover at the depths of the Great Depression.  He has shifted the tax burden from the rich to the middle and lower classes and cost America over 3 million jobs. On social policy, he has endorsed abstinence to battle teen pregnancy, a pitifully stupid ideological "idea."  The crime rate is higher now than it was under President Clinton.  Science is being attacked by a "fundamentalist" Christian who doesn't even read the Bible (then again, how many evangelicals do?).  The VA budget is slashed while the rich chickenhawks enjoy their tax cuts. On national security, he is the most unmitigated disaster in the history of the US presidency.  While Dubya was daydreaming about Star Wars and reading stories to schoolchildren, Al-Qaeda carried out the worst terrorist attack in world history on American soil.  Rather than strike back, Dubya blew it in Afghanistan before lying to the American public and attacking Iraq at the behest of his puppet masters, Cheney, Rumsfeld, and Wolfowitz.  Today, Al-Qaeda flourishes while American soldiers are picked off on a daily basis by terrorists.  Thanks, Dubya. So John Podhoretz, an elite establishment figure whose parents are famous society Republicans upon whose coat tails he has ridden his entire life, writes this book.  Why?  To make a quick buck and maybe get a cabinet appointment from Emperor Dubya of Iraq.  Good luck, John.
