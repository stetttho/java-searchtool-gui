 Barry Paris' life of Greta Garbo is an extraordinary biography in many ways.  First, it tells the story of one of Hollywood's most enigmatic and legendary icons without resorting to hyperbole or the sort of highblown psychobabble so many other, lesser writers would have stooped to.  Second, it is meticulously researched and tells Garbo's story honestly, responsibly and thoroughly, including her mysterious days as New York's Most Famous Recluse.  Finally, it delves deep into the heart of what made, and continues to make, Garbo one of the enduring figures in 20th century popular culture.  Paris reveals the woman behind the dark sunglasses--and she turns out to be much more interesting than one might think.  Garbo, it seems, was a woman of vast contradictions, who ultimately became the victim of both her own compulsive need for privacy and her vast emotional ambivalence.  This is the biographical art at its finest, and highly recommended.
