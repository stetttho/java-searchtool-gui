 There is no questioning Rick Wakeman's technical skill or importance as a progressive rock instrumentalist.  However, this is what you end up with when your technique is more important than your creativity: dull, rambling,  dated, unmelodic organ runs and cheesy "classical" piano  instrumentals.  If you're still someone who thinks "Fragile" is  the greatest album of all time, then this is for you.  If you have any  taste in music, avoid this at all costs.
