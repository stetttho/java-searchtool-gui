 With "OHMSS" and "Octopussy," I rank "License to Kill" in the top tier of Bond films.  I had never thought very much of this film until watching it again recently for the first time in many years.  I was surprised at how good it is.  The plot is based in part on the original "Live and Let Die" novel (1954), in which Felix Leiter is fed to a shark and Bond exacts revenge.  This is the most coherently plotted Bond film since "OHMSS," avoiding the labrynthine storytelling of previous entries like "The Living Daylights" (which I also like very much).  The action is well choreographed and this is one Bond flick that doesn't overstay its welcome.  Timothy Dalton is superb here: tough, angry, and suave.  He's definitely my favorite Bond, followed closely by George Lazenby, and it's a pity he didn't stay with the role.  He brought new life to a series that was getting old and hackneyed.  Carey Lowell is a particularly luscious Bond girl and gives a fine performance.    This is a gritty, realistic, and engrossing film--the Last Real Bond Movie, in my estimation.  I recommend it highly.
