 Michael Daugherty is one of the most idiosyncratic of modern American composers.  His work shows a consistent, perhaps occasionally tiring, obsession with pop culture, and despite his awesome technique (he has a Ph.D. in composition and worked at IRCAM with Pierre Boulez), his work is almost invariably accessible and melodic.   His debut opera, "Jackie O," is tantalizing evidence of his diverse talents.  This is a man who understands how to write for the human voice, and the music here is extraordinarily eclectic, with Verdiesque arias and brilliantly inventive contrapuntal vocal excursions standing beside catchy pop tunes and blues riffs.  The scoring is superb as well.  Daugherty's resourcefulness and energy are breathtaking.   Indeed, this could have been a great new contribution to the operatic repertory if it weren't for Wayne Koestenbaum's horrible libretto.  When he's not trying really, really hard to be profound, Koestenbaum is laboring to be funny; in both attempts, he fails resoundingly.  This "collage" libretto ranges from fair to deeply embarrassing, and ultimately collapses under the weight of its own cliches.   A skilled librettist with an original mind could have made something good out of this concept (which isn't that great in itself).  Unfortunately, Koestenbaum has a pedestrian mind and a heavy-handed "wit."  So there you have it. All in all, "Jackie O" manages to be rewarding thanks to its extraordinary music, despite the pretentions of its libretto.
