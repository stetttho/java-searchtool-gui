 Kenzaburo Oe, the Japanese novelist who won the 1994 Nobel Prize for Literature, was 28 when his son, Hikari, was born.  This event was the most important in Oe's life.  Born with a herniated brain, Hikari has needed almost constant care since birth.  "A Healing Family" is Oe's first non-fiction attempt to make sense of Hikari's life and the effect it has had on the people around him, most importantly his family.   This beautiful book shows the profound love, affection and pride the Oe family take in Hikari's accomplishments and happiness.  From the age of five, Hikari has been obsessed with classical music, and eventually began to compose pieces for piano and violin.  Much of "A Healing Family" concerns Oe's attempts to understand his son through music.   "A Healing Family" is a book everyone should read.  Finely crafted, perceptive, intelligent and moving, it shows us again that compassion and empathy can make all the difference in the world.
