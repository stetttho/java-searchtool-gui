 Gene Lees's "Inventing Champagne" is a terrific look at the partnership that spawned "My Fair Lady," "Gigi" and "Camelot"--the collaboration between lyricist / librettist Alan  Jay Lerner and composer Frederick Loewe.  Based upon exhaustive research  and hundreds of interviews, this is the only book that tells the story  behind some of the greatest works ever written for either stage or screen.   Lerner comes across as a supremely gifted neurotic; Loewe as equally  gifted, and vastly arrogant, yet free of the wild ambitions and assorted  personal problems that plagued the obsessive Lerner.  An unlikely pairing,  yet one that had few rivals in the creation of theatrical songs.  Lees'  readable, in-depth portrait of Lerner and Loewe is a fascinating,  well-written book that is more than worth reading.
