 Charlie Daniels.  The name evokes many things.  Plaid.  Fiddlin'.  The devil.  Georgia.  But what would you say if I told you Mr. Daniels, in addition to his numerous other gifts, is also the most acute and penetrating social critic since Durkheim?  You might be skeptical.  Well, you obviously have never read "Ain't No Rag," Mr. Daniels' new tome.  The arguments in this book can be summed up succinctly, despite their awesome complexity: Democrats are bad, Republicans are good; patriotism is good, and only Republicans are "patriots"; "liberals" are trying to destroy our society, despite the valiant efforts of "patriots" to counteract their (liberals') satanic designs; Christians are very good, non-Christians of all varieties are very, very bad, and on a fast track to the Lake of Fire to boot.  These arguments, on the surface, might appear somewhat uninformed and, well, dumb--but remember, these insights flow from the pen of Charlie Daniels, one of the most learned, well-informed, open-minded thinkers of our era.   I urge all "real Americans" to read "Ain't No Rag."  Do you "love America"?  Then embrace it.  Don't question it.  As reviewer and "true patriot" Bob Creasey says below, in a quote that sums up this book better than I ever could, "Ain't No Rag" is great for "simulating" reading.
