 Most books that style themselves as "introductions" to literary theory fall short of their promise, often resorting to the same jargon the novice is trying to decipher or operating on the assumption that the reader already has a background in the field (which would preclude the need for an "introduction").  This is the main flaw with Terry Eagleton's much used "Literary Theory: An Introduction," which is as obscurantist as it is lucid.  Peter Barry's "Beginning Theory," on the other hand, is the ideal primer for theoretical studies and is, bar none, the least polemical and most straightforward introduction to critical theory yet written. Barry takes the reader step-by-step through most of the significant areas of literary theory (passing over reception theory and substituting an analysis of liberal humanism for the New Criticism), explaining their basic theoretical foundations carefully and clearly, with an emphasis on understanding through example rather than unfocused summary.  He provides basic examples of what critics try to do when they apply certain methodologies and then demonstrates the methods himself with short analyses.  If you have absolutely no background in critical theory, this book is the place to begin.  Barry is painstaking without insulting the reader's intelligence. In short, if you're looking for a readable, thorough examination of the main trends of critical theory, "Beginning Theory" is the best starting point available.
