 Otto Klemperer's recording of Beethoven's only opera is justifiably legendary.  "Fidelio" was Klemperer's operatic specialty, and his identification with both the opera's music and message were profound.  Klemperer's noble and moving musicality guide us faultlessly through one of opera's most troublesome scores.  This is a genuinely moving experience. Klemperer was one of the 20th century's most revered operatic conductors, and his years of experience and experimentation (including several years as the music director of Berlin's Kroll Theatre, which was a haven for daring artistic innovation under Klemperer) are what make this such an extraordinary recording.  Klemperer was 77 when this was recorded, and with an absolutely unassailable ensemble singing the parts, he was able to produce a "Fidelio" that was more or less perfect. Each singer is excellent, but for me, the performance of the great Jon Vickers stands out.  From his first moments, crying out "Gott! Welch' Dunkel Hier," Vickers is gripping.  What an amazing Florestan.   Don't pass up this opportunity to hear "Fidelio" in an incomparable recording, at an excellent price.
