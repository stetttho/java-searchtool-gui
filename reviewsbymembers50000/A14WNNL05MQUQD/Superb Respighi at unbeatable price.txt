 Whatever opinion you might have of Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra, there can be no denying Ormandy's mastery of the these Respighi tone poems.  "Pines of Rome," "Fountains of Rome" and "Roman Festivals" were staples of Ormandy's repetoire during his years (1936-1980) as Philadelphia's music director, and these superb recordings are almost unrivalled (Fritz Reiner's are their only competitors).  Even Bernstein and Karajan's recordings pale in comparison; the famous "Philadelphia sound" is perfectly suited to Respighi's music.   Each tone poem is beautifully performed, with the lushness and sensual qualities (not to mention bombast) one expects of Ormandy/Philadelphia.  The clarity of texture and singing lines of Ormandy's interpretations are what set these apart from other recordings, including Reiner's more objective (but still dazzling) renditions.  Though he stumbled often in Classical and Romantic music, in Strauss, Debussy, early Stravinsky, Sibelius, Tchaikovsky and Respighi, Ormandy was a master.  These are excellent recordings at a spectacular price.  Don't pass it up.
