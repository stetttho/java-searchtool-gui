 Marni Nixon, perhaps best-known for dubbing Audrey Hepburn's singing in  the film version of "My Fair Lady," turns in a simply magnificent  performance here as she sings some of the finest pop songs ever written.   The accompaniment by pianist Lincoln Mayorga and a small band is perfect  and it is obvious that was a labor of love for both vocalist and ensemble.   What keeps this from being a five star CD is the selection--some of the  songs are not Kern standards, and considering the amount of classics Kern  wrote, it seems that they could have chosen better songs than  "Californ-i-ay" or "Go, Little Boat."  However, this CD  is a great collection of songs by one of the greatest songwriters of the  first half of the twentieth century.
