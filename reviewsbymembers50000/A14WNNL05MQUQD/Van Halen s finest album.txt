 In their final days with David Lee Roth, Van Halen found themselves running low on creative energy, and it showed on their final Roth-era release, the dismal "1984," which was half filler and, with a few exceptions, well below their earlier releases in term of songwriting consistency.  After Roth's departure in 1985, Sammy Hagar joined and Edward Van Halen found his creative juices replenished, because they then released one of their finest LPs, "5150."  However, the best was yet to come. After proving their enduring popularity sans David Lee Roth with 1986's "5150," Van Halen returned two years later with "OU812."  It was here that Eddie proved that not only was he one of the colossal guitarists in rock history, but also a first-rate songwriter and keyboardist as well.  Lyrically, this is the best writing Sammy Hagar ever did for Van Halen, while Eddie's guitar work remains searing, emotive and inventive.  His songwriting, however, exploded with newfound maturity, confidence and artistry.  Edward Van Halen has said many times that he considers himself more of a songwriter than a gunslinging guitarist, and "OU812" shows why: from the pulsing, keyboard driven "Feels So Good" to the country-inflected "Finish What Ya Started," Eddie's writing shows an unexpected stylistic catholicism and assurance lacking in any other Van Halen album before or since.  And there's still plenty of frenetic, hair-raising guitar on "OU812" ("Source of Infection," "AFU," "Cabo Wabo") to satisfy old-style purists who don't like Eddie's keyboard experiments.  While many prefer Van Halen's older, party-oriented releases with David Lee Roth, "OU812" shows one of rock's finest writer/instrumentalists at his absolute creative zenith.  Highly recommended.
