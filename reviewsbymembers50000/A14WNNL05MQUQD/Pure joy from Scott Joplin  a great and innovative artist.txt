 When Scott Joplin died in 1917 of advanced syphillis, he was penniless, frustrated artistically, and had seen the last days of the ragtime craze pass by.  Who would have imagined that today, nearly 90 years after his death, his music would be taken much more seriously than it was in his own time, and would continue to delight and astonish performers and audiences around the world?  This is Joplin's legacy, and it exceeds that of hundreds of other composers whose music has come and gone in the years since his death.   Not bad for a man who aspired to critical respectability above popular adulation, and who wrote three operas (including "Treemonisha") in the hope of attaining respect among "serious" musicians.  Joplin's unbelievably resourceful melodic gift, his innovative rhythmic instinct, his utterly original harmonic palette, and his superb talents as an arranger have made his music immortal, and even such a renowned musician as Theodore Leschetizky (who trained more great pianists than any other teacher of his time) played and admired his music.  Maybe he was more respectable than he knew. Roy Eaton's renditions of fifteen of Joplin's most famous rags are wonderfully vibrant and insightful.  This is a first-rate recording at an unbeatable price.  Need I say more?
