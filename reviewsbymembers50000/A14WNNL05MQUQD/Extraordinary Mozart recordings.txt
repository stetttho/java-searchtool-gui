 With the exception of Bruno Walter, Karl Bohm was the most universally admired Mozart conductor of the 20th century.  Bohm trained under Walter, and from the older maestro he learned to conduct Mozart as a serious composer, not an effeminate minor talent.  Bohm's deep identification with Mozart's music, both symphonic and operatic, is virtually palpable on these magnificent recordings.  With the exception of (surprise) Walter's interpretations, I can't think of another set that so completely captures the spirit and vivacity of Mozart's symphonic genius than this one. Bohm approaches Mozart with a strict precision, careful pacing and closely observed dynamics.  These symphonies were near and dear to Bohm's heart, and he had performed them countless times before making these recordings--yet he manages to make them sound as if they are being performed for the first time.  There is a sparkling vitality and the sheer joy of music-making throughout these recordings.  Bohm's reputation as a master Mozart conductor was well deserved.
