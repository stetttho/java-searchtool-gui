 Hugo Wolf, who died raving mad in an asylum in 1903, was a singular figure  on the Vienna music scene during his short life: composer of one opera,  legendary bohemian, the most notorious music critic of his time and also,  incidentally, the greatest composer of lieder (art songs) who ever lived.   This magnificent reissue of his "Spanisches Liederbuch" is not  only a must have for any lover of lieder, but also a tremedous value.   Elisabeth Schwartzkopf and Dietrech Fischer-Dieskau sing these songs with  sensitivity, emotion and the astonishing control that can only come from a  deep knowledge of their material.  For me, though, the highlight of these  disks is the keyboard work of Gerald Moore, who plays Wolf's songs with  grace, finesse, precision and delicacy.  A true pianistic artist.  This is  some of the greatest music ever written, brilliantly performed, and at a  more than reasonable price.  Highly recommended.
