 Christopher Hitchens is one of a new and insidious breed of political pundit.  Like his fellow chickenhawk and laptop liberator, Andrew Sullivan, Hitchens is a transplanted Englishman who came to the US to tell us what our foreign policy should be, what constitutes American patriotism, and where our soldiers should be sent to die.   This book is a good example of his work.  Hitchens became a right-wing courtier to such politcal titans as Lindsey Graham and Rick Santorum during the Clinton impeachment era, and is now firmly ensconsed as a reliably right-wing commentator on a host of issues.  Here he argues that Saddam was a threat that had to be eliminated--this despite that fact that, after over 700 US deaths, no WMD in sight, and the creation of our very own quagmire in the heart of the Middle East, we still have no good reason to be in Iraq.  And Osama continues to plot.   Perhaps Hitchens should stick to what he does best--getting drunk, cheating on his pregnant wife, and making an ass of himself at Washington soirees.  Political analysis is, to say the least, not his strong point.
