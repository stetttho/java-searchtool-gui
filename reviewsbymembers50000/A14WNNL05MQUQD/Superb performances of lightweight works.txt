 George Gershwin remains one of the finest songwriters of the 20th century.  As a melodist, he had few peers, and he left a body of work that remains a monument to his talent.  In "Porgy and Bess," he created one of the few American operas to find a niche in the repertory, and songs like "Summertime" and "Bess, You is My Woman Now" made "Porgy" a truly great work.   It is when one gets to Gershwin's excursions into orchestral music that problems arise, at least in my opinion.  Don't get me wrong--there are many wonderful things about "Rhapsody in Blue," "An American in Paris," and the Piano Concerto in F.  At their best, they abound in melodic invention and a swaggering jazzy charm.   Unfortunately, it must be said that they also have a tendency to meander in search of where to go next, and to rely on heavy doses of bombastic horn sforzandos and quick scalar piano runs in place of real ideas or development.  For this listener, Gershwin's penchant for compensating for a lack of ideas with noise proves very tiresome, and weighs down the positive qualities of his concert music. As far as the performances on this disc, you cannot do better than Andre Previn and the LSO.  Previn's background as a jazz pianist and Hollywood orchestrator and arranger is ideally suited to the music at hand, and both the pianism and orchestral playing are outstanding.  They are, indeed, as good as this music deserves.
