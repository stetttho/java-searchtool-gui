 Klaus Tennstedt, who died in 1998, was an artist whose unpredictability and profound insecurity sometimes overshadowed his phenomenal gifts.  Notoriously unreliable, Tennstedt became a maverick--the most sought after guest conductor in the world.  However, despite his idiosyncracies, Tennstedt was without peer as an interpreter of Beethoven, Bruckner and, in particular, Mahler, as abundantly evidenced on this magnificent set of Mahler symphonies. Tennstedt's absolute emotional commitment and profound intellectual and psychological insight into Mahler's music is conspicuous in virtually every movement contained on these disks: his identification with Mahler is almost palpable.  "I, too, had led a complicated life," Tennstedt once said, describing his attraction to Mahler and his music.  Listen to his recordings of the 4th, 6th or simply the fourth movement of the 5th symphony to hear some of the most gripping music making ever recorded.  Tennstedt manages to maintain this colossal level of tension and emotion throughout the cycle and it is impossible to listen without being struck by his mastery of each work.  To me, Klaus Tennstedt, despite tough competition from Horenstein and Bernstein, is the definitive Mahler conductor.   At this extraordinary price, it would be a crime to pass up on this set of Mahler symphonies.  These recordings are the greatest legacies of two extraordinary artists: Klaus Tennstedt and, of course, Gustav Mahler.  Worth every penny.
