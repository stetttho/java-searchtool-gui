 Who is Ann Coulter? She is an avowed follower of Jesus, yet she preaches social Darwinism.  She abhors the sexualization of our society, yet she wears miniskirts that would make Jenna Jameson blush.  She speaks for the common man, yet she comes from an elite background.  She preaches family values, yet has never married nor had children.  She calls liberals "totalitarian," yet she endorses a theocratic, one-party state and is an admirer of Joe McCarthy.  She cries out for a more civil political discourse, yet is the most unhinged, extremist, shrill hatchet man of her ideological circle.   That's Ann Coulter, folks--the darling of the fascist Republican Party.
