 V.S. Naipaul once disdained F. Scott Fitzgerald for being a terrible writer prone to injecting his novels with "bogus emotion." He was right on the mark. "The Great Gatsby" is a pedestrian, pretentious book that has somehow made its way into the Great Novel section of American literature. This is by no means a great novel; it isn't even a particularly good one.  The story is thin and forced. Annoying, self-consciously clever characters (reflections of their creator) preen and weep through 185 pages of would-be Greek tragedy. The narrator, Nick Carraway, is annoying, as is virtually every other character in the book. In fact, there isn't a single person in this entire novel who is worth caring about. The prose is laughable and usually downright bad. Sometimes it was so incoherent and overwrought that it seemed to be poorly translated from another language.  Fitzgerald's attempts to be "poetic" invariably fall flat. "The Great Gatsby" is little more than a relic of a past era, and not a very compelling relic either. Obviously, other readers will have to come to their own conclusions, but for me, "The Great Gatsby" should have been retitled "The Mediocre Novel."
