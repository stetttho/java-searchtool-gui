 Maynard Solomon's writings have always been the source of controversy.  His application of Freudian and Marxist theories to his research makes his work unlike that of any other musicologist, and in terms of sheer scholarly erudition, there are few modern historians who can rival Solomon.  His biography of Beethoven was immediately acclaimed as a groundbreaking work upon its publication 25 years ago, and after decades of research, his long awaited life of Mozart appeared in 1995 and was, not suprisingly, the source of much discussion and rethinking about the great composer.   Many people have difficulties buying into Solomon's psychoanalytical, sociopolitical approach to biography.  His deep analysis of the psychological motivations of Beethoven was striking in his earlier work, but it reached new heights in his Mozart biography.  Each and every word, thought or action of the composer (and his family members) is explained and analysed in in painstaking detail.  As an admirer of Solomon's work, I was surprised to find myself sometimes annoyed with his overwrought Freudian psychobabble, but don't let that discourage you from reading "Mozart: A Life."  This is easily the most illuminating, comprehensive and rewarding book ever written on its subject, and Solomon's accomplishments as a researcher cannot be overstated.  This has been rightly recognized as one of the great musical biographies yet written, and will probably remain the definitive life of Mozart for a long time to come.   Let us hope that Solomon (who turns 71 this year) has enough time left to write at least one more enlightening, shocking and profound musical biography.  Wherever Solomon turns his attention, the result is always compelling.
