 I'm not going to comment on the fact that this is one of Van Halen's three greatest albums, which it is.  Instead, I just wanted to clarify two points that several people keep getting wrong in their reviews here: 1) David Lee Roth did not write any of "5150."  Eddie wrote the music; Sammy wrote the lyrics.  Some of the music was written before David left, but he did not write music for Van Halen--so nothing on "5150," musically or lyrically, was written by David Lee Roth. 2) Sammy Hagar did not play any guitar on "5150"--or any other Van Halen album, either.  Eddie played all the guitar on every Van Halen album.  Sammy only sang and wrote the lyrics.   People need to do their homework before they make stupid comments.  Read Guitar World magazine's book of interviews with Eddie and find out the truth behind the writing and recording of "5150."
