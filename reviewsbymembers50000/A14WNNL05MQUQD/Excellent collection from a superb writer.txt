 "Down Here in the Dream Quarter" contains some of Barry Malzberg's final stories from the period (c.1967-1975) when he was writing some of the most unusual, literate, technically virtuosic and highly personal fiction of the post-war era.  Malzberg, who had aspirations (and certainly the talents) for a career in "serious" fiction, turned to science fiction during the mid- to late-60s after numerous rejections from literary magazines.  He went on to write over 76 novels and 300 short stories (not all of them SF) in a creative white heat that ended when he realized that, despite this formidable streak of artistry and prolificity, he remained unknown outside SF and maligned and misunderstood within it.  What remains is a body of work that is as uncompromising and challenging, but ultimately rewarding, as one is likely to find.  That Malzberg had been forced to write paperback originals and fall into obscurity when he had the gifts to be winning National Book Awards and heading PEN is a situation with implications not lost on the author; it is, indeed, downright Malzbergian.   Which brings us to "Down Here in the Dream Quarter."  This volume features several late stories and two scathing essays (in addition to an illuminating preface) and is a fine introduction to Malzberg's short fiction.  Each story includes a short introduction by the author.  "The Best of Barry N. Malzberg" remains his finest collection of short works, but "Dream Quarter" is a more than respectable anthology and demonstrates not only the understandable bitterness the author felt at the end of his SF career, but also the fact that, in terms of ambition and skill, Malzberg was lightyears ahead of all but a handfull of his peers.   Highly recommended.
