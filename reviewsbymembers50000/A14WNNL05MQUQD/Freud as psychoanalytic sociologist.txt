 Sigmund Freud, whatever the variations in his posthumous reputation, remains the most compelling, daring, and persuasive analyst of the human condition we have.  His psychoanalytic theories of sexuality, sublimation, repression, etc., offer original insights that profoundly influenced the course of Western consciousness in the 20th century.  In addition to his gifts as a thinker, Freud was a master stylist, a man whose luminous prose and skillful argumentation make reading him a genuine pleasure.   "Civilization and Its Discontents," one of Freud's last works, remains one of his most vital and important.  Don't be fooled by its brevity; this is a deeply complex and wide-ranging examination of Western civilization and its tensions.  Freud speculates about the origins of our modern societies, the difficulties of assimilating ourselves to them given our own individual psyches, and ends the book with a rather pessimistic look forward.  Clearly, Freud felt that civilization's "discontents" were an unresolvable fact of life.   What makes "Civilization and Its Discontents" so fascinating is Freud's application of psychoanalysis to Western society as whole.  He examines how the factors at play in our own psyches--family conflicts, sexual desire, guilt, the "death instinct," and the eternal battle between our own self-interest and the interests of the human species at large--cause the problems that human beings encounter on a daily basis.  As always with Freud, his ideas are put forward not as a final statement, but as a tentative first step.   This is one of Freud's indispensable texts, and its accessible and absorbing style make it an ideal introduction for those who are seeking to discover this colossal mind for the first time.  A must read.
