 Taking their cues from David Bowie and (early) Roxy Music, Duran Duran created a remarkable collection of singles, all conveniently gathered together on this fantastic, endlessly listenable (though poorly annotated)  compilation.  From their earliest hits like "Planet Earth" and  "Girls on Film" to their later could-have-beens ("Electric  Barbarella," "Skin Trade"), this is some of the most  influential, consistent pop music of its era.  It is also a fine  documentation of a good band's progression through two decades of stardom.   So Simon LeBon's lyrics make no sense and the album has a rather oblique  sense of sequence (one late song is mixed right in the middle of their  early hits)--do you care?  I don't.  That's not what Duran Duran is about  and, with only two weak tracks ("I Don't Want Your Love" and  "All She Wants Is") out of a total of 19, this is the best record  Duran Duran ever released.
