 In his prime (c.1971-1982), Stevie Wonder produced a body of music that ranks among the most original, innovative and consistent ever created.  As a composer, lyricist, drummer, keyboardist, harmonica virtuoso, producer  and arranger, Stevie was the very epitome of the independent creative  artist, and almost entirely self-sufficient at that.   "Innervisions," along with 1972's magnificent "Talking  Book," is arguably his finest hour.  Nine extraordinary songs, with  Stevie's finest set of lyrics to accompany his rich, intricate music and  arrangements, display a true musical genius at his most intensely creative.   "Innervisions" has been universally acclaimed as a landmark  recording since it was released and it is easy to see why: there is nothing  here short of excellent, and most of it is among Stevie's very best.  And  not only is the material virtually peerless, but Stevie's production was  also unique--in addition to playing almost every instrument on the album,  he was busy using synthesizers in ways no one else had ever imagined they  could be used.  If you buy only one Stevie Wonder record, let this be it.
