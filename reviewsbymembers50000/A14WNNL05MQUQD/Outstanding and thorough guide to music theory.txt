 Music theory is kind of like math.  Some people are good at theory, but hate studying it; some have a complete theory block and can't understand even the fundamentals.  And some, like me, love it, are good at it, and enjoy it for its own sake.   For those who are interested in this vast and sometimes intimidating subject, Kostka's "Tonal Harmony" is a superb, well written, extremely thorough, and largely lucid guide.  This is the text I used in both college theory classes and in the independent study I did with a University of Oregon doctoral student, and in both cases I found it very useful.  To get much out of it, one really should have some background in theory, but with at least a modest understanding of the subject, this book is one that can be used alone by the self-motivated musician.   Everything from four-part writing and figured bass to secondary functions and French augmented sixth chords is covered here.  In fact, unless you are getting a Ph.D. in music theory, there's a lot here you'd never need to know.  Kostka and his co-writer include many exercises at the end of each chapter, and there are a couple of chapters on post-tonal theory at the end of the book. There will never be a perfect guide to music theory, since it's such a complex subject.  There will also never be a perfect guide to physics.  That doesn't mean this book can't be of use to you.  Highly recommended.
