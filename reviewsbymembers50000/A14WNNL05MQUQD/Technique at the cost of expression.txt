 There is no questioning Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli's phenomenal technique and his awesome command of his instrument.  Both of these elements are abundantly evident in this recording of Ravel and Rachmaninoff's concertos: his delicate pianissimos and thundering triple fortes; his inability to play a passage without crystal clear articulation; his rhythmic assurance and and superb pedalling.  Michelangeli was, technically, a uniquely gifted pianist.  However, technique alone is (to quote Schnabel) "mere athleticism"--without any emotional or intellectual insight into the music one plays, all we are left with is a playing machine.  For me, this is what makes Michelangeli less than extraordinary as an artist--he was a pianist, but not a musician.  His coldness and evident emotional distance from the music leave me uninspired as a listener.  This is not to disrespect Michelangeli's prodigous talents, but only to say that his pianistic tunnel vision was his downfall.  It is evident throughout this recording, in both concertos.  Always accurate, but (to me) always simply going through the motions.  Gieseking also leaves me cold in the same way; all fingers with no heart or mind.
