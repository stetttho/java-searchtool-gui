 The Republican Party, puppet of Christian fundamentalists, is proud of its contempt for minorities, its contempt for equality, and its contempt for civil rights.  It attacks "liberals" for their supposed weakness, whining, and "victim mentality."  It works hard to limit the rights of gays, non-Christians, and women.  It presents itself as the party of morality while preaching a hypocritical doctrine of social Darwinism.  David Limbaugh, whose only qualification as a "conservative" writer is his misfortune in being born Rush Limbaugh's baby brother, amply demonstrates the duplicity and hysteria of the modern Right in his new ghostwritten book on the plight of white Christian fanatics, "Persecution."  This book is a terrifying chronicle of modern America.  Christians are no longer free to practice their religion on any level; they cannot attend church, pray in public, hold religious public gatherings, teach their beliefs to their children, or acknowledge "God" in any manner.  Actually, they can do all these things, and do all these things on a daily basis.  Apparently, Limbaugh feels that Christians are persecuted because they cannot force prayer on others at public events (eg, football games), endorse fundamentalism through government (eg, Chief Idiot Roy Moore and his law-flouting monument to himself in Alabama), or inflict their skewed and hellish worldview on everyone around them, try as they might.  This is the "victim mentality" at its least subtle. One would think that having fanatical Christians in power in the White House, Supreme Court, and both houses of Congress would appease fundamentalists like those who run the Republican Party.  But, of course, it doesn't.  As long as gays live freely without punishment, as long as women are free to exercise control over their own bodies, and as long as our government refuses to endorse Jesus Christ as the supreme ruler of our land, fanatics on the Right will have something to whine about.
