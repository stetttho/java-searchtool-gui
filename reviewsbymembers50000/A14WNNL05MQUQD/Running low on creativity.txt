 Released on New Year's Eve, 1983, "1984" showed that the DLR era VH was running out of ideas.  With the exception of "Jump," "Hot for Teacher" and "I'll Wait," "1984" lacks any truly remarkable or innovative tracks, and with the inclusion of "House of Pain," one of their earliest, LA bar circuit songs, Van Halen proved they were running low on creative juice.  Tensions between the band members, particularly Eddie and DLR, were running high, which probably affected the band's creativity.  "Diver Down," "1984"'s predecessor, consisted mostly of cover tunes, which showed that Van Halen was badly in need of musical inspiration, which (luckily) they soon received in 1985 with the arrival of Sammy Hagar and the writing and recording of the magnificent "5150."  However, "1984" was a disappointing (though highly successful) and uninspired effort.  Luckily, rumor has it that DLR is back in the studio recording with VH--so maybe they'll pick up where "1984" left off and give us a record that fulfills all the hype that will inevitably accompany a new DLR/VH collaboration.
