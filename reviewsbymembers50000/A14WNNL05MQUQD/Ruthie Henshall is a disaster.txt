 Ruthie Henshall's embarrassingly melodramatic performance as Fantine is disgusting.  She's so full of herself it cast a pall over every song she "sings" (it should say "emotes").  She breaks her voice  and is more interested in looking pathetic than singing well.  Where is  Patti LuPone when you need her!
