 "I, Asimov" was the penultimate book to pour from the pen of Isaac Asimov.  During a career that lasted over five decades, Asimov wrote on more topics than virtually any other writer in literary history.  From the sciences to history and Shakespeare to the Bible, his clear, concise writing style and ability to simplify even the most complex ideas earned him the nickname "The Great Explainer."  His fiction, with the exception of his early Foundation novels, "The Gods Themselves" and some shorter pieces, consisted largely of filler.  Nonetheless, by the time of his death, he was quite possibly the most famous SF writer of his time. Asimov's first volumes of autobiography were published in 1979 and 1980.  As his health declined and the end drew near, his wife, Janet, encouraged him to write a third volume, less explanatory and more introspective.  He obliged.  "I, Asimov" lacks the surface detail of the early memoirs, but is rich in thought, emotion and self-revelation.  The man that emerges from these pages was witty, intelligent, kind, loyal and genuinely devoted to sharing his knowledge and talents with others.  He could also be vain and arrogant, but he is so honest about these less-attractive attributes that the reader is willing to forgive him anything. There is a cloud of nostalgia and approaching death that hangs over most of "I, Asimov."  The book was written when the author knew he didn't have long to live, and the book reflects that state of mind.  In the end, however, it is uplifting and optimistic rather than depressing and gloom-ridden.  What keeps me from giving it a full five stars is the rather dull middle section, which is significantly less interesing than the beginning and ending.  The first 150 pages of the book are particularly unputdownable.  All in all, this is a superb memoir and well-worth reading.  I highly recommend it.
