 "Gigi" was yet another classic score from lyricist Alan Jay  Lerner and composer Frederick Loewe, the creators of such classics as  "My Fair Lady" and "Brigadoon."  In this beautifully  remastered reissue, not only are all the magnificent songs available, but  also all of Loewe's wonderful incidental music.  What keeps me from giving  this recording five stars, however, is that there is almost TOO MUCH  incidental music, and "Gigi" is such a sugary-sweet score to  begin with that you might find your teeth rotting by the time you finish  listening.  The endless reprises and variations get a little tiring after a  while.  However, the real treat here is the inclusion of three previously  unreleased demos, featuring Leslie Caron's original vocals and some  thunderous, dazzling piano courtesy of "Gigi" musical supervisor  Andre Previn.  Caron's poignant rendition of "Say a Prayer For Me  Tonight" alone is worth the price of admission.  All in all, an  excellent reissue, with interesting essays and pictures included in the  booklet.  So if you admire Lerner's witty lyrics and Loewe's  "sentimental Viennese melodies" (as Previn described them), by  all means--buy "Gigi."
