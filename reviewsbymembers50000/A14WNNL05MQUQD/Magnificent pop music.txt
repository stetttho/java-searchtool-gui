 Tennant and Lowe, the Rodgers and Hart of modern pop music, made their break from Great Singles Band to Great Album Band with 1990's  "Behavior," their most mature, consistent set to date.  Ten songs  that range from moody, atmospheric ballads ("Jealousy" and the  poignant "To Face the Truth") to more upbeat, yet still  bittersweet dance-oriented tracks ("How Can You Expect to Be Taken  Seriously?" and "So Hard"), "Behavior" shows one  of pop music's finest songwriting partnerships at their creative peak.  At  its heart, however, "Behavior" is a profoundly somber reflection  on fame, loneliness, relationships and AIDS.  Occasionally optimism shines  through the dark, pessimistic soundscapes, but "Behavior" remains  one of the definitive albums for the lovelorn.  Tennant and Lowe played it  more lighthearted on 1993's overrated (but still good) "Very" and  1996's "Bilingual" (perhaps their finest album), but they never  again captured the wistful, touching vibe of "Behavior."
