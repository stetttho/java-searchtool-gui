 You think George W. Bush calling himself "bold and decisive" is funny?  Republicans have always been renowned for their biting satirical  skills (think of Gordon Liddy and Put Buchanan), but this is perhaps the  finest example of the fact that Republicans can do more than speak at  racist, anti-Catholic colleges and triple the national debt in eight years  ('81-'89)--they are also sans peer as political satirists.  With this book,  "J.P. Mauro" demonstrates that someone can actually write three  hundred pages worth of "jokes," and still fail to include one  that is actually funny.  No small feat.  This book is a truly pathetic  attempt to counter Al Franken's brilliant, hilarious "Rush Limbaugh is  a Big Fat Idiot" (perhaps the most accurately titled book of the '90s)  with some right-wing barbs.  I hope everyone in America buys this book.  It  will prove everything I've been saying for years about Republicans.
