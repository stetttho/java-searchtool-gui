 OK, tied with their eponymous album (1995) for their best.  "Nightbird" shows that, after 20 years together, Clarke and Bell are still capable of writing perfect pop songs; their creative well is far from dry.  It's been four years since their last collection of original material, and "Nightbird" makes it worth the wait.  With the exception of the weak "I'll Be There," every song on "Nightbird" is a fully realized pop confection, with nothing short of good and several that rank with their very best work.  My personal favorites are "Here I Go Impossible Again" (a hit if I've ever heard one) and "Because Our Love is Real," but the rest of the album is of such quality and consistency that that choosing one track over another would be a difficult task.    Andy is in fine voice and Vince's arrangements are unassailable.  I should note that I think Andy's contributions to Erasure's sound are underrated; he composes most of their vocal melodies and by now should be reckoned one of the supreme pop melodists.  (See my 2001 interview with Vince on the official Erasure website for more information on their songwriting process.)  "Nightbird" is the album Erasure fans have been waiting for since the mid-nineties.  After 1997's slight "Cowboy" and 2000's patchy "Loveboat," we are once more in the realm of "I Say, I Say, I Say" (1994) and "Erasure" (1995).  That's not a bad place to be.
