 Terry Eagleton's "Literary Theory" advertises itself as a clear, lucid introduction to the topic, written for the unitiated.  In many ways, the book fulfills this promise, particularly in its discussions of the New Criticism, reception theory, hermeneutics, deconstruction and the overall arch of literary theory's history.  Eagleton also does a superb job of placing each of these theories within their sociopolitical context (no surprise there).  Most of this book is engaging and well-written. There are weak areas, however.  In his discussions of structuralism, phenomenology and a few other areas, Eagleton gets bogged down and its difficult to get straight to the heart of these methodologies, which is ostensibly the point of this book.  Overall, though, I recommend this to anyone interested in literary theory as an historical and academic phenomenon, and as a fascinating subject in itself, even if you find much of it obscurantist and even devious (which many do). People looking for other introductions to this topic might also look at the equally superb "Literary Theory: A Very Short Introduction" by Cornell deconstruction guru Jonathan Culler, or Peter Barry's excellent "Beginning Theory."
