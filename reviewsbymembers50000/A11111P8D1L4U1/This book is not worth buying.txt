 One quote from mythic is that this book is easier to use than your binder full of maps.  Maybe, but most of the mosters are not labelled on the maps.  If you look at a map of vanern swamp (midgard), it doesn't list 60% of the monsters which is dangerously misleading since it's a high aggro area and this could get you killed.  There are many better monster maps on the internet.  Don't waste your money.  The revised strategy guide, however, is great.
