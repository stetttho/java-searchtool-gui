 I love this game!  I've played the previous two Oddworld games and was a little nervous about the 3D aspect of this game.  Even though the characters are strange, they're very endearing and you find yourself wanting to help them out. I am not very coordinated and I'm not good at first person shooter type games because I react too slowly.  I have no problems playing this game though and it's very addictive.  The game isn't so hard that you can't figure out what to do.  I only had to go on the internet twice to look something up. I definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes this genre.
