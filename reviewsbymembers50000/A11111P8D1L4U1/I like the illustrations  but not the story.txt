 This book was compared to the Harry Potter books in a famous entertainment magazine and I decided to purchase it since I loved the Harry Potter books.  I am not sure if the targetted age group for this book is the same as H.P., but it feels much more juvenile.    The author keeps interrupting the story to define words, which is highly annoying.  Also the characters are not very well developed and everything is very predictable.  It does not live up to the hype.  Check it out in a library before you spend your money on it.
