 This review is in reference to the collector's edition DVD. I love the movie and I thought I would spend a little extra getting the special edition DVD vs. the regular DVD, but I don't really feel it was worth it.   The "outtakes" are only 30 seconds in total.  "Bridging the  comedy chasm" was about 15 minutes long and wasn't terribly exciting  or insightful.  My recommendation is to skip the collector's version
