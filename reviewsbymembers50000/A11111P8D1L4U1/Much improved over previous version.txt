 This book is a vast improvement over the first version of this book.  This book is more organized, up-to-date and helpful.  Obviously, with a game that is contstantly changing, no book could ever be perfect, but it seems like they put a lot more thought and effort into gathering information. I definitely recommend picking it up, it's very well done.  For those of you who were burned by the first one, go to a book store and computer store and look at this one.  You'll be able to see the difference immediately.  I do not regret buying it.
