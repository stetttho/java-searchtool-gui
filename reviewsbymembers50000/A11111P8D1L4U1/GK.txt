 I thought the sotry of the game was very good.  As with the other GK games, there's a lot of history to wade through, however I found it very fun.  The only thing I didn't like was the graphics.  I think they could  have spent more time on that.  The movies in between some of the chapters  were the same polygonic 3D images from the game instead of realistic  movies.  There is also a lot of religion in the game (many different  types), but it's not telling you what's right or wrong. It's worth the  money, buy the 3D is sometimes annoying.
