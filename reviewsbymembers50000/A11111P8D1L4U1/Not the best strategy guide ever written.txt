 The book has useful information but it is poorly organized and the maps are terrible.  They have these numbers all over them, but there's no separate key that lists what these number represent.  Instead you have to  search through pages and pages of text to see when the "number"  is semi-explained. Plus they leave out key information on some of the  maps/sections.  There's no index in the book either, which makes finding  something almost impossible. Poor organization is why I give this book 3  stars.  However, there's some useful content that kept me from giving it 1  star.
