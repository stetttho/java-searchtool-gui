 There is NO show on TV today that I love watching, besides the Golden Girls.   I get home just before 6 PM and my friends all know NEVER to try calling me while the Girls are on.  Even my two cats do not bother me when the girls are on.  My newest kitten, Benson, will lay on the sofa next to me and actually watch the episodes.  He knows a good show when he sees it! Come on!  Bring out the ENTIRE series on DVD NOW!   We want to buy it for Christmas...  Who needs any other presents if we can have the DVD's?
