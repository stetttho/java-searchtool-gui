 I always enjoyed seeing the VHS version of La Cage Aux Folles and am happy to see it now on DVD.   The movie is great and glad to see that it was resurrected again in the 90's with Robin Williams and Nathan Lane.   I think the original is by far more enjoyable.  My only criticism is the audio seems rather weak.
