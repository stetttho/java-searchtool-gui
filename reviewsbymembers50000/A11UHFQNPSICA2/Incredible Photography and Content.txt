 This book is a must for those who truly enjoy a great table!  The photos are magnificent and is beautifully written.  I found that I learned a LOT by simply looking at the photos of china, crystal and glassware.  From this  book alone, I chose my sterling silver flatware and china patterns and have  never regretted it!   The book also gives ideas on simple room decorations  as well - even though this is not a primary focus of the book itself.   I  really can't say enough good about this book......
