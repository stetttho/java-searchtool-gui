 Agatha Raisin is quite the character.  After living as a Public Relations guru in the heart of London, Agatha decides to settle down in a quiet and cozy Cotswold village called Carsley.  It proves to be everything she hoped for, including the thatched roofs and flower gardens.   It's not long after her arrival that she finds life in the country rather lonely.  In order to make new local village friends, Agatha decides to enter the village quiche-making contest.  Never being a cook herself, she buys one already made and enters it as her own.  The trouble begins when her quiche poisons and kills the judge of the contest. Is it accidental poisoning or murder?  Leave it to Agatha to bulldoze her way to the truth!  She's bossy, impatient, sometimes grumpy but always a good person with a good heart.  A must read for anyone who enjoys english country life, baking contests, and a real sense of humour!
