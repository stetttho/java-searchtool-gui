 Although I have seen a few of the Victoria books, I must say that this issue was mildly disappointing in compared with previous editions.  I really think volume 3 was by far the best of the bunch. Overall, this books gives good ideas about decorating and cooking for Christmas.   A good resource for those who like to make their own ornaments and home decorations.
