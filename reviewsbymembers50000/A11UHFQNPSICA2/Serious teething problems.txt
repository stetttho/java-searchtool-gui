 I had to learn the hard way again:  Never buy a NEW piece of electronic gadgetry until it's been out for some time and the bugs are ironed out.   It appears that others who bought this unit have dealt with similar issues  as me.  I finally returned the unit and opted to live without the  techno-advances until a newly-created unit is truly dependable and doesn't  need to be hand-held through it's programming.  I was under the impression  that equipment like this was there to serve OUR needs, not the other way  around!    The concept is great, but I would advise folks to really  research their options before purchasing.
