 My first introduction to Andreas Vollenweider was in the mid 80's while listening to a "space music" station in Atlanta GA.  I was hooked and bought this LP.   I have since bought 3 others of his albums and eventually replaced them with the CD's. I had the fortunate opportunity to see him play live in the mid-80's (also in Atlanta) and was spellbound.   It was the finest concert I have ever attended.  I really loved it! Although somewhat mystic or even crunchy, it is music to really "feel".   In this day of daily world terror and disease, it is nice to come home after a long day at the office and unwind and refocus while listening to Andreas. He's really quite wonderful.  I would absolutely recommend anyone new to his music to start with this CD.  Graduate on to Caverna Magica next....  You will be forever a fan!
