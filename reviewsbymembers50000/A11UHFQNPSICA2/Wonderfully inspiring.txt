 Although I have been away from the world of Miniatures for 20 years, I was really inspired when I opened this book.  The rooms were beyond beautiful!   I will make every effort to see these miniature rooms in person when I next visit Chicago. I'd love to own a room box or two but would REALLY love to have a full-scale version of these rooms to live in!  So realistic and detailed!
