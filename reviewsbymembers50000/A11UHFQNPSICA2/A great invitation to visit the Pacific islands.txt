 A very nice book chock full of pictures.  I was only a little bit disappointed by the lack of more interior photos.   Having travelled to French Ploynesia (Tahiti, Bora Bora) I was familiar with some of the pictures I saw.  The book serves as a wonderful introduction to the landscape, homes, and lives of the islanders. I highly recommend this book !
