 La Cage II has always been my favourite of all the La Cage movies (there are 3 total).   I am happy to see it in DVD format and happy too, that the audio is better than La Cage I.   I highly recommend you see this movie.  It is quite good!  There are plenty of action scenes throughout the comedy that will make you truly laugh.  From Nice, France to Italy go Renato and Albin hiding from international spys....
