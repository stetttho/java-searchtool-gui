 One of the best films to ever grace my screen.  The film was quite spectacular and really helped to understand the history of WWII more as an outsider caught up in the policies of war.  I really felt as though I was  there and found myself becoming "friends" with each and every one  of the characters.  Definately calls for a trip to Florence now!  Baird  Wallace has a wonderful career ahead of him.  Cher was-as usual- great!   Judi Dench's character was lovable and emotional.  Joan Plowright was truly  a gem among stones.  She's brilliant!  Don't bother to rent this movie.   buy it for you, your family and your grandkids.  You won't be disappointed!
