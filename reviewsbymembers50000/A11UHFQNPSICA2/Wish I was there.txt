 In the movie that billy Crystal directed, I WAS there. It was amazing! I have never been a big fan of baseball but after reading/watching 61*, I am hooked.  I'm saddened that I was not of age then to have known of Mickey and Roger. I think they would have left a big impression on me as a kid.  The players now seem more interested in money, women, and  living the high life.  I am grateful to have been brought up in an era of real heros. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in baseball or simply a good human interest story. I'll look forward the the DVD version of the movie 61*.
