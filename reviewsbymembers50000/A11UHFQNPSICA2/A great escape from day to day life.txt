 I never knew about this movie until the Summer of 1987 when I saw the video cover in a local video rental store.   I had gone to Santorini in 1981 and spent 3 weeks there exploring it alone.  The movie brought back many memories and I thought the portrayal of life on Santorini was very accurate.  I admit I did not have a three-way while there, but I enjoyed it none-the-less! It was only recently that I discovered that Valerie Quennessen had passed away from an automobile accident.  I found her to be the life of the movie and thought her beauty was unbelievable.  One of her great lines was "Jealousy doesn't prove how much you love someone, it proves how insecure you are - Margaret Mead: I think I have that book here somewhere"  At that time (1987) I found myself healing from a broken relationship and somehow that line of Lena's made me understand a lot.   I had been to Akrotiri and Perissa Beach while visiting and found the film captured the feeling one gets when you are actually there.  Unlike a couple of reviewers who were so disgusted about the nudity in the film, I thougt it was done with accuracy and in good taste.  Europeans don't have the same hangups that we Americans do about our bodies. I applaud the director for not 'Americanizing' the film.   Overall, it was a great reminder of my Summer in Santorini and I now occasionally watch the video when I am wanting to escape the day-to-day trials.  It's a great video for escape and discovering yourself and life.  Should you ever have the chance to visit Santorini, GO and HAVE the BEST time of your life!
