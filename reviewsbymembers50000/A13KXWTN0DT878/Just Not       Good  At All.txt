 John Carpenter did Halloween, yes? He did! And he also created The Thing and The Fog. All three of those were creative horror movies full of spirit (Well, the spirit of horror). Let's take John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars and compare this to those movies. Oops, we can't. Because Ghosts of Mars [stunk] beyond total belief. I believe that is the harshest words I've ever used for a movie. But I believe it's true. The acting was terrible (Except that given by Jason Statham as Jericho). I expected so much more from Pam Grier and Clea Duvall, but got nothing. The concept was a very good one, but it was executed without any interest. And there were so many characters that at one point, I wondered where one of them came from.   The only good stuff about Ghosts of Mars is: The makeup. The makeup effects were extremely awesome. That being of the mauled faces of the "ghosts." There were a lot of ammo wasting / battle scenes, and those were good and tightly paced. The scenes just seemed to not matter much when you don't care for the characters much (And there's really no use anyway as . . . allow me not to spoil this even though I despised it).  The DVD has some features that I really didn't care for so I didn't watch them.   Sorry if I seem so bitter about this movie. I can't even believe I sat throughout the entire thing. Or wait, I did wait to see if Clea Duvall brought anything to the movie. She didn't. A shame. I still love her as an actress though.
