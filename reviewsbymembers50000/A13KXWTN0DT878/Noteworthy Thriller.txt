 The Skulls is a well-paced and well-acted thriller. Joshua Jackson is Luke McNamara. An Ivy League college student who isn't doing to well with paying his tuition. To certify his place in completing college and have a successful future, he wants in with the Skulls. An intermediate group of young men who are guaranteed anything they want in life. After getting in, Luke's life begins to fall apart as his best friend is murdered and his girlfriend is on the run. Should Luke trust the secret society and his new friend Caleb, or try to get out of the society alive?  The Skulls, for some reason, gives me an at-home feeling. I kind of relate to each character in a way, and that shows that each actor gave a pretty good performance. Joshua Jackson, Paul Walker, and Leslie Bibb shine as the leads. Craig T. Nelson also gives a nice performance. The plot and pacing of The Skulls is excellent. The scenes meant to be intense are just that, and scenes meant to be heartfelt and fun are just that too.  The DVD isn't loaded, but it's pretty note worthy to any fan of the movie. A commentary is given by director Bob Cohen. I actually found this quiet entertaining as Cohen explains concepts of the movie and other things. There are a few deleted scenes with commentary by Cohen. It is seen why these were cut. There's also a Making Of featurette that works mostly as a promo spot. To round it up are the theatrical trailer and some very interesting production notes.  For any fan of the movie or its stars, this DVD is a must have and a must keep.
