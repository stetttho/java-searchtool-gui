 Having never had the need to see a Rob Schneider flick, I was surprised when I actually decided to rent The Hot Chick. Honestly, I rented it more to see Anna Farris because the girl has a knack for comedy by just using her facial expressions. But instead of thoughtfully being disappointed by Rob Schneider's performance, I found him to be rather funny and endearing even. Yes, endearing.   Schneider (A criminal) and "perfect" high school girl Jessica mistakenly switch bodies after putting on a pair of ancient earrings that has the mystical ability to switch bodies. All in all, they take this plot and make a minimum spoof on high school. But there's much more to see in The Hot Chick. Actual lessons on friendship, family, and love are here too. I guess that's where "endearing" is coming from.   Rob Schneider and Anna Farris' chemistry in the film really pulled this along also. The club scene was a riot. Watch for that one. The supporting cast all had different little quirks and made for some great laughs along the way. There's a cameo from Adam Sandler to boot, too.   In the end, The Hot Chick was worth my rental and I didn't bother with the special features. I'm saving them for when I buy the DVD, because The Hot Chick is worth it.
