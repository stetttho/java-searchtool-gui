 We all know what to expect when it comes to horror and Wes Craven: A mixture of a nightmarish world and dark humour. We've seen it done wonderfully in A Nightmare on Elm Street, Wes Craven's New Nightmare, Scream, The Serpent and the Rainbow, and many more. Dracula 2000 is no exception, except for the fact that it adds something new to the mix. Intense action sequences. Sure they rip off The Matrix, but they work in a film about creatures who are supposed to have unique skills and powers.  The back story created that connected Van Helsing, Mary, and Dracula was very interesting, and kept the movie together. You can tell by the commentary given to the movie by director Patrick Lussier and screenwriter Joel Soisson that research went into coming up with the story, and they wanted the film to be serious and have a story. I believe that's why some people didn't enjoy the movie. They didn't know whether to take the film seriously, or just let it be "eye candy". True, it does have the appeal of "eye candy", but when you understand the going on behind the film, you can begin to take it seriously. So I highly recommend giving the audio commentary on the DVD a listen. Dracula 2000 managed to snag a talented cast full of up-and-coming stars (Sean Patrick Thomas, Jennifer Esposito) and veterans of acting (Christopher Plummer), and even a pop star (Colleen Fitzpatrick aka Vitamin C). Justine Waddell, who plays the main female lead, Mary, did very well at putting heart into her character, but her given dialogue is sometimes - to me - overacted, but in the end she does quiet well. Her voiceover in the end was effective. And I can't write a review without mentioning the person who played Dracula, Gerard Butler. Butler had the actions, the eyes, and the voice to play a perfect Dracula. Watch Dracula 2000 the first time with an open-mind, and then watch it with the commentary. Both times, it will be like a different movie.
