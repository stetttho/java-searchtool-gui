 I've been a fan of the Buffy books for a long time, and it's always good to see a new author write a book for the series. John Passarella wrote a pretty impressive book. Ghoul Trouble is set early in the third season, even before Xander and Willow kissed, and it was pretty awesome to see how Passerela was able to keep the continuity. I even caught hints that lead to things in season 4. I also liked how Passarella managed to make 2 main villians for this book, each is as interesting as the other. A little more folklore was even started, about the existence of ghouls, and to add to the danger of the 2 main villians, he takes 3 of the people closest to Buffy and puts them in instant danger. But what really made this book was the twist the takes place during one of the final battles with one of the main villians. It wasn't obvious to me at all while I was reading the book, and when I got to the twist, I knew I couldn't stop reading. I look forward to see if John Passarella will write another Buffy novel.
