 Nancy and her friends are afraid. They're being tormented by a burned man who wears a red and green sweater and a dirty hat. And he has knives for fingers. They tell themselves he's not real because he only appears in their dreams. But when one of them is found dead, Nancy begins to suspect something more sinister and must get to the bottom of it before they're all dead.   That plot, my friends, is pure genius. It was created by director Wes Craven. The man described above and created by Craven is Freddy Krueger. Freddy was a child murderer in Springsville. When the parents caught on to him, they burned him inside a boiler room and buried him in a junkyard. Little to the parent's knowing, Freddy sold his soul so he could get revenge on the ones who put him to death. By using dreams. Freddy enters the dreams and the unconscious state of mind to murder his victims. This, to me and many others, is what makes A Nightmare on Elm Street so interesting. Most of the time, when you sleep, you sleep in your room. And your room is your safehole, where you go to get away from the terrors of life. Craven took that concept, and took that away from the characters in the movie. They couldn't go lie down and fall asleep to escape Freddy. That's when he got you.   The directing in NOES was brilliant. Every shadow, every sound, every scare was set up at the right moment. Heather Langenkamp starred as Nancy Thompson, our heroine. Heather's acting wasn't the best, but it didn't make the movie bad. I couldn't imagine anyone else as Nancy, so kudos to Heather! Johnny Deep made his film debut in NOES, and did pretty well. All of the other actors did well. And I can't leave out Robert Englund. He's the person behind the burnt skin and red and green sweater. He brought Freddy for life, and made one of horror's most memorable icon.   Nightmare on Elm Street has gone down as a horror legend, and will always live up to that.
