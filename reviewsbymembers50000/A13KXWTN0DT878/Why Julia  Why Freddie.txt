 Ok, I rented this movie thinking it to be a fairly good movie. Really, I didn't know what to think since noone I knew had seen it, neither had I seen any reviews written anywhere, and it didn't stay in the theater long  here. So I rented, and watched it. It seemed like forever while I was  watching it. All I am asking is why waste GREAT talent (Freddie Prinze,  Jr., Julia Stiles) on such a dull movie. Don't get me wrong, their acting  was great (except for Selma Blair playing a porn star), but the plot was  totally predictable. When the credits rolled, I understood why noone  reviewed this nor saw it.
