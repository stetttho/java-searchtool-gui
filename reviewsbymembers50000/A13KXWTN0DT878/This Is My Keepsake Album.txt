 What made me exceedingly happy at one moment in time? Receiving Look Around by Anthony Rapp. Having become a fan of Anthony through Rent, being able to hear music written and sung by himself was bound to make my respect and like for Anthony even larger. And so it did. After hearing the first song (Living Alive) and instantly connecting with its simple -- yet effective -- lyrics, my enthusiasm for the cd grew. As I passed on to each song, I fell in love with Anthony's music. 'Look Around' is a jazzy number bound to make you think of a loved one. 'Then Again' and 'Human Tornado' both have more of the rock / punk feel, and each one is supplied by awesome vocals. 'Always' starts off with a haunting piano tune and moves into a more expressive tune as Anthony begins to sing. 'Just Some Guy' will ultimately make you want to be with your special someone, or long for that special someone, as it shows how sweet and simple love can be. 'Goodbye' is absolutely one of those power ballads proving that it is simple to move on. Whilst 'Room to Breathe' can be taken many ways, it's a good songs full of memorable quotes -- some of which I use daily. 'Lesson #1' is soft and one of the sadder songs on the cd, while 'Visits to You' follows in the sadness yet both songs speak highly for themselves and are meaningful. One of the best songs on the cd is 'Out Out Damned Spot.' The song is full of spunk and nifty tunes, not to mention the meaning in the song is down and to the point. To end the cd is 'Now I Know', and with Anthony's soothing voice, it's a quaint way to end a great and worthy cd.    Anthony Rapp has -- to me -- excelled with Look Around. The songs will always play a part in my life, as corny as that may seem. It's true.
