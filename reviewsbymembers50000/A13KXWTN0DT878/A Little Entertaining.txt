 The New Guy, just one of the many teen movies we were being slapped with monthly a few years ago. But now they're just sporadicly released, and I guess that's making them a little better. For The New Guy, although not flashy or star-filled, was an entertaining flick.   The story is a twist on the "fish out of water" plot with the main character, Dizzy, transcending from "a blip on the radar screen" to one of the most mysterious yet undeniably hip students at a high school. His transformation is done by a prison mate who - and I found this weird - could be visited frequently. There were actually a lot of weird plot hole instances in this movie, but they're easily overlooked for the film has a sense of stupidity about it. Which could annoy some, but make it entertaining enough for others.  DJ Squalls was perfect for this role, and although not an A-list actor, he handles himself well and has a bit of comic timing. Eddie Griffin is - as always - annoyingly funny, yet his act is toned down here and his humour is felt a bit more than normal. Eliza Dushku carries us through with the lead female, and she's luscious as always. I've got to note that there were some interesting cameos throughout the entire movie.   While the DVD is almost featureless (a music video, the trailer, etc.), The New Guy is a good buy if you enjoyed the flick itself.
