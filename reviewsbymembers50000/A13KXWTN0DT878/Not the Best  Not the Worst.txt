 It's true that Valentine is cliched, most of the stuff in the movie has been done before, and the killer is reminiscent of Michael Myers from Halloween, but that really doesn't mean you need to down the movie. You can tell that Jamie Blanks (Who also directed Urban Legend) mostly paid homage to all of his favorite slasher and horror movies. He even admits to it himself in the commentary given on the DVD. And Blanks also sounds like he has fun doing what he does.  Valentine has also been classified as a teen slasher, when in fact, it isn't. Sure it has some of today's hottest "Teen" stars -- who are actually in their early thirties and late twenties - but the characters themselves are adults over the age of 25. And I do admit, some of the acting was quiet bad, but that only added to the fun of the movie. Marley Shelton did well as our heroine. She acted best when she was running or was terrified, but did well when she wasn't. David Boreanaz is her recovering alcoholic boyfriend. He was really underused in this film. Katherine Heigl, Jessica Caulfiell, Jessica Capeshaw, and Denise Richards round out the main cast.   There are some very interesting chase scenes in this movie. The first is suspenseful, while the second wasn't much of one. The second could have really been good if they'd played it out longer. The true highlight of the movie is Denise Richards. Not because she acted well or flaunted her cleavage the most. It's because . . . well, if I said, I'd give away some of the movie. Let's just say, when she meets up with the killer -- whether she dies or not - what takes place is the best thing in the movie.   Valentine was a fun watch. Although the ending is quiet confusing.
