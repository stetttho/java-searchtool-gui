 The Watcher's Guide is the ULTIMATE Buffy viewers' book. It has everything from the first 2 seasons. I really mean that, nothing is missing. You can read about each episode, and even get dialogue that was cut from the  episodes, and the bloopers and mistakes in the episodes. Read bios of all  the actors & actresses in Buffy, and their characters. See who dated  who, and who liked who, just everything you need to know! If you just  started watching Buffy, and have no idea what's going on, buy this book, to  see what happened in the first 2 seasons, and wait for The Watcher's Guide  2, for seasons 3 & 4.
