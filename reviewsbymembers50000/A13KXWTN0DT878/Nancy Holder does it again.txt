 'The Evil that Men Do'is not only a good book, but surprisingly eerie in the beginning. A popoular grade-A student suddenly kills his parents and then goes on a shooting spree at his school. The way the part of the story  was told was just too eerie, and seemed realistic. This when Buffy and the  crew come in. After Willow is shot but not badly injured, and Oz and  Cordelia are kidnapped, and the whole town of Sunnydale is a lil bit on the  off side (meaning there are fights, fires, riots, and everything going on),  Buffy knows there's more to this than teen angst. This is when the little  brother of the kid who shot comes in, and everyone is accusing him of the  killings. Everyone in town are after the kid, and it's up to Buffy and the  gang to keep him safe. Little to their knowledge to begin with, two big bad  vampires are planning on resurrecting a Greek goddess so they can rule the  world. What's so neat about this book is that it includes some Greek  culture. Such as the lions in the battle dome, but it's not lions they're  using. You also get insight on a slayer that was in Greece a long time ago.  If you're a Buffy fan, or not, and you are looking for a good  thriller/horror/drama book, then check this one out.
