 After being brought up on the motion picture soundtrack of Grease, it was kind of hard to get used to the Broadway stylings of the music. At first, I didn't like it one bit. I discarded the CD as soon as possible. But then an interest in theatre and Broadway grew in me, and I decided to give this CD a listen. Although I still do not find it as a great listen, I did begin to like it more than I used to.   What really threw me off was the voice stylings here. They're a bit off. Like an earlier reviewer mentioned, the Sandy was a bit Rizzo, and Rizzo was a bit Sandy. I did find it kind of neat when I found out that Barry Bostwick (Rocky Horror) was the Danny here. He faired well, but still, like the rest of the cast and company, he was a bit off.   I look at this CD as the originic beginning of the Grease phenomena. But it goes low on my list of favorite Grease recordings.
