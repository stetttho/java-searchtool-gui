 Here I am, one of the last of the people to jump on the Harry Potter "train." I'm also one of the many who thought the whole idea was ridicolous (even though I love any and everything fantasy), and would never give the book a try. I was eventually coaxed by some co-workers that I should open myself to the Potter world, and I finally gave them and Potter a chance. I can say I'm not at all dissapointed. I was instantly thrown into the world, and glad to say I enjoyed it.   The biggest thing that enthralled me was all of the history, research, ideas, and characters (with which you fall in love with or begin to hate) that Rowling introduced in such a short book. A lot is established within such a short space that it makes me completely curious as to how much more Rowling introduces in further books.  And now on to see about it.
