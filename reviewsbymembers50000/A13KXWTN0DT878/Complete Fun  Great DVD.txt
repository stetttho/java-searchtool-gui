 Killer Klowns from Outer Space is a zany, fun ride through cinematic B-movie world. It is the prime example of a B-movie. There's bad acting or over-acting, crazy plot details, and wacky characters. The plot is simple. Aliens in the form of clowns begin to take over a town. It's up to a police officer and a group of teens to stop them. Grant Cramer and Suzanne Snyder are great as our hero and heroine. Personally, I like Suzanne Snyder. Even though I've only seen her in 2 horror movies, both B-movie material, there's just something about her. John Nelson is our co-hero.   A lot of the movie was set and costume-based, as you can see in the movie. The klowns are something to look at. The normal horrible clown face (I have a clown fear) is twisted and gnarled into an even uglier clown face on these guys. Their actions and what they do just creeped me out.   The DVD is any KKFOS fan's dream. There's plenty of supplemental material. The featurettes feature interviews with the film's creators, the Chiodo Brothers. They also contain some behind the scenes shots, and the last featurette contains films made by the three in their early days. The featurettes do drag some, but are fun to watch. Also included are two deleted scenes. One that features our three main people walking on a "tight-rope", and the other is Suzanne's character explaining why she has a fear of clowns. I actually liked that scene, but I believe both can sometimes be seen in the TV versions. Also included are a number of photo and still galleries, and the original theatrical trailer. There's also a commentary with the Chiodo Bros. The picture is the clearest I've ever seen this movie. The audio is pretty good, but there is a moment in the film where the dubbing is off for about 5 minutes. The main menu is very animated with sounds and theme music, while others are static backgrounds.   The Killer Klowns from Outer Space DVD is certainly a must buy for fans of the movie and those of B-movies.
