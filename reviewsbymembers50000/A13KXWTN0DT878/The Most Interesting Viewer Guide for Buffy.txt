 Christopher Golden an his co-writers now have reign over the title  "Best Authors of a Buffy Viewer Guide" (something like that). The  book is the ultimate source to find out about the monsters, demons,  vampires, and more that have appeared on Buffy. Everything said about the  "monsters" are very detailed, and their current status is even  mentioned. Then, after each category, ancient lore and the history of the  type of monster and pop culture references are told. I think that is what  makes the book very interesting.
