 Hairspray has got to be one of the more upbeat musicals out there. Taking place in the 60s, it quietly spoofs what the 60s was about, but has the ability to bring meaning into its "to the point" subjects. Tracy (the endearing Marissa Jaret Winokur) Turnblad is our star, and she opens up her doubts and happiness in the opening song "Good Morning Baltimore." What happens after this song is a mixture of 60s rock, pop, and soul that exclaims the rest of the story as Tracy falls in love with heartthrob Link, and Tracy's friend Penny is in love with a black guy, Seaweed. The latter subject is, of course, racy for all times, but is handled very quaintly and with little humour in the song "Run and Tell That!". The show ends with the very upbeat and catchy "You Can't Stop the Beat!"  With it's uplifting story, excellent song writing (thanks to Scott Whitman), and wonderfully rounded and talented cast, Hairspray is sure to be a Broadway hit.
