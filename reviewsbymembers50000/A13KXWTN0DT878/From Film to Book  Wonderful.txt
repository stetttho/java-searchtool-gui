 About A Boy is quite the swell movie! Having read the titular book by Nick Hornsby, I was a little afraid to watch the movie in fear that it would go against the book. I was a little surprised that it stayed faithful to the book throughout the entire movie. Albeit it is a movie adaptation so some things were changed, but nothing to make me regret the film.   Hugh Grant is Will, an actual good-for-nothing who lives off the fame of his father's famed Christmas song which he despises. During a scheme to pick up single mom's, he becomes involved in the life of 12 year old social outcast, Marcus played by Nicholas Hoult. The Weitz bros., the directors, took Hornsby's novel and made it perfectly viewable. The transition between scenes has a great pace and the playout of the evolving fatherlike relationship Will begins to have over Marcus is shown with heart. Hugh Grant handles the part of Will with charm. He showed a great performance. Nicholas Hoult as Marcus was a great choice for the role. I hope the kid has much more opportunities in his future; however they'll probably be British productions. Toni Collette (Very quirky in an off way in this film) and the beautiful Rachel Weisz also costar.   The DVD is a hefty one. Picture and audio transfers are great. The supplemental material is satisfying. Especially neat is the "English to English" which is a featurette on British slang.   About A Boy succeeded to be touching and enjoyable as both a book and a movie. The two make a perfect pair, although I suggest reading the book before the movie. Or perhaps not, for more effect on the film. Either way, they're both wonderful.
