 The plot: A group of film students decide to film a "cursed" horror film, but all of a sudden, they begin to get murdered by a masked killer, one by one. Sound familiar? Yep, it's bone done similarly in Urban Legends : The Final Cut and Scream 3. But Cut managed to pull the plot off exceptionally well. And sometimes, with more suspense. That's what this movie is full of. Suspense. There will be times when it seems as if the killer will pop out of nowhere, but he calmly walks onto the scene. That was one of the awesome things about Cut. Another is the killer itself. The mask is a bit creepy, and he's not afraid to use anything in hand to murder his victims. Although it seems like fire was his favorite. Another formula that was used in this movie was that they combined the slasher movie technique with the evil spirit technique. The two were combined, and didn't slow the movie down one bit. The cast of characters were awesome, but stereotyped. You had the joker, the tough one, the slut, the sweet one, the innocent one, and the one you think is the killer but turns out not be. And then there is the one person who graced this film. Molly Ringwald. After seeing her in all of those 80s teen romantic comedies, I was surprised at how well she did in the horror genre. All in all, it isn't as good as Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer, but is much better than I Still Know What You Did Last Summer and Urban Legend.
