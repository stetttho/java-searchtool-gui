 The Sounds. The from out of nowhere band that I happened to catch on a daytime variety show. They performed Seven Days A Week. And during the middle of the performance, I knew I would definitely like this band.  Maja Ivarsson's similarity to the Blondie in both looks and sound is uncanny. And instead of trying to be a rip-off, she  takes her own stand and is her own person. The band supplies some great beats and backup to Ivarsson's singing. Some may say that a lot of the songs sound alike. I say they don't, listen to The Donnas for that.   The Sounds breathes fresh air into a reminiscent 80s sound, and Living In America is a great album.
