 I'm the kind of person who gets excited over movies by seeing the trailers. I even get chills from trailers, and this one of those "chilled" movies. The plot: A group of ship-wrecked survivors fight for their lives on a planet overrun by dark loving blood-thirsty creatures. The positivities: The acting was awesome, and I was glad to see a movie full of fresh faces. They may not be new actor(resses), but they aren't widely known. But after this movie, they should all be recognized for their great acting and characterization. Especially Vin Deisel who played a convicted murder with heat censored eyes who plays the hero of the movie. The guy's intensity made his character (a top-notch murderer) very mysterious, and spontaneous. Radha Mitchell did great as our heroine and leader, and the young actress who played the girl who disguised herself as a guy were awesome additions to the cast. The suspense was kept up scale after the eclipse happened that allowed the creatures to come out of hiding. You keep asking yourself: Who's going to die next? Or when they're going to die. The negative: This isn't really a negative thing, but there are some places in the movie where you feel as if you're watching the sequel to Starship Troopers. Although the creatures are totally different and more high-tech looking, there was just something about the movie that gave me the feeling. All in all, Pitch Black is a great sci-fi/horror that is well worth seeing, and buying.
