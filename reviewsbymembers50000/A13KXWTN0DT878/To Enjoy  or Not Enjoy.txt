 There are two ways you can view Halloween H20. Number One: Forget that Halloween 4-6 were ever made, and believe that Halloween 1-2 are the only existing ones. This would make for an enjoyable horror movie. At times, H20 has a bit of the same feel of the original and its sequel, but an updated feel to it. Michael is a bit more brutal here, but it was the 90's and the Scream phase was going on. Jamie Lee Curtis is as strong as ever as Laurie Strode, and plays off her "near the brink of insanity" persona very well. The final showdown -- er -- showdown between her and Michael in the school is a very tense and good setup. The acting from the supporting characters is very acceptable. Especially that of Josh Hartnett.   Now, let's see it from my second viewpoint. In Halloweens 4-6, Laurie Strode supposedly had another child. Jamie Strode, and it was these 3 films that focused on Michael trying to kill her. He finally managed to do so in part 6, but not before she also had a child. And what about the whole Thorn occult deal that Michael is linked to? This is what upsets me about the Halloween series in general, it didn't keep up with its continuity. And with Halloween Resurrection's release, they even space themselves more with discontinuity by completely ignoring Laurie's son, John (Josh Hartnett). Read my Halloween Resurrection review for more on what I have to say.  When I do watch H20 (And I do occasionally because it's entertaining), I try to set my movie-mind with the fact that there is no Halloween 4-6, and that this is only the third entry in the series. I at least enjoy it better when I think that.
