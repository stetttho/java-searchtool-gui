 Although there are a few horror movies that make their way into wide-release theatres and are truly worth it (The Others, Jeepers Creepers), there a few gems that are always kept undertow. Ginger Snaps is definitely one of them. After reading many positive reviews for about half a year, I finally got my hands on a copy. And I loved it. I place it high on my list of horror movies.   The story tells the tale of two goth sisters, Brigitte and Ginger, who have always stuck by each other's side. While attempting to play a trick on someone at night, Ginger is viciously attacked (Incredible directing during that scene!) by what seemed like a wild dog. After this, Ginger begins to change dramatically, and not the way a growing young woman should change.  Ginger Snaps, while in itself is a horror, has plenty of dramatic elements. The bond between the two sisters is shown tight in the beginning, and throughout the movie when it begins to loosen, we can truly feel the feelings of Brigitte as she watches Ginger change and as she does all that she can to save her sister. Emily Perkins (Brigitte) and Katherine Isabelle (Ginger) perfected their roles, and gave a lot of depth to their character, making the movie more enjoyable. The mood is set right in every scene, and there is never an off scene. It looks as if John Fawcett definitely knows how to set the mood. And I praise the special effects department of Ginger Snaps. The werewolf looked great and was never once hokey looking.   While Ginger Snaps never made it to wide release here in the states, I hope it finds a fan base on dvd (Very jealous of the Canadians who have a special edition) & video. It deserves it.
