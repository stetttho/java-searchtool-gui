 First they slithered, then they walked, now they fly. With each step of evolution "graboids" take, they get deadlier. And with each new Tremors movie there is, they stay the same. The entertainment value and campy fun is the same in each. Of course, there's more of it all in the first, but with the second and third, the Tremor movies are still fun!   In the latest, Tremors 3 : Back to Perfection, we are taken back to Perfection, Nevada where the first movie takes place. Burt (Michael Gross) is the main star in this entry, and we first see him shooting down a herd of Shriekers in front of a frightened tv crew. This was a great opener for Tremors 3. We are then introduced to new characters (Shawn Christian & Susan Chaung) and some familiar faces from the first Tremors. Tony Genaro (Miquel), Charlotte Stewart (Nancy), Bobby Jacoby (Melvin), and Ariana Richards (Mindy) all return. And this makes this movie more at home than the second, and gives a great feeling to it. And also many references to the first. From Walter Chang's store which is now ran by his granddaughter Jodi Chang to the infamous Perfection Valley water tower.  Tremors 3 is the same mixture of fun and rock-to-rock terror. And being a fan of the series, I wouldn't mind seeing a Tremors 4 with Michael Gross in the lead.
