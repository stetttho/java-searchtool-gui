 When Sherrie Rene Scott begins that timeless Every Story Is A Love Story, you are drawn into a world of love, betrayal, and unforgettable performances. Tim Rice and Elton John have produced a timely piece of Broadway history with Aida. The music found here is jolting and memorable and is orchestrated wonderfully.   Adam Paschal (I'm a Rent head!) and Heather Headley are our star-crossed lovers, and their voices are some of the most powerful and thought provoking to have ever struck my ears. Adam Paschal proves his power in Fortune Favors the Brave, and as his character softens, the tone in his singing softens and goes with the story. The man has a talent, and uses it gracefully. Heather Headley has a beautiful voice and has many moments to use her voice. I have to mention her in Dance of the Robe, she's wonderful. Sherie Rene Scott is a wonder also. Her voice is powerful and fun (My Strongest Suit) and at other times, pierces your heart (I Know the Truth).  I'm a fan of theatre and Broadway music stylings. I love it when true character and heart is put into song. True character and heart is exactly what you'll find in Tim Rice and Elton John's Aida.
