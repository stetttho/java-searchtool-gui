 Season 2 of Angel takes a couple of steps up from it's freshman season, and takes its viewers on an escapage that is just as fresh, fun, emotional, and scary as Buffy itself. It doesn't hold the same feeling as Buffy does, but it produces itself a new feeling, a feeling for the Angelverse.  Season 2 begin to flesh out its characters. Angel, Cordelia, and Wesley's role as Angel Investigations has continued past its last horrific experience, but this time they're in an awesome new setting. With the addition of Gunn and Lorne, the cast now seems to be round and about complete. With Darla's return and the evil that is Wolfram and Hart, there is never a bore. Especially with the inclusion of Drusilla (whose moments of insanity are better than ever).   Angel season 2 settles the show for it's future seasons and future storylines, as it is a season of building and pretense.   The DVD presentation is just as equal with the first season. Nothing new here, but all the supplements are just as interesting.  Darla's human, Dru returns, Darla's a vamp, Lilah (Stephanie Romanov is delicious) is promoted, Cordelia becomes princess, Lindsay is ran out of town, Fred is introduced, and a heck of a lot more happens in what is Angel season 2.
