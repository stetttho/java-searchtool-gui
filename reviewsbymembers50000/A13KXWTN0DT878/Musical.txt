 Grease has got to be the best musical that was ever made. Or maybe I think that because I haven't seen many musicals. Nah, it's the best. I would go  on and say how I liked the characterization, acting, and all else, but all  of that will fit into four words - It's Just the Best. Casting couldn't  have been better, neither could have the cast did the parts better.  Everything in this movie was perfect! And the performances of the songs  were great! I'm in a production of Grease right now, as Kenickie, and I'm  having a great time! Everything that revolves around this movie is  just...the best!
