 'The Bone Collector' was WELL worth viewing. I thought it was agreat idea to have a cop, who's paralyzed and has to lie in a bed allthe time and has major technology going on so he can continue to be a cop, try to help a rookie (Angelina Jolie) try to solve a case in which a cab driver kills its costumers. The character developments made by the director and such make you feel for them, even the cab's customers who you only know for a bried period of time. All in all, I call 'The Bone Collector' a mystery drama with great acting that has a great plot with Queen Latifah playing Thelma who you gotta love kind of movie. And oh! Add to that list, a very twist-worthy ending.
