 My perfect movie would have to include a good plot, GREAT acting, a lot of funny stuff, and a woman who can kick butt. That would be my perfect movie. And I got that perfect movie in Miss Congeniality. Miss Congeniality was about a woman private detective (Sandra Bullock), Gracie, who had always been a bit tougher than most of the girls . . . and guys. When the police force Gracie is with is assigned to go undercover at the Miss United States beauty pagaent to capture a terrorist, Gracie must go undercover as one of the girls entering the pagaent. With the help of a pagaent talent instructor (Michael Caine), and a handful of comedic cops (inc. Ben Bratt), she must not stop at all costs (Even if that means wearing breasts that aren't hers and high-heel shoes) to capture the terrorist before he attacks. Gracie meets up with some interesting friends (most notably, Miss Rhode Island) and in the end, saves the pagaent. Miss Congeniality was thrown together in a fun way, and is a fun movie. All of the acting was great, and the comical moments were right on the moment. Especially the ones given by Sandra herself.   The DVD contained some great supplements. The two featurettes are filled with interviews from cast and crew, and are very interesting. They even include some deleted scenes that are hilarious, but were taking out due to length and drawing out the story. The commentary by Sandra Bullock and screenwriter, Marc Lawrence, is thoroughly entertaining and hilarious. There's another commentary, but I haven't had time to catch it. The theatrical trailer is also there. The video and audio transfers are great.  Miss Congeniality will always be one of my favorites. Thank you ::sniff:: Thank you.
