 Yvonne Navarro manages again to capture the character of Willow as best as anyone could, even better. Navarro took three Willow-centric episodes from Buffy's third season to show how Will has matured in her life as well as her Wiccan ways. The three episodes written in this book also show the strong bond Willow has with her Slayer-esque best friend, Buffy. In the first story, "Gingerbread", the town of Sunnydale is taken back after Joyce, Buffy's mom, discovers two dead children in the playground while uninvitedly accompying her daughter on patrol. When witches and occults are blamed for the deaths, Joyce organizes a group - MOO - that is against all things witchcraft. After Buffy, Willow, and their friend Amy are accused of being witches (2 out of the 3 are) and then captured, it's up to the rest of the gang to save their friends and figure out why Sunnydale is willing to burn 3 innocent people at the stake. In the second story, "Doppelgangland", Vamp Willow from the alternate reality shown in the episode "The Wish" is transported to Sunnydale after Anya and Willow mess up a spell that, unbeknownst to Willow, was supposed to get Anya's power-centered necklace back from that reality, to the present one. "Doppelgangland" is one of my favorite episodes, and also foretells of Willow's newfound sexuality on the show. In the final story, "Choices", Willow is captured by Faith after helping Buffy and Angel retrieve an object that is important for the Mayor (The main villian in season 3) not to have. "Choices" really shows Willow and Buffy's friendship in the end. Navarro excells at tying these stories by using a computer diary of Willow's to explain stuff that has happened in between these episodes and such. I can't wait for The Willow Files Vol. 3!
