 The Ring, the movie that has scared almost everyone who has seen it. The same effect was not put upon me, but it was definitely thought provoking and I left the theater with the creepiest feeling.    The plot is known by mostly anyone, and it's known that The Ring is a remake of the Japanese horror success Ringu. Gore Verbinski's direction was very effective. Had to be to scare the daylights out of everyone. His use of mixing subtle blues and blacks fit the films mood, and enhanced my mood while watching it. Naomi Watts succeeds at her character for I was involved thoroughly with it throughout the entire movie. Martin Henderson also pulls through as the side character. The subplot dealing with his and Watts' character was effective. And David Dorfman who played Aidan, the little kid, was quite creepy. His eyes did a lot of the acting. Great performance.    The DVD release is a bit of a letdown. It's near barebones with only one feature and a string of 3 trailers (Although one is for Ringu). The one feature - the new short film that was much hyped - is a combination of deleted scenes mixed in with the actual video tape. It's a good watch, but doesn't reveal anything new. I'd rather have seen the deleted scenes in the normal format. But hey, where is the theatrical trailer for The Ring itself?!  After the major success The Ring has had in just its first day of sales (2 million copies in 24 hours), a special edition is expected. Because, hey! More show, more money making. But I'll be there to buy it.     I will close this review with noting ... on the main menu, get the arrow to disappear and select Enter. You'll see the ring.
