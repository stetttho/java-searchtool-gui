 The first song I heard from this cd was Lucky, and I loved it! I gradually began to hear more songs, and I instantly went out and bought, and ENJOYED it. It stayed #1 cd in my cd player for months, and is still weekly  listened too. Her music is compared to such as No Doubt and even Garbage.  And the music does live up to those comparisons. She's just as good as  those two bands (although I do like No Doubt better). My favorite tracks on  the cd are I Died, Any Day Now, Spaceman, Lucky, Violence, and Twitch. Some  of have up-beat rocks and others are slower, but they all still rock! Check  out the song samples, and I garuantee you'll enjoy.
