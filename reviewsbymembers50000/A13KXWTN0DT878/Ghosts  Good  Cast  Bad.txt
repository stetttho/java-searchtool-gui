 Thirteen Ghosts is one heck of a horror movie. Forget the cast and their characters (Annoying kid, and why did Shannon Elizabeth's character have to be so fake and obsessed with bathrooms?), tune in for the actual 13 ghosts and great directing shots given by Steve Beck. Suspense and minorly frightening imagery is displayed throughout. The imagery is flashy -- not subtle -- but it's pulled off very well. The ghosts are all greatly done. The interesting supplement on the DVD explaining each ghost's backstory is a great addition to the DVD.   Pardon me for saying to forget about the cast. Half of it does work. Rah Digga as the nanny, Maggie, is here for the one liners. I found her funny and cared for her most as a character. Embeth Davidtz (Kalina) is one of the antagonists, and her twist around in the movie wasn't all that surprising, but she played her part fairly well. Matthew Lillard was on and off the whole, but his performance was enjoyable. What was off was Shannon Elizabeth's performance. Was she meant to be playing a 12 year old? Her all too goody show at the beginning just threw me off. And the little kid, egh...I won't bother.   Thirteen Ghosts has great horror qualities when it comes to suspense, imagery, and scares. But it seemed to fail with its cast (Not including the ghosts, who were great). And the DVD is a good buy with great animated menus and awesome supplements.
