 Scary Movie 2 is a step down from the original, but there's still lots of ... gags and cute facial expressions from Anna Farris to smile and laugh at. This time, characters from the original and some new faces are taken to a haunted mansion dubbed "Hell House" for a "sleep disorder experiment." Their professor has, unbeknownst to them, actually set this up as a paranormal investigation experiment.     The entertainment value of Scary Movie 2 isn't as high as Scary Movie, but who says there needs to be comparisons? I believe I laughed just as much. The star of both Scary Movies is definitely Anna Farris. Her comedic charm is great. The Wayans brothers are here again, and both are scene stealers. Regina Hall also returns, and she's still funny. Tim Curry, Kathleen Robertson, Tori Spelling, and more add to the cast of new characters. Chris Elliot is right up there with Anna Farris for making this movie. His character as the caretaker is unforgettable and insanely hilarious. The spoofs here aren't as numerable as Scary Movie, but still work. My favorite being the Charlie's Angels spoof. The opening Exorcist spoof is also great and hilarious with James Woods, Andy Richter, and Natasha Richardson.  The DVD is something to be proud of. With a couple of interesting featurettes on the movie and special effects, an extensive still gallery, and a load of deleted and alternate scenes which includes 3 or 4 alternate endings. The deleted scenes contains a couple of hilarious scenes with Regina Hall which I wish they didn't cut out, and explains Tori Spelling's character more. The alternate endings are awesome, but can be seen why they weren't use even though they use a formula similar to The Others and The Sixth Sense. The animated menus with the Perch (The annoying bird) are great. I do find it odd not to have the theatrical trailer.  Scary Movie 2 may be distasteful to some, but for fans, the dvd is a treasure.
