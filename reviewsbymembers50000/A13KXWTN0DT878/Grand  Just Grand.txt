 Could Purge be just as satisfying as Bif's previous release, I Bificus? Indeed. Taken with the spunk and heart from I Bificus, Purge is a full on great listen. Choking On the Truth begins the cd with a similar sound as the tracks on I Bificus, but with Tango Shoes, things get a bit different. And there's nothing bad in that. The nifty beat to Tango Shoes is followed by Dawn which mellows out a bit but doesn't let you down. I Love Myself Today is a power anthem! Was for me. Great song. Things do get a little slow with Stolen Sidewalk. Bif's lyrics always shine but with Stolen Sidewalk, they're touching in an off way. But that's what makes her music so grand. The remaining tracks continue to be great listens. Most notable are ... well, all of them. Although Leader, You Are the Master, and Hold On tend to be more favorable for me.  Bif has done an awesome follow up to I Bificus. Another album? Yes, please.
