 I think Sandra Bullock has covered almost every movie genre but horror. And she's done each with expertise and fun. In The Net, Sandra plays Angela Bennett. A woman committed to her job as a computer virus-detector. After having a one-night stand with a guy on her only vacation in 6 years, her life ... is suddenly gone. All because of a single disc in which the man she slept with wanted. Now she must run from the police, and the group of people out to get her. With only the aide of her old shrink and lover, played by Dennis Miller. Sandra tackled the role of Angel Bennett as well as she has all of her roles. She shines throughout the whole movie. Although her character falls deeper and deeper into insanity.  Dennis Miller was the comic relief, and did well at that. The story itself is something that could happen in real life, and that made the premise frightening in a way. To have your whole life stripped away from you in one second is absolutely terrifying. The directing in The Net wasn't topnotch, but does keep you on the edge of your seat. I wish the DVD would've had at least a featurette or something. It doesn't even come with a  theatrical trailer. But the picture and sound quality are good, and there are scene selections. The menus look like they're right from a computer program. The Net isn't one of Sandra's best movies (Leave that to Miss Congeniality), but it certainly is one of the entertaining ones.
