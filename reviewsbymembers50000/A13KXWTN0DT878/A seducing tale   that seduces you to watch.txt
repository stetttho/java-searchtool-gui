 'Cruel Intentions', among all the other movies based on the same book of literature, has got to be the best. Yes, it is because it had some HOT young stars in (Sarah Michelle Gellar, Reese Witherspoon), and also it was  most wicked out of them. But there could be a moral to 'Cruel  Intentions'....love can overcome all things. Even bratty step-sisters that  doesn't just wanna ride your hot car.
