 Cruel Intentions 2 is not real bad. The acting isn't ultimately superb, but it fairs well. As all know by now, CI2 was originally the planned FOX tv show, Manchester Prep, which was spun off from Cruel Intentions. When FOX saw how risky the content was, they decided to not add it to their fall line-up in '99, or any other line-up beyond that. I, myself, was very dissapointed as Cruel Intentions is my top favorite movie of all time. CI2 is basically about how Sebastian Valmont really got into ruining people's lives, a quest that was set by his "psycho stepsister" Kathryn Mertieul. I must say that Amy Adams did a good job portraying Kathryn, but nobody will ever beat Sarah Michelle Gellar at the role. Also, Keri Lynn Platt who plays Cherie did her character and very good was the most hilarious person. CI2 is also a bit more toned up than the original, as in there's more of the nudity business . . . and the grabbing business. But it all fits into the plot, which was also great. All in all, CI2 is a fair sequel, and will undoubtedly do well on video and DVD.
