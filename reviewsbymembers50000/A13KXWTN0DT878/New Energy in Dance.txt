 DJ Sammy has taken me into the world of dance / techno / pop music with utter delight. This album became an instant favorite of mine. DJ Sammy's mixes are up-beat and full of fun energy. The first single from the cd, Heaven, has become a radio hit and is rightfully so a hit. The remixes of California Lovin' and The Boys of Summer are great. I prefer the latter as a better listen. It has been a favorite 80s song of mine. Sunlight, Beautiful Smile, and Take Me Back to Heaven are all great songs, and the slow remix of Heaven is a nifty little extra.   Dj Sammy's debut (I think debut) cd is on my list of top 10 best cds. I doubt it'll get replaced any time soon.
