 What Lies Beneath (WLB) has everything you want in a great mystery thriller: good plot, suspense and tension, and great acting. Harrison Ford, on his behalf did exceptionally well, but it must be known that the star of WLB is Michelle Pfeiffer. Since it is centered around her, of course they would show more of her. But this woman is magnificent. Pfeiffer took a middle-aged woman watching her only daugher go off to college and turned her into a woman struggling to discover the truth behind mysterious happenings. The beginning of the movie starts off as any movie would, introducing the characters, and setting up plot points. There's also a false accusation which makes you think the whole movie will be about that one thing, but then an unexpected twist happens. And I loved the way they did that! I won't give away the twist for those of you who haven't had the chance to see WLB. Anyway, the middle is spent with mysterious going ons, and Pfeiffer's character trying to understand what's going on. As soon as she does get a grip on what's going on, she is determined to get to the bottom of the story. Which she does, in the end. I must say, if you see nothing but the end of this movie, you will be blown off the edge of your seat. Of course it would be better to watch the full length of the movie, but the ending is spectacular. What Lies Beneath is sure to become an instant classic.
