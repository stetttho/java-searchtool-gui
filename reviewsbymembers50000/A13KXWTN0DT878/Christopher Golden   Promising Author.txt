 Although this book hasn't been released yet, I'm unpatiently awaiting it. Why? Because it's Christopher Golden's work! Christopher Golden is a very talented writer. His recent novels (e.g. Spike & Dru : Pretty Maids All in a Row, and the Strangewood series) is proof that his writing skills are excellent. I wouldn't call them skills, as I seem to think of his writing as an art. It takes a horror storyline, and relates to every day lives and problems. Thus making him one of my favorite authors. I plan on buying Prowlers the first day it is available, and instantly beginning to read it. As for the plot, it tells of a young man in a horrible situations. A pre-human race has made it's way into the young man's city - a pre-human race who began the legend of werewolves - and is murdering everyone in sight. When the guy's best friend is found dead, the guy thinks all is lost. But his friend comes back as ghost, to aid the guy in defeating the race. Yep, can't wait!
