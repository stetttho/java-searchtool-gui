 There was never a thought in my head that a sequel to Blade could be just as fun, dark, witty, and great as the original. I was wrong. Blade returns in his justly commendable sequel with just as must action and more bite than the first. More bite is mucho thanks to the events that takes place in the film. Blade is forced to join teams with a group of highly trained vampires to rid of a new breed of vampire called Reapers. These reapers, woo, they were some ugly freaks. They not only feed on humans, but plan to rid the world of vampires too. In Blade 2, it's basically good vs. evil vs. evil vs. good. This whole agenda made for some great plot twists which I didn't see coming at all, and a few I did, but they still were effective. The action is up a notch from the original, and it's all good. Most notable is the "House of Pain." Ouch.  Wesley Snipes becomes Blade once again, and adds more depth to the character. Kris Kristoffersoon returns as Whistler. Yep, thought he died in the first one too, but his return is simply and quickly explained. The estrogen in the film comes from Leonor Varela as the daughter of a respected vampire leader. Great actress, and her last scene is quite poetic.   Guillermo del Toro must have known exactly what he wanted, and he must have known what the fans wanted. He pulled all of the right punches, made a great cast of characters (It's all about Scud!), and gave the Blade storyline another level. Here's to a third . . .
