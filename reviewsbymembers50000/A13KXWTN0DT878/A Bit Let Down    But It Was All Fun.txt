 I must admit, the game was kind of a letdown. You go through similar Sunnyale settings and kill differently dressed vampires. It was kind of interesting to see what the vampire would be dressed like next, and some had more "powers" than others. There are two exceptions to the vampires. There were monsters that seemed to be covered in mud of some sort, and at the end, you fight a very big demon. He's the final boss, but it only took one stake to get him. And originally, stakes don't kill demons, but they kept it simple.  The controls were kind of difficult, but as the game went along, you got used to it. You would have to get the vampire on the ground, kneel down, and then stake him. But you have to be at a certain point near them to where you can stake them. I found it easy to get them cornered in one side of the screen, then take them down and stake them.  The graphics are what you would expect from Gameboy Color. Nothing extravagant. The backgrounds are pretty nice though, and it was great to see the Hyena exhibit -- complete with red glowing eyes -- in the Sunnydale Zoo.    The storyline is this: Ethan Rayne (A well-known villain in Sunnydale) has returned to Sunnydale to retrieve The Book of Ancients. A very powerful book that will be used -- by Ethan -- to open the Hellmouth. The book is only known by vampire covens from around the world (Which explains the differently dressed vampires) which must be present at the opening of the Hellmouth.   The characters from Buffy in the game were Buffy (of course), Giles, Willow, Xander, and Anya. Although the Initiative is one of the levels, Riley was nowhere to be seen. There are also guest appearances by Cordelia and Angel.   All in all, the game could've been more difficult and took me longer to play. But you do get hooked on trying to kill the Ninja Vamps...or the European Top Hat Vamps...or the Egyptian Lady Vamps...or the...
