 Movies like The Mummy are made for one intention. That is to have fun! It isn't made to be taken serious. People down The Mummy and its awesome sequel for being filled with special effects and witty humour. I say, bring it on! The special effects in The Mummy were very interesting. Most were convincing, and breathtaking. Such as the recreation of Ancient Egypt, and the sand-wall. The watery spirit that went into Anck Su Namun was kind of campy, but fit into the movie. The casting was also great. Brendan Fraser was awesome as our hero, Rick O Connell. Fraser did well with his dialogue and actions, and was good with the one-liners. His reactions were funny too. Then there is the beautiful Rachel Weisz. Her character, Evelyn, went from being very clumsy (a cute scene) to being very brave (her face-off with mummified Anck Su Namun). John Hannah (Jonathan) was our comic relief, and so was Kevin J. O'Conner who played the wimpy Beni. Oded Fehr made a good co-hero, and Arnold Voosloo was the villian, the mummy. Voosloo has the creepiest eyes, so that fit well with his character. As for the dvd itself, picture and audio are great. I think the deleted scenes should've been kept in as to they were interesting, and added more action and suspense. But I guess they took them out for length. The rest of the supplements were interesing. If you're looking for a fun movie, then check The Mummy out!
