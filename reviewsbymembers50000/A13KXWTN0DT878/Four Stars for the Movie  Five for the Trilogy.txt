 The Scream trilogy rightfully deserves to be called the "Star Wars of horror movies." All three entries played off of one another, and in the end, all light was revealed on the whole series in a twisted ending. And I must say, an entertaining thrill ride.   The third and final Scream finds Sidney Prescott living in isolation and in fear of once again being stalked. Dewey Riley and Gail Weathers are coincidentally teamed up when Cotton Weary is killed in true Scream - or in  their world, Stab - fashion. Again, they are united with a cast full of stereotypical yet fun characters (Especially Parker Posey) who run, die, and try to outwit whoever is under the mask.   I, for one, am glad they ended this series with a third installment. Even though this movie is entertaining and deals a deserving ending, I could see the series getting old with another installment. Just how many people would have a reason to kill Sidney? But like I said, Ehren Kruger came up with a final resolution that tied all three movies together in good fashion.   The DVD is a complete fan's choice with features such as hilarious outtakes, a behind-the-scenes montage, a couple of deleted scenes (An interesting alternate opening), an alternate ending, Creed video (I love it), trailers, a LOT of tv spots, audio commentary, and I do believe there may be one or two things I'm missing.  As I've said before, the Scream Trilogy got a well-deserved and respective ending. The trilogy is truly a classic.
