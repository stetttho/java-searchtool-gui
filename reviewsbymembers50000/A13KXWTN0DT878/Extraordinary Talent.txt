 You can't describe the debut album by this group in one word. There are so many good words I can come up with to describe the album. The best being, Astounding. Everything from the lyrics to the voice and writer behind the lyrics (The truly gifted Jason Wade) to the awesome instrumentals. The first single, Hanging By A Moment, is an awesome blend of great instruments and voice. The lyrics, if you listen, are deep and meaningful. The other tracks on the album do not fall down after this. They keep up with the meaning lyrics and great instrumentals. Hanging By A Moment was a bit of rock / pop. The songs "Somebody Else's Song" and "Quasimado" take a true turn to complete guitar alternative type music, with lyrics still being the meaningful ones. Trying, Simon, Breathing, and Everything are great ballad like songs while Cling and Clatter, Only One, and Somewhere In Between stay in the same vein as Hanging By A Moment. Lifehouse's No Name Face is a true album, and will certainly become a classic. And there's no doubt a great future is ahead for Lifehouse.
