 Freddy's Dead : The Final Nightmare was a decent entry in the Nightmare series. There were a few problems though. The dialogue, some of it, was a little corny. Most of the dialogue spoken by Freddy in the beginning and middle of Final Nightmare wasn't dark and scary at all. The only thing a little bit scary about the Freddy we see in the present world in the movie is his image, which is getting to be a little comical. Lisa Zane and the other actors all gave believable performances. Especially Lezlie Deane, who played Tracie, a girl who was abused by her father. That gave her rage, and I believe she could've made it as the film's heroine. But they stuck with Lisa Zane, playing Freddy's daughter. She being Freddy's daughter was a nice little twist though, since we all thought the character of John was Freddy's son.   What really made Final Nightmare was how we were introduced to Freddy's past. We saw him as a little kid where he was picked upon by his fellow classmates and how demented he was, even at a tender age. They also go through his teen years to show how he was abused by his own father (Alice Cooper camoed as Freddy's father), and into his adulthood, where he murdered his own wife. We also see how he evolved into the dream stalker he is.
