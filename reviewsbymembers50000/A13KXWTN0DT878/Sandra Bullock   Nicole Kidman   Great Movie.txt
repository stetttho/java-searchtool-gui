 Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman, what a perfect pairing for the enchanting Practical Magic. The two play sisters whose family heritage is that of being a good witch. Another part of the heritage? The men who the Owens women fall in love is sure to die after living in the euphoria of the woman for a couple of years. This leads to sure mishaps in both of the women's lives, and we see as both overcome the spell and one falls in love.   Practical Magic is full of humour, drama, and estrogen wit. Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman are the perfect match for the roles of the Owens sisters, and both play their parts superbly. They both had me near tears and in laughs. Stockard Channing and Diane Wiest play the aunts of the sister, and are great.   With a great story and a superb cast, Practical Magic doesn't fail in anyway.
