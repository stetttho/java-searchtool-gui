 Who doesn't love the stuff left on the cutting room floor from the Real World series? Especially with this cast, Chicago. Chris, Aneesa, Theo, Cara, Keri, Tony, and Kyle are all here, with some good and boring stuff we never got to see. As with any "Never Saw" disc, we are shown bloopers, crazy antics, and little stuff not seen on the show. We get to see Chris' "pet hand," more of Aneesa's naked antics, Kyle pretending to be Chris, Chris saying how good Kyle looks as him, and Tonya slamming her head into a camera (Yeah!). There's much more in the 40+ minutes of the footage (some hilarious stuff, and some blah stuff), with in-between cast reactions and such.   There's also the usual 3-5 minute video profile of each cast member. Why they focused on Kyle talking about ... nevermind, just check it out. All of these are great watches as you get to see snippets from the audition tapes and casting interviews. Then there's the suprisingly entertaining house tour given by Cara and Theo. The two are a lively pair and keep the house tour very quick paced, fun, and interesting. Also is a blueprint gallery, and an artwork gallery.  Although this disc isn't as entertaining as previous ones (Ahem, The New Orleans cast), it doesn't bore you. With Aneesa, Cara, and Keri (Who supply the more hilarious scenes), it's quite worth it.
