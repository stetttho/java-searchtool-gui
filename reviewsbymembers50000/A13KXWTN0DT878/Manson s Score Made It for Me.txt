 Resident Evil's soundtrack is just as you'd expect after seeing the movie. Full of hard hitting, guitar riffed, and alternate -- almost techno -- version of songs from bands such as Saliva, Static-X, and Slipknot. Thing is, they fit the pace that the movie carried. So there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. But the numero uno thing that drew me to buy this soundtrack are the last 5 or so tracks. That is . . .                          Marilyn Manson's score for Resident Evil. Without this, the cd would have gotten 2 stars from me because I generally do not listen to the bands and type of music that were on the cd, but Manson's ingenious score shoots the rating up to a sure 4 stars. Manson's score - which was wonderfully orchestraed by Marco Beltrami - is at times eerie while at other times, it is completely in your face and utterly menacing. It's very easy to imagine scenes from the movie as you listen to the score.           If you're one to like the music styling of Static-X and above, you're sure to enjoy this cd. Especially if you're into remixes. But for those who aren't, I recommend you still buy the cd, if only to savour Manson's score.
