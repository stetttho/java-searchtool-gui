 The fourth, and I guess, final Best Of Friends DVD is an absolute must have. Much like its 3 predecessors. (1) The One with Chandler In a Box - Chandler, to show he feels sorry for stealing Joey's girlfriend, decides to stay in a box throughout Thanksgiving dinner. This ensues in hilarious stuff from Joey who becomes a parent-like unit to Chandler. Also, the gang finds it weird when Monica pursues a relationship with Richard's son.  (2) The One Hundredth - Phoebe goes into labor with the triplets, and is stuck with a doctor who is obsessed with "The Fonz" much to Pheobe's dismay. Monica and Chandler question their relationship here also, but in the end, they strengthen it. I must also mention that Lisa Kudrow gets major kudos for this ep! The ending is quiet teary. (3) The One with All the Resolutions - This episode is great for 2 reasons only. 1. Rachel finds out about Monica and Mr. Big -- after making her New Year's resolution not to gossip. And the other reason, 2. Ross' resolution is to do something new each day. He chose to wear leather pants one day. And well, that leads to a very funny catastrophe in a date's bathroom. (4) The One Where Ross Got High - Another Thanksgiving ep! Monica invites her parents over for Thanksgiving, but has failed to tell them about her and Chandler. Also, Monica has promised Rachel she can fix the Thanksgiving dessert. Although this episode doesn't have the spunk that the rest do, the last 5 minutes are great. (5) The One with the Proposal - Chandler plans  to pop the big question on Monica, but all doesn't go as planned when Dr. Richard (Tom Selleck) shows up and screws things up by telling Monica he loves her. A VERY good episode with a VERY good ending.  The twenty episodes that were contained in the Best of Friends volumes are all great. Now I must go and get the Friends Season One set, and anxiously await further seasons.
