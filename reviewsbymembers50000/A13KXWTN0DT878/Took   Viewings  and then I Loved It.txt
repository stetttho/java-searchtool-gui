 For some off reason, it took two viewings of The Sixth Sense for me to actually like the movie. The first time I watched it, I had high expectations. I was expected to be scared to death by ruthless images of ghosts haunting a defenseless little kid. I also expected there not to be all the dialogue that there was, and more ghosts. After my first viewing, with my expectations lowered, I decided to wait a while to watch it a second time. I think it was a year before I actually bought the DVD (Not the Vista Series), and watched it again. And this time, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I enjoyed it for its depth, heart, and it's minimal -- yet effective -- scares. M. Night Shyamalan is a very creative and intelligent director, putting heart into his design. The use of the color red was a very unique touch. The main cast -- Haley Joel Osment (Cole), Bruce Willis (Malcolm), and Toni Collette (Lynn) -- were all superb. The relationships between Osment with both of the leads were great. Especially that of his and Collette (Cole's mother). Scenes with them were near tear-jerking at times.   The Sixth Sense is an exceptionally scripted thriller / drama. Too bad it took me two viewings to realize that. Yet, I'm glad I did.
