 Could Empire Records have been any better than it was before? Nope, it was perfect. But with this new Fan Remix edition given to us by Warner Bros., there is a lot more to enjoy. Sixteen minutes of additional footage, 4 deleted scenes, and 3 music videos to enjoy, in fact.  If you're here, you obviously know the story that is Empire Records. It's a great actual coming-of-age film that has the ability to touch on subject that is relatable to any person between the ages ... well, of any age. There are great performances (Liv Tyler, Renee Zellwegger, Robin Tunney, Ethan Embry, the whole cast!), the film's many subplots never run into each other, and the soundtrack has got to be near one of the best and biggest of any movie.  The additional 16 minutes added into the movie gives more character development to certain characters, new little scenes obviously edited out for they supplied only minimum yet effective humor, and some stuff that would have rallied the actual storyline. There are 2 of the 4 deleted scenes that makes the infamous Sexy Rexy an actual good guy, and also include an unseen performance of Mon Amour by Coyote Shivers, Renee Zellwegger, and Maxwell Caulfield (Rex) that was cut from the movie.    Warner Bros. truly released this for the fans of Empire Records, a la Fan remix. But if given the chance, any person will easily take a liking to the movie. If you're into stuff like this. That's what I think, but "Who knows where thoughts come from? They just appear. Mm-hm."
