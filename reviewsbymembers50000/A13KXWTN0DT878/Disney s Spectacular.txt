 Disney's great. Supplying the fans with such detailed releases of the most beloved Disney movies. Beauty & the Beast is high on almost every Disney lover's list, and I'm certain that this dvd will satisfy them. Satisfied me.   Three versions of the film are available. The original theatrical version, the special edition, and the unfinished version. The new musical number included in the special edition is a fun one, and to see simple artwork throughout the unfinished version is a fun watch. The tons of supplemental material is too much to actually review. But it shows that Disney cares.   The film was the first animated picture to be nominated for Best Picture, and rightfully so. The combination of romance, humor, adventure, and even a bit of fright make the film one to reach almost every person's heart. Forever memorable characters were introduced in the film, and the morale of the story is great.   Uberinstant Disney fun all-time favorite major classic! In my once again 7 year old mind, that's how I would describe Beauty and the Beast. Wait no, actually, that's how I describe it now. Eleven years later and this movie has not changed (Except for the new musical number), and neither has the magic it has given changed.
