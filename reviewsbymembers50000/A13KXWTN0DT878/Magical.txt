 I've recently taken a liking to theater, and this Peter Pan is something that has inspired me to do so even more. Everything about it was awesome. But what makes Peter Pan the most enjoyable, as it is for the many Peter Pan takes, is the music. Such songs as Ugg-A-Wugg, I've Gotta Crow, and I Won't Grow Up just stick with you. And Cathy Rigby displayed Peter Pan wonderfully, along with the rest of the cast. I can't leave out the choreography, it's awesome! Too bad the show was retired, it would be *magical* to see it in person.
