 Chuck Palahnuik's Lullaby was one of those reads where you imagine every detail because every detail is examined within the story. Lullaby is a story about greed, control, power, and in contrast of those, the path of redemption. Carl Streator is a detective who has a past that haunts him. When it comes back to bite him in the butt in the form of a culling song (an ancient poem that kills intended people when read), he must put his past and the poem to rest. With the aid of an over-the-top woman, a young wiccan, and an overbearing know-it-all, Carl must destroy all copies of the poem, and reach redemption before damnation takes over him.    Palahnuik captured the essence of his main character, and kept you involved with him from beginning to end. The same goes with each of these characters as we meet them and see each of their own downfalls. I must admit that the beginning of the novel is a bit confusing, but it all comes around in the third chapter, and from then on any mystery/suspense lover will be involved until the end.    What really kept me involved is how the novel is much like a social commentary. The undertones of how much power can control one's self is shown in each character. That's how it is in real life with people. Once power is given to someone, they want more. I won't get deep with this, but it's just an extra goodness of the book.  This is my first book by Chuck Palahnuik, and it's sparked my interest for his other novels.
