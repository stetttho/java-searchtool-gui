 1988's The Blob is a sure horror movie for any type of horror movie fan. And for a remake, it does justice for its original. A feat some remakes never come close to doing. Maybe that's just my personal opinion, and I stand true to it.   The film's not just an update to the 1958 version of The Blob, it's more of a different turn on the story. We're taken to a small town where basically everyone knows everyone. It's your average day Mayberry type deal. We're introduced to many residents of the town, but the two main ones are the star cheerleader (Shawnee Smith as Meg Penny) and the town rebel (Kevin Dillon as Brian Flagg). When the two cross paths as a result of some of the blob's terror, we follow these two as they fight for their town and for their lives.  The Blob has a pretty equal formula for a great, fun horror movie. Of course for any horror movie, there's got to be tense scenes. The film has it's share of some. Most noteable are the whole diner / diner lady chase scene, and the oh-too-great theatre / sewer chase scene. Those two scenes are basically the whole movie, but they make for great viewing! Not only for the intensity, but for the great shooting and colorizations that are there. And the gore? Aw man, the gore is plentiful here. We get gooey body parts, the blob engulfing and then melting body parts off, and more of the gooey melted body parts. It's crazy. Yet not totally overdone. If I dare say, "tastefully" done to please any gore fiend. As usual, for any horror movie, we get cliched characters, but they are all handled well here. Shawnee Smith is wonderful as the heroine. She kicked major [behind] here. Kevin Dillon is kind of stale at some times in the movie, but he pulls through and makes a viewer happy. The supporting cast have their own little perks.   Chuck Russell, director of The Blob, knew what he was doing when he made this movie. And in itself, 1988's The Blob has become it's own cult classic.
