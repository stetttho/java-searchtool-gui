 When I first bought this soundtrack, I was dissapointed. A year later when I listen to it, I absolutely LOVE it! Why? I don't know, I guess I got older. But the music is awesome, and really goes with the awesome movie. My  fav track is Once in a Blue Moon. It is awesome! And Katalina's Bewitched,  Bothered, & Bewildered. Also, give it a few seconds after the last  track...see what you hear.
