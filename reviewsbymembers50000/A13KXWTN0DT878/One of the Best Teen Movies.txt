 I'm a an avid viewer of all the teen horrors and comedies that have been  recently coming out. This is one of the bests. Of course, the plot is  predictable, and you have your usual type-cast people (e.g. nerds, jocks,  the beautiful ones. It's just the humour in this movie is better than any  other. Besides 10 Things I Hate About You, but other than, it is! The  actors/actresses really did their part for the movie. Especially Jodi Lynn  O'Keefe who is always awesome at playing the beautiful one. I recommend you  check this one out!
