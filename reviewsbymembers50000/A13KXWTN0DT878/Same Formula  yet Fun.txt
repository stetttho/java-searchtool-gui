 The Forsaken, a group of vampiric like individuals that go back to the Crusades. There are 8 of them to be destroyed. Four have been killed, 4 remain. And it's up to a group of people who are brought together to destroy one of the remaining.   The first mistake made with The Forsaken is it being compared to The Lost Boys and Near Dark. It's nowhere near those two gems, but in its own way, The Forsaken is actually pretty good. The whole cast gave very good performances. Kerr Smith deserved his lead role. The action sequences are tense, and are never over the top. The final showdown between bad and good is worth the watch, although it falls kind of short. The backstory given for the vampires is another interesting bit added to Hollywood vampire lore, and is one of the most interesting one to come along lately.   The second mistake is, well, there's no second mistake. The Forsaken didn't do so great in theatres because people thought they've seen this formula before. But I believe they movie didn't fail in any of it, and did a good job at keeping you interested. I believe The Forsaken could not have been any worse or any better. It is what it is. A fun watch for any vamprie or horror movie lover.
