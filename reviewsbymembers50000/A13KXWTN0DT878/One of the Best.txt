 I have a list for almost everything. Honestly. And one of those lists is entitled "My Favorite 80s Horror." Fright Night holds its own spot in the top ten. Because of its wit, scares, and the little notice of slapstick humour towards old Drac flicks.   William Ragsdale stars as Charley Brewster, a normal guy who spends some spare time trying to get his girlfriend Amy (Amanda Bearse) to put out. Unbeknownst to Charlie, his new next door neighbor is a vampire (Chris Sarandon). As the vampire - Jerry - closes in on his mom, Charley realizes he must stop the vampire at once. But that's not so easy. With the help of Amy, his friend Ed (hilarious Stephen Geoffreys), and creature feature host Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowell), he begins his attempt to rid of the creature of the night.  Throughout the movies are great horror moments tied in with simple humour. Mostly the dorkyness of being a teenager, and trying to unveil a "supposed" vampire. Tom Holland's direction is pretty on, especially the whole alley scene and the showdown between Evil Ed and Peter Vincent. All of the actors put on believable performances. Stephen Geoffreys left behind a classic character in the horror genre.  If a craving for good old 80s mainstream horror ever hits your system, be sure to pick up or buy (Although a sadly bare bones dvd, plus the trailer) Fright Night. Satisfaction guaranteed.
