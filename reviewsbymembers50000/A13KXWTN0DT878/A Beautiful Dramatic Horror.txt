 Interview with the Vampire is a pure example of what good horror should be. Actually, I would classify it as a Dramatic Horror because that's simply what it is. Interview tells the story of a 200 year old vampire (Brad Pitt) who isn't happy with being what he is. A vampire. In the present day, we see him telling his life story to a man (Christian Slater). As he tells it, we see the story play out. How he, Louie, became the vampire he is, and how it almost destroyed him. Lestat (Tom Cruise) is the vampire who made Louie. Their relationship is shown as a love / hate type thing where it seems as if Lestat only puts up with Louie because he has too. Not being a respectable vampire, Louie only wants to drink the blood of animals and not harm a human being, but the first person he does harm, puts a burden on not only him but Lestat also. It was a little girl (Kirsten Dunst), and Lestat decides to change her into one of them, and make her their "daughter." That, and what occurs after that, is a very interesting and never dulls. It keeps your attention, and the characters take your emotions.   The actors who portrayed the characters in the film were astounding. I believe this is Tom Cruise's best part to date. He brought life to an undead character, and a character who would not die. Brad Pitt's eyes brought soul to the character of Louie, there was real depth there. But the most superb is the acting of Kirsten Dunst. Only at the tender age of 11, her acting spoke volumes as the role of Claudia. In the movie, her soul aged but her faced never changed, and Kirsten worked very well with that.    The mood is set just right in every scene. The tone of the movie is dark, and mostly all of the colors are dark. Sometimes a dull bright green will contrast with the colors, but it only makes the tone better.   Interview with the Vampire is a beautiful, if twisted, story of love and faith that can even be given by the darkest of souls.
