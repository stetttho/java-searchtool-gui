 Avril just happened to pop up in my life while working. The radio station said she was new with a fresh sound. They were right. Avril Lavigne's Complicated played on the overhead speakers as a nodded my head to the catchy beat, and I instantly connected with the lyrics of the song. After hearing only one song, I had a new favorite musician. Instantly, I went out and bought Let Go, and I was even more impressed by the talent of Avril and her band.     All the tracks on the cd make for great listening. The lyrics seem to be from the heart and most are relateable. There's also a hint of different styles of music. Avril really hits it hard with Losing Grip and Unwanted. Both are great power ballads -- in a good way. A little bit of pop -- but not too much, just enough -- can be found in Anything but Ordinary (My favorite track!), Things I'll Never Say, and My World. Avril's punk style completely shines through in the catchy Sk8r Boi. I'm With You and Naked are deep songs with thought, and Mobile, Tomorrow, and Too Much to Ask are also great listens.     Already, Avril has a dedicated fanbase. Here's to it lasting.
