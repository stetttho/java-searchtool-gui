 I think I could cry, because living as far away from New York City as possible is bad for me. I never got the chance to see the probable wonder that was Tick Tick Boom onstage. Being a fan of Jonathan Larson's Rent, I came across Tick Tick Boom. I read that it had similarities to Rent, but was it's own show. And how right it was. Tick Tick Boom has the same spirit and vibe that Rent has, but their two entirely different shows. The three member cast (Jerry Dixon, Amy Spanger, & Raul Esparza) all are gifted with beautiful voices. All the songs in the show are great, but highlights for me are Green Green Dress, No More, the hilarious and fun to sing Therapy, and the powerful Louder than Words. Also, and I'm glad this is on the disc, but a major highlight is Jonathan Larson himself singing Boho Days. Tick Tick Boom showcases Jonathan Larson's talent and love for music, and I will always be a fan.
