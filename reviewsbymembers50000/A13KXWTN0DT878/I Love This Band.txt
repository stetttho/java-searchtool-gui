 Lifehouse's Hanging By A Moment has been my favorite song since the first time I heard it on the radio. It's a song that hooks you from the beginning, and never loses its play. In fact, all of the songs on Lifehouse's cd, No Name Face, has that same quality. I was glad to find more tracks by them on this import that was taken from Lifehouse's first hard-to-find (believe me) album. Fairytales Sandcastles is a superb song. With Jason's colorful lyrics and beautiful voice supplied by the band's instrumentals, the song sticks with you. As does Fool. It kind of follows in the vein of Hanging By A Moment, but there's a total difference. It's an awesome song, and has become one of my favorite Lifehouse songs. Sitting up there with Hanging By A Moment. What's Wrong with That is an excellent song, and proves that Lifehouse once again can make every one of their songs different and likeable. What can I say? I love this band. And will for years to come.
