 I don't see why "critics" have given this movie such poor reviews, or why it flopped at the theaters. Urban Legends : Final Cut, to me, was a very good suspense thriller. Although the only connection it has with the original Urban Legend is the security cop Reese (who is hilarious), the movie lives up to be better than the first. Of course, there isn't much originality (It's got to be hard to think of something new after all these teen horrors have been released), but the acting is well done, and the effects aren't the worse in town. Jennifer Morris was awesome as struggling film student Amy. All the other cast members looked as if they really knew where their characters were coming from, and dove right into them. I also liked the way the whole Hitchcockian theme was used. Especially the cute little diddy that happened at the end of the movie. As for the DVD itself, picture and sound quality is excellent, and there is a great amount of supplements (inc. 9 deleted scenes, audio commentary, gag reel, ec.) found on the DVD. Even though some people think it is entirely stupid to recommend this movie, I do recommend it.
