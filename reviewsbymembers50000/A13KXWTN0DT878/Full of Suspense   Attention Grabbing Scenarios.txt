 Vivian is a werewolf, loup garou, and she is bound to her pack. When she falls in love with a human, can she withstand her pack's law and live her life happily with the human? Or will sudden murders blamed on the pack bring her back to reality? Or is it she who is commiting the murders?  Annette Curtis Klause captures the distinct feel of a werewolf tale in Blood and Chocolate. Laced with suspense, action, and romance, Blood and Chocolate never failed to leave my attention. Klause introduced an all new werewolf lore and made the book feel cinematic. Her characters were all fleshed out, and you cared for them. Especially that of the main character, Vivian. The ending is one of minor surprise, but of great surprise.  Blood and Chocolate is by far one of the best novels I've read in a long time. And the cover of the book captures the feel of the book. Awesome cover. Blood and Chocolate is highly suggested for those who like horror, and for those who like a good thrill read.
