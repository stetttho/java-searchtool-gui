 No Ghostbusters 3? That causes sadness. But getting a movie that is very similiar to the franchise and is directed by the director of the Ghostbusters films causes happiness. Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters, Ghostbusters 2) directs Evolution, the story of a group of thrown together people who must destroy a new race of creatures that has evolved from a meteor that crashed into earth before the world is taken over.   The story, while flat in some areas, is interesting. The positions of the main characters made the story go along. The actors did a great job. Julianne Moore was cute as the clumsy scientist lady who must choose to either go along with the government and screw up, or go along with the other group and save the world. David Duchovny and Orlando Jones play two college professors who impersonate whatever they can to get to the meteor. Orlando Jones was hilarious, and his flat tone of his one-liners made the one-liners better. Sean William Scott is the discoverer of the meteor. And groups up with the others after finding one of the creatures dead. In my opinion, Scott made the movie. He was  the lovable, funny dude of the movie. Much like Rick Moranis was of the Ghostbusters movies. And there's even a cameo from Dan Aykroyd which brightens the movie.  I feel as if the DVD cheats out on some stuff they could have given us, but it fairs well. There are some deleted scenes. The only entertaining one was the alternate ending which was all about Orlando Jones. There is are some interesting photo galleries of the creatures created for the film. Those primates were pretty ugly. There's also a featurette and cast and crew biographies. I found it weird that the disc was lacking the theatrical trailer for the film.   In the end, Evolution is a fun comedy that rides alongside Ghostbusters. Heck, we even get tons of slime near the end.
