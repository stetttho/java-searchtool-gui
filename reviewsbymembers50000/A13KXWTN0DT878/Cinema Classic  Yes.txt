 Finally, one of cinema's all-time favorite musicals has made it to DVD! Grease - a long awaited dvd release of mine -- holds that magic that makes a film a rounded complete cinema classic.   Everyone knows the story of the Rydell High group, each going through their own little quirks and some getting share that through amazing song and wonderful dance. It's awesome how director Randal Kleiser combined the main plot of Danny and Sandy with subtle subplots such as Rizzo and Kenickie (Which - in a way - are the main stars of the Broadway version), the Thunder Road ordeal, and Frenchie's dropping out of school for beauty school. The cast is an awesome group of talent. Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta as our leads are captivating with the best moves and wonderful voices. Jeff Conaway and Stockard Channing add that sufficient racy attitude into the film with their smirky one-liners and great voices. The rest of the Thunderbirds and Pink Ladies were all great assets to the film and are memorable in their own way. Especially Didi Conn and her voice. Loved the lady.  Although I praise the movie highly, the DVD is a the littlest bit of a disappointment. We do get the film in anamorphic widescreen and the nifty original theatrical trailer, but there's nothing new in regards to bonus features. We get the same interviews that can be found on the 20th Anniversary special VHS edition (Which aren't bad, but I've seen it so many times). But there's nothing more than that. Warner Bros. did treat us to a nifty packaging, but the menus aren't gawkable. All in all, the DVD presentation is a fair one.  Grease is a piece of cinema classic fare if there ever was one. Disagree with me? It's okay. But I know me, a fan, and tons of others agree with that statement.
