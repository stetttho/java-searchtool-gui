 Admittedly, as a Jewel fan, I was a bit apprehensive about this new "sound" Jewel had. Would it suit? Or would her folk rock prove to be better? All fears were eased when I put the cd in my cd player and listened to every track from start to finish.   0304 is Jewel branching out with a definite new sound. But the true heart of Jewel is still there, evident in her lyrics. All new pop, r&b, and occasional dance beats carry her lyrics all the right ways.  The disc's first single, Intuition, is a great satirical view of today's entertainment industry. Standout songs for me are Run 2 U (Very reminiscent of Jewel's pre-0304 work with the updated sound), 2 Find U, Fragile Heart, Doin' Fine (Personal favorite), 2 Become 1 (Way better than that Spice Girlsl song of the same name), Yes U Can, and U + Me = Love. There's also America which like Intuition seems to satire.   It's safe to say, from my standing, that whatever Jewel decides to do, it's going to be good. 0304 is evidence.
