 Alice has been living safely with her "nightmares" behind her. She's got a boyfriend, graduated from high school, her dad is recovering from being an alcohol addict, and an unplanned baby on the way. And Alice is going to do everything to protect and keep the baby. But that's going to be harder than it seems, because Freddy has been hiding inside of Alice, and is now using her unborn child's dreams to get more souls. Alice must prepare for another battle with Freddy, and must do all she can to protect her baby. In A Nightmare on Elm Street 5 : The Dream Child, the series began to delve into Freddy's past. Freddy's mother, Amanda Krueger, was also brought back into the storyline. She was used in A Nightmare On Elm Street 3 : The Dream Warriors, but not as much as she is here. She's crucial to the storyline in NOES5.   Lisa Wilcox proves again that Freddy is no match for her. Even though I'm not a big fan of Nightmares 4 and 5, Lisa Wilcox's Alice is my favorite Nightmare heroine. I believe it's her eyes.   With Nightmare 5's interesting plot and Lisa leading, I believe that it is the weakest entry, other than Nightmare 2, in the series.  It didn't have what the rest of the entries do. I don't quiet know what that is, but it didn't have it. But as it being part of the Nightmare series, I do like it.
