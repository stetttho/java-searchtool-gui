 At the beginning of Nightbreed, we see quick flashes and glimpses of nightmarish creatures jumping and running around the screen. I was thinking "Awesome" and all of those other good words. Then we find it's the dream of a man, Boone (Craig Sheffer), who wants to reside in this place called Minion, where the monsters live. Why he wants to be there? His doctor (David Cronenberg, director of The Fly and many other horror movies) has something to do with it, I never quiet understood that. This confusion leads to many other confusing plot holes in the movie. Or at least to me it did. I've read many other reviews that praised this film for being a very good early 90s horror. Yes, it did have some great creatures and special effects and sets, but that's all I found good in the movie. The acting wasn't the best in the world. The only performances I liked were those given by the tendril-headed demon guy who bit Boone and the mama monster (Forgot their names). Maybe I need to watch Nightbreed a second time to fully understand the plot details, but the first time around - it was quiet confusing. Mostly eye candy, for me. But still, the creature effects and sets were awesome. Kudos to those.
