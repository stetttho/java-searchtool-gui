 Ok, I know there were lots and lots of Blair Witch parodies, but these were the worst and most I dunno...stupid, I have ever seen. They're basically the same thing, over and over. And what's up with this channel Woods thing? All of those little commercials had to have come up by drunk people. The reason I gace this 2 stars is for the last parody. It's the only thing that got my laughs in the whole show. I usually don't give bad reviews, so I'm feeling bad for doing this, but I did it. I do recommend you rent it for the last parody!
