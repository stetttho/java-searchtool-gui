 Everyone I talked to who saw this movie said it was the worst, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The acting wasn't bad, the plot was good enough, and Marisa Coughlan's portrayal of Linda Blair in 'The Exorcist' was awesome.  Also, Katie Holmes' acting was better than that of 'Disturbing Behavior'  and 'The Ice Storm', but that's my opinion. Over-all, I would recommend  this movie to people.
