 I like John Mayer's music. It's simple, acoustic, and there is an all around goodness in his voice. Most of the songs on Room for Squares are quite sober, but that's a good thing. John's voice goes right along with the soberness of the songs. His voice is smooth and soothing, and flows right along with the instrumentals which is mostly combined of his own guitar and occasionally a piano or another extraneous instrument. It seems as if his style of making music is writing his feelings down on paper, picking up the guitar and finding the right tune, and calling it song. And there's no negativity in that here on Room for Squares. Every song works. Although I do have my favorites. Those being his first single No Such Thing, and My Stupid Mouth, Your Body Is a Wonderland, Neon, Not Myself, and St. Patrick's Day. I say, if John Mayer continues to make music, I will continue to listen.
