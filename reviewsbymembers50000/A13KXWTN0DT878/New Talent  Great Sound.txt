 I didn't pay much attention to Christina Milian when she sung the back vocals to Ja Rule's Between Me and You. I didn't even know it was her when I heard this song on the radio. I just knew I liked it, and could dance to it. As soon as I figured out who sung it and what the name was, I got the single as soon as I could. AM to PM is awesome. And it was a surprise to see Ja Rule's Between Me and You on the single. The clips of the songs on her upcoming CD are worthy, and I plan on buying Christina Milian's debut cd when it's available.
