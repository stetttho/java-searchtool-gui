 I didn't expect to laugh so hard when I started watching The Real World You Never Saw - New Orleans. Most of the footage is hilarious stuff that happened in and out of the Belfort that may have been considered too "risqu" for television. Melissa's antics contribute to most of the funniness, but we also see a wilder side of Matt and Julie.   The cast is separated into three groups (Matt & David, Kelly & Danny & Julie, and Jamie & Melissa), and they look back over some of the crazy times they had while we are treated to footage of those crazy times. We also get to see the much-talked about and much-"mimic"ed parents of Melissa. And they are just as hilarious as Melissa. There are about 3 other scenarios with Melissa that are very comedic.  The bonus stuff on the DVD is mostly information on the cast. Short 2-3 minute clips from their audition tapes and sessions are given. Except, for some reason, Melissa. Instead, we see her trying on a huge pair of underwear and strutting around the house. She's wild. There's also a tour of the Belfort Mansion, a promo for The Real World You Never Saw - Hawaii, and a segment on How to Audition for The Real World which is hosted by Amaya from Real World Hawaii.  The New Orleans cast is my favorite from The Real World casts because of their diversity, humor, and drama. This disc really expanded the humor part. It's a must-have for Real World fans. The book companion for the New Orleans cast and soundtrack are also must-haves.
