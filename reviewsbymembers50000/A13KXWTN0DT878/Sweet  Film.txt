 Simply Irresistible was a great film. I have no idea why it flopped at the box office. Sarah Michelle Gellar and Sean Patrick Flannery put out great performances as two falling love in a magical way. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays Amanda Shelton, a cook who co-owns her mother's restaurant with her aunt. After buying a basket of crabs from a mysterious little man, magic begins to happen. Whatever Amanda's emotions are, the same emotions go into the food she cooks.   Simply Irresistible was full of fun dialogue and scenes which came from the actions of some pretty quirky characters. Everyone in Simply Irresistible was lovable. Even Amanda Peet's cameo, in which she played a snobby rich girl, was likable.   The best thing about Simply Irresistible has to be its score. When the score is playing, it goes right along with the actions of the characters, right down to their footsteps. It sounded a bit Mary Tyler Moore-ish, but it worked well.   Simply Irresistible is a sweet romantic comedy, and shouldn't be missed by anyone.
