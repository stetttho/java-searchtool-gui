 The Best Of Friends Vol. 2 has even more episods for us to enjoy. Although not some of the "Best of", any Friends episode on dvd is worthy. (1) The One Where No One's Ready - Noone's ready when Ross wants them to be. Each friend goes through their own quirky mishaps. Joey and Chandler fight over a chair, Monica has a phone problem with her ex, Phoebe has spilt something on her dress, and Rachel can't decide what to wear. This all leads to funny stuff. (2) The One with the Embryos - Phoebe is clinically impregnated so her brother and his wife are able to have babies. Cute little episode. (3) The One with Ross' Wedding - Yep, Ross' 2nd wedding I believe. Here he's getting married to British Emily, so the gang (all but Phoebe) goes to London for the wedding. It's here that Chandler and Monica end up together. I believe this one of those eps that doesn't deserve the "Best Of . . ." treatment. They end this ep on a cliffhanger type thing, and never show the next ep or what happens. My only complaint with the disc. (4) The One with All the Thanksgivings - Great episode! The gang views videotapes of past Thanksgivings. (5) The One Where Everybody Finds Out - This is my #1 funniest Friends ep. It's hilarious when Rachel and Phoebe found out about Monica and Chandler, and how they cover it up from Ross. And the interaction between Joey and Rachel is great when they both try to not tell each other what they know.  Great episodes with turning points in the series!
