 This book can only be described as beautiful. It's content, the pictures, everything is a true dedication to the work of Jonathan Larson.   The book begins as a biography to the creator of Rent, Jonathan Larson and his original vision of the play and of life itself. Reading his story was quite inspirational. If only he were alive to see his success and how he has touched many people's lives.  The remainder of the book is the whole libretto for Rent complete with pictures from a stage performance. The presentation of the libretto and pictures is wonderful. Honestly, I was in complete awe the first time I saw it.   There are also in-depth interviews with the cast and people behind the scenes, and some rare photos.  This book is the Rent fan's necessity. And, as I said before, could be seen as a true inspiration thanks to Jonathan Larson.
