 I Know What You Did Last Summer is noted as the 2nd teen horror movie in the new teen phases that started with Scream. Kevin Williamson, the writer of Scream, also wrote I Know. And it shows in the witty dialogue and actions of the characters. But this isn't a bad thing, because there are great differences between the two movies' characters. I Know tells the story of four teens who commit a hit & run, and cover up. Turns out, they didn't cover it up as well as they thought when whoever they hit has come back to kill them. Stellar performances are given by Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillipe in this movie. Too bad they're the ones to meet their demise, because I think they would've worked better in the sequel. If they would have agreed to do it. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. faired well, but didn't shine as much as Sarah and Ryan. I must comment on the directing. I think it was very good. Especially Helen's (Sarah's character) chase scene. To me, it's one of the most tense chase scenes out of any horror / suspense movie. Jim Gillespie really took the effect of the dark and shadows in I Know. It seemed as if he used them every chance he got, and it worked well. But his commentary on the dvd wasn't that interesting. It had it's good points, but most of it was - in a way - boring. In conclusion, I Know What You Did Last Summer was full of suspense, great acting (especially Sarah & Ryan), and good directing.
