 Catch Me If You Can is one of the most captivating movies I have seen in a long time. Not visually, but performance wise and emotionally. Perhaps I was so struck by the movie because I went in without having read any reviews, and I knew only little of the plot. So I went in without a biased opinion, and with an open mind, and was treated to the nicest movie I've caught since Lord of the Rings.  Leonardo Dicaprio brings in his best performance here, in my opinion. He was a little off at first, but as the story delved more into his character, I believed him to be Frank Abagnale. With this being a true story, I was in awe at how much Frank actually got a way with. Sure, the movie may have exagerrated, but the situations Frank put himself into and got himself out of were absolutely crazy. Also how Dicaprio showed Frank's descent from fully confident in his dealings to being on the run and in fear from Tom Hanks' character Carl Hanratty was priceless. Speaking of Tom Hanks, he's so awesome. I've always liked him, but this movie made him high on my list of top actors. His subtle one liners were great, and the Knock Knock joke has become classic to me. A surprise to me was Christopher Walken. I'm used to seeing him play the villian or a devious character, but here he showed heart and range. Great actor. Another nice addition was Amy Adams.   Everyone knows this, but Steven Spielberg is a directing genuis. He makes setting the tone for any type of feeling seem so easy. I'd feel like I was making an understatement if I said "Great directing."   I'm continually saying good things about Catch Me If You Can, and it's because I honestly can't think of a bad thing. Even with its over two hours play, I can find no complaint.   Catch Me If You Can was a nice surprise. How long before another hits me like this one?
