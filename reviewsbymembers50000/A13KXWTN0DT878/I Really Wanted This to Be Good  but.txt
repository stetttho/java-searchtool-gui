 Honestly, the only reason for me seeing Harvard Man is the presence of Sarah Michelle Gellar in the film. I believe her being in the film is what actually sold the movie to a studio. Rightfully done, since she was the only entertaining part of the whole film. And even her performance was a bit weak.  Harvard Man tells the story of a young Harvard student (Who is experimental with drugs, and is fairly promiscuous) who gets involved with a mob boss' daughter. When a bet is made between the two that leads to him throwing a highly important basketball game, all goes down hill. Fairly simple, yet I found myself losing the point of the story occasionally. Just why exactly did the FBI want with the Harvard guy? To have a link to the big mobster guy? Hm?  Along with the dialogue, performances seem a bit rushed. The only one who seems to sit back and enjoy was Eric Stoltz. Not that he has much screen time. The main star here is Adrian Grier (Drive Me Crazy). I didn't enjoy his performance. Only when he was high off of 15,000 somethings of ecstasy was his performance even the least bit interesting. Sarah Michelle Gellar was great as always, and actually seemed to take the movie into her own hands. Joey Lauren Adams is undeniably cute, and she fairs well. Rebecca Gayheart was shortly seen, and her character just seemed off. And were the two Italian hitmen supposed to be for comedy relief? No, to me, they were just plain annoying.   Hard to say if I'll ever sit through another watching of Harvard Man. Ever. Again.
