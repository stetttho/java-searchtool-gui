 Clayburn Moore knew what he was doing when he sculpted the first ever figure of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Although the face of the figure doesn't compare to the actual beauty of Sarah Michelle Gellar, it fairs well. The articulation is short on it though. Just some elbow and leg joints. That's not bad to me, since I keep my figures in the blister card and display them. The clothing on the figure also captures the style of Buffy in season one, and so does the hair. All in all, the Series I Buffy figure is a great sculpt.
