 Val Kilmer and the delightful Warwick Davis take us on a fantasy adventure that noone should ever forget. When Willow (Davis) happens to come upon a mystically sacred child, he finds out he must defend the child to help save her and all that is good from an evil sorceress bent on taking over the world by using the power of the child. Along his way, Willow encounters some interesting counterparts, including Madmartigan (Kilmer) who had been imprisoned for wrongdoing. What happens on Willow's adventure is something every fantasy film fan should enjoy.   Much like Legend, Labryinth, and The Goonies, I grew up with Willow being one of my favorite films. Willow has the special ability to make me return to my childhood and thoroughly enjoy it, no matter how many times I've watched it. My excitement when I found out Willow would be transferred to DVD was great! And I'm a satisfied customer after purchasing it. The video and audio transfers are wonderful. The picture makes the film even more colorful than I've ever seen. The Making Of . . . featurette is quiet entertaining, and it was awesome to see both Ron Howard and George Lucas working behind the scenes with the cast. The commentary with Warwick Davis is a good little listen, and the theatrical trailers and tv spots are neat to watch.  I was very very ecstatic about this Willow's DVD release. And even more ecstatic that all of my favorite 80 films are getting good DVD releases. I hope there's more to come.
