 Titanic. The ultimate movie. Winner of a lot of Academy Awards and who knows what else. I'm one of those people who thinks that the movie, the cast, and the crew got deserved all that it got.   Everyone knows the plot, so I'm going to skip that. The acting is astounding. All of the performances are worthy, and are given with heart. Kate Winslet could not have, in any way, played her character any better. She was astounding, and so is her beauty. Leonardo DiCaprio was also good, but some of his dialogue seemed dull. But that didn't slow down any of the movie, nor did it really damage his performance. Billy Zane did well as the over-possessive poor excuse for a man. You really hated this man from the first shot of him in the movie. Gloria Stuart was awesome, and gave a little bit of humor to the movie. The rest of the supporting cast were wonderful, and I can't go without mentioning Kathy Bates. Her character, Molly, was the most lovable woman ever to grace the big screen, but that's just my opinion on that.   Since I really don't know much about the directing elements of a film, I can't really comment on it, but I do know that scenes were well organized and the moods were set just right. The characters were introduced very approachingly, and never really focused on one character while the introductions were occurring. We were set up perfectly to know who we were going to be watching. When the sinking began, the movie took a faster pace, and did it well. All the while, focusing on Rose and Jack's love for each other.  Titanic has gone down as classic, and certainly does live up to that standard.
