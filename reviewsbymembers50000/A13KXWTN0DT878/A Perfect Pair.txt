 Romy & Michelle's High School Reunion. A light .... ahem ... airy comedy about two social misfits going through their high school years and then making a grand appearance at their high school reunion. You know things never go exactly right until the end in these movies, and the same thing happens here. But hey! It's quiet the entertaining watch.  Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino, awesome pairing. They made Romy & Michelle. This film could have seriously gone off the annoying bend, but it doesn't. It stays on a good track the entire time. A very hilarious track. Kudrow and Sorvino were awesome as the titular characters. They're interaction was great, and Kudrow's present air-headedness role is always a hoot. Janeane Gurafolo is a nice unpleasant character with many humorous lines that she gracefully pulled off. The woman never ceases to entertain. Alan Cummings plays an Alan Cummings role. I always like him in movies.   The DVD isn't something to cheer about. Although the film is great enough, I wish a few more extras could have been spared. But taking note that the movie didn't necessarily come out when DVD hit its prime, it's okay for the lack of extras. What really would be great is an audio commentary from Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino. I say "Special Edition!"
