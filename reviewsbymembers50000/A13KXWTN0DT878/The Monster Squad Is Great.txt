 The Monster Squad is like The Goonies, but with your favorite Universal monsters. Monster Squad follows a group of kids who call themselves, The Monster Squad. They gather in a treehouse to discuss all things monster, and fear walking by  Creepy German Guy's house. When the squad realizes that monsters are real, and are looking for a stone to begin world domination, they do everything to stop the world from being taken over. Even if it requires the help of Creepy German Guy.  Of course, the best thing about The Monster Squad is the monsters. All of your favorites from the classic Universal movies are here. Dracula (portrayed wonderfully by Duncan Regehr) and his "brides," the Werewolf, the Creature from the Black Lagoon, the Mummy, and the all-time favorite, Frankenstein. I really like how they decided to portray ol' Frank as a gentle monster confused in his situation. The bond he shared with the little girl in the movie was also great, and made a tearful moment near the end of the movie. Oh, the ending. That's what really makes this movie a treasure. The final showdowns are always the best, but this one really shows how a final showdown should be done. If you're a fan of The Goonies and the Universal monsters, then check The Monster Squad out.
