 Frank Oz & Jim Henson are genuises! The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth are the top 2 fantasies of all time. I mean, who wouldn't want to be Jen, a boy who risks it all to save the love of his life, or Hoggle, the old dwarfed gatekeeper of the Labyrinth? These 2 movies were made just so you can wish you were part of them! My favorite out of these two is Labryinth, though. Jennifer Connely did a fine performance as Sarah, a girl who wishes her baby brother into the hands of the goblin king, thinking nothing of it. Only to have it actually happen. She then must find her way through the Labryinth to rescue her baby brother. This movie could not have been made with Jim Henson's characters. Such as Hoggle, Ludo, and the very loveable, fast-paced Sir Diddimus. These 2 movies will gone down as classics.
