 This may sound kind of shallow, but I had never really heard of Kylie Minogue until I saw her cameo in Moulin Rouge. Her voice was one to be proud of. Then I came across her single Can't Get You Out of My Head which was a fun, dancing tune with Kylie's singing moving right along with the back beats. Those two reasons are the reasons why I decided to buy her cd, Fever. And that's when I found out that Kylie was a UK hit, and had plenty more albums out. But her US release, Fever, was the only one I could find. And there's no bad in that. Fever is a great mix of dance tracks and dance ballads. The goods for me are More, More, More (It's just the beat, I love it), Give It to Me (Kylie's such a temptress here!), Fragile (This is one of Kylie's slower songs, but it's just as good. It's actually my favorite), and Burning Up (A great mix of ballad-like lyrics that switches over to dance floor beats). The remaining tracks on Kylie Minogue's Fever keep the album at a status to where it's certainly worth the purchase. And the cover of the cd ... Wow! Yes?
