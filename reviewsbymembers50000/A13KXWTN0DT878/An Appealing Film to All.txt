 Jody Sawyer has made it into the most prestigious dance school, and she goes through what every young lady goes through while maintaining friendships, a mistaken relationship, and her dance career.  Center Stage tells this story, and many other side stories in an easy flowing, interesting way. Not only has Center Stage appealed to those who dance, but it has appealed to those who do not. Although it's main focus is the ballet world, there is  more to Center Stage. What makes the film really good is almost all of the characters are well developed by time the first hour rolls around, and you feel for everyone's outcome. A lot of that goes to the performances by the actors. They were all mostly unknowns, and all came out swell. Amanda Schull as the lead, Jody, was wonderful. She's quite a beauty, and her dancing is wonderful. The remaining cast are all great and talented in acting and exceptionally talented in dancing. The last two dance scenes are excellently choreographed.   The DVD release is a great special editions featuring deleted scenes, extended dance sequences (Fun stuff), an in-depth featurette with interviews with cast and crew, the isolated film score, trailer, and Mandy Moore's I Wanna Be With You video (Which actually enticed me to see the film).    "Life doesn't hold tryouts" states the tagline of Center Stage, and that's exactly what the film's moral is. Great movie.
