 Forgive me for liking Not Another Teen Movie, but I couldn't help it. It's not because I found all of the humour (Sick, crazy humour) funny, but it's because of all the references and spoofs that it set out to do. It pokes fun at almost every single teen movie released in the past 4 years, and managed to spoof some from the 80s as well. The film takes the basic storyline of She's All That, and moves on from there introducing each one of the characters. Each taken from different movies with combinations of its characters. The most entertaining - to me - was The Cruelest Girl based on Sarah Michelle Gellar's Kathryn from Cruel Intentions and the trio of desperate virgins based mainly on the American Pie guys. And kudos to the casting team for getting Molly Ringwald to set our two leads straight in the end! In accordance with my positive notes, I do have one negative. I didn't really expect the film to have an even plot, but there were a few plot holes that just lingered and never were covered up. But who really cares in a movie like this?  The DVD special edition should satisfy anyone with 18 deleted and extended scenes. All of which are fun to watch (Especially the extended musical scene with more of the characters having their part. Even Reggie Ray). There are two commentaries from the cast and crew to listen, 3 fun to watch featurettes, audition footage (Fun to see the cast joke around and such), the unrated version of Marilyn Manson's Tainted Love, and there's much more to entertain (If you found the movie entertaining).   Not Another Teen Movie is brainless, senseless, harmless fun. For others it could be rude, crude, and offensive. But hey, that's what the filmmakers were going for, weren't they?
