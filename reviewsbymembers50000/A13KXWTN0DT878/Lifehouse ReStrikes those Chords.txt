 Lifehouse has literally struck the chords of my life again with their new cd, Stanley Climbfall. The lyrics in every song relate to life in every way and for every person. Wade's voice is perfect for the words he sings, and for the instrumentals in the background.  Stanley Climbfall has 12 new songs from Lifehouse that I instantly began to favor. Although some more than others, I am sure to come around to the songs I've yet to listen to a lot. My favorites right now are Spin, Out of Breath, Just Another Name, Take Me Away, Precious, and Am I Ever Gonna Find Out.   Just like No Name Face, Stanley Climbfall has soft, meaningful ballads; songs that make you happy with life; and power songs that speak meaningful truth. Lifehouse has now proven they're here to stay with this great, great cd.
