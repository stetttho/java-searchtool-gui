 I used to dislike Britney Spears. I thought her music was to bubbly, and all those rumours about her "enhancement" just made me dislike her. But I begin to read more about her, really listen to her music, and I  have respect for her. That's when I bought "Oops!...I Did It  Again". Her music hits the soul! From strong dance beats (title track,  Stronger, Can't Get No Satisfaction) to soothing melodies(When Your Eyes  Say It, Dear Diary) to songs you love (Lucky, What U See Is What U Get),  the cd satisfies all your music needs!I really like the song Lucky, that  tells the story of a girl who is big and famous, but doesn't know if she's  really happy. If it relates to Britney, I hope she knows, and I think she  does, that she has fans that will always be there for her.
