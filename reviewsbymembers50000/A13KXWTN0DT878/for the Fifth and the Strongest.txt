 Every year of Buffy is intense, moving, funny, and relative, but the fifth season magnifies each of these qualities. With the fun stuff that is Buffy vs. Dracula, the season then introduces Michelle Trachtenberg as Dawn, and thus begins the goodness that is the fifth season. Aside from season two and the Buffy / Angel / Angelus story arc, the Dawn / Buffy / Glory story arc is the next to have as much emotion and structure. Some saw Dawn as annoying, as did I, but in the end, the storyline changed that idea for me.  I know it's said everywhere, but this season also produced one of Joss' best episodes, The Body. It is an episode that shows almost true brilliance from Joss, as the director, and superb performances from the cast. And I've never spared so many tears for a tv show as I did during the season finale, The Gift. Not even did the series finale hit such an emotional spot.  As for the DVD set itself, it's a step up from the fourth season, as each season steps up.  Plenty of commentaries from Joss and writers/directors/producers. These commentaries are the most interesting to sit and listen to if you're a devote fan, but great listens with a little filler if you aren't. The featurettes are there as always, even more this time around (the "Natural Causes" covering The Body is one of the more interesting, and seeing Clare Kramer speak on Glory in the "Story of Season 5" is great). Also included are Outtakes, finally, but just some from the first 3 seasons. They're still great.  Buffy's fifth season is my favorite out of all of the seasons, whether it be because of the story arc, superb cast (Sarah MG's and Alyson Hannigan's best moments are here), great directing, or just because the relation to the characters ... it's unknown. As for all other Buffy fans, it varies. As for those who aren't fans, then I recommend going back and purchasing season one and then subsequently purchasing the other seasons. It's worth it. Don't trust me? Ask another fan.
