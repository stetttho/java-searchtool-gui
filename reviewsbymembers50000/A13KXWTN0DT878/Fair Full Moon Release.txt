 I always look for the fun in Full Moon releases, but Horrorvision was all serious. In fact, I think this is the first Full Moon release I've seen that took a serious stride. HorrorVision tells the story of Sed, a technology freak who is losing friends to a mysterious website. After he loses his girlfriend, it looks like all hope is lost from this guy. After being attacked by a techno-pede (my word for the creature that resembled a centipede but was all metal), he runs into a mysterious man who helps him on his quest to discover the truth behind HorrorVision.com. I believe if they worked on this a bit more, and made the gore a bit more believable, it would've worked well if it had been widely released. The acting was real good for Full Moon, and the directing was quiet good also. Although there were things not needed in the movie, I think it was a pretty fair release from Full Moon. The ending left it open for a sequel, which I hope will be a tad better if there is one.
