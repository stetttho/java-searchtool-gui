 I once scolded a friend for liking anything to do with N'Sync. Granted, I was one of those who never liked the band nor cared much for its music. When this friend bought JC's Schizophrenic, I just sniffed the cd off without much thought. But the more I heard it played, the more I wanted to hear. It started with track 9, All Day Long... . Then I heard the ballad that is Dear Goodbye followed by the more dance-beat, "Sweet Dreams" sounding Come to Me. These three tracks are what stand out to me now, and what made me buy the album. I was surprised with the remainder of the album and how JC's songs are fun, witty, hot, and his ballads are meaningful.    I was surprised with how much most of his songs are laced with sexual innuendos, but that's what JC Chasez is now. I'll get lash back for this, but I consider him the male Christina Aguilera. Although I respect Christina more than Jc, it's that their music style is similiar and its themes are similiar.    Schizophrenic has made me a fan of at least one N'Sync goneby. And the album is a great beginning for JC.
