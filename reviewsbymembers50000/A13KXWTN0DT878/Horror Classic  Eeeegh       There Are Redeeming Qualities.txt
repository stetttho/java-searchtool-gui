 I had always heard and thuoght Friday the 13th was one of the definite horror movies of the 80s, much like Nightmare on Elm Street and the such. After finally seeing it, I only half agree with that statement. I did not enjoy F13 like I thought I would. Perhaps it has something to do with me seeing all of the sequels (minus part 2) before actually seeing where they stemmed from. The sequels all set up plenty of gore and hokey suspense while F13 wasn't all about the chase scenes and surplus gore. I'm guessing it went more the way that Halloween did with the subtle horror and murderer's POV shots.   There are qualities that I did like about Friday the 13th. To begin with, it drew the backstory of the whole series, and is a serious horror movie (Unlike most of the sequels). The acting is average, and the characters are well developed before we see them (or don't see) killed. Kudos to Adrienne King and the shortly seen yet very effective performance of Betsy Palmer. Sean Cunningham's use of POV shots were great and helped set up plenty of tension and suspense in the film. The use of rain and the dark was good, and gave the film that really good "camp" feel. Tom Savini's makeup effects are put to good use, but it's a shame we're always only briefly shown what he has done.  What's a big shame is Paramount is so noncaring to its consumers that it only provides us with the trailer for the film. I don't mean to be so demanding, but there's so much stuff they could add to the Friday the 13th DVDs, and they don't bother to. Paramount, you need to listen to fans.  Friday the 13th fairs well as a horror movie, in my opinion. It was breakthrough in its time, and has gone down as a classic. Over millions of fans can't be wrong.
