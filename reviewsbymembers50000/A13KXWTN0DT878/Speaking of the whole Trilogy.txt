 With the few 'Buffy' books Christopher Golden & Nancy Holder has written ('Child of the Hunt, 'REturn to Chaos, 'Halloween Rain') , I knew there work was awesome. When The Gatekeeper Trilogy came out, they lost their rank of awesome in my book, and they now have UBERAWESOMERIFFICAL  (dumb word, but means BIG TIME awesome). They depicted each character to  the bone, and gave literally so much detail my mind was playing lie a movie  as I pictured the scenes in my head. I do that with all books, but this is  the one that I clearly could see happening. All in All, Christopher G.  & Nancy H. KICK VAMPIE BOOTIE!
