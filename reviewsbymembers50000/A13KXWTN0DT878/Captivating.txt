 Shakira can easily be compared with other great talents. I believe Shakira is one on her own. She's beyond talented. And her English debut proves my opinion. Laundry Service delivers a blend of music genres (Rock, pop, world) with lyrics from the hand of Shakira herself and a voice from the soul. Shakira's first single, Whenever Wherever, interested me. Then I saw the video, and was hooked. I bought Laundry Service and was captivated by what I heard. Every song on Laundry Service is worthy. The highlights are Whenever Wherever, Underneath Your Clothes, Fool, Te Dejo Madrid (I really need to learn Spanish, but I didn't care what she was saying, she sounded great and the beat's just right), Poem to a Horse, and Eyes Like Yours. Those are my tops, but the others are very awesome. For someone who writes and sings her own songs, and also helped produced her album, I say kudos to Shakira, Keep it alive.
