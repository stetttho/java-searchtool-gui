 A Walk to Remember is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. The soundtrack goes right along with it. As in, it's one of the best soundtracks I've heard in long time. The soundtrack is faithful to the movie, keeping almost -- if not -- every song that there is in the movie. Mandy Moore's tracks -- "Cry," "Someday We'll Know," "It's Gonna Be Love," and "Only Hope" -- are all sweet tracks. "Someday We'll Know" is a take on the New Radicals song of the same name, and Mandy collaborates with Jonathan Foreman making it a nice listen. "It's Gonna Be Love" has got to be one of Mandy's next singles, it's awesome. And "Only Hope" is the song that Mandy sings in the movie, and is great. She's absolutely wonderful when she sings it in the movie.  A band featured on the soundtrack is Switchfoot. Before now, I had never heard of them. But after hearing their songs -- "Learning to Breathe," "Dare You to Move," "You," and "Only Hope" - I want their previous CDs. Their songs are great, and give a lot of meaning to the movie.   Remaining on the disc is the upbeat New Radical's track "Mother, We Just Can't Get Enough," Toploader's retro "Dancing In the Moonlight," Rachel Lampa's R&B "If You Believe."  A Walk to Remember's soundtrack is placed high on the best soundtracks of all time, and will remain there unless some miracle happens.
