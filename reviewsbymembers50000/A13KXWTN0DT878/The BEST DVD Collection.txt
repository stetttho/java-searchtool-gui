 Fred Krueger, a name that brought fear to me as a child, and I'm sure to plenty of others. But I began to overcome my fears by watching the Nightmare on Elm Street movies 1 by 1. Then I began to constantly rerent  them. Why? Becuase they are the most interesting movies. Wes Craven,  creator of the series, made what you thought the safest thing to do, the  most harmful thing to do. Sleeping. Fred Krueger was a child murdered who  was burnt by the parents of the children he murdered a few years back. Now,  Nancy Thompson and her friends are having dreams of a man in a red &  green sweater, and that has knives for fingegs. Nancy's friend began to die  mysterious deaths, and Nancy knows who's to blame, Fred Krueger. After  finding out about his past, Nancy turns to adults for help. Not even they  will believe her. So now it's up to her and only her to fight Freddy. That  was the first. The first that spawned 6 sequels. All of them record  breaking movies! Now, the sequels and the original are brought together in  a top-notch dvd collection, along with an extra DVD called the Nightmare  Encylopedia. The Nightmare Encyclopedia is every Nightmare On Elm Street  lover's paradise. With over hours of interviews with cast & crews of  the movies, snippets from Freddy's MTV Special, behind-the-scenes footage,  theatrical trailers, music videos, and even 2 alternate endings! I don't  know how anyone will ever beat this DVD collection.
