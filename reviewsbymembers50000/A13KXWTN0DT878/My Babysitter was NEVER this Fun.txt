 Elisabeth Shue is Chris Parker, a normal seventeen year old who begins the night with an ordinary babysitting job, sitting two normal suburban children, Sarah and Brad. After her friend - Brenda (Penelope Anne Miller) -- calls from a bus station in the city (Chicago), stating that she has runaway from home and needs Chris' support, Chris takes off to the city with Brad, Sarah, and Brad's friend, Daryl. What should have been a 30 minute ride to the bus station turns into a run through the city as the group of four encounter car thieves, weird mechanics, and a place where nobody leaves without singing the blues.          Adventures in Babysitting is THE fun movie of the 80s. Well, THE fun movie that doesn't contain little monsters, goonies, or Tom Hanks. As we follow the quartet through Chicago, we are introduced to hilarious scenes and crazy antics as they get themselves in the middle of a car heist, a cheating wife and her enraged husband, and many more. I must say that one of the biggest highlights of the film is the Blues Bar scene where Elisabeth Shue and the kids absolutely have to sing before leaving the bar. It's great.          The films is full of great characters. Elisabeth Shue is vibrant as Chris Parker, the babysitter gal. Her interaction with the kids was great, and she handled her leading status with ease. Maia Brewton is little Sarah who offers a lot of the laughs in the movie. She was awesome - I wonder where she is now? Keith Coogan and Anthony Rapp (Rent! Mark in Rent! I love Rent!) are Brad and Daryl, and both stay true to their roles and make them entertaining. But did anyone else want to occasionally strangle Anthony Rapp for that laugh?! We also see the likes of a young Penelope Anne Miller and Vincent D'Onofrio in cameo roles. Although Miller's role is a bit bigger, and very hilarious.   Although the DVD release is bare, without even a nice trailer to suit a fan, we do get a nicely widescreen anamorphic presentation with nice picture (Although there are signs of an aged film) and good audio.                     Adventures In Babysitting is definitely one of my favorite 80s movies. For the fact that it's a great, fun, and crazily adventurous comedy.
