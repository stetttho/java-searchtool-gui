 From the first moment I heard Kimberley Locke sing her duet Band of Gold with Frenchie on AI2, I knew I would like her and stick with that. I was sad to see her go away in the competition in 3rd place, but now, it's as if she has came out the third winner.   8th World Wonder is an awesome first single. I don't want to call the song catchy, but it definitely carries its own in the line of singles given from previous AI contestants. I'm going to go out on a limb and say that it exceeds those two who came out ahead of her.   The new rendition of Over the Rainbow was a bit eh at first, but listening to it longer, it turned out to be great. Kimberley's range is shown more here.  Her album, One Love, couldn't get here any sooner.
