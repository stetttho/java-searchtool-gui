 In almost every review anywhere of Urban Legend, it has been compared to the Scream trilogy (WHICH IS AWESOME!). Sure, maybe there is little comparison (the teen cast, killer having a costume), but the plot is way  different. And is very good (couldn't think of a good adjective). Natalie  is a student at a New England college, and her friends are beginning to  drop off one by one according to Urban Legends. And Natalie is a witness to  each murder that is done by the parka wearing ax carrier. But noone will  believe Natalie. Of course, there is one more simliraity to Scream, the  "Everybody's a suspect" thing, but who the killer actually is, is  a total surprise! And he/she plays the best psycho I've seen in a while!  The only thing I've found wrong with this movie is the casting of the lead  Natalie. Alicia Witt wasn't just too believable. Only in the ending  sequence was she. But all the other stars (Rebecca Gayheart, Michael  Rosenbaum, Tara Reid, Loretta Devine) did some great acting. Now let's just  hope the seqeul to be released this fall is as good.
