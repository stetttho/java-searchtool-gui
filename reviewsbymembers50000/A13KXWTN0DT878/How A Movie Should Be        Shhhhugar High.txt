 Empire Records is a GREAT example of how a movie should be made these days. It takes a group of determined individuals with their own problems -- who all work at a record stored promptly titled Empire Records - and lets us look in on one day of their lives. It doesn't use the standard movie formula. Except for the fact that it has a happy ending. But when that ending comes, you don't want the movie to stop. You want it to continue into the next day to see if AJ and Corey's relationship makes it or if Gina decides to change her "turbo slut" ways and become the lead singer of a band. And even if Debi decides to take life as what it is.  The cast really made this movie. They all may not be topnotch actors, but their performances were awesome. Renee Zellwegger and Liv Tyler gave believable performances, although I prefer Renee's performance better. Ethan Embry was a riot. The rest of the cast were awesome. There's also a cameo by Coyote Shivers, and the performance between him and Renee Zellwegger's character near the end made 50% of the movie. The dialogue used is also some of the most quotable dialogue ever in a movie. Many have already mentioned that, and it's true that is quotable. Another "must mention" is the soundtrack. It works VERY well with the movie, and the songs are very catchy tunes.  When Empire Records ends, whether you liked it or not, the movie fills you with a certain feeling that you must watch it again and again.
