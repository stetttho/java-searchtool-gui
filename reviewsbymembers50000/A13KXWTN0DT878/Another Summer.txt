 As most people say: "The first was better." In I Still Know's case, that's the truth. I Know was a whole better in the sense of suspense and plot. In I Know, it was fresh and original. In I Still Know, we knew the story and who the killer was and why he wanted to kill. We were just shown some new chase scenes and a bit more gore.  Not that the movie is bad, it's just that they could have come up with something a little better. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. reprise their roles as the survivors from I Know, Julie and Ray. New faces are Brandy, Mekhi Pfeiffer, Matthew Settle, and Jennifer Esposito. All give a little less than solid, but not bad,  performances.  The ending does give a nice twist, and doesn't fall flat on that. I Still Know is a good movie, although my review seems to give the front that I didn't like it. I did. But I prefer the first much more. Although I Still Know will be watched over and over by me. Well, at least once a year. During the summer.
