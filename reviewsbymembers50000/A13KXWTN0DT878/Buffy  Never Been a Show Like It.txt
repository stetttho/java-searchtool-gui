 Joss Whedon did well with the 1992 original feature, but most of his stuff on the movie was taken out. He then decided to make a tv show out of it. People thought the show wouldn't make it. They were proved wrong with the show aired in March of 1997. Since then, the show has grown into something HUGE. And these 6 episodes on tape are a part of that. At best, they're one of the very reasons this show is so big. What is that reason? The tragic love story of the slayer, Buffy Summers, in love with a vampire with a soul, Angel. Although the storyline has grown and died since these 6 episodes, it is a good way to start it off. If I say more about this, I will go on and on. I have one more thing to say: You don't even have to be a fan of the show to watch this!
