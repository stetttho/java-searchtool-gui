 Think about taking 90 minutes to combine Joyride, Wrong Turn, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, House of 1000 Corpses, Deliverance, Jeepers Creepers, Maximum Overdrive, and a really bad Jack Black wannabe and putting it into a movie. Stop thinking, it's been done for ya in the flick that is Monster Man. Taken directly from Joyride's concept, we have 2 college buddies cross countrying it so that one of them can confess his love for a girl. Along the way, they seem to upset someone who drives a big big truck and that big big truck's driver is determined to make them pay. After picking up a hitchhiking damsel in distress, complete mayhem ensues.    Oh, how full of cheese this movie is. And oh, how much of a rip-off it is. Could it be a spoof? Possibly. But no matter, this movie was one thoughtless 90 minutes full of fun. I enjoyed just waiting to reference any other movie I could catch, and some of the situations the trio got into were actually fun (ie the dream / roadkill scene).    There's nothing special about Monster Man. The only ones that will most likely enjoy this are those who enjoy cheesy horror movies. Gorehounds may be pleased also (oooh the crushed car / dead man bit, and the finale). It's just fun.
