 The Fast and the Furious looks like any car lover's dream movie. Granted, it is. But it's more than just a car movie. It has plot. In fact, it has a good and detailed plot. It tells the story of a guy (Paul Walker) who mistakenly is taken up by a group of streetcar racers, and deals with the world of streetcar racing. Yet, there is something much more behind the new guy. I would give that away, but it surprised me when I watched the movie, so I won't spoil it.   The first thing, even before the plot, anyone will noticed about The Fast and the Furious are its intense action sequences. There's plenty of them, and all are enjoyable to watch. And they're not all just placed there so there will be an action sequence. They deal with the story. The next is its stars. They are a few known faces in this film. Vin Deisel and Paul Walker lead the cast. Actually, this film is Vin Deisel's film. He portrayed his character very well, and made him very believable. I can't say the same for Paul Walker. Even though he faired well, the way he handled some of his dialogue just seemed out of place to me. Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster level the film out with estrogen, and do it well. Both ladies played their characters well. Even though Rodriguez got stuck with her usual typecasting. There are also few subplots going throughout the movie, but are never really confusing nor downplay the entertainment value of the movie.   The Fast and the Furious DVD is a must have for it's full of entertaining supplements to keep you busy for a while. And the film itself, well of course, it's quiet worth the purchase also.
