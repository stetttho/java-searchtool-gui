 I recently read John Passerella's first Buffy novel, Ghoul Trouble, and LOVED it. He captured the characters with such ease and approximately. And now, with Avatar, he does the same with the characters. Angel, Cordelia, Doyle, and even Kate are displayed respectfully and with the right characterization.   When a demon materializes in LA, needing to find 12 victims to complete a cycle in which the demon will be reunited with its true body, Angel and the crew are on top of it, along with the help of Detective Kate Lockley. The demon is using a man, who he promised the world to, to find his victims online in chatrooms. The demon appears to his victims as what they most desire. On a side note, Cordelia wants a website made for Angel Investigations, and that results in some humorous moments. Especially with the aide of a teenage computer geek.  Passarella really knows how to write a novel. It's absolutely expertise, and he knows exactly what he's writing about. He never makes the novel drag or become dull. There is one incident that makes the whole novel though. It plays out when Cordelia is chosen as bait to lure the demon in so Angel and Doyle can destroy it. We then see who each one of them desire. It's a very interesting and suspenseful moment in the novel.  John Passerella is now up there with Christopher Golden and Nancy Holder as one of the best Buffy and Angel novelists. I hope to see more coming from him in the future.
