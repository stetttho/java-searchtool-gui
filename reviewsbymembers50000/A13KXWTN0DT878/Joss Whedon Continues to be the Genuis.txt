 In November of 2001, it was official. Joss Whedon was a total genuis. Once More, With Feeling premiered on UPN to the eyes of Buffy fans and non-alike, and it made television history. Mucho thanks to Joss Whedon's brilliant writing of the lyrics, and the surprising singing talents of the cast of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. All of the songs speak in the mythos of Buffy, and are sung by its cast superbly and "with feeling." Sarah Michelle Gellar's voice is soft and powerful in Going Through the Motions, Walk Through the Fire, and Something to Sing About. Nicholas Brendon and Emma Caulfield are quirky and amazing in their true Broadway number, I'll Never Tell. Amber Benson shows she has a wonderful voice in Under Your Spell whilst Anthony Stewart Head showcases his musical talent in Standing. There are many more collaborations with the whole cast which are truly listenable with no downsides. There are also little hilarious songs with cameos from producers David Greenwalt (Mustard Stain) and Marti Noxon (Parking Ticket). The orchastral scores from the episodes Hush, Restless, and The Gift were a nice addition. Especially that of The Gift. And to hear Joss Whedon and his wife sing Something to Sing About is an extra that will be enjoyed.    Once More, with Feeling was critically-acclaimed and praised by everyone. It was a disgrace that the Emmy people ignored this piece (Although it did get a minor nom, it didn't win). But what really matters is that we fans know that Joss Whedon and cast's talent is really shown here.
