 As many know, Buffy the Vampire Slayer is now a cult hit tv show. This is what started it all. Joss Whedon wrote the script for the movie, but always envisioned it as a tv series. And although his script was tinkered with, for the movie, I think the movie turned out good. Of course, it's campy and cheesy. But that's what makes it good. Kristy Swanson stars as Buffy, she who must rid the world of the forces of darkness. She is guided by Merrick, her watcher, played by Donald Sutherland and a friend, Pike, played by Luke Perry. There are also appearances by the then up & coming David Arquette and Hilary Swank. When Buffy finds out her destiny as the Slayer, she must help Merrick slay a very powerful vampire, played by Rutger Hauer. Of course, chaos ensues, but Buffy saves the day in a final showdown worthy of all the one-liners shot out by Rutger and Kristy. Although the hit show created by Joss is superbly better, the movie still holds it own and will go down as a cult classic.
