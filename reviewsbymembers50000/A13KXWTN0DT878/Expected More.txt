 I thought this movie would be something more, but the teaser trailer was far better than the movie! I understood that it wasn't a jump out horror movie, but more of a psychological thriller thing, and still, no good.  Maybe the only thing good in it was Catherine Zeta-Jones that neat  merry-go-round / mirror room, and the special effects.. I also found the  other characters in the movie quiet boring, and the plot confused me until  the third time I watched it. But if you like slow-paced movies that  eventually end, then this is for you.
