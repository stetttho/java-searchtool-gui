 My subject asks the questions, good or bad? Well, Nightmare on Elm Street 2 has been labeled, by many people, the worst of the Nightmare series. I agree. All the other sequels were more entertaining, but there are some good points to Nightmare 2. The plot was a great idea. With Freddy trying to possess a new resident in Nancy Thompson's (from Nightmare 1). The longer the dude resides at the house, the more he notices what is happening. The plot was an awesome idea, but the directing is what made it such a let-down. I would say the acting, but the acting was real good (besides the guy's father). Back to the directing. Things just seemed to move a bit fast at times, and at other times, a bit slow. The ending wasn't all that great, and the final show-down between the female character and Freddy turned out to be, to me, a resemblance of a twisted soap opera episode. But if you're like me, you've bought this one to complete your Nightmare on Elm Street collection. Although it is possible you can just skip this one and go on to the awesome Nightmare on Elm Street 3 without missing any major plot details.
