 I really related to this movie in one main way, the fear of clowns. Why, to me, is there so much fear of clowns? The same reason the little guy in this movie gave, or the reason the movie gave. You always see the outer shell of a clown: the costume, the paint, the brightly colored wig. But you never see what's on the inside. In Clownhouse's case, it was three psycho lunatics that escaped from a mental ward and managed to kill three clowns from a town circus.  They then take the costumes, and face paint and apply it to theirselves. Meanwhile, three brothers are at the circus, and the youngest has a great fear of clowns. The brothers leave the circus, thinking everything is great, but the mental patients follow them home. This movie used the usual horror methods. Like the killer following closely behind it's victim without the victim knowing it. Although this has been used many times, it was cleverly pulled off here, and made for some tense and creepy moments. Another method used was the silent killer type. This could be creepy in any other movie, but try looking at a painted on smiling face who's expression never changes, and sound never escapes it's mouth. People with great of fear of clowns will relate to this movie, but those who don't have a fear, will enjoy it non-the-least.
