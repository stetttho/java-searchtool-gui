 As the most well-known and acclaimed of Shaffer's plays, Equus definitely makes that reputation obvious as soon as you open the pages.  As stylized and abstract as some of it is, it is nothing more than life changing.  I saw a taped recording of it when Sir Anthony Hopkins played the role of  Dysart, and it was brilliant, pure theatre.  For theater-aficionados, this  play should be in your script collection, no doubt!  This is a play in  which the audience is so spellbound that they have an extremely difficult  time averting their eyes from the stage.  For any directors or actors out  there in a theatre production group, perform this play......no inhibitions  needed!
