 True, there isn't a bad song on this album, but very few of them are remarkable.  THE HUSH features symphonic flourishes, Motown touches, and most "remarkably," the beautiful, emotive voice of Sharleen Spiteri.  Her voice can range from show-stopping to Diana Ross to, [...], Prince.  From listening, one would never guess they're from Glasgow. "Once in a Lifetime" is the quintessential pop song, despite the similarities between its chorus and the chorus of "Creep" by TLC.  Its Asian-themed opener adds a touch of eclecticism. On "Tell Me The Answer," Sharleen sings "come on, come on, come on" with the same urgency and longing as Blur did on "Tender" from their 13 album.  "Summer Son" is another hard-hitting, driven tune like "Black-Eyed Boy."  "Black-Eyed Boy" is a song from their previous album WHITE ON BLONDE, and it's amazing.  I suggest anyone interested in Texas check out this album first before the others.  It's a great intro into Texas's world. To get an idea of the other songs on the album, "When We Are Together" features a Motown groove along with some Elton John-styled piano.  It is the happiest tune as Spiteri sings, "Love started making sense/I always make mistakes at my expense." "Zero Zero" is an instrumental with more Asian influence but with a trip-hop kick.  "Saint" gives more trip-hop sounds, but this song sounds more like Garbage (2.0), a much more melancholy and sensual sound than the other songs on the album; it also showcases lyrics like "Catch another dream now/We can find them somehow." Like others who have found this great secret, I am surprised they haven't had more airplay than just a song on a second-rate Jennifer Aniston movie.  I hope more people catch on to this great band.
