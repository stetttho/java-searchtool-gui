 Madonna has never been one to jump on any bandwagon; her tendency, rather, is to be the driver.  Her new flavor: dance floor cowgirl funkstress.  Writing more creative lyrics that are the most exposing she's even sung, Madonna is displaying a wide range of maturity. Don't judge Music, the album, by hearing "Music", the single.  While the song is the catchiest and funkiest and probably will be the biggest hit of the album, Music offers a lot more, and excluding "Music," the slower songs are the real gems. "Nobody's Perfect" is her most self-exposing; she admits her mistakes and flaws but welcomes them and grows from them.  The use of the vocoder on this song and subtle and very appropriate to the song.  In fact, it's the only song it really sounds good on.  "What It Feels Like For a Girl" is one of the best songs, along with "Gone," of the album.  It sounds like it could have been written by a younger Madonna during her earlier career.  "Gone" opens up with what must be Madonna's mantra for meditation: "Selling out is not my thing."  These are simple pop songs, but they are beautiful and profound. However, a couple songs are miserable compared to the rest of the album.  "Impressive Instant" is annoying and campy with more vocoder-tricks; these are overdone though.  "Paradise (Not For Me)" is the last miss of the album.  Contrite and stuffy, Madonna rasps out most of the lyrics for the song, and don't forget your French dictionary on this one--Madonna goes bilingual.  These are the only misses of the album though. Overall, the sound is a leap ahead of her earlier work being even more playful and experimental, but still without the drama and lingering that made Ray of Light a milestone in Madonna's career.  Still, extremely capable and very fun...
