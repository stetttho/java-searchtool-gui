 ALONG CAME A SPIDER is another nice installment of the Alex Cross series of mysteries.  The book has truly translated well onto the screen. Morgan Freeman does an excellent job; he plays the character of Cross much less stiffly than we have seen with other genius detective types.  Most of the time, they're so clinical and absorbed (sometimes self-absorbed) that it's difficult to watch them.  At least Denzel Washington was supposed to be stiff in THE BONE COLLECTOR. The strength of the movie relies heavily on a quick change-up surprise which occurs at about twenty minutes from the end of movie, which is good, because once you figure out that not everyone is quite as they seem (and we all know who's going to win), a resolution shouldn't be drawn out too long. I was impressed by Monica Potter's performance.  Most critics called her a copy of Julia Roberts, which isn't a bad thing necessarily.  There is one scene in which the character Soneji is finally killed, and we see some good acting from her, but not only is she a good actress, her character is a good actress as well.  I won't leak too much information, but when the turning point comes, the movie relies much less on Morgan Freeman as a power-actor and turns the spotlight onto Potter.  Michael Wincott, as Soneji, and Mika Boorem, as Megan Rose, also do fine jobs. The movie's not a classic, but the surprise twist does spin your head a bit, and you will definitely not see it coming, unless you've read the book and you know the Alex Cross formula.  It's a palpable thriller, and I can't wait for the next installment in the Alex Cross mysteries.
