 Sade was the queen of mood music during the 80's, and now she returns with even a more clearer picture of the beauty and pain of love.  Sade doesn't change the formula that has showcased her talents, and she doesn't overcompensate by trying to match and imitate the musical flavors-of-the-week in today's music market.  But she has changed her mood: she is more self-assured, especially in her roots which she sings about in songs like "Slave Song" which features a tribal-like percussion over such lyrics as "...even the comfort of a stone would be a gain." Sade knows sorrow, and no one can deny that when she sings the line "I'm the king of sorrow" in "King of Sorrow."  She has the great ability to convey emotion to her listeners through her singing and music. But, sorrow isn't the theme of this album: love is, as is evident in the title and its song "Lovers Rock."  Sade also keeps a jazzy attitude in "Flow" and "Every Word." I was disappointed in that there aren't any "showstoppers" here like her previous "Jezebel" and "Is It a Crime?" but her simple song writing and powerful statements make the album all worthwhile.  Instead of numerous layerings of sounds and textures, Sade just lets things flow and groove, making it evident that Sade can set any mood.
