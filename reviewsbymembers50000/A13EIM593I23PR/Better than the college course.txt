 A couple months ago, I had the distinct pleasure of hearing Chip Kidd talk about his novel, THE CHEESE MONKEYS, and provide a little insight into the world of Graphic Design.  The novel itself goes a step further with the advice, by allowing us to take a peek into Chip's bag of tricks. The hero, from Smalltown USA, enrolls at the ubiquitous State University, where Art is about as high on the scale of importance as mulching the grounds.  Thankfully, we have a cast of great characters to add some edge to the bell curve.  Himillsey Dodd, artist/sadist/guerilla, takes the hero under her wing while frequently torturing him; it's easy to see why he likes her, but she has a boyfriend, not to mention a few problems of her own.  The sexual tension between them is a great theme, but the character of Winter Sorbeck, the kind of professor we all yearn for and fear, is memorable, to say the least.  Check out the sexual tension there too!  A little twisted, but the events these characters go through could arguable be tame compared to some real college horror stories. My only problem with the novel, as many others I noticed had also, was the ending.  It just seemed messy and abrupt.  The pacing of the story is indeed fast but not that fast.  It was kind of a let down, despite the neat textual effect. Chip Kidd may be revolutionary and a clever boy, but in the end, the cleverness isn't as big of a payback as one would hope.  Yes, the design is fantastic.  I urge you also to read Mark Z. Danielewski's HOUSE OF LEAVES if you want to see another marvel of design, although taken to the extreme.  I have no doubt Chip Kidd will astound us yet again in the future with his jacket art, but I hope his next writing effort is no less amazing.
