 "House of Leaves" is a visual marvel, the kind of novel that  might have been written earlier if Franz Kafka had studied Daedalus'  mythological labyrinth or had seen Stephen King's "The Shining,"  a story which sets its own chilling climax within a maze. When you start  reading "House of Leaves," you think you're just reading a  slightly atypical novel about an atypical house, but after a while, the  book turns on you.  Footnotes stretch to span several pages, the word  "house" takes on an eerie significance, and then, everything is  turned upside-down, as well as backwards, vertical, and every other  direction.  The book has become the house it has been describing.  In the  same way the family in the story discovers a "new" hallway behind  a door that used to open into the backyard, you, the reader, finally  realize this book (this house) is not quite what it seems. This novel  gives much more than just words and their juxtapositions, it also supplies  several "exhibits," startling photographs, cryptic letters from  one of the narrator's mothers, and strangely enough, an index.  Nothing  about this novel is typical.  In one rescue sequence, a rope snaps while  carrying one of the rescue team's members up a long shaft.  To show the  action of this horrifying turn of events, the word "snaps" is  spread over three pages: sn-; -a- ;-ps.  This is the genius behind this  novel. The book arrests all your attention, doing more than just  demanding it.  It reminds one of "The Blair Witch Project" in the  way that if you didn't know it wasn't real, you would believe it.  You  might think, "This could be the house next door or that one on the  corner with the picket fence."  It works the same way even if you know  it's fiction; it's too enticing not to believe and too terrifying to give  in.
