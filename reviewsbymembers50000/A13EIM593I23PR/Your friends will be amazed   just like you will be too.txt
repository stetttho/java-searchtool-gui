 Finally a game/test that proves you wrong when you say that you really don't know yourself that well.  The Cube is amazing in its accuracy, revealing even the most tightly-guarded personalities.  Just by answering a  few simple, visualizing questions (might take some imagination), you can  discover new things about yourself, things about your friends and family,  perhaps even things you didn't want to know. Take the book on trips with  friends, parties, family reunions, etc...  You will be the center of  attention with everyone asking "Cube me!"  Two of my friends have  bought books of their own in order to Cube others; it's quite addictive  once you get going.  A lot of fun to be had by all.
