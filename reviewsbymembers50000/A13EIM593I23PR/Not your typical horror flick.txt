 PITCH BLACK is a rare horror movie which defies the horror formula. As is essential with most creature features, although PITCH BLACK is not about the creatures, you're always wondering and speculating about the deaths of the characters: choosing which ones look like prime meat and which ones you're rooting for. PITCH BLACK throws those expectations out the window, until the very last death, which is shocking in its choice. David Twohy certainly makes us think twice about trusting our expectations. Another formula contraption is also thrown out the window as most horror films seem to make victims out of its black characters, but again, PITCH BLACK defies convention with its fine performance by Keith David (from REQUIEM FOR A DREAM). Twohy creates a barren landscape for which the characters to live and die. Massive skeletons like those of mammoths litter the desert, which is blinding during the day, but when the eclipse plunges everything into darkness, the darkness itself becomes a character, and Twohy is adept at manipulating it. When the creatures do appear, ashen and skeleton-looking themselves, the effect is gripping. A few characters hold surprises: Cole Hauser's addicted cop, the little "boy" who wears a great disguise. I love the interaction between Vin Diesel and the androgynous head-shaved "boy." You can already see where I'm going with this one. Radha Mitchell's performance is affecting, but Vin Diesel steals the show, long before he got the deal to drive fast cars in THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS or play superspy in XXX. He's charismatic, smarmy, bombastic, vulnerable, manipulative, and hateful sometimes, but you keep rooting for him. In the end, I was disappointed by one character's death, but that is to say, I wasn't expecting it, and my jaw dropped when it happened, but anything that foregoes the typical formula, made fun of by such movies like SCARY MOVIE, is fine by me.
