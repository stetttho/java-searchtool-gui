 Lee Ann Womack's I HOPE YOU DANCE is exactly what country music has been needed the last few years.  A innovative album, it is filled with creative musical expression, thoughtful uncliched lyrics (as country music lyrics  usually are), and displays incredible song writing talent.  The crowning  achievement of the album is the title track.  "I Hope You Dance"  is for anyone needing a lift-me-up or inspiration to get back on track.   It's a song for family, friends, and especially since it is that time of  year, for graduating Seniors; its words of wisdom should be guidelines for  any student stepping out into the world.  It should be at the top of your  list of songs to commemorate Graduation.
