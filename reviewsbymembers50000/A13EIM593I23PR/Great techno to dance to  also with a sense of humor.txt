 REMEDY is a great album, full of dance rhythms, sublime soundscapes, and a display of provocative song writing skills. The songs in this album are full hypnotic beats that if nothing more, get your head bobbing.  Known for  the singles "Rendez-vu" and "Red Alert," which are the  two most danceable songs on the album, there are quite a few more.   "Stop 4 Love" I wouldn't know of that many people could dance to  it, but it is absolutely beautiful as a love song without lyrics.  If there  is music that can transport a consciousness, this song is it.  "Don't  Give Up" is another love song, this time in a more Bjork/Tricky-esque  attitude.  One lyric says, "...don't pull the cracks in your mind  apart" which is exactly what the song sounds like, digital cracks  expanding into valleys while the singers' voices weave in and out of the  music. If you have seen any of Basement Jaxx's videos, such as for  "Red Alert" (both versions) or for "Rendez-Vu," you can  see these musicians also have a great sense of humor which is a great in  electronic/techno music.  Everything isn't all break beats and synthesized  melodies, these guys know how to party with their music.
