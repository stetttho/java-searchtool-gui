 The original play by Tim Blake Nelson is a harrowing tale of love, religion, and illusions, and the movie tells this tale with full regard and respect to the play. The story begins with love blossoming between a  small town girl and an jail parolee who has found God during his  incarceration (Plimpton and Anderson) but also with a terrible murder  having been committed in the town.  Slowly we find that things aren't quite  right between the two lovers as she discovers she's pregnant.  Meanwhile, a  witness to the murder, a young boy, stops speaking due to the trauma of  what he's seen.  By the end of the film, all lives have intersected in one  shocking climax. In the same style and theme as LITTLE BOY BLUE, EYE OF  GOD is small town ideals corrupted.  It leaves you asking "WHY",  feeling angry, almost scarred, and feeling entirely empathetic with the  people on screen.  It is true storytelling with a twist.
