 Esthero is essentially a techno album with several other musical influences tucked in the seams.  Many of its combinations seem perfectly matched and effortlessly blended while others pale in comparison. The first single from BREATH FROM ANOTHER was "That Girl," a shimmering, space age jazz groove.  Esthero's harmonies and the trumpet solos perfectly fit the techno enhancements with lyrics such as "It's my right to love."  "Breath From Another" displays enough syncopated hip hop drumming to make Timbaland and Missy "Misdemeanor" green with envy, while "Lounge" features jazz, calypso, and tribal influences.  The hip hop influences must have led Esthero to join with Black Eyed Peas on their "Weekends" song off the BRIDGING THE GAP album.  The most beautiful song on the album is also one of its more simpler songs also: In "Country Livin' (The World I Know)," Esthero turns hopeful to let loose lyrics like "This love could be ours / just look at those stars."  Its simple strings showcase Esthero's voice.  Esthero's voice is her asset.  Its Bjork-esque quality, evident on "Heaven Sent" and "Lounge" especially, is definitely powerful. It has a simple beauty sparked with a hard edge that carries through in several songs. BREATH FROM ANOTHER is a great headphones album, but it also has a few get-up-and-dance songs that groove and shake along.  A few songs, however, fall flat due to their poor matchings of influences.  "Half a World Away" pairs latin music and techno beats; this combo could've been pulled off by another artist, Nelly Furtado maybe, but here, it falters with Esthero's over-manipulated voice.  Their are a couple harsh songs like this.  Still, BREATH FROM ANOTHER is great album, and I'm surprised it didn't catch on more in the US.
