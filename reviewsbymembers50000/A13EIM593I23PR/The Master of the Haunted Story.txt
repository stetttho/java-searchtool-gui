 It is a shame that Shirley Jackson died before finished what most certainly would have been her most provocative novel, yet we are lucky that a small portion exists.  But, if you don't like cliffhangers (even though  this one is on purpose), you'll be disappointed. However, the book  contains much more than just the unfinished novel; it is a collection of  some of her best short stories and lectures.  "The Lottery" is  included as is a "biography" of the story displaying some of the  reactions received by the shocking story.  Other stories such as  "Pajama Party" and "A Day in the Jungle" show her  talent for the human side, innocence and all.  "The Rock" is just  as haunting as "The Lottery" and is perhaps even more  disturbing. A book for writers, COME ALONG WITH ME also includes several  of Jackson's lectures regarding her ideas on the creation of short stories  and their value as literature.  This is definitely a book for those wanting  to become more familiar with Jackson's spellbinding work.
