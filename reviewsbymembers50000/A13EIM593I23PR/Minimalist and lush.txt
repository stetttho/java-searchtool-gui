 The first single from Homogenic was the song "Joga," a  dedication to the wonders of pregnancy.  The song undulates with a rousing,  most of all exhilirating symphony, the strings becoming the transportation  for the song (and the listener). The other Homogenic songs carry the same  kind of transportational quality.  Bjork's sincere lyrics are the  mechanisms for her songs, and are showcase in other songs such as  "Hunter," ("If travel is searching / and home what's been  found / I'm not stopping.") and "All Neon Like."  While  you're not going to find anything as show-stopping as "It's Oh So  Quiet," Homogenic has many other strengths such as its exploration of  love.  "All Is Full of Love" which was also remixed on the  Stigmata soundtrack is a aural marvel.  Bjork's voice splits and weaves all  through the song, and while the hypersonic background will sometimes make  you cover your ears, you'll want to turn up the volume even louder.  The  climax of "All Is Full Of Love" is full of emotion; the first  time you hear it, tears will fall.  "Immature" repeats the same  verse over an almost church choir/organ/bells background while showcasing  Bjork's trademark growl.  Each song is uniquely different from the next,  yet as the title suggests, the same. As dark and moody as Homogenic is,  Bjork still manages to maintain her unique quirks, vocal and personal.  In  "Alarm Call" she waxes enlightenment and her walkman.  Homogenic,  which should have won the Grammy two years ago, is a masterpiece,  nonetheless.  And now that Selmasongs is soon to come out, Bjork will again  wow us and shock us...
