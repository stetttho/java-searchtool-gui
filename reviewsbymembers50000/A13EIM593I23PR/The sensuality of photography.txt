 THE GOVERNESS is a beautifully shot period piece that revolves around the character of Rosalina, played with remarkable depth by Minnie Driver.  Ms. Driver carried the full weight of this film with skill, and I daresay that she has never looked more beautiful or ravishing than in this movie. The film deals with her journey, torn between Jew and incertainty with Gentiles, her love for an older, married man, played by Tom Wilkinson (In The Bedroom), and the unwanted affection of the man's son. A large portion of the film deals with Mr. Cavendish's experiments with photography.  When Rosalina first comes to the Cavendish's home, she is told Mr. Cavendish's secret experiments deal with capturing pictures of ghosts, and indeed, he does seem preoccupied with taking pictures of dead things: a shell from the beach, a bird's wing.  He finds beauty in unexpected places, and it is when he finds Rosalina shares the same views that their relationship blossoms, and she becomes his favorite subject to photograph.  The scenes of Rosalina's photo being taken are beautifully shot.  The sensuality of the camera is greatly evident and capitalized upon in the film, and you become aware that even today's cold, calculated video cameras still have a spark of that warmth from their early precedessors. The color in the film is vibrant, as when Rosalina wears a bright red coat or when she returns home, her neighborhood stricken with cholera, and shades of blue fill the screen. THE GOVERNESS is a great period piece, but Minnie Driver's wonderful performance should be reason enough to see it
