 "Lawn Dogs" is a beautiful story of companionship and the bond formed between two misfits who don't exactly fit it with where they are expected to.  Revolving around the Russian fairy tale of Baba Yaga (girl trapped by an evil witch who is rescued by her prince only to have to run away to escape Baba Yaga's wrath) much in the way "The Sweet Hereafter" mirrored the story of the Pied Piper of Hamlin, the story follows these two friends/first loves?/confidantes (Mischa Barton and Sam Rockwell) as she follows her own and ignores the ignorance of her parents and he becomes more and more isolated from the town he lives in. Mischa Barton is wonderful as a girl who believes in magic and is able to weave a little of her own.  She is an "old soul" who knows better than to believe what everyone else thinks and knows to go her own way and make her own decisions.  In the end, when she takes matters into her own hands, she has achieved the wisdom and knowledge that most people dream of and never reach.  Sam Rockwell is also great as her companion who first doesn't know what to expect from this young girl who acts as though she should be his mother.  In fact, she is the only one who looks out for him, and as their relationship becomes more and more intimate though never obscene and always beautiful, the tragic occurs, and she must save him from the wrath of "Baba Yaga." The ending is spectacular as Mischa's character displays all her magical talents.  She is the star of this film, and I expect to see much more from her (her small part in "The Sixth Sense" was great) in the future.  In the same vein as Martha Plimpton's "Eye of God" and Nastassja Kinski's "Little Boy Blue," you can expect the tragic from "Lawn Dogs," but it is also beautiful, moving, and transcendant.
