 JIMMY EAT WORLD is a rare accomplishment that stretches across musical genres, the Billboard charts, and audiences of all ages.  The young can appreciate the honest lyrics and the power of each song, and while the old may not be blasting this album in their stereos, they can appreciate the great melodic structures of the songs. The one cohesive bond that ties each song together is the strength and clarity of Jim Adkins's voice.  This is a voice that only comes along once a while.  Songs like "Sweetness" and "The Authority Song" display his raw power while "Hear You Me" and "My Sundown" show the expressiveness of his voice.  When Adkins sings: "You rip my heart right out," in "Your House," it doesn't sound like it's a hard process, but rather, something he is enjoying.  He has a way of making the most unexpected lyrics seem everyday, much like the band ELBOW. Some of the songs are more poppy that others, like the radio champion "The Middle."  Others are darker and less conscientious of the mainstream listener, like the Red Hot Chili Peppers or PJ Harvey at their most melody-conscious and least angsty.  I appreciate Jimmy Eat World's strong sense of melody and thoughtful lyric crafting. The lyrics are triumphs in themselves, like in "Bleed American:" "I bled the greed from my arm / Won't they give it a rest now?" JIMMY EAT WORLD is a great album, one I can listen to all the way through without skipping tracks, and I can't do that very often. Jimmy Eat World has the power to take over the airwaves, and I personally hope they succeed.
