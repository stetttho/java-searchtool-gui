 Esthero's BREATH FROM ANOTHER is essentially a techno album with several other music influences tucked in the seams.  Many of the combinations are entirely appropriate, though not groundbreaking, and effortlessly blended while in a few songs the mixes falter. The first single off of BREATH FROM ANOTHER, "That Girl," is a shimmering, space-age jazz groove.  Esthero's vocal harmonies and the song's trumpet solos compliment each other perfectly amid lyrics like "It's my right to love."  "Breath from Another" features enough hip hop syncopated drumming to make even Timbaland and Missy "Misdemeanor" green with envy, while "Lounge" combines techno, calypso, and tribal beats sounding like Everything But The Girl.  It must have been the hip hop influences that inspired Esthero to join Black Eyed Peas on the song "Weekends" from their album BRIDGING THE GAP.  The most beautiful song is also the simplest: In "Country Livin' (The World I Know)," strings showcase hopeful lyrics such as "This love could be ours / Just look at those stars."  Esthero's voice is her true asset, though.  Its Bjork-esque quality conveys emotion with intensity and clarity. BREATH FROM ANOTHER is a great headphones album, but it has a few get-up-and-dance songs also.  However, a few of its songs fall flat due to poor musical pairings and overmanipulation of Esthero's voice.  "Half a World Away" is one such song that does both of these combining latin and techno beats.  These are only a couple harsh songs like this, making BREATH FROM ANOTHER a good groove album.
