 With ROCK STEADY, No Doubt have successfully melded the playful attitude of TRAGIC KINGDOM with the more seriousness songwriting chops exhibited in RETURN OF SATURN to make a great dancehall album: ROCK STEADY. The first single, "Hey Baby," is a great precursor to the rest of the songs on the album.  If you like the great cameo by Bounty Killer on "Hey Baby," you'll love the reggae-spiced "Underneath It All" which features Lady Saw, the woman who added her own touch to Vitamin C's "Smile" and made the song pleasantly bearable.  Prince also adds background vocals as well as co-writing and co-producing credits to the darker "Waiting Room" in which Gwen sings "If desire is your only food / it can get you sick." No Doubt experiment with more producers as well.  The most successful of which is William Orbit (Madonna) on "Making Out": an amazingly danceable song about the anticipation of a lover's long-awaited visit.  It has a "Do the Hustle" feel much like Smash Mouth's new "Pacific Beach Party."  Nellee Hooper (Bjork) also has luck with "Hella Good," another synthed-up, bassed-up, also very danceable tune and "Detective" which sounds like a continuation of RETURN OF SATURN's "Ex-Girlfriend." No Doubt have definitely hit their stride with ROCK STEADY.  Maybe it's been Gwen's collaborations with Eve and Moby that have helped to enhance No Doubt's overall sound, and with the success of those songs, I'm sure anymore collaborations in the future will be welcome.
