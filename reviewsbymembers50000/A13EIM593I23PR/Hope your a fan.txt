 If you're not associated with the lore and history already present with Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles, do not purchase this book unless you like to be confused or even bored. I feel Anne Rice used BLOOD AND GOLD as her opportunity to further perpetuate and fill in gaps present in her earlier "Chronicle" books.  If you liked THE QUEEN OF THE DAMNED especially or are at least aware of the characters and circumstances involved in that book, BLOOD AND GOLD will be much more enjoyable as the story of Mekare and Maharet, the red-haired twins, is added to and explained more fully.  Also as the book centers around the character of Marius and his life story, it helps to be interested in his character, but it also helps to have read Rice's PANDORA and THE VAMPIRE LESTAT, both which involve Marius's history and are alluded to in BLOOD AND GOLD. Anne Rice may choose not to include new readers into her realm of witches, vampires, and eroticism.  By having written so many previous books, it makes a new reader feel as if they need to do their "homework," but she has created a rich world nonetheless.  If you want to take up the daunting and challenging task, you will better for it, but be sure you're ready for it.
