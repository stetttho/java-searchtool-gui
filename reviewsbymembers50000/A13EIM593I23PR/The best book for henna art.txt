 I read several books about henna when I got started practicing the art,  and the absolute best I've found is Loretta Roome's.   No other books  describes all aspects of the art of mehndi better; the book details the  spiritual side of the art, as well as its meaning, its practice throughout  the ages, today's sublime twists on the art, and how to get started with  your own creative skin art practices.  Roome incorporates all her own  artwork and henna prints into the book which are absolutely beautiful and  are enough cause to buy the book simply on the talent and artistic endeavor  displayed alone. This book also lists several companies to contact for a  henna supply.  Color Trends (now Earthhues) is one I have contacted for my  supply of henna.  They give the best quality of henna powder I've  found. If you've discovered a growing interest for henna since hearing  about it fashion magazines or from seeing Madonna's video for her song  "Frozen," this is the book to begin your research into this  mystic and creative art force.
