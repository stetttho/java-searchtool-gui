 Amel Larrieux, singer from Groove Theory, has truly found her niche with the album "Infinite Possibilities," a album whose name fits every single song. After the revelations of marriage and childbirth, Larrieux  finally has found music to express her heartfelt emotions.  Compared with  Sade, Amel is much more: her voice has much more body and fullness to it  without the sex hype of Sade. The first song, "Get Up", is akin  to Macy Gray's "Do Something" in theme, but in song, is stronger  with more pride and heart.  "INI" tells off beauty magazines,  "they cannot define beautiful to me..," saying exactly what makes  her look beautiful: God.  Other songs run the gamut of emotions:  "Sweet Misery" when you know you can't stop loving the one who  broke your heart, "Down" which is reminiscent of old Billie  Holliday, and then, "Weather" which is the crowning achievement  of the album.  The song doesn't expel storms and cloudy days but welcoming  them, "the dark skies that bind us will send a clear day to remind  us..."  The last song, "Make Me Whole," a true, uncliched  (finally) love song, which Amel dedicated to her husband, is one of the  most beautiful love songs you will ever hear. This album is a must-hear  for anyone looking for soul and a heart in today's music.
