 This is one of my daughters favorite toys.  At 3 months of age she grabs for it when she is in her crib, and it has taught her about sounds.  She seems to know if you squeeze the back it will crinkle and if she kicks at it, it will jingle.  She is always smiling when she plays with this toy.  The durablity has been satisfactory thus far, for as many times she chewed on the tail of this adorable hippo friend.
