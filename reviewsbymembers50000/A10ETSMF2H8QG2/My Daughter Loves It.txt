 My daughter loves this mobile!  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it only plays for about 3 minutes each time you wind it.  I still find it worth it because it puts a smile on her face everytime I put her in her crib.  As long as you are in the room I find it is not such a pain to wind - though most new parents probably would!  I can't wait until she is old enough to use the animals as toys!  AND I have looked at other mobiles (ones requiring batteries) but this one seemed to be the only one for us.
