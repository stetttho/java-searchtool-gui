 We got these bottles for my 2 month old daughter and we noticed after 20 minutes nothing was coming out of them, so we opened the hole in the nipple with a push pin and it started to work.  However, we still found that there were lots of bubbles in the liquid.  Warming the bottles is a bit of a pain because you can not warm with the nipple on, which in one case made a huge mess when my husband dropped the bottle taking it out of the warmer.  I wish I could return them, but I threw out the package.  Some advice, Save ALL the packaging for anything you buy.
