 Even though this is one of the cheaper matresses it is very comfortable (I know because I curled up on it for almost 3 hours before putting it in my daughter's crib).  She seems to like it and it fits very well in our crib (Natural Dreamer Crib N Toddler Bed).  We are very pleased with its quality & price!
