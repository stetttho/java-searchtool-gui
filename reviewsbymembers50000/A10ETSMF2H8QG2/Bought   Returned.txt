 This cover is soft terry cloth, but we bought the safety changing table pad deluxe by Dex Baby Products and you do not need this item (we returned ours).  If your baby ever has an accident while you are changing them, you will end up washing more then you should have to.  We just use the pad which is vinyl & easy to wipe down after changing.
