 We have been using this set since the day we came home from the hospital.  The emery boards are the best thing to use on your baby's nails.  I use the clippers & scissors on my daughters toenails, they are much easier because they do not have to be as short as her fingernails.  She was born with a lot of hair and after taking a bath she loves having her hair brushed.  When she has more hair the comb will be useful.  She does not have teeth yet so the tooth brush has not been used.  We love this product!
