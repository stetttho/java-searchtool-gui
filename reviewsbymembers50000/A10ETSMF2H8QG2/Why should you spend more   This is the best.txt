 I must say this may be one of the cheaper models of the pack-n-play, but it is the best!  I have bought (and returned after trying to set up) Nursery Care Center & Playard LX I, Graco Pack 'n Play with Bassinet - Hobby Horse, Special Edition Bassinet - Animal Kingdom, and Playard Nursery Care Center - Navy Dot (I bought these thinking I needed a bassinet - Nope! You have to completely take them apart to put the darn thing back in the bag.)  Not to say that any of these were terrible, however, the Party pack-n-play only took me a few minutes to set up & take down.  Everything fits in the bag along with extra sheets, and a stuffed animal with room to spare!  My husband & daughter love it too!
