 I got this rocker and it was really nice until my daughter started reaching & grabbing things, the toy bar is too flimsy.  She is a busy body too so the kickstand thing did not really work to well for us.  All in all nice rocker, but not for an infant who is very active.  We now have the fisher-price kick n' play bouncer - great for active infants.
