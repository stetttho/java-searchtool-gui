 This set is my favorite by far.  My husband & I have tried almost every kind of bottle (his favorite is the Evenflo reusable contour bottles).  We have bought & gave away the Avent Reusable Bottles (to go with the Avent Pump) the Playtex VentAire Reusable Bottles, Healthflow Starter Set by Johnson & Johnson, and the Dr. Browns by Handi Craft.  All of these seemed to leave too many bubbles in the milk for our daughter.  The choice of nipples is nice, but the ones your child won't take are sitting in a box somewhere, ours uses the natural-flo clear nipples (which do not come with this set).
