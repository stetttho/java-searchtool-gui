 This is not a bad product, but it is not very useful.  The only thing I have used so far was the thermometer - and it works well.  You receive a medicine dropper with any prescription requiring one.  The nasal aspirator you receive before leaving the hospital is the best, do not lose this - I have not even used the one in this set.  The nail clippers will probably be more useful when my daughter gets older, I tried using them and could not cut the nails short enough so she would not scratch herself. (we use emery boards.)  The medicine spoon may come in handy, but she is still too young to use it (3 months).
