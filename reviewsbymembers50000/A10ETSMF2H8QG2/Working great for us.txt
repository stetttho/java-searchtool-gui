 We purchased these moniters because it comes with 2 receivers.  We are currently taking care of my husbands mother and she is living upstairs, while we are living in our mostly finished basement.  We keep the moniter upstairs so when his mother is playing with our daughter we can tell if she needs any help and can hear if the baby is crying (Our baby sleeps in a corner of our bedroom so we only use them for checking in upstairs).  We keep one receiver in the bedroom downstairs and the other in the computer room downstairs (where my husband always is working).  We both wake pretty easily so the moniters 'white noise' is not a problem for us, we can keep the moniters fairly low & still be able to hear her loud & clear.  We are very happy with these moniters & would definetly recommend them to others.
