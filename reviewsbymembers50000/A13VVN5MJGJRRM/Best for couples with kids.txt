 My husband and I have a great relationship, and we are always looking for encouraging devotionals to build us up, and even convict us in areas we need it.  This one is ok, but highly geared toward couples with kids.  We have only found a few devotionals that focus on the couple with out children, or make the couple the priority of the book.  This one does not fit into that category.  My husband and I thought it would be better titled for "Moments together for couples with children" since so much of the book focus on that are of a couples relationship.
