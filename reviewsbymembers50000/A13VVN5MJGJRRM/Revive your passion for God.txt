 This is a great book, I read this as a very new believer and was taken to a new level of knowing God after reading this book.  I would recomend it highly, and have read mine more than once, and reference it often.  Great gift for that person who desires to seek God. I highly recommend this book.  It is very reader friendly to even the newest believer, but will challenge a even the seasoned Christian.
