 I had to respond after reading the post of another user.  If they  had read any of Max Lucado's books on the Wemmicks (you are special, you are mine and just the way you are) she would know that Max Lucado and the people working for Mr. Lucado do take cultural diversity under consideration. This book is a phenomenal tale of the Love our King is waiting for us to show him.  We do not have to be busy about all kinds of tasks to please him, but just give Him our heart!  Yes perhaps there was not the proper percentage of races represented in this book, but the theme of the story is much more important than the illustrations. Fantastic book, pictures or not.  Read it to your children, and show them how much the King of the universe loves them as well.
