 I received this devotional from a very dear friend as a gift.  I was blown away at the short concise devotions presented in this book.  Do you ever have a book that seems to go along with your life, and what you are seeking the Lord for?  Well this one did for me.  These devotions were encouraging, and challenging all at the same time.    The readings could be a great end or beginning to your day.  They are light enough that you could read them before your bed time, but certainly strong enough for a good hearty portion as part of your morning devotion time.
