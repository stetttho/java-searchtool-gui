 I've read portions of almost all the biographies written on Spurgeon.  This one seems to take the some of the best bits and pieces and combine them into one book.  This book used much of the quotes left by Spurgeon's wife, and this gave it a first person kind of feel. If you really want to dive into Spurgeon's life and see the trials and victories that this man faced, this is a wonderful book.  Enjoy it.
