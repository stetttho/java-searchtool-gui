 My husband and I read a devotional together every night before bed.  We have gone through many "couples" devotionals, and just great devotionals by authors that we adore. This is an ok couples devotional.  It is very geared toward a family with children.  If you do not have children yet, I'd pass on this one.  The discussions are kind of lame, we rarely even read those.  Sometimes it is hard to understand why the Rainey's put certain scriptures with certain topics. I get bummed when so many devotionals are depressing and all about the sadness that is going on in your life.  This one was ok when it came to that, but not terribly encouraging either.
