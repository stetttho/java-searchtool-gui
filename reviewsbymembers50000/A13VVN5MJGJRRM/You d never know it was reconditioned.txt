 I bought a reconditioned KitchenAid last year, and it runs like a champ.  I've used every feature, and run this thing hard for a good year, with absolutely NO complaints! Looking at this appliance, you truly would never know that it was reconditioned at the factory.  It is beautiful.  I'm so pleased with my purchase.  You should get one too :).
