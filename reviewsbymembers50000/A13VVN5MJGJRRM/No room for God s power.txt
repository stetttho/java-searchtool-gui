 I read this book at a very low point in my fertility journey.  After finishing this book, I felt like the the author left no room for God's power to work through any fertility situation. I understand that she never conceived, and decided to adopt, but not all of us are there.  I still feel that God can bring me a baby, even if I get to be as old as Sarah!  I guess I didn't feel the same from this author.
