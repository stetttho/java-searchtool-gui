 When my first piggie came to live with me I got one book, Peter Gurney's.  However soon after I really wanted to learn as much as I could, so I bought many others, this was one.  It is ok, it has really good basic information, but it is not complete.  You should really look into other books as well, like The Proper Care of Guinea Pigs, by Peter Gurney. Hope that this helps.
