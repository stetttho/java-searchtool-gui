 This is a phenominal book for worship leaders, or anyone who wants a closer worship relationship with God.  There are so many areas that touched my heart and drew me closer to our Lord.  I enjoy reading, but sometimes I will take a break from a book, and never pick it back up again.  This was not one of those cases.  I finished it in one setting.  It is a short book, and would be appropriate for teens all the way up to the most seasoned Christian. I hope you enjoy it.
