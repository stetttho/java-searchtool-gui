 I think this disk holds one the greatest Christian songs to get played on secular radio, and for that I commend MercyMe, and this album. However I have become a touch tired of the repitition, but I absolutely love some of the lesser played songs on this disk, for this I would recommend buying it, and give it 4 stars!
