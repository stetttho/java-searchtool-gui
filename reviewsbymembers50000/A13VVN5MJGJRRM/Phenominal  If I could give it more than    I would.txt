 99.9 times out of 100 you cannot go wrong with Spurgeon.  This is one of those wonderful cases.  A wonderful gift to that Christian that desires to seek God daily in a devotional.  Or just a great book for you to get into His presence with. I bought it at a conference, and enjoyed it tremendously.  I let a friend borrow it, and he thought it was a gift.  He called me to thank me, and told me how much it blessed him.  How could I tell him I wanted it back!  I bought another copy for myself, and have enjoyed it again ever since.
