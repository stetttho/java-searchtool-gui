 It seemed like everything in the book was just as over the top as he is.  Instead of showing you a really tastefull way of going about decorating something, everything was just bigger, and more colorful, and fluffier.  I think that is kind of his style, and I guess I'm just not a fan of it. I think if you really enjoy him, you will like this book.  I guess I don't enjoy him or this book.
