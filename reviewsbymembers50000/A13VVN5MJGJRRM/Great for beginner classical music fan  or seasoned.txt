 I've had this CD set for about 10 years, and I have always found it to be one of my favorites.  I like the mix of pieces, and would recommend it to anyone, classical lover, or not. I agree that there are some pieces that could be added to fill out the loving theme, but I think that the compilers did a great job, leaving little else to desire. Buy it, you will enjoy it.
