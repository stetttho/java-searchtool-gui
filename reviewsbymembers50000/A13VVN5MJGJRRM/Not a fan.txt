 I bought this video, and did the work out for a few months.  I don't really like the way that the sets are layed out.  There are several sets, with a cool down after each.  One set is too short, and if you want to do two you have to fast forward through the cool down and the warm up to get going again. My biggest problem with this video is the crazed Aussie instructor.  I can put up with almost any aerobics instructor, but she really really grated on me.  I have done all kinds of videos, and liked this one probably the least, because mostly of her. One funny side note.  There is a big out of place guy in the back that never keeps up, and is usually dancing to his own beat.  That was the hilight of the video for me.
