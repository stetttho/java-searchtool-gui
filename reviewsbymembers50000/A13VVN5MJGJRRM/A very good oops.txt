 I was looking for a new exercise video, I have done them all pretty much.  I loved Cindy's first one, and saw this one.  I bought this one, not realizing it was for after having a baby.  The first segments are great for those days you don't have time or energy for a long work out.  And the C segment still kicks my rear end.  I'm in pretty good shape, I work out several times a week, and I still love this one.   One thing to keep in mind is that she is very monitone.  She always has been, even when she had the house of style show, a long long long time ago (am I showing my age??).  If you are one of those people that need perky, uplifting, shout at you exercise gurus you will not find it here. PRAISE THE LORD! I hope that you enjoy this video too!
