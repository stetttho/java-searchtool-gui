 I own the first book, and have used a zillion times, great ideas and really no complaints.  This second addition is very similar, some of the recipes are almost carbon copies of the ones from the first book.  I guess I had higher hopes of this second addition because the first had been so great.  I'm a little disappointed, but still have found some new ideas useful.  If you love the first, I'd suggest getting the second out of the library before purchasing, to see if it would be worth it for you.
