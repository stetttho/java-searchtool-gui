 I ordered this egg keeper, and love it!  However a few days after the order I received a notice stating it would be delayed.  Ok I can understand back orders, I accepted the back order, instead of trying to find it somewhere else.  Eventually I did receive my product in fine condition, (It's a rubbermaid continer, pretty hard to damage).  I also received a coupon in the box stating that I could get $5.00 off my next purchase.  The coupon was valid "now through July 31 2005.  Unfortunately I received my order in the middle of August.  I called and left a message asking if I could get another coupon, no one returned my call.  I called again and left a message no one returned my call.  I called a third time and they told me that they did not reprint the coupons after they expired I could use the expired one.  I tried and the website did not accept it.  A little frustrated by the run around, I opted not to call back a fourth time to ask why the expired coupon was not accepted.  If you can find this container some where else it's great, go for it!
