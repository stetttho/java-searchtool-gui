 My husband and I love this book, we have read it together several times, and always give it as a wedding gift to every wedding we attend. It may not be as in depth as some marriage devotionals, but it is an encouragement, and makes you appreciate your spouse a little more each time you read it. My husband and I have a wonderful relationship, and sometimes it is very hard to read devotionals that are always talking about sadness, dispare, and dread.  This is a pick me up compared to so many others. It is also a great devotional for couples with out children.  We do not have any children, and some devotionals every other page discusses how children effect your relationship.  This one does not focus there quite as much.  It is more directed toward you and your spouse.
