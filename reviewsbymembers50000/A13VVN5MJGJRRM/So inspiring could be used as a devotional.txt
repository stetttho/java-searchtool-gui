 I read this book with a box of Kleenex! I think a better way to have read it is daily, like a devotional.  The chapters are short, 6 pages tops, and they take one scripture as the theme.  Corrie would go into how that scripture was driven home to her, through certain circumstances. The only suggestion I would give is to first read The Hiding Place, you will have a better understand of what this woman went through, and how she was used by God.  This book goes into life after the concentration camps, so it is good to have a knowledge of what her life was like before.
