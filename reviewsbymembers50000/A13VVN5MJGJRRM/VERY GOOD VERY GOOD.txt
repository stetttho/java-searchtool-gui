 Anyone who has seen this video more than twice knows why I entitled the review as such. Susan L Hitzmann is great, and uses this phrase a few times in the video, but I think that she and this video are VERY GOOD VERY GOOD!!!! If you want a heart pumping, sweat pouring video, and don't always like to dance around all over, than this is the video for you.  Push ups, crunches, slides, kicks and leg pulls.  This is my kind of video.
