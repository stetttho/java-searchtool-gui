 This is one of the most ministering books I have ever read.  I see that the other reviewers felt the same way.  Buy this book as a gift, an encouragement, a house warming present, a thank you for dinner present, a Just because present, JUST BUY THIS BOOK, and some for others. It reads like a story, and my friend reads it to her children. A wonderful book, (if I didn't mention that before)
