 Starting with the pros.  I love Crunch videos, the teachers are usually great, and entertaining.  They are encouraging with out being wierd.  I feel the same about this video, Gloria Quinlan was very engaging.  However I am no latina dancing mama, and you need to be to keep up with her. All the women on the tape were amazing, they were bustin' moves this little white girl shreeks at the idea of.  If you are a dancer, than I'm sure you will enjoy this tape.  If you are not, you will enjoy watching them run circles around you! I am in shape and enjoy working out, but this one was not for me.
