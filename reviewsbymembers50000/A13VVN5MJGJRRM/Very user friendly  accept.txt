 I'm a musician, and I'm trying to learn guitar as well.  This is great, it really goes through the basics, and has been very helpful. However, it doesn't teach you accuratly how to tune.  I can't stand doing all these exercises out of tune.  It drives me crazy, and makes me want to put the guitar back in the case, untill someone can tune it for me. I don't want to invest in a tuner, untill I know I want to keep learing how to play, and I don't want to play while I'm so out of tune!  What a vicious circle :).
