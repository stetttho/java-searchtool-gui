 All the reviews on this are right, this is a great cd, one that every Christian should have in his/her collection. Mac Powell's voice is raspy, in a great kind of way :).  If you don't go for heavier praise, than shy away from this, but those who like a rock band feel to their worship BUY BUY BUY :)
