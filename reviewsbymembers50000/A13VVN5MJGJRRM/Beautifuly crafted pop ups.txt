 I bought this book for my nephew, and I almost kept it for myself. The illustrations are very clear, and well thought out.  The pop up dynamics are just precious.  This should not be a book that would get rough-housed around.  Some of the pop ups are quite delicate. My nephew is 4 and enjoyed it immensely.
