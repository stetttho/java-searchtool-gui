 I'm a fanatical fan of Janette Oke's books.  I've read almost all of her books, and immensly enjoyed nearly all of them.  Usually I pick one up and am done with it by the next day, this one took me a while.  I just couldn't get into it.  It just didn't have the same quality as many of her other books.  Usually I'm sobbing by the last 3/4 of the book, but on this one I felt like the task of getting it done was more important than the ending. If you are as big of a fan as me, still read the book.  I just is not the best one to start on.
