 I got this membership for my father, he is a huge billiards enthusiast.  Over 3/4 of the mag. is ads, which for him wasn't a bad thing.  The only problem, all the companies that advertised in the magazine were only selling to re-sellers.  He would get on their web sites, and you had to have a pool hall to order from them. I was dissapointed, I really wanted to bless him with a fun read, but all I did was make him want things, he wasn't able to buy.
