 I'm a sunday school teacher, and like really different crafts to keep the kids attention, we don't do a whole lot of coloring in my class :).  I found this book, and thought there might be an idea, or a recipe I could use in it.  This book has ended up being one of my most used resources for crafts in my class.  The instructions are clear, the pictures are even cute, and all the materials you have in your pantry, pretty much.  The kids love the gooey or creative crafts, and I love the ease of directions!  I've used probably 3/4 of the projects with maybe one flop which was probably my fault anyway :).  Use this book to play with your kids, they will love it!
