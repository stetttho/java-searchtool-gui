 I have to say that I enjoyed this movie, so did my husband.  However I would not show it to it's target audience.  There were some things that I would not let children see. Several areas of language, either used in joking, and covered up by a rhyming word, or "donkey" jokes. One scene that made me gasp, when I thought about the kids seeing it was when the prince looked under the covers while pondering his princess!  I couldn't believe that that was in a movie, where the majority of the audience is under 13! Enough said, but I would caution parents preview this before allowing your children to see it.
