 Our church did a bible study based on this book.  I do love the way this book is layed out.  Each chapter is a different women of the bible, and is assigned to a different author.  The authors are Pastor's wives from Calvary Chapel's.I do love getting a different writing style, and theme to each chapter, it makes the read more interesting and go much faster.  I can't give a reason for giving it only 4 stars.  It was very good, and I enjoyed it very much, but I just didn't love it.    I would suggest reading it though.  It is insightful, and helps you get a little back ground on the life of a pastor's wives as well as the women of the bible chosen for each chapter.
