 I love this book about the prez, and all the crazy, foolish things he sez,  Like when he sez "How do I know there's a connection betwixt Al Quida and Iraq? .., because there IS a connection between Al Quida and Iraq" It makes you want to bang your head against a rock,  OK that thing about the rock was a little lame, I admit, I am a novice at this rhyming game, But these lyrical jabs at our Simpleton-in-Chief, Are guaranteed to provide comic relief,  In these times of cable tv windbags and blowhards, Calvin is surely something good that rhymes with blowhards.
