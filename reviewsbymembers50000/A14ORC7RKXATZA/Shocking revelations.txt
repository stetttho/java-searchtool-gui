 Ruddy does a great job reporting the facts surrounding the Clinton/Gore years, including the Clinton sanctioned murders of Ron Brown, Vince Foster and Nicole Simpson. One of the most interesting parts of the book is where Ruddy describes how Clinton managed to leave the Simpson estate, after helping OJ clean up all the blood in his house and in the Bronco, and make his way to the LA airport and take a commercial flight back to Washington DC, and got back into the White House without anybody noticing.   It's a remarkable story and says a lot about the unimaginable powers that a President wields, and how someone as evil as Clinton can abuse those powers and turn the Presidency into a nightmare for the nation. Ruddy's account of Gore's sinister dealings with the Chinese is also a heart-stopper. Who would have thought that a US Vice President would personally sit in one of the notorious Shanghai torture chambers and administer the most violent and horrific torture sessions on student protestors who were speaking out about the administration's corrupt practices in the region? Most surprising of all was the story of Hillary killing all those little kids.   And although the only proven allegation is that Clinton recieved oral sex and did something with a cigar, one never tires of hearing all the other entertaining things that crazy old Clinton may have done.
