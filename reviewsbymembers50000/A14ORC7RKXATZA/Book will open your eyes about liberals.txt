 Malkin critiques the American liberal establishment from her unique immigrant perspective, and concludes that they are a bunch of crazy loons out to destroy her adopted America which she loves so much. Malkin is sincere in her belief that liberals are now in control of the White House, Congress, Senate, Supreme Court and the mainstream media. Although I am pretty sure that this is not currently the case, I nonetheless love the book and enjoy her depiction of liberals as a bunch of crazy loons who rule the world without any morals. Malkin makes a passionate plea to the great conservatives like George Bush and Dick Cheney to run for the White House, so that we can reclaim this coutry from the amoral liberals who are destroying everything. Although I am fairly certain that Bush and Cheney are already in the White House and are running the country, I still love Michelle Malkin's books about the loony liberals. Can't wait for her next book. I wonder what it will be about. With a great writer like Malkin, there is no telling.
