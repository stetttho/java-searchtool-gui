 Barnes brilliantly chronicles the corrupt yet highly successful methods used by the conservatives in 2000 to steal the election. Barnes, being the well-informed and objective political pundit that he is, goes into excruciating detail in covering the unscrupulous yet necessary tactics carried out by Cheney, Karen Hughes, Karl Rove, and Bush and their brave colleagues to steal the election, and in so doing, saved America from the amoral liberals. Barnes's coverage of the efforts of Jeb Bush and certain members of the Supreme Court to get Bush Jr into the White House are simultaneously chilling and comforting.   Although these events have been widely reported and the world is well aware of the highly dubious yet heroic method by which Bush came to reside in the White House, Barnes provides an effective strategy for the Republicans to steal the election again, although I'm sure Rove and the rest of the campaign managers will do just fine without Barnes's valuable insight. But I still recommend that Republican election officials and polling workers everywhere read this book so they can do it again in 2008. The future of our country is in your hands, and you must do everything in your power to ensure that the deceptive and dangerous liberals are never allowed to win again. Election officials and polling workers, you must make it happen again. Our very lives depend on it. If we do not let the Republicans steal the election again, then the terrorists have won.
