 I've been fascinated with Indian movies ever since I saw whatshername on David Letterman promoting that Indian movie. The spontaneous song and dance sequences are irresistable. I cannot get enough of them. Indeed, Indian movies are today's Holy Grail,as the title suggests.  So I bought the book as soon as I saw the title, and I'm looking forward to reading it and getting a behind-the scenes story of how these wonderful Bollywood movies are made.
