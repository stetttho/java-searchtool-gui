 CNN has been covering the revelation that this autobiography is mostly made-up for about 20 hours today, and I think it's safe to say that CNN will continue to cover this story for about another 3 or 4 days. So it looks like Frey's going to make out even better now than he did when Oprah first endorsed the book. You can see the book going up in the Amazon best-sellers list by the hour. I think all the coverage is going to be great for Oprah's show too. She "confronted" Frey today on her show. Yes, she was embarassed and humiliated and yadda yadda yadda. But her ratings were sky high. And Anderson Cooper of CNN can't seem to get enough of this story. Obviously, CNN is going to make out pretty good with the story too.  So what is the lesson to be learned here? No really, I'd like to know.
