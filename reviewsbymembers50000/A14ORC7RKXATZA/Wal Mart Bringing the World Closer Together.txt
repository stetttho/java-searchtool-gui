 Sam Walton chronicles the meteoric success of the retail behemoth and provides a detailed look at the unique business philosophy which made him and his namesakes among the richest people in the world.   Walton recounts how he concieved and implemented all the things we love about Wal_Mart/SAMS - the beaming elderly people who stand by the shopping carts and "welcome" you, the ubiquitous blue vests that adorn the multitudes of happy employees, the inspiring and cutting edge blue/red color scheme, the groundbreaking RFID initiative which will enable them to sell us plastic flora and Great Value hot links even cheaper, the $5 flannel shirts made in Chile, the $29 DVD player made by those energetic little toddlers in the sweatshops of China, the 25 gallon can of fruit cocktail, the humongous parking lot, and generally the company's magical ability to completely strip your town of everything that once made it special, and of course, the fact that the founder always drove a pick-up truck (that one always brings a tear to my eye). As he foretells, these glorious things will soon be available to every man, woman and child in every country on every planet in the universe. As he predicts, soon will come the day when the entire human race is wearing that glorious blue vest and congregating at the McDonald's or Auntie Mae's up front during our 2 minute break periods.   From the desperate illegal workers who are forced to work long hours and not allowed to leave, to the beautiful little children of South America and Asia who toil to provide Americans with their $1 photo frames and $5 musical keyboards, to the customers who walk the aisles waiting for their $19.99 oil change to be finished, Wal Mart is bringing the world closer together.
