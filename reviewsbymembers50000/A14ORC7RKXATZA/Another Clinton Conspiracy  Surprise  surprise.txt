 It has been known among us internet users for a long time that Hillary has been on a crusade to stamp us all out. Poe chronicles numerous episodes of Hillary's wrath against internet users. Poe's accounts ring true especially for me. For you see, there was the time that I posted a message on a forum about Clinton's cigar, and 2 days later, Hillary and about 40 of her sword-weilding thugs showed up at my house in the middle of the night. They sliced up all my computer cables and smashed my monitor in slow-motion, and then shot my computer to bits, all to the sound of Aerosmith's Walk This Way. It was a bloodbath.   Poe writes about other brave souls who also posted anti-Clinton jokes on the internet and went into Republican chatrooms and typed truthful messages about what slimebags the Clintons were. And every one of them has a horrific story of retribution by Hillary and her secret torture unit. One heroic Republican web-surfer tells of the time Hillary came to his workplace with her group of killers and broke his keyboard over his head in slow-motion, then strutted outside, again in slow-motion with Ozzy's Crazy Train playing in the background, and set the whole place on fire with Molotov cocktails.   Read the book, and know the truth. And as for Hillary, she must know that we will not be cowed, or kowed or khoughed or whatever. We will continue to post our thoughts on the Former Cigar-Insertor in Chief as long as we can pay our America On-Line monthly fee.
