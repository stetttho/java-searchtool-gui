 I agree 100% with Hannity - liberalism is at the root of all that is wrong with the world today. Liberal thinkers are destroying the fabric of the non-liberal way of life which we love and cherish so much. If we are to continue to enjoy the liberty of our non-liberal way of life, then, as Hannity has proposed, we must put an end to all liberal thought and promote only the non-liberal ideals which have made this nation the great beacon of non-liberal values which we were meant to be. Down with all liberal thought!! Let us all adopt the values of the non-liberal thinking cable tv commentators and restore the liberty of non-liberal thinking to this great land of liberty - that is liberty of non-liberal thought. We will win the war of liberty (I mean the liberty of non-liberal thought) over liberalism only when we have penetrated the minds of the masses with the non-liberal ideology of our founding fathers, who made it their goal to create this great land of liberty (from liberal thought).
