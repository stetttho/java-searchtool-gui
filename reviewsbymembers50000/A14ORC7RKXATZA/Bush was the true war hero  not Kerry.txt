 O'Niell does a fantastic job shredding Kerry's war record and portraying him as a coward and a traitor. O'Neill recounts how Kerry was too much of a chicken to participate in the requisite atrocities and village burnings that were the hallmarks of military service for the true patriotic soldiers of the war like O'Neill and his courageous and truthful swiwftboat veterans. These brave men are to be commended for telling the truth about Kerry and his shameful military record and ensuring that this weak-kneed, terrorist coddling, war-protesting, non-baby killing, non-village-burning weasel did not get elected president. Thank you Mr O'Neill for your tremendous efforts in making sure that the true American war heros and courageous patriots ended up in the White House.
