 This is one of the best pots to hit the market in recent memory. It is slightly reminiscent of the T-Fal 4U 2.8-Quart Covered Sauce Pan, but with more sensuous curves and a more rugged demeanor. I have found that the Calpholon out-performs the T-Fal on all counts when it comes to heating noodles and malt-o-meal.   The Calpholon also exhibits extaordinary aerodynamic performance. During heated arguments, the wife is able to  easily grasp the sleek handle, slide it off the hot stovetop and fling it across the kitchen toward my head in one smooth motion. The percussive timbre that is produced when the pan strikes the side of my head, or when my son bangs our Anolon 6-Piece Utensil Set on the lid are among the most glorious sounds imaginable.   The care and craftsmanship that are apparent in the adonized coating brings to mind the work of the ancient Afghani  gemstone carvers who produced the legendary Lapis Lazuli stones. Although the price here is a bargain, I would recommend checking the Sunday inserts for a deal on these.
