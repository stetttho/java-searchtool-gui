 Pete Hamill is a New Yorker and he explains what it was like to grow up in the 50's.  Some of his insights are brillant.  For example his discussion of how television changed community life was wonderful.  He also points out how a young person could move around the City was nostalgic.    When we get to Pete's growing up we get a wonderful story about growing in an Irish family.  I think his insights about that deal with the fear of success and leaving the neighborhood is fascinating.  The sociology of the Irish upbringing is interesting.    My major criticism is that Pete seemed to loss interest in the book when he reaches his 20's.  We do not get an insight on why he stopped drinking.
