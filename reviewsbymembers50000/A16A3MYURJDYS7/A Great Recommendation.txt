 A dear friend finding out that I loved mysteries gave me this book to read.  As I read it I wondered why I was enjoying it so much.  I love mysteries especially when there is an intriguing hero.  Inspector Banks is a normal individual.  He works hard and is devoted to his job.  There is not much mystery in this book but I could not put it down.     In short it was a wonderful read.
