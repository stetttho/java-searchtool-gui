 Double Homicide really consists of two short stories.  The book construction is clever but neither story reaches the level that we are used to.  I have read more of Jonathon than Faye so I can not tell if it is her influence that predominates.   STill Life which is set in Santa Fe was more interesting.  Steven Katz is an interesting character.  The story unwinds in the normal Jonathon matter but it lacks the character development that I enjoy in his books.   The ending is interesting.  Unfortunately the story is too short to really care about any of the characters. The other In the Land of the Giants is an old story.  Although Dorothy is interesting again we did not have the time to watch her really develop.   I imagine the Kellerman's had some fun writing this and it was pleasant entertaining.  Really the effort proves that two is not always better than one.
