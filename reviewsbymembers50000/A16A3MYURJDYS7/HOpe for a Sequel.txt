 It is always interesting and instructive to read the on line reviews.  Like so many thrillers this one brings strong emotions on each side-- some were enthralled and others bored.  I am a big DeMille fan and enjoyed Up Country and the previous Corey books.  As in those, the writing is fun.  The difficulty with this book is that it seems that the story was a way used to put forth a theory.  The last third of the book was actually silly and the ending was unacceptable. The conspiracy theory is always dangerous but especially as in this case when there does not seem to be any motive for the conspiracy.  Maybe there will be a sequel when a reason for the alleged conspiracy can be explained.
