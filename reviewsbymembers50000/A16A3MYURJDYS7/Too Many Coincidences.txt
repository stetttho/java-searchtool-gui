 In her first book a Darker Shade of Crimson there was some sense in the story because Nikki Chase was operating in her home environment.  This book deals with a murder at Yale of a righr wing law professor.  It is hard to understand why Nikki even was around.  It also missed the interesting characters from the earlier effort.  Nikki's boyfriend Dante is really hard to understand. He appears for no reason   All in all a book that is very hard to believe and is disappointing.
