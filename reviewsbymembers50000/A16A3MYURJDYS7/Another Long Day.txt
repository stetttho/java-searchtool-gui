 AS in the DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons the action takes place in one long day. The good news about this is there really is little time to develop characters.  The books are a wild ride in every available method of transportation. It is natural to compare this effort to the two mentioned above.  It is a weak third.  The style is the same, a long day with the unknown person until the end driving the action.   The problem with this book is the escapes were even more hard to believe, the scenarion was less believable, the escapes were outlandish  and the ending was more contrived. Having said all of that I must admit it was fun to read.
