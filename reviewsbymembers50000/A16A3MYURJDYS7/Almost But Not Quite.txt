 Cal Dexter started as a fascinating character.  He is a Vietnam hero, a lawyer but his major occupation is as an avenger of wrongs.  Other reviewers describe the story.   My comments are that he seemed just a bit too hard to believe.  Also the 9/11 angle just was too far fetched.   In summary the book was fun to read but thinking about it afterward it did not hang together.
