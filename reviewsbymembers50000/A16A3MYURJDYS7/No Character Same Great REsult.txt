 Michael Connelly is the best mystery writer writing now.  It takes courage to introduce a new main character after the success of Harry Bosch.  It is even more difficult when the personality and the venue of the main character changes.  Mr Connelly does this with great success.   Mickey Haller the Lincoln lawyer is a wonderful character. We know he is a minor scoundrel but he is lovable.  His exwifes both remain in love with him.  He makes the book wonderful  I will not get into the story other than to say it moves quickly.  It is less a mystery than a character study and I loved it.
