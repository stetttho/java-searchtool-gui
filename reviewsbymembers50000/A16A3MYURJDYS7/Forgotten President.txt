 This is a wonderful book.  It is a compelling story of James Garfield who was an accidental president.  Garfield was only in office in 6 months and most of that was spent battling to have offices filled.   The background of life in the White House.  The lack of security and the open atmosphere of the White House is so interesting when compared with what we know have.   Also the story of the Nominating Convention is compelling.  The studies of Chester Arthur, Blaine and Senator Conklin are wonderful.  Meeting these individuals is a bonus in this story.   This is a wonderful book.
