 This is the first Robert Crais novel I have read.  I will now read more after enjoying this so much and reading the reviews on Amazon. I was especially taken by one individuals review which discussed what makes an unusual thriller or mystery--select your word.  Many writers can drive a story.  It is the unusual one that drives a story and creates characters who you care about. Max HOlman is one of those characters. We understand that he has a special quality that fits with the story.  He is believable.  I have given the book only 4 stars because I had a harder time believing Katherine Pollard.  In summary this is a great read.  It is in the class of Micheal Connelly who is the gold standard in my view
