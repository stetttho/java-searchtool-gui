 This is a remarkable book.  Other reviews have repeated the story so it is not worth going into the details.  The mystery portion of this historical thriller, is well paced and continues to unravel.   The wonderful part of the book is the character development.  I especially enjoyed HOlmes, Longfellow and Lowell.  We began to understand them as the extraordinary people they were as they dealt with the crisis of the murders in Boston. Also I particularly enjoyed the relationship between Oliver Wendell Holmes and his son.  At times coincidence was stretched somewhat, but that is normal for a good mystery.  Even the minor characters were fascinating. Lastly the historical color added to overall impression.  There were touching scenes of post Civil War Boston. All in all a wonderful effort. I can not wait for Mr. Pearl's next effort.
