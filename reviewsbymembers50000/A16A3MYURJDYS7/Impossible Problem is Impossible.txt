 Several thrillers follow the same path.  The villain is not really a bad guy.  In this book, our villain/hero Fade has done some bad things.  He is a sympathetic character but he does kill people which is not socially acceptable even if there is good reason.  As a result we watch his work with his old friend Matt Egan and his strange relationship with Karen Manning with interest.  How can it end.  We hope for a happy ending.  Fade is a good guy even if he has tried to kill an evil government functionary.  As I write this I am raising my grade to 4 stars because even if there can not be hoped for ending it is a fun read.  It is my first Kyle Mills and I will read some more.
