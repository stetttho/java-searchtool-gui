 Follett has written a number of wonderful books including Jackdaws.  Hornet Flight like Jackdaws deals with penetration into occupied Europe, but unlike his past efforts the characters were not believable.  Harald the hero and his girl friend Kathy are totally dependent on unreal coincidences to move the plot along.  There were opportunities of character development especially with Kathy's and Harald's parents but instead they were made comic book, as a prior reviewer said, figures.   In short I would rather invest my time in reading some wonderful prior Follett's than this effort.
