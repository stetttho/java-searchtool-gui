 I relied upon the reviews posted after I started the book.  By the way the reviews on Amazon written by readers are better in my view than most one reads by professionals.  I agree that the book is a great page turner in the beginning because the premise is terrific.  The problem is that there is not a satisfying or believable resolution.  The other disappointment is that Baldacci at his best develops memorable characters such as in Absolute Control or the Winner.  In this book none of the characters grew or surprised.   If you have not read Baldacci before do not start with this one.  If you have read his others prepare for having fun but the book will not measure up.
