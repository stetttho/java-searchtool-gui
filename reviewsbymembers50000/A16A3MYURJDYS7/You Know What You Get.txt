 My wife and I went to our favorite resort for a long weekend.  I had been working hard and needed some easy entertaining.  In the resorts library was a copy of the Big Bad Wolf.  I had sort of given up on Alex Cross but I thought why not look at it.  Over the next few days I spent several hours flying through this book.    The short chapters and quick action that brings with it some good characters such as Nana is good company while on vacation.  Nothing is believable and nothing taxes the mind. It is pure entertainment.  It does what it does well.  My only real objections is that even at this level the story is not up to earlier Cross stories.  Second after reading over 300 pages I think we should get resolution.  As it is I now have to wait for my next vacation to see what happens next.
