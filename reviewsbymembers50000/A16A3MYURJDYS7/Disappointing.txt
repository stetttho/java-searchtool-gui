 I loved Butcher's Boy and immediately picked up Death Benefit expecting or wishing for a reprise.  The beginning of it was equal. Walker the inexperienced analyst and Stillman the experienced detective work together and find the body of Ellen Snyder.  As in other Perry book's the characters are interesting.   The second section of the book is almost painful to read.  The never ending stay in the small town in New Hampshire was uninteresting.  I also have trouble figuring out what really happened.  If someone want to explain this to me please send me an E Mail.   Others have enjoyed these books so I will not give away too much.  All I can say is that I have read three Perry books now and 2 our of 3 were good so I will give it a  try.
