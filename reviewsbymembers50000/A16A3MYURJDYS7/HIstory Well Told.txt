 1876 election was corrupt and ended an era and prepared for the beginning of another.  It clearly marked the end of Reconstruction and influenced the subsequent 90 years.  Essentially, in the election of Hayes who is portrayed as a decent individual and Republican party giving up its commitment to Black rights we see the end of the battle for equality.   The story is told well by Mr. Morris.  It is impossible to read this without drawing comparisons to 2000.  Some of the reviewers have argued that there were differences but some of the similarities are striking.  Tilden like Gore made fundamental errors immediately after the votes were cast. IN each case there was faith in a legal strategy that did not work while their opponents out manuevered them on the ground.  Also Florida was the place where the work was decided.   I suggest that anyone reading this book also read 1876 by Gore Vidal to understand how different society was at that time.
