 The mark of a powerful mystery are characters that are remembered.  Mr. Arvin has done this again in this wonderful book.  The story has been summarized in other reviews.  The characters who stand out are the hero Thomas Dennehy, Carl the retiring prosecutor, Fiona the sexy preacher and Mr Bridges, the harrowing killer.  The moods captured by the Sudanese group was wonderful.  I thought the story slipped slightly at the end but the characters made it a wonderful read that I was sorry to see end.
