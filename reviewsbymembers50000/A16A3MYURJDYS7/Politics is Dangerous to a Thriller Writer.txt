 David Baldacci is a wonderful story teller and he continues to use that ability in this book.  However, in this book he has a message which is that America has to be more understanding of the Muslem world and that world peace requires mutual respect.  Unfortunately he does not have the depth or ability to make this argument and he lets his political views get in the way of a good story with some of his wonderful characters.  There are too many speeches and too many unbelievable coincidences.  Baldacci has had the ability to paint wonderful characters.  In this book Lucky and the background of the members of the Camel Club are interesting.    As one reviewer said a weak Baldacci is still worth while but not nearly as satisfying as the real thing.
