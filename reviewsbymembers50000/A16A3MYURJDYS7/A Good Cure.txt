 I read most of this book while I was up most of the night with the a bit of a flu.  If you want to help get through a long night it was a good companion.  I will not review the plot as many others have done so.  I measure a mystery by the characters that one meets, the excitement the plot generates and the ending.  This effort gets 2 out of 3.   There are wonderful characters such as Blu the beautiful secretary and Sammy Liston( a wonderful name) who move the story along.  Also the portrait of Pope and his role in the housing development was terrific. Arvin also makes an effort to have some serious thoughts.  There are several pages of wonderful writing in this effort. The two criticisms were a little too much foreshadowing and the ending just was not up to the rest of the story.  I would go on about that but would not want to ruin the book for others.  My only comment it reminded me of one of my favorite movies but not done as well.
