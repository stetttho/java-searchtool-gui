 I admit that I am a fan of serial killer thrillers.  The interesting part of these books is that the stories are all basically the same.  Brillant psychotic killer who needs to play with the protaganists are featured.  Murders are creative and send a message. Close calls abound and most times the killer is discovered just as he is about to commit yet another heinous murder.   Yet with similarities some books work and others do not.  The difference is that the characters are interesting. Sean and Michelle, the detectives, who we met in Split Second mix well. They also are very clever. We watch their friendship grow.  The killer who narrates several chapters is fascinating and even though he kills he has a soft side, which may have been part of his undoing. I stayed up too late reading this.  There are criticisms that parts of the story are not believable.  All I can say is that it is only a story.  That is so but is a really good one that should not be missed.
