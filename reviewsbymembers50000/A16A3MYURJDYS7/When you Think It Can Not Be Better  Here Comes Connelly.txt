 In my last review of HOurs Game I said that it was as good a serial killer story as one can write.  I spent the second part of my vacation reading The Narrows and I must admit I was wrong.  The Narrows is better on all accounts.  Harry Bosch continues to be a compelling hero.  He unwinds the mystery but a brillant intuitive mind matched with hard work.   Connelly is comfortable bringing in past history, even the movie version of his past book.  Giving the characters life, especially Terry McCabe adds reality, which makes the book even more chilling.  The characters are terrific, there is not a missed beat. Harry is human.  I felt for his love for his daughter and his indecision about returning to the force.  This was all in retrospect As I was reading all I could do is turn the pages as the book was so exciting.  Michael is the best there is.  We can only celebrate that Harry is going back to the police force and we will see more of him.
