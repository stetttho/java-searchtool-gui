 The Last Juror seems to show Grisham's change as an author.  In his early works he wrote suspense stories.  In The Last Juror the suspense which is secondary to the development of wonderful characters.  Miss Callie is a wonderful woman who shows how a powerful force for good can make her whole family better.  It is worth reading this book just to meet her.   The rest of the small town characters such as Harry Rex and Baggy as well as Will himself and his grandmother are wonderfully drawn.    Some reviewers have commented that the book lacked suspense.  It seems that Grisham is moving in his work.  Rather than a fast moving book such as Angels and Demons with little character development, Grisham is now writing slower moving books with wonderful characters.  The Testament and the King of Torts are examples.   I think that the new Grisham is every bit as enjoyable as the early Grisham but just a little different.
