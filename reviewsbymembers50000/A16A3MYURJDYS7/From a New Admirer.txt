 This is my first experience in reading a Rebus story.  I can not wait to read more of the series although I think I will have to wait a bit because Rankin writes a dark book.  A few weeks in between will be necessary.   I will not repeat the plot which others have summarized.  I would say that there are many questions about Rankin and I wlll read the rest of the series in order so I can see Rebus' development. I am very interested in watching the development of the relationship between Siobhan Clarke and Rebus.  One of the interesting parts of the book there is little description of Siobhan.   The plot has many turns but the strength is not the trick ending but the characters that are met.  There are no American writers like him. I really enjoyed this effort.
