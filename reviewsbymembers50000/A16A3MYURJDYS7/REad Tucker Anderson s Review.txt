 Tucker Anderson's review of this book describes the issues well.  Without reading other books in the series a portion of the book is lost because the incident that colored the behavior of Dis and Abe is not understandable.  For this effort to be completely enjoyed the past history should be understood.  Having said that most of this is a good read.  I do not want to give away too much of the plot but the twists and turns before the ending are fascinating.  We watch the story unfold through deductive reasoning. Dis is a compelling character who shows human weaknesses.    There are a few quibbles.  It is hard to understand how the illness of Abe's son fits in the story.  Also I think the ending was a bit far fetched.
