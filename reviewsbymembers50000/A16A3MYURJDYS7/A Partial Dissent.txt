 All the other posted reviews were so enthusiatic that I hate to be ambivalent.  I thought the first half was compelling.  Jack Tobin is too good to be true.  The group he put together was just too easy.  I enjoyed reading this book because I love a good story but Mr. Sheehan has not joined the first team yet.  I await his second foray
