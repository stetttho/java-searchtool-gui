 I read this book while Governor Ryan of Illinois was commuting all death sentence of individual in his state's jails.  Also a judge in New York was reversing the conviction of the Central Park jogger alleged rapists.  If Turow's book only dealt with these issues brillantly as he did the book would have been timely and engrossing.  The story shows the unraveling of the truth and we see how errors were made.  We also learn that the police are honorable in their way and do their job well but still can be wrong. In addition,Reversible Errors examines old relationships and finds errors, some of which can be reversed others that can not be.  Gillian ,the judge who convicted Gandolph, is in my view the most attractive character in book.  She is correcting her past errors.  Muriel the PA and Larry the fascinating police detective are having more difficult correcting their errors.  I doubt they ever will.  In any event these parallel relationships enhance the book. Many reviewers have compared Turow to Grisham.  There is no comparison.  Grisham is fun. Turow is a master.
