 I will not review the plot as many other have done that already. The interesting part of the book is watching Dan Brown begin to develop his craft.  I have now read all four of his books and in some degree they are all similar but they improve.  Each is researched, although according to several reviews the research in this book is spotty especially as it relates to number theory and Spain. Each takes place in a long day.   In each the conclusion is reached just on time.    Digital Fortress is not nearly as interesting as the others.  Also the plot is even more far fetched than the later efforts The characters are not as interesting   All in all it was worth reading because it shows how someone who has become a master started.  I have  read that Mr. Brown is having trouble finishing his next novel. Maybe he is concerned that he has reached his peak and does not want to just mail one in as other authors such as Grishom have done on occasion.  Maybe he also has realized that he has hit his peak.  In any event it will be interesting to see what he does produce next.  In rereading this review I see I have spent more time talking about the author than the book.  After thinking about the Digital Fortress that is an appropriate comment.
