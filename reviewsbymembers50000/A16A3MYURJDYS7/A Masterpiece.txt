 I first read In Cold Blood in the 60's.  After seeing the movie I reread it and was struck how ground breaking it is.  The vivid prose that paint an unblinking view of Kansas and the life of two terrible people.  Perry Smith is a character that will stay with me.  There was obviously something about him that drew people to him and he obviously had talents,yet he was a cold blooded killer.    One of the reviews that I read commented that the book never fully explained why Smith killed the Clutter family.  The strength of the book is that as in life there is no complete answer.   I read many serial killer books where the killer is some kind of a monster who is very clever.  Here the tragedy was that the killers were mundane and like life their motives were not clear.  This is a book that must be reread because as one changes and times change no insights are drawn.
