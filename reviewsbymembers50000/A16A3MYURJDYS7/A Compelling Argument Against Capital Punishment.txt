 When Mr. Patterson writes there is no doubt where he stands on important issues.  This book is a wonderful example of the development of a character and the changed perception. The first hundred pages of the book paint a picture of Rennel as a generally horrible character.  He certainly seemed the unrepentatant killer of a little girl.  There is no doubt in my mind that Rennel deserved to die  However, as we see Rennel develop we begin to understand what actually happened. Our perception of Rennel and even his brother Peyton change and our sympathies shift.  The lesson is clear that it is easy to understand how emotion can color judgement.  Also there are many figures about capital punishment set forth that make it very difficult to favor this form of punishment.   Mr Patterson is a wonderful story teller but sometime the polemics block the progress of the story.  Also when the Supreme Court get involved it is easy to see the Judge Scalia stand out.  A criticism is that Mr Patterson is often guilty of overwriting as well.  Also the Paget family is just too good.  These foibles do not really slow the progress down.  The plot is very similar but not quite as good as Reversible Error by Scott Turow which I read several years ago.  If you have not read it I suggest you compare the two.
