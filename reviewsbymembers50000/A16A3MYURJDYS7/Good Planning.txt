 This is the story of a professional killer who is hired to perform several killings to avoid an investigation.  The fun of the book is watching the killer react when his plan goes awry.  He cleverly with exquisite execution defuses the situation.  The FBI agent who is pursuing him adds very little to the effort.  I keep waiting for her to add some significance to the narration but it never happens.  The character of the hit man who for some reason Mr. Perry only names once in the book is engaging.  We forget that he is a cold blooded killer until we are reminded by an FBI agent.  The second wonderful part of the book is the description of Las Vegas.  I have shared it with a friend of mine who lived and worked in Las Vegas for several years and from her description it was right on.  Lastly and this may be carping.  The book would have been better without the last two pages.
