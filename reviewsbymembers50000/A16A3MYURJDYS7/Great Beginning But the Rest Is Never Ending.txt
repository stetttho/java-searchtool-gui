 I have read many of the customer reviews and they seemed to be split.  I unfortunately agree with the negative reviews.  The first segment of the book is wonderful.  Without giving away any plot the train ride and the scenes in LA are riveting.  If the book had ended there I would have given it a 5 star.    The remaining portion of the epic is not convincing, wordy and boring at times. I continued to read this portion because of the momentum of the first portion.   Also it was interesting to try to figure out exactly what was happening.  This was resolved mid way through the second portion.  From about 450 onwards the story dragged.  I found the end unsatisfying.    The question that is touched on better never really explored is the moral dilema that was faced.  In the 700 pages more should have spent on this issue and less driving in a never ending snow storm.
