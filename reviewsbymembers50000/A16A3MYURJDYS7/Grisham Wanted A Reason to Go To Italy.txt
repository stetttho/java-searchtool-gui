 It seems that the plot is an excuse for Grisham to explain why he enjoys Italy.  As many other reviewers said the discussion of Bologna was fun, especially because Grisham loved the city.  Plot was not believable or even important.   The book was totally lacking in suspense and was far fetched.  The saving grace is that the book had no pretense.  It was just a pleasant diversion on two plane trips.  I am not sure how one rates.
