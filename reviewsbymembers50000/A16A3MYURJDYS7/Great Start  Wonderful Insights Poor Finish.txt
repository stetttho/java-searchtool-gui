 The book starts with a wonderful idea that other reviewers have commented upon. Harlan has the ability to move his story along so one can not put it down. AS itdevelops one begins to focus upon different characters.  The problem is that there are too many coincidences and also the end is too pat.  I thought the end was just not satisfying. Harlan has so many insights in living in the suburbs.  He does a wonderful job on the socialization of the car pool line and raising children.
