 This book is what it is, which is a poorly written, highly predictable, cookie-cutter type of fiction that goes down real easy. The dialog is awful, the coincidences are truly astounding, and the action is truly unbelievable. (Who would believe that in this era, multiple gunshots in an airport - no matter what time of day - would not bring down a swift response by security personnel?)  Having said all that, this book is a quick read and suitable diversion for a plane trip. It is not nearly as good as the Davinci Code, however.
