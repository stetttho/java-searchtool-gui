 Everyone is in great form on this recording. 'Trane gives a fantastic exhibition of his late-50's style: fat tone, great lyricism, and imaginative soloing. He sounds like he's in the room with you. Kenny Burrell shows why he is one the the very best jazz guitarists of all time. (He was a major inspiration to Wes Montgomery!) The rhythm section keeps things running smoothly. Tommy Flanagan was (is?) one of the great under-appreciated jazz pianists and he contributes a few excellent solos on this recording. I've had this recording for 30 years and I still listen to it regularly.
