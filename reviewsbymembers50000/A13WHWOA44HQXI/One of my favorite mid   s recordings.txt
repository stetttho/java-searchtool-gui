 This was a terrific album. I spent a lot of time learning the songs on it. I was a big fan of Paul Butterfield and saw Butterfield with Buzzy Feiten. I wish it was available in the USA at a realistic price. BTW, I have all the Electric Flag albums and Gene Dinwiddie *never* played with the Electric Flag. He *did* play with Paul Butterfield; perhaps the other reviewer got his bands mixed up.
