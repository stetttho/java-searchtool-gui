 This book is stunningly simple, and therein lies its usefulness. The author seems to know his stuff: the workouts are progressive and varied, which pushes the body and keeps it reacting, rather than "settling in". My only complaint is that the book assumes that one has access to a gym and certain machines, especially for leg exercises. It would have been nice to include alternative exercises for those who work out at home. What are the best substitutions for leg extensions and leg curls, for example?
