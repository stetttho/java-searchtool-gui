 Much of the information presented here was not new to me. The strength of the film is the way in which Michael Moore puts it together. What I took away from the film is the difference between news in the U.S. and other countries, namely, that in the U.S., the focus is exhaustively on violent crime, disasters (both natural and human-caused), and other topics (snakes loose in your neighborhood!) that are designed(?) to make viewers afraid.
