 The old windbag does it again! He repeats the same stuff over and over again in the book and paraphrases from past novels. For example, practically every major character in the book repeats a variation of Stalin's famous question, "How many divisions does the Pope have?" This guy clearly has too many people telling him exactly what he wants to hear and he's let it go to his head. His writing style is morphing into the kind of Ann Coulter-ish ranting that extreme conservatives seem to crave. You couldn't give me this book. I borrowed one from my local library. I suggest you do the same.
