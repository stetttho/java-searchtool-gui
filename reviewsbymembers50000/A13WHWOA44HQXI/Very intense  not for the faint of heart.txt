 N.S.U., which opens the CD, is one of the best openings for any song. The solo drums sets a frantic pace that gets even more frenetic as the song progresses. One of the things I've always loved about Cream is the way they EXPLODE into their jams. Sonically, it is like a dam bursting. There is enough guitar instruction on this CD to keep one occupied for months.
