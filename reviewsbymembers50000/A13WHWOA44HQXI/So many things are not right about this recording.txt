 1. Absolutely lacks the fire of the originals; it sounds tired. 2. At best, the packaging is misleading; at worst, it is fraudulent. Name another "greatest hits" recording that did not consist of the originals? 3. The background vocals sound lame - see #1 above.  The Animals did some great stuff, especially some of their covers of Howlin' Wolf and Little Richard. It's too bad that this tired re-hash is being pawned off as their best.
