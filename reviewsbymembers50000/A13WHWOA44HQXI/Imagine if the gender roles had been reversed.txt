 Imagine a musical that glorifies men who kill their wives. That has scenes of men in prison talking about how they shot, stabbed, or poisoned their wives and how the wives deserved it! That glorifies slimebag attorneys who defend these men and who have "never lost a case". Such a musical wouldn't have a snowball's chance in hell of being produced today, if ever. Everything associated with such a production would be subjected to massive boycotts and PR campaigns by womens' groups, and would be stopped dead in its tracks. In fact, pre-censorship would prevail and the project would never seriously be considered. Coincidentally, I borrowed this DVD from my local library while I was reading the chapter in Warren Farrell's terrific book, "The Myth of Male Power - Why Men are the Disposable Sex" that discusses how women receive much more lenient sentences for committing the same crimes as men. The media is literally saturated with anti-male propaganda that women would never tolerate. This film is just one example. Most men are where women were in the 1950s, in terms of their consciousness of their own oppression and of how in so many ways they literally are "the disposable sex". I've been radicalized, and I'm not staying silent any longer.
