 A friend of mine taped the last show at the Fillmore East on his reel-to-reel. (It was broadcast on WNEW-FM in NYC.) By this time, I had already memorized every note on the original album. When I listened to the tape I was SHOCKED at how different the tape sounded compared to the original album. The guitars just rang with overtones that are completely missing from the album. The rest of the band sounded much better also. The album sounded incredibly dry and compressed in comparison. Sonically, this reissue is a vast improvement over the original, but it still doesn't even begin to represent the way the original ABB actually sounded live in concert.
