 I found this book quite interesting until the author began ranting about a quarter of the way into it that the whole thing was a fantastic plot to establish World Socialism. The idea that a cabal of the wealthiest men in the world, greedy capitalists all, would hatch this fantastic conspiracy to bring about World Socialism is just plain stupid. Unless the author really means National Socialism (Nazism), which is more like Corporate Socialism, or fascism. That is far more believable, and likely. Nevertheless, once the author got on his rant he lost all credibility with me. The ruling elites are far more likely to want to bring about World Fascism than World Socialism and if the author is unable to see the distinction then his analysis is so fundamentally flawed that the book is not worth reading.
