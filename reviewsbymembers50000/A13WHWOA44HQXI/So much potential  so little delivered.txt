 The other criticisms are all valid and I won't add any. My title says it all.  BTW, there were 19 reviews for this book at the time I wrote this one. It seemed to me that the overall rating (4+ stars) was not reflected in the reviews and the number of stars assigned. I decided to calculate the rating for myself. Here is what I calculated (stars * count):  (5 * 11) + (4 * 1) + (3 * 2) + (1 * 5) = 70/19 = 3.684.  This is almost a full star _below_ the overall rating as reported by Amazon. I have noticed before that Amazon's overall rating for materials seemed too high for the reviews, but this is the first time I ran the numbers myself. Seems one must take these things with a pinch of salt...
