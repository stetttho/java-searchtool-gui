 This book is a true "no spin zone" that makes a devastating case against the regime of George W. Bush and shows Mr. Bush and his cronies for what they truly are: the lying-est, most corrupt, most mendacious, most anti-democratic administration in our country's history. They are conducting a class war against the bottom 90% of Americans, and we are getting our collective butts kicked! Read it and weep. Then, do something about it.
