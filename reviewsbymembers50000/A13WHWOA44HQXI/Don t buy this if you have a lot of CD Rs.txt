 I have a few thousand LPs that I am recording onto CD-Rs. This CD player will not play roughly 50% of them. I can discern no particular pattern relating to brand of CD, 74/80 minute capacity, etc. If you have a lot of CD-Rs, get a CD player that specifically states that it will read them. By the way, both my hifi CD players can read all the CDs, as can the 4 CD readers and writers on my home computers.
