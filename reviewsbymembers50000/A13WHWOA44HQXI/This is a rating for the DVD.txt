 Pluses: 1. Incorporates some yoga, especially stretches. 2. Very pleasant voice, unlike most "workout" tapes, which are too "peppy" for my tastes. 3. Three levels of instruction. 4. "Coaching" for selected exercises. Minuses: 1. Major weight-loss component is advice to pay attention to one's physical, emotional, and spiritual needs. Workout will not provide much cardio benefit, nor add much muscle mass, so it's hard to see how one can lose weight on this program alone. 2. Many of the exercises are not standard Pilates (as defined in Brooke Siler's book), but incorporate "yoga" variations. 3. Background music is spotty.
