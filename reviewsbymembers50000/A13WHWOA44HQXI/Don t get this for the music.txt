 This is an interesting, perhaps even a historically significant, film, but it definitely is not one of the better *music* DVDs out there. The sound is great, but the  Stones are out of tune with each other and with themselves, they consistently miss changes and flub endings, and the other performers are even worse.  Get Your Ya-Ya's Out is a much better buy and one of the best live rock recordings. Of course, it's cherry-picked from the Stones' entire tour and not a single concert.
