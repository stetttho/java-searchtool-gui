 The other reviewers are not exaggerating! This is a great record. The guitar solo on "Do you wanna dance" is worth the price of the CD. David Lindley takes his music seriously, but he doesn't take himself seriously. The result is a recording with excellent musicianship, great vocals, superb production values and an infectious vibe. This is a great party record, guaranteed to get people dancing. My two sons, 6 and 9, love this record.
