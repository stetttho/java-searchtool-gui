 Throughout all of the post-Soviet Union Jack Ryan novels, there were rivers of apologies for the inadequacies of the CIA and, specifically, its failure to have predicted the downfall of the Soviet Union. In this book, Clancy strongly hints that the Reagan defense build-up was in fact a carefully orchestrated plan by Reagan/Bush (based on a Ryan-inspired CIA study) to force the Soviet Union to ruin its economy in an attempt to keep up with the US defense build-up. (The last 100 pages of the book contain conversation by Ryan's superiors to employ his expertise in economic matters to the problem of the Soviet Union.) This is the same kind of drivel that has been coming out the extreme Right in this country for the past few years. Never mind that the defense build-up actually began during the Carter presidency and was well underway by the time of the attempt on the Pope's life. According to Clancy, the defense build-up and its consequent effects on US deficits and its tremendous opportunity costs to the rest of the economy was a brilliant plan by Reagan. Clancy has an ability to distort history and twist the facts that would have been the envy of any Party Apparatchik.
