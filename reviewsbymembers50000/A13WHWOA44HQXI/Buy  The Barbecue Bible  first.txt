 I have made @ half the recipes in this book. They are OK. I find "The Barbecue Bible" to be a much better book. It doesn't have the glossy photos, but the quality of the recipes and the variety is far superior to this book. James McNair also wrote an excellent grilling cookbook that is superior to this one.
