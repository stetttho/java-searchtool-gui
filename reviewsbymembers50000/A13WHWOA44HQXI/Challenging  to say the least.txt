 When I was 14 years old, I walked into the Sam Goody record store on 5th Avenue and 42nd St. in NYC and told the sales clerk that I wanted to purchase my first John Coltrane album and what would he recommend. Ascension is what he gave me. Needless to say, I found it unlistenable and it put me off Coltrane for several years. When I was in high school and college, I used to bet people that they couldn't listen to this recording all the way through. I never lost. In the late 1970's I worked in a casual restaurant. After closing time, we played this record real loud. It never failed to clear out the stragglers. The one thing I remember from the liner notes was that the non-musicians in the studio were screaming during the recording of the pieces. The writer was surprised that they were able to keep the screaming off the vinyl. If and when you listen to this recording, you will understand why they were screaming: the music is *intense*.
