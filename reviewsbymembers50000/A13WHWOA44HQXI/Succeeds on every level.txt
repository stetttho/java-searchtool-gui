 This is a terrific DVD. It is emotional without being maudlin. It is a *celebration* of George and his music. The musicianship is outstanding. The musicians are all pros, they don't overplay, the sound is simultaneously very tight and very loose. (Perhaps only a musician would understand the last statement.) I wonder if Jeff Lynne, who is responsible for the sound mixing, left certain instruments out of the mix. At certain points there are 4 drummers, 2 or 3 percussionists, 8 guitarists, and 4 keyboards, yet the sound is not cluttered at all... The material really highlights Georges gift for both lyrics and melody. Eric Clapton, the musical director, did a great job of managing the musicians. For those who don't know: Joe Brown is/was a big star in England and Europe. In fact, the Beatles used to open for him a long time ago, which is how they met. Sam Brown is Joe's daughter. She had a run of popularity in England and still performs and records. She delivers a great vocal on "Horse to Water". Jools Holland is a popular R&B band leader in England. My only gripes are that Ravi Shankar's piece, composed for the event, is longer than it could have been and the Monty Python segment just didn't do it for me. In addition, I would have liked to have seen some kind of "family tree" that explained the connection that the performers had to George. I got this DVD from my local library and it is definitely on my buy list.
