 I still remember my first time reading this book!  I have never laughed out loud reading a book before, but this changed it all!  The book is well written for a nice light read that you can read in a day or two.  I still  go back and read it when I have a little down time and I still laugh and  just can't put it down.  This is the first in the Agatha Raisin series and  the others are just as delightful.  If you have a day or two and need to  escape or need something to read on a relaxing vacation this is it!
