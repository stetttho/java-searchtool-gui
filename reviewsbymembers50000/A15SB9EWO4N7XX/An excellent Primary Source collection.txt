 This volume, and volume II, make an excellent compainion piece for a servey look at British history. The chapters are arrainged to give a good over view of comtemporary ideas and issues and the excerps of documents are  an excellent choise. I have used both volumes in survey courses of British  history in college. One extra benefit is a chapter dedicated to the Irish  question giving a wide variety of views. Many of the picks Prof. Arnstein  has made are excellent choices as they are definatly not mainstream  documents, yet are historicaly well known or give interesting views that  are often overlooked.
