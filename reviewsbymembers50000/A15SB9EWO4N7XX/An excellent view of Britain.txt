 I am a student majoring in History with a concentration in English History.  I have used this book for one class, but since have come back to it counless times.  The chapters are well focused and broken down into  logical subcategories.  The book is an excellent reader for those who want  to know about the events and significance (something that many books leave  out) of English history and contemporary England, as well as a refrence  book for students and Anglophiles!  The book is well written and easy to  read for any reader, historical backgroud or not.  Prof. Arnstein is known  for his keen sense of humor and it definatly shows through in this book.   This book also inclues photos which excellently illustrate the world of  late Victorian England and the 20th century of the UK.
