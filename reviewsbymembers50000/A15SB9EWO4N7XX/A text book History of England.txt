 This book gives an excellent historical background to the history of Britain.  It does not present any theories, views, or concentrations, and thus makes a good read for those looking for a thurough basis of British  History.  I have tried to use this book as a refrence book but often have  difficulties as many topics are not focused enough in sections and tend to  drag out over the whole chapter.  While this makes an excellent scholastic  book, I would not recomend it to casual readers.
