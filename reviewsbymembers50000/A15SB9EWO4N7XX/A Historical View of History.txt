 This is a very interesting book!  It was written by a man writing during the Edwardian period over people living in the Victorian period.  It's perspectives and biases are unique to anyone  interested in Modern English History (19th cent.).  It includes bios of Gen. Gorden Florence nightengale and more.  It's tone is very unique and will give the reader insight and often a good laugh.  Even if you're not a historian, it's an interesting way to learn a version of some famous Victorian's lives.
