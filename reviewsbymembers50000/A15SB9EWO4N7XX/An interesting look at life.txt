 This book combines particular case histories with a well organized view of what common people did and what their lives were really like.   One interesting aspect of the book is that is organized the social history  around stages of life: birth, infancy, childhood, etc.  Instead of starting  out with birth, however, death is the first chapter.  This positioning  gives the reader an stunning realization of what life really was like for  early-modern people. I read this book for a history class covering  Tudor-Stuart England at my University.  I would recomend this for people  who already have some understanding of English history, specificly  early-modern.  While it does give an excellent account of what average  people faced, it does not cover major historical events.
