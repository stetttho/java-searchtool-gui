 As a college student from the blackhawk area, I found this book captivating.  Really written for any age or education level, I think anyone and everyone should read it.  A heroic story of a real man, the book is a  beautiful journey through history.  The story some details of Black Hawk's  life before the war and describes the events behind the wars and his  interpretation of them well.  I would recomend this to anyone from junior  high up and definatly anyone from Rock Island or the surrounding areas.
