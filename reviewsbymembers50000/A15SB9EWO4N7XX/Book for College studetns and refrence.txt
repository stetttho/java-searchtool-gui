 While the book contains a good view of British History, it is a very dry read.  I used this book in a class on early British history and found it an excellent background source book, but not for the casual reader.  One  stunning aspect that the book contains that many do not is a section on  pre-roman Britain.  Most books start British History at the arivals of the  Romans in Britain, yet this one gives a good account of the Beaker folk,  those who built Stonehenge, and the rest of early England.  I've tried to  use this as a refrence book and have found it somewhat difficult to easily  flip to sections that contained focused and collected information, but I do  reconment it to those who need a better background to English history and  events.
