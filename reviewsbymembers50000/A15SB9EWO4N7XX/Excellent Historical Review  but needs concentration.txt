 I read this book for a history class on Tudor-Stuart England when we discussed the radical thoughts behind the Civil War.  I would recoment this book to anyone who had the time and will power to sitt through 400 pages of  radical thought and already had some knowledge of the English Civil  Wars. I must give one caution to readers.  Despite this book being 400  pages, I urge anyone who reads it to question how many people are really  represented in it.  Many readers will get the impression that massive of  people followed these radical sects, but Hill occasional gives clues that  actualy followers were much smaller in number.  Also, despite the emphasis  on smaller groups often unheard, there is an almost total absence of female  voices even though women played a large part in the movement. While the  book is not a light read, it is a must for anyone wanting to increase their  knowledge of what English people were thinking on the eve of Revolution.
