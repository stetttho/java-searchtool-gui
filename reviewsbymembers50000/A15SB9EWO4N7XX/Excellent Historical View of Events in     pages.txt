 Culture and Power in England gives an excellent historical narritive of England in a rather small book.  Unlike Christopher Hill's "The World Turned Upside Down," it uncovers many of the less publicised points of  view before the Puritain Revolution.  It also goes forward to give an  excellent over view of the "Glorious" Revolution.  People looking  for a wide range of issues from travel to classical literature to what was  vouge will find them all in this short volume.  While the field of Cultural  history is still debated, this gives an excellent case for studying how  people reacted to everything in their world.
