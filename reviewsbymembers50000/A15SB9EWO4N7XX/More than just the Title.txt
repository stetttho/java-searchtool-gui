 This book is much more than just the Easter Rising.  The first chapter explains the Rising rather simply, making it easy to follow along.  The following chapters explain everything from the causes of the Rising (Unionists, Republicans, Consititutionalists, Home Rulers, Romantics).  It goes back more than a hundred year, giving a quick overview of Irish Colonialism by the English and focusing on the 19th century after the Act of Union in 1800.  It includes political, popular, literary, and even sporting movements.  Then it explains the imediate events of the Risings and goes on to explain the after effects, including Sinn Finn, etc.  This book is really a short history of Anglo-Irish relations.  It's written in a manner that anyone can pick it up and set it back down with a well rounded knowledge of the events.  It even includes a chapter that explains the effects of Americans on Irish relations.  This is a wonderful secondary source sutable for anyone wanted to gain some basic knowledge of the problems in Ireland or wanting to just get a solid background before going on to do any more reading.
