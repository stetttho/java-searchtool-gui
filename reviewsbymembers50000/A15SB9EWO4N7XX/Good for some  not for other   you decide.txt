 I read this book in a History class of the Tudor-Stuart period in college.  While I found the book interesting, many others did not.  The book combines documents by Elizabeth herself, many rare or hard to find and of a  personal nature, and secondary source comentaty.  The book gives an often  unheard naritive of Elizabeth I's childhood, accendancy, and reign. One  problem that many other students found in my class was the constant  personal narritives given by the author.  While at times they are quite  dramatic and through provoking, they are often biased and pure speculation  (yet presented as fact).  Some issues and events are taken someone out of  context or presented in a slanted view. While I would definatly recomend  this book to anyone wanting to know more and about Elizabeth I, I must  caution the reader to question some of the evidence and speculation given  in the book.  The reader must constantly be on the look out for things that  may be biased.  This book does make an excellent read for the amature  historian, but like all historical books, do not base all your knowledge on  this one work.
