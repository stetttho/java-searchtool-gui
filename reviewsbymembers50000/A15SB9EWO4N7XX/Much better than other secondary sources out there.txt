 I am a student at the University that Prof. Arnstein, the co-author of this book and the author of the next book, teaches at.  I used both this and it's follow up, "Britain: Yesterday and Today," for classes  here at the university as well as my own knowledge and background  reasearch.  The book is well written with an excellent comedic edge that  captivates even the most light-hearted historical reader.  While it covers  a long period of history is a relativly short number of pages, it does it  well.    I would suggest this to any one looking for a little knowledge of  the time period without having to get a Ph.D. in history to do so!   One  nice feature of the book is that it features full color photos which many  other books lack.  I've used many text books here at the University for  English history and I keep comming back to this one anytime I need to check  a fact or brush up on an event.
