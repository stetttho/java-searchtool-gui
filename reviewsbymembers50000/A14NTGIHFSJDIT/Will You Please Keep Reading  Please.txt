 Like Carver, I was born and raised in a small town in Oregon. Maybe life is different in the rest of the US; but when the characters in his story "Vitamins" complain that there's no work anywhere except Portland, I understand. When the characters in "Chef's House" are evicted because Chef's fat daughter needs a place to stay, I understand. If you haven't lived in a small town (and I'm not talking about a picturesque New England village; I'm talking about a run-down logging town, I'm talking about closed mills, all-night bars, and welfare lines a mile long) you might not understand what Carver's talking about. If you haven't clung desperately to a miserable job, where the boss knows he owns you because there's a line of people who would JUMP for your 30-hours a week at minimum wage, Carver might not radiate for you as potently as he does for others. So. Come on up to Oregon. Work in a diner, or at the video store, or part-time bagging machine-parts on an assembly line. Worry about your job. Drink too much. See your kid get busted for possession of grass. Spend 5 months out of the year in dense fog and rain. Lose hope that you'll ever be able to afford another moving truck to get you out of Oregon. Oh, and when you're done... pick up this amazing collection of short stories by Raymond Carver. I guarantee you'll think he's the most amazing writer that ever came down the pike.
