 "Innocent young maidens cast into the grips of horrible old hags, frogs who are really princesses awaiting the right kiss, magical spindles and feathers, precious golden apples -- these and other classic fairytale ingredients are to be found in this superb collection of seven traditional Russian stories. Collected by Afanasyev, "the Russian Grimm," and splendidly decorated with the peotic and colorful illustrations of Ivan Bilibin, renowned nineteenth-century scenic artist, the stories share the common themes of good versus evil, psychic transformation, and rebirth. Children will be enchanted and adults intrigued by the sinister and delightful qualities of these traditional folk tales." -- excerpt from dust jacket.  This collection of fairy tales is, indeed, marvelous. It contains seven classic stories:  *Ivan Tsarevich, the grey wolf, and the firebird *Sister Alyonushka and brother Ivanushka *Finist the falcon *Marya Morevna *The white duck *Vasilisa the beautiful *The frog princess  While the stories are entertaining in themselves, the illustrations really deserve the most praise. Bilibin's work is reminiscent of Alfonse Mucha's Art Nouveau pieces -- possibly the best is Bilibin's painting of Vasilisa escaping from Baba Yaga's hut, carrying an enchanted skull mounted on a stick. (Light pours from the empty eye sockets; that's how Vasilisa can see to leave.)  Not to be missed by collectors or lovers of fairy tales and fantasy -- the artwork alone is worth the purchase.
