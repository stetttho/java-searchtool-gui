 In an age of predictable fiction (enough with the Noah's-Ark-we-have-to-live-on-this-ship-for-generations already!), Jack McDevitt proves that science fiction can still explore the future... and tell a pretty good yarn at the same time.  In this novel, the Earth is dying, and habitable worlds are hard to find.  The only evidence of a non-human race capable of space flight is odd monuments strewn across the galaxy, including a bizarre ice-statue left on one of the moons of Saturn.  So we're not alone, but where the hell is everybody?  The planet Quraqua had two advanced civilizations, but both literally vanished overnight.  Interestingly, the Quraquans seemed to know exactly when this catastrophe would occur.  And if it weren't for the fact that Quraqua is slated for planetary re-shaping (a minor inconvenience involving deliberate "snowballing", or lobbing ice asteroids at the planet's poles), humankind might have time to figure out what is going on.  This novel is one surprise after the other, and the characters are perfectly human, driven by fascination, revenge, greed, and sheer stubbornness. And if you are interested in archaeology, or have ever dreamt about sifting through the ruins of an alien culture, this book is a must-have.  Do yourself a favor.  Throw out that latest hack-installment of "hero with a zap gun" and snap up "The Engines of God".  Your brain will thank you for it.
