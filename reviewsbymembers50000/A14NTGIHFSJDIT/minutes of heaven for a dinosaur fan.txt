 I've been obsessed with dinosaurs since I can remember, yet privately disappointed with cheesy dinosaur movies (not that that ever stopped me from watching them!)  Thank goodness, then, for "Walking with Dinosaurs: Allosaurus"!  The animation is flawless, and unlike the excellent "Jurassic Park" movies, there aren't any annoying humans to distract us from the dinosaurs.  The video takes us from Big Al's birth and early years, chasing dragonflies and harassing scorpions, to his juvenile and young-adult years, and eventual outcome (I won't spoil it!)  What could be more terrifying than a 30 foot predator running through the salt flats after a herd of apatosaurs?  Take your bathroom break before you start the video, make sure there's extra popcorn, and keep the Visine handy--- you won't want to blink!  The afterword, where they describe the science behind the show, is fairly decent.  And yet... couldn't they have deleted it and just added another half hour of the dinosaurs?
