 Badger's Drift is the best kept village in Midsomer... at least, that's what the sign says.  The mystery starts when Ms. Emily Simpson, an 80-year old retired school teacher, stumbles upon "something" in the woods.  Her best friend and neighbor, Ms. Bellringer, knew something was wrong when Ms. Simpson came home that night - she didn't close her door, she slammed it.  And she failed to padlock her tricycle... Emily was always afraid of thieves, you know.  When Ms. Simpson is discovered with a broken neck, as from a fall, Ms. Bellringer just knows it must have been foul play. Chief Inspector Barnaby and Sergeant Troy take up the investigation.  Questions: Why does Dennis Rainbird, the local undertaker, seem so eager to get Ms. Simpson's body in the ground?  What's really going on with Dr. Lesseter, who claims that Ms. Simpson was in perfect health?  Isn't it odd that no one ever sees Mr. Henry Trace, the wealthiest man in Badger's Drift, out of his wheelchair?  And just what is Michael Lacey "painting" in his studio?   Don't worry - none of these are spoilers.  They're just the sort of devilishly odd questions you might ask yourself while watching one of the best episodes in the _Midsomer Murders_ series. Enjoy...
