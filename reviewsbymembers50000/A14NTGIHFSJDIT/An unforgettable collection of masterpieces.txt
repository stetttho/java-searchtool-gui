 Of all the movements in 20th century literature, Imagism is my favorite.  If you're as sick as I am of angry,  modern, "confessional" poets (yes, I'm sure your childhood was awful, now see a therapist and get on Prozac), then take a look at this collection.  While some of the poems here are widely anthologized (including Wallace Steven's, "Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird" and William Carlos Williams's, "To Waken an Old Lady"), most haven't been seen except by literati.  It's truly a shame, because one of the "rules" of the Imagist movement was clarity of prose and vision.  Take this gem from Richard Aldington, for example: "The chimneys, rank on rank,/ Cut the clear sky;/ The moon/ With a rag of gauze about her loins/ Poses among them, an awkward Venus---/ And here I am looking wantonly at her/ Over the kitchen sink."  Wow!  The Imagist movement was about nature, and unexpected beauty; things we haven't seen much of in late 20th/early 21st century art.  In my opinion, this affordable little book is worth ten times the cover price.  "Confessional" poetry?  If I want to read about child molestation or how awful the world is, I'll read the newspaper, thank you.
