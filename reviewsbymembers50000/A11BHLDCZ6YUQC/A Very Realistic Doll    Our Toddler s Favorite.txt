 The first time my daughter saw a Chou Chou, she wouldn't leave the store until we kissed and hugged it goodbye -- she was absolutely convinced it was a real baby.  After all, it was about the same size as her little baby brother, had eyes that closed when it went to sleep & wore a REAL DIAPER! (Yes, stock up on those if you decide to buy one...changing the diaper is a favorite activity at our house).  Plus, the doll came with a pacifer and her very own lovey (small teddy bear).  Our Chou Chou is treated just like a baby in our house -- when her little brother is hungry, my daughter's Chou Chou is always hungry.  Same goes for those sleepy moments (especially at our daughter's naptime) or when her brother has those stinky diaper moments.  Another plus...this baby can wear real newborn clothes and shoes so if you saved any of your child's clothing, no need to buy expensive boxed clothing sets.  Makes for great photo opportunities too...seeing your child hold a dolly in the outfit your own real baby once wore.
