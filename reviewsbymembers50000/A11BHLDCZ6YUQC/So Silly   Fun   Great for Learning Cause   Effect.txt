 This toy is an absolute blast! Our almost 7 month old figured out (with the help of a very enthusiastic 3 yr old) how to push the blue button to activate the toy with just a few tries.  The stacking toys are just the right size for chubby baby hands and work well as teethers (especially the little bug with two fabric wings).  Reminds me a lot of the baby Legos in terms of size and style but the "character" pieces have the typical goofy F-P faces.  My husband likes the bopping flowers; my toddler enjoys building stacks on spinning discs and then knocking them over so the pieces fly around. This toy has a couple of limitations.  First, it's noisy (especially when the stackers are flying around) and only plays one tune -- very annoying if your child keeps hitting the "on" button.  Second, the play mat is thin & edged with fabric- covered hard foam pieces...not the soft padding I was anticipating.  Despite these drawbacks, it is still one of my baby's favorite toys and always gets a laugh.
