 This was the hit of our Christmas...even the adults took a long break to play with it.  The best part of this set is how realistic the tools sound; I was convinced that my daughter was cutting away part of our coffee table.  The drill works both in forward AND reverse.  Plus, you can actually screw or drill pieces of plastic wood together...so fun for my toddler.  The tool belt is pretty cheesy plastic (and definitely needs a better latch) but each holder is labeled with a picture so my daughter has enjoyed making sure each tool is in its proper place.  There are a few things I would improve on with this set: 1.  Make the drill bit actually "disappear" when you drill (similar to Little Tikes) so it really feels like you're drilling into the floor 2.  Improve on the measuring tape construction...ours already won't retract 3.  Finally, make it easier to get out of the package!  It took two adults (and a couple sliced finger tips) before everything was removed.   Overall, this was a great buy for us!
