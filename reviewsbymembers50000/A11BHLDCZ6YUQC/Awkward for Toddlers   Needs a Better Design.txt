 My daughter received this at 18 months along with all the other circus/big-top sets.  She has hardly played with this one at all, with the exception of using the little people with her other F-P sets.  The diving board has never worked for us and forget about latching the elephant into the rolling thing...what a pain and impossible for little toddler fingers to do.  She thought the diving pool was a bathtub and it has since migrated to her F-P house as a baby tub.  I'm rating this toy as a 2-star for fun instead of just a one-star because the elephant was a HUGE hit and is absolutely adorable plus we do use the clown and diving pool in other play.  However, I would definitely look at other F-P sets before purchasing this one.
