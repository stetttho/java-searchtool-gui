 I bought this for my daughter when she turned two & it is one of her favorite toys.  We never even put batteries into it!  She uses the little people and accessories to act out bedtime and dinnertime.  Her favorite part of the play house is the bathroom which comes with a potty whose lid actually lifts up and down...a huge hit with a potty training toddler!  Her people make constant use of the balcony and doors too.  Her other F-P people often come over for parties.  I love the fact that house closes up securely and I can hide all the pieces inside.  My only request for future versions would be to make it a little more unisex...the house and accessories are VERY pink and definitely targeted to the little girl market.
