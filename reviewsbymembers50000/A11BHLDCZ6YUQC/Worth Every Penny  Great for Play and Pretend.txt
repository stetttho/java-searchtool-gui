 My daughter received this as a gift for her first birthday.  Initially, I thought she was too young but the purchase was right on the nose.  In the beginning, she would just walk in and out the door and hide under the climbing ledge.  It took until about 18 months before she could climb up on the ledge herself and go down the slide.  At around age 2, she started climbing up the outsides (there are little steps and footholds) & thought it was a total blast (even though it terrified us the first few times).  Now, at 2 1/2, she uses it as a "pretend house" for her stuffed animals and baby dolls.  She has been too tall for the doorway for quite a while but having to bend over hasn't slowed down her play.  In fact, I think she likes it that this is a "kids only" play toy.  We've always used this toy inside, first in our living room and now in the playroom.  It is a great way to burn off energy during our long Minnesota winters!  Definitely a must-have.  We had no problems putting it together and it has stayed sturdy and safe even with all the time she's spent with it.
