 My daughter received this as a gift a year ago along with all the F-P circus/big top sets (train, bear, etc.).  We were a little disappointed with this set.  It has the great F-P quality & shows no sign of wear but my daughter never played with this set as an individual whole.  For one thing, the dog never spun around on the holder like it should have (we tried other little people with better success).  My daughter also got frustrated because the holder kept slipping out of the back of the horse.  The horse should also have been constructed with rolling wheels...doesn't make sense to have to push it along the floor & hope that the rolling/spinning part will work.  She's played mostly with the horse individually.  She also plays with the rolling part in her F-P garage (she likes crashing it into the gates and walls).  Before you select this toy, take a look at the other F-P offerings first, unless you want to have the full circus/big-top set.
