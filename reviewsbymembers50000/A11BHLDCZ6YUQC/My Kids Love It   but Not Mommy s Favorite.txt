 This toy has everything that little ones love...bright colors, flashing lights, a lever to pull down, a wheel to turn, a button to push & lots of NOISE.  This toy personally drives me crazy just because it's so loud BUT my kids (and their friends) love it.  The only part of the toy that frustrates them is that it is relatively light-weight and slides all around the table when they are playing with it.  Definitely need little grippers on the bottom.  My daughter received this as a gift for her 1st birthday & she was way too young...this is definitely a toy for 2 yrs old & up as some coordination and strength (to pull the "shifter") is required.  My husband also likes this toy but only because he discovered that he can get the Sesame Street characters to rap if he hits the buttons just right...great amusement for those Dad Club get-togethers (you know you're a parent when this stuff makes you crack up).  One good aspect of this toy...it doesn't show a sign of wear & the batteries are still fresh after almost two years of play.
