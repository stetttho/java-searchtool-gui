 I bought this set on a whim for my daughter (can't beat the price) because she loves F-P little people. This set, by far, has been played with more than any of her others.  Excellent construction...both the front door and back wheelchair door still work great.  She piles all her little people inside and wheels them around to visit her other sets (the house, the garage, etc).  She also likes lining up her people to make them "take turns" riding the bus.  The open-top is nice and large...great for little hands.  The wheelchair was also a big hit (its wheels work great) but it spent more time with her parking garage than on the bus.  Her 7-month old brother has just started to play with it too and is learning to take the people in and out of the top and likes playing with the eyes on the bus front. 5-star set in every way!
