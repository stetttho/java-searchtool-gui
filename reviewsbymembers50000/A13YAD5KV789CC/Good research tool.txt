 I bought this book exclusively to research some social and historical characteristics of County Roscommon Ireland in the early 19th Century.  My ancestors lived there around the time period on which the book is focused.  This gave me a lot of helpful information in understanding why my ancestors may have left Ireland in those days to come to America.  But I am not a scholar.  So I wasn't afraid to keep a dictionary nearby as I read this well-written soft cover book.
