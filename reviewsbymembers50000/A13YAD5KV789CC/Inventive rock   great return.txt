 It's nice to have them back after a three-year absence.  Well, I shouldn't say that. They've been touring all this time.  However this is a good progressive rock release.  It's full of variety and reminiscent of a number of other performers.  It's close to an hour of music and each song connects to one another similar to the way the Moody Blues produced albums in the 60's and `70's. "Godless" is a great lead cut. "County Leaver" makes you think of songs such as the Rolling Stone's "It's All Over Now."  "Solid" reminds me of classic, quirky Kevin Ayers.  Lead singer Courtney Taylor-Taylor sounds exactly like him there.  "Bohemian Like You" is pop in its purist form and was the perfect choice for the first single.  I think it should be followed with either "Cool Scene" or "Shakin'," which hints of of Bowie during his "Lodger/Scary Monsters" phase.  The dreary finale "The Gospel" is an appropriate ending but it probably was my least favorite song. I'm not a huge fan of rock but this one is a keeper.
