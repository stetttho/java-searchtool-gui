 "Borrowed Tides" reads like a 50's space opera with more believable characters.  It's a deep space expedition that turns into a time travel story.  Time travel is a tricky subject to write about and purely speculative.  However the way Levinson addresses it makes it come across as more plausible.    Each of the characters here have their own individual traits and desires with a fairly consistent goal. They all want to know what's going to happen to them as they spend 16 years cramped together in a space ship on its way to Alpha Centauri.  To me the most interesting parts of the book are the situations that develop when they actually get there and then the final couple of chapters as their mission comes to a close.  Or does it?  You'll have to read the book to find out.
