 This is a handy pocket-sized companion guidebook for the Pokemon Game Boy Color Crystal game.  This is really a gift for my son so I have little to say about it other than he finds it helpful and useful.  I ordered it through amazon.com because it is not an easy book to find locally any longer since the game is no longer manufactured.
