 Like other reviewers, I found this five song sample way too short.  This CD is brilliantly crafted, hypnotic and elegantly arranged. Miss Meade's voice is soothing and her lyrics are personal and real. I am pleased to see  that a new release is forthcoming and I expect to be right at the beginning  of the line to get my copy.  If you like acoustic music with a creative,  artistic touch, you will enjoy this one immensly.
