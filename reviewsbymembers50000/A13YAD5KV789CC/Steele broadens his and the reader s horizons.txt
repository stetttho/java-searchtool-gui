 Allen Steele's "Coyote" is actually a collection of stories and novelettes that have appeared in Science Fiction magazines over a 2-3 year period.  They are strung together in a cohesive story about a group of rebels who escape the earth, which is now governed by an ultra-Conservative coalition.  Ultimately they wind up on a new world called Coyote on which they build a small community they name Liberty.  Steele enters new writing territory with this book.  He has traditionally written books set on the Moon or on near-Earth venues in the not-so-far off future.  This one travels far ahead. One thing I liked about this is Steele's attention to detail.  There are plenty of "new world/new colony" Science Fiction novels out there.  Many of the ones that I have read just brush over things like building toilets. Steele often discusses the lack of these day-to-day necessities and the impact on the characters.   I could not really find one clear lead character although there are plenty of antagonists.  Among those are a Colonel loyal to the old government.  Deadly flying creatures called boids.  The elements of the new world.  The inner demons of those haunted by a past way of life.  The two characters who have the biggest "parts" are Wendy and Carlos.  I find the obscure reference to the trans-gendered synthesizer artist Wendy Carlos almost ironic as this is a person who explored new genres of music.   The one flaw is the change in presentation.  The first several chapters are written in present tense, which I found distracting at first but easier to follow later.  Then half-way through the book it switches to past tense.  Generally I found this to be a pretty good read and I am glad that I was able to read it over a few days rather than over three years in various magazines.
