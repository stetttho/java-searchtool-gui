 What do forensic science, ancient Phoenicians, a New York serial killer, and amnesia all have in common?  These are the ingredients of the latest Phil D'Amato adventure from Paul Levinson.  This blends the science-fiction/mystery genres into one page-turner of a read.  The science-fiction part deals with chemical and forensic sciences.  The mystery angle is who's been killing all of these young ladies in New York?  And the fact that most of the characters lose their memories at least once because of some FDA-approved anti-biotic that gets into the brain while trying to cure the flu definitely is not conducive to solving this mystery.  See how D'Amato and company get around this problem to solve the mystery.  I liked the story.  I liked the humor.  I liked the book.  Try it.
