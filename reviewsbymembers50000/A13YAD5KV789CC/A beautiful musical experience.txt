 Saint Etienne has written and recorded its magnum opus.  Too grandiose? Just listen to it.  This is a luscious piece of work. It has the poetic sensuality of early Kate Bush; the electronic experimentation of OMD; and  the perfect pop sound of New Musik.  However, it's Saint Etienne and this  song has to be their masterpiece.  It's a three part suite starting as a  ballad, stepping up to a dance beat and then ending with a hint of  jazzy-blues.  This disk is 27 minutes long plus it has an enhanced video of  the song.  It's almost like getting a whole new album for less than the  usual price.  Saint Etienne fans will love this.  New listeners-definitely  try it out.
