 This collection is a must for true Doctor Who fans and especially those who like Patrick Troughton, the Second Doctor.  As has been said in other reviews, so many of the Troughton and Hartnell episodes were either destroyed or lost.  So what we have here is a hodgepodge of existing episodes, clips, and even audio tracks.    There's really only one full story here and that's "The Moonbase."  All four parts exist but episodes #1 & #3 exist as audio tracks only.  However all exisiting audio & video are presented here.  I admire the BBC for putting out the audio tracks of this gem from Troughton's first year as the Doctor but it's a shame that they didn't utilize more of the exisiting photographs to give it a little bit of extra life.  It was annoying listening to a 20 minute audio track with just a single picture of a Cyberman staring back from the TV screen.  Along with "The Moonbase," you're getting episodes from "The Faceless Ones," "The Underwater Menace," "The Evil of the Daleks," "The Enemy of the World," "The Abominable Snowman," "The Enemy of the World," "The Web of Fear," "the Wheel in Space," and "The Space Pirates."  You're also getting some BBC promotional clips, 10-15 second clips from scattered episodes, images shot off TV screens, and even a 10 minute 8mm documentary called "The Last Dalek," which showed some of the production techniques used to bring the famous metallic menaces to life.  By far this is a great DVD for fans and collectors but is of little value to the casual Doctor Who viewer.
