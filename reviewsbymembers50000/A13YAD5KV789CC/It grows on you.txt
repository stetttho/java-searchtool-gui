 Saint Etienne is a very underrated band in the mainstream.  However, I agree with an earlier customer review.  I thought that "The Sound of Water" was setting the tone for what I where I was expecting Saint Etienne to go in the future.  This is a little bit of a letdown after that excellent 2000 entry but it has some enjoyable moments.  It also has a few ho-hum moments.  In some respects, it harks back to their pre-"Continental" material.  Fans of the earliest Saint Etienne will probably be very satisfied.  The spoken drop-ins are back on this one.  They haven't used those for a while. It hops on songs like "Action" and "Shower Scene."  "The Way We Live Now" is mostly instrumental until it climaxes with Sarah's irrepresibly breathy vocals. The title track is also pleasant. I suspect fans will still come out in droves and buy this one.
