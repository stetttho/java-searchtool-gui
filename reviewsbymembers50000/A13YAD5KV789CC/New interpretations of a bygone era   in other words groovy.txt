 This has all the elements needed to satisfy your pop music urges.  There's a sultry lead singer (Debbie Diamond) belting out a balance of perky, upbeat tunes and slower, sometimes eerie melodies.  There is a distinctive mod feel about it.  The songs conjure up images of Swinging 60's European films like Antonioni's "Blowup" or Peter Sellers in "The Party." Even the production has a crispy, simplistic sound to it.  The lead cut "Juliette" is a great beginning with it's catchy, hooky melody.  It sets the pace for the listening experience ahead.  Other standout cuts include the animated "Black Transmission", the lively "All Systems a Go-Go," the hypnotic "Jon Sings" (burn the incense for that one), and the swaying "U&Me."  "Chocolates and Strawberries" makes you want to cuddle by the fire with the lights low and see what transpires.  Think of mini skirts and a MG convertible and you just about get the picture.  This is especially good in the headphones. Fans of Ivy, Air, and Fantastic Plastic Machine should enjoy The Januaries.
