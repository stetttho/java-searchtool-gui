 I was waiting for this one to come out on DVD because I consider "The Mind Robber" to be one of the best Doctor Who stories from the 60's.  It is more fantasy than Science-Fiction because the writer, Peter Ling, said he didn't know anything about Sci-Fi when he was contracted to write it.  But you wouldn't know it after viewing it.  The idea of the Doctor and his companions caught in a world of fiction, where well-known characters such as Gulliver or Rapunzel can only say (more or less) the dialogue that they were given by their authors is certainly intriguing.    This one also overcame a few challenges during the recording of the show in clever ways.  For one thing Frazer Hines (Jamie) contracted Chicken Pox and had to take an extended leave from the studio.  Since the story was already a bit unusual, they worked in a section where another actor would play Jamie for the duration, without affecting the overall storyline.  Also, at the last minute, the BBC needed a 5 part serial rather than a 4-part serial, so the entire first episode was concocted to build up to the rest of the story.  I was already aware of some of these things but the Special Features cover it in more detail.  Watching the features was very enlightening.  Since I have seen every classic Doctor Who episode multiple times I very much enjoy watching these DVD's with the Information Text and Commentary turned on.  There's a good lineup of commentators from the original series.
