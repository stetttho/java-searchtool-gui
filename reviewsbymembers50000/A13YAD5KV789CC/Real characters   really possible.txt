 I read a lot of Sci-Fi and but only Allen M. Steele seems to make me lose sleep.  Whenever I read one of his books, I can count on getting very little sleep that night - because his books are very hard to put down.  This one is no exception.  So when I finished this one about 2AM, I was thoroughly satisfied.  The characters are so real and three-dimensional (albeit a bit vulgar - lots of obscenities).  The concept of setting up a mining operation on the Moon is plausible.  The idea of company officials (Skycorp) who only care about the bottom dollar and not about their employees is a long-held notion about big business.  The plot has one major theme with a series of little adventures intertwined into it.  This was one of Steele's earliest books and it definitely exhibited the roots of a writing style that was yet to come (and is now here for our enjoyment).  It was occassionally amusing.  I also loved the way the book was put together.  Major chapters were broken up by transcribed audio-video interviews with the cast, articles from newspaper articles, etc.  Oh and Steele, in true Hitchcockian style, threw his own name into the mix once or twice as a reporter interviewing some of the characters.  Clever, clever.  4-stars because I personally don't need all of the four-letter words. Not that that will bother you.  It shows an affirmative reality in the characters.
