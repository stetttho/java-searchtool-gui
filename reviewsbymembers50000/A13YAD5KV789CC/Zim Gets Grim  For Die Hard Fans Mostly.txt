 It's easy to see why Nickelodeon cancelled the series if these were the ones produced for airing during the next season.  That's not meant to be a harsh statement but it is obvious that these episodes were geared more to adult fans.  It has some hilarious moments especially each time Zim screams or laughs maniacally.  The animation remains stylish, the stories are still delightfully decadent, and there are plenty of quirky drop-ins.  My favorites tended to be all the food-related ones: "Zim Eats Waffles," "Gaz, Taster of Pork," and "The Frycook What Came From All That Space."
