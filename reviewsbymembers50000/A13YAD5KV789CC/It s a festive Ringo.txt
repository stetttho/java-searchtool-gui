 What can I say?  It's Ringo Starr singing Christmas songs.  That pretty much describes it.  It's kind of fun.  He puts a little oomph into some songs and gets into the rhythm and blues at other times.  His "Little Drummer Boy" sounds like "Back Off Boogaloo" with bells. He does his own version of the rare Beatles Christmas song "Christmas Time is Here Again."  Actually, I kind of like this one better than the very unique Fab Four original.  Ringo sings like Ringo.  He use bagpipes riffs from time to time.  Some of the songs are originals and others are classics.  It's a fun CD to put up your tree up by.
