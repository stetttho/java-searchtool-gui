 What a thrill it was to find an affordable copy of this long overlooked irrepressible techno-pop classic.  Sure, the recording technology of 1980-81 cannot compare to the recording quality of today.  Granted there are a few thin synth spots, lots of electronic beeps and blips, and a very obvious electronic drum kit.  Forget all of that.  Listen to what Tony Mansfield and company were attempting.  Catchy melodies, experiments in sound, inoffensive, simple lyrics, and truly visionary of what the 80's and the 90's would ultimately branch off into.  This has always been one of my all time favorite pop albums. I bought the original when it came out in 1981.  Stand out songs include: "Churches," "While You Wait," "Changing Minds," and "Back to Room One."  All the other are just plain good.  Also included here are the B-sides to the two 45's released from the original album.  Interesting that "From the Village" is sort of a tribute to one of my all time favorite TV shows, "The Prisoner."  Be seeing you...
