 The Motors are a hard band to define.  Are they punk?  Are they dance?  Are they pop?  Well I suppose the answer to all of those questions is "yes."  The Motors were uinique in many respects and they enjoyed experimenting with different styles of music. When I hear some of the Motors music, I feel I'm in the audience of some huge broadway production.  They liked production and music of gigantic proportions as well.  Fans will know what I mean.  This has some great songs "Airport," "That's What John Said," and "Tenement Steps" to name a few.  Get it.
