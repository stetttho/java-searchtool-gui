 I bought this CD specifically to get my hands on this version of "White Bird."  I always thought it was a better version than the original one from It's A Beautiful Day (though some may call me blasphemous). This CD is most definitely a product of its time.  It's late 70's progressive-fusion-jazz.  At least that's the best way to describe it.  There are occasional jam sessions such as on "Hot Summer Day."  It is definitely not distracting. Fans are already aware of LaFlamme's talents as a violinist. The second half of the CD appears as if it was more of an attempt at commercializing his music. I remember hearing radio stations play "Where Flamingos Fly" even though it sounds like Brian Eno crooning...kind of monotone and eerie.  "Forever and a Day" is enjoyable enough. Mostly I use this CD for background music at work.  It's excellent for that purpose.
