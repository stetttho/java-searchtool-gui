 I probably would have rated this five stars because I have always been such a fan of the late Duncan Browne.  I was thrilled to be able to find an affordable CD that included both of the classic albums.  It is also nice to  have the liner notes because even though I have been a longtime fan, I  never knew much about him.  "The Wild Places" and "Streets  of Fire" are Browne's better known works, even though most of his  material has been largely ignored or unnoticed. He was a true talent with a  gift for generating mood-enhancing music.  I am extremely disappointed that  "Cancion de Cuna: Street Echoes" was left off this collection.  That was the final peaceful track on "Streets of Fire." Perhaps  the label ran out of room as the two albums combined run about 76 minutes.   However it is still pleasant to get clean copies of "The Wild  Places," "American Heartbeat," "(Restless) Child of  Change" and all of the others.
