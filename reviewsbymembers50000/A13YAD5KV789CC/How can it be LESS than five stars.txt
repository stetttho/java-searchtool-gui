 Saint Etienne continues to write, create and produce beautifully crafted melodies.  This is such a soothing CD.  It's too bad they left 3 or 4 cuts off the final version.  They were supposedly working with about sixteen  songs for this one.  "How We Used To Live" is, I'd call it, their  masterpiece, and I have been a longtime fan. It is a work of art by itself.  It is a three part suite that touches on a variety of forms of music and  then drifts peacefully into the quiet finale "The Place At Dawn."   Wow!  I mean WOW!  When it was done I wanted to reach out and grab more.   Thankfully they have dozens of CDs and well over a hundred other songs in  their discography. Sarah Cracknell's vocals are incomparable. Pete Wiggs  and Bob Stanley are craftsmen of their keyboards.  It's nice to see that  they are touring Europe this year.  I guess Bob Stanley has second thoughts  about giving up touring.  I'm waiting for their return to the USA. This  would be a fine addition to any collection.
