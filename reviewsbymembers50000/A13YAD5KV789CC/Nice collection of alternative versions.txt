 OMD has always been one of my favorite bands since I bought their first two albums around 1980.  This is the era before OMD "hit it big" on the US Top 40 charts; the era in which they were the most creative and  new.  The musical selections here are right on target for what they were  doing during these early years.  It's nice to get the rarely heard  "Annex."  This has a very pleasant version of the beautiful  "Of All The Things We've Made" as well as two other songs from  their ground-breaking "Dazzle Ships" album. It is interesting to  see how far ahead of their time they really were.  Most OMD fans already  realize that.  This collection just proves it even more.
