 This is a fine CD from Saint Etienne, one of the most underrated, artistic and expressive pop groups out there.  This album, which came out only in Japan in 1997, shows the impressive versatilty of this band.  Sarah's voice doesn't get much better than this.  Even when she hums on "Shad Thames," it's sexy. The two-part "Down by the Sea" and "The Sea" is a hypnotic merger of simple lyrics and ethereal musical arrangements...a masterpiece in its own way.  "Lonesome" is the kind of song that when you hear it, you simply cannot understand why it wasn't a hit.  It has a kind of pop emotion.  And they cover a lesser known Gary Numan song, "Stormtrooper in Drag." Get out your dancing shoes for that one. Even the one minute long "Public Information Film" has a certain pleasantry about it. This includes "He's On the Phone," which is a fairly well-known song among the band's fans. I know the price may be a little steep for a CD but if you need to eat macaroni and cheese for a week to buy it...you should.  This is HIGHLY recommended listening.
