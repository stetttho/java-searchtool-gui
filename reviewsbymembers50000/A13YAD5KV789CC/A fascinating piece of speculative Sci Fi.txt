 Robert J. Sawyer's "Mindscan" tackles the human dream of immortality with a twist.  Think for a moment what you would do if you could upload your mind, your very being, into a durable, android-like body.  In Sawyer's futuristic world, the Immortex Company allows the wealthy to do that.  However, your human body is shipped to the dark side of the moon to live out your natural life in luxury.  When you die, your uploaded self can live on for an eternity back on earth.    Immortex doesn't bother with informing the uploaded copy that the real one has died. But due to a bizarre coincidence, the death of prominent writer Karen Bessarian (who uploaded her mind due to old age)is reported to her flesh and blood son, who didn't particular care for her uploaded form.  He forces the matter into Probate Court for the reading of the will.  The uploaded Karen says, "No way, I'm still alive" and the matter becomes what amounts to the trial of the 21st Century.  In the meantime Jake Sullivan uploads his mind because he had a rare, incurable disease.  Wouldn't you know it?  They find a cure and he demands to go back to Earth and continue his life but Immortex puts the kibosh on that idea.    Sawyer writes great Science Fiction and presents it in such a way that it sounds almost plausible.  His characters are real and believable.  His plots move along smoothly and are easy to read.  The trial scene is gripping.  It's no wonder that he has won Hugo's and Aurora's and has been nominated for Nebulas.  "Mindscan," which is actually an embellished version of his Analog short story "Shed Skin," fits right into the award-winning category.  Highly recommended.
