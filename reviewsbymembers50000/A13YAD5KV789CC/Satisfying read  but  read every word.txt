 I am pleased to be the first one to review the new book of fellow New Englander Allen Steele.  I enjoy time travel stories immensly, especially those that make sense.  This is a magnificent experiment in taking two parallel time streams and crashing them together in a creative, intriguing way.  Steele has essentially expanded upon his award-winning short story "Where Angels Fear To Tread" and given it a new beginning and a new ending.  It's not often that I read a book that has a cameo appearance...in this case it's the well reknowned writer/scientist Gregory Benford.  And fans of sci-fi magazines will like the many references to Analog Science Fiction/Fact magazine. But you MUST read this book from cover to cover to get all of your answers.  I was reading along for the first 100 or so pages and enjoying the story that was building.  Then suddenly the main character, David Zack Murphy, seems to develop all new characteristics.  At first I was shouting "What the...?"  But it was resolved in the end in a splendid fashion.  "Chronospace" is gripping and tough to put down.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because Mr. Steele needs to scold his editor over a couple of missing words and at least one punctuation mistake.  But if that's all I'm nit-picking about, that says a lot for the book and its story.
