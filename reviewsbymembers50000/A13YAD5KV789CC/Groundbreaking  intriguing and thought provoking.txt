 "Oswald Talked" is by far the best book on the subject of JFK's assassination that I have ever read and I have been reading exposes on it  for nearly thirty years. This book is extremely well researched and, while  it doesn't name anyone in particular as the actual shooter...it does make  some extremely enlightening and interesting connections between Oswald,  Ruby, gun-running, Anti-Castro groups and the FBI and CIA.  The LaFontaines  use ACTUAL, previously top secret documents as their evidence.  People who  criticize this book for not acquitting or accusing Oswald in JFK's  assassination are missing the point entirely.  This book isn't about  theories of hidden shooters in the grassy knoll, JFK's questionable autopsy  results, the Zapurder film and the unexplained deaths of key witnesses. To  me, this book opens discussion about previously overlooked theories and  sheds light on the Red paranoia that was sweeping the nation in the  volatile early 1960's and late 1950's. The book is more technical and  theoretical.  I don't think it was designed to solve the assassination but  instead, to make you think.  It also adds a touch of humor to break up the  onslaught of documents being seen, in many cases, for the first time.  I  firmly believe that many JFK conspiracy watchers were annoyed that those  millions of documents that were turned over to the Assassination committee  a few years back never came out and said Oswald did or didn't do it.  But  the LaFontaines are showing us that that information may be buried there  somewhere and they've begun to sift through everything to find out.  I'll  tell you, this book is over 450 pages and I read it in about two days...it  was so engrossing, exciting and explosive.
