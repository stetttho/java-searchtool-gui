 Saint Etienne proves once again that they are one of the most creative and talented bands on Earth.  Yet, they continue to be passed over by the public at large.  It's the kind of music that should be heard on a variety  of radio stations.  Sounds include pop, new age, alternative and even hints  of jazz.  But so few members of the mainstream public have ever heard of  them.  And it is a shame. This is a wonderful collection of melodies and  snippets.  The only flaw is that some of the pieces are too short.  Sarah  Cracknell's vocals are typically breathy and lovely.  The CD is a pleasant  experience overall even if you have never seen the film "The Misadventures  of Margaret."  I haven't seen it and it is quite easy to enjoy this CD.   Highly recommended.
