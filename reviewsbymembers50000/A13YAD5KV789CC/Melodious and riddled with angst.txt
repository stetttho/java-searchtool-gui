 June and the Exit Wounds are a band to watch. If you enjoy pleasant melodies with lyrics of love, lost love, unrequited love, sensual love...you get the picture?  Actually it's a little deeper than that. It's brilliant at times.  The vocal arrangements are harmonious.  Often the songs are reminiscent of the Beach Boys during their creative period (Pet Sounds/Smile).  This is particularly true with "Highway Noise" and "How Much I Really Loved You."  Occassionally they harmonize like Crosby, Stills, and Nash.  The main flaw with it is that it is sometiems redundant.  "Let's Shack Up Together," although a fine song, uses the exact same keyboard beat arangement as "Highway Noise." I like how it fades into the sunset with the closer "Idly By," a moody piece arranged around two guitar chords. But I really think this band has a great future. I look forward to hearing more from them.
