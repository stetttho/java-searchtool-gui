 If you are buying this CD, I suspect that you are probably one of 1% of all music listeners in the world who ever heard of this band and I don't need to tell you about this band.  But if you are one of the 99% who haven't heard of Telex, and you stumbled onto this page by accident - this review is for you.  Belgium-based Telex is one of maybe 4 or 5 music groups that planted the seeds of modern day electronica.  Until Telex came along in the late 70's and early 80's, most recordings with synthesisers/keyboards fell under the categories of space rock or prog-rock or were just filler/background for the guitars.  Sure Gary Wright was proud to tell the world that all of his musical sounds were created by keyboards.  But Telex took the keyboards, added a toe-tapping beat and a few quirky lyrics to create such early dance classics as "Moskow Diskow" and "Twist A Saint Tropez."  Both of those songs are in this affordable compilation.  They didn't have the visual (sort of glam) image of some of their contemporaries such as Visage or Human League.  They didn't experiment as much as some of their contemporaries like Ultravox and Depeche Mode.  They most definitely DID NOT have the production qualities of today's electronica.  You won't hear any heavy reverb, heavy compression, or bass-boosted electronic drumbeats on this CD.  You will hear a band that had a whole lot fun making music.  They didn't have much commercial success outside of the French speaking nations, which is why a majority of the songs on this CD are sung in French.  But there were a few English translations and some of those are here.  I have always liked Telex since I bought my first Telex album back in 1981.  I rate it a "4" because nothing is perfect.  There are a few slow moments.  I still prefer Plastic Bertrand's punk version of "Ca Plane Pour Moi" over this dreary slow version.  Still, I hope that you have fun listening to this.  I did.
