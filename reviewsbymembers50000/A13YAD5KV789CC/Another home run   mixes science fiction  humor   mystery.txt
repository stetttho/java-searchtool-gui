 I invite you to be amused and intrigued at the same time by reading Paul Levinson's new book "The Pixel Eye" featuring New York Forensic Detective Phil D'Amato.  It's a different world today than it was on September 10, 2001.  Paranoia runs deep in many of us and this book is a great book for the paranoid.   We have all seen squirrels running around the park collecting their nuts.  What would happen if those squirrels were fitted with a brain chip and could monitor our every move or get into the nooks and crannies of a major office complex or the heart of city government and set off bombs?  This brings a whole new dimension to the old adage "I wish I could be a fly on the wall." Levinson explores that possibility in a book that is a real page-turner. It is well-crafted.  You really don't know who the "bad guy" is until well toward the end.  There are suspects on every page.   When you read the first chapter, you can't help but to chuckle at the concept of missing squirrels and the importance that the New York police seem to have placed on this matter.  But as the tale unfolds, it becomes clear that something is terribly awry and it is up to Phil D'Amato to put the pieces together and resolve the issue.   We do learn who the culprit is by the end of the book, however it closes in such a way that a sequel seems almost guaranteed.  I enjoyed the book.  It entertained me.  There was an element of intrigue and it also made me laugh.  It made me speculate on all of the possibilities of bugged squirrels and rodents running around my back yard.
