 Frazier Chorus are pioneers in some respects.  They pioneered a kind of mellow sound that is often referred to as Dream Pop these days.  Except that Frazier Chorus would compose these wonderfully ethereal melodies while inserting lyrics about death, lousy relationships, and one night stands crooned almost in a whisper by lead singer Tim Freeman.  Ironic really.    "Ray" is very much like that.  Dreary or sex-obsessed topics put to chillingly beautiful melodies, probably played on keybaords but sounding like a chamber orchestra.  Still it's enjoyable in its own way.  The first time I heard Frazier Chorus was when they released "Sue" in '89.    That was one of my most favorite albums at the time.  "Ray" is very similar in sound and therefore is very easy to enjoy.  My favorites on this one are "All the Air" and "Prefer You Dead."    They are an acquired taste.
