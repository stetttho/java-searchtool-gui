 I have been a fan of Saint Etienne for a while.  "Interlude," is just that - an interlude between "Sound of Water" and the next album (hopefully there will be one).  This is really a collection of songs that were thrown onto CD singles over the last two or so years.  Most of them I have already heard.  It is nice to be able to get "Stevie" without having to go out and buy that Brian Wilson tribute CD. The remixes on "Lose That Girl" and "Boy is Crying" are also nice to have since I hadn't been able to find them prior to this.  It gets 4 stars from me, primarily because I think Saint Etienne are a great talent and highly underrated (and a good concert too).  But since I already have many of the songs, the lack of "new" material doesn't rate it a "5."  This is good for true fans only - it may not be the best one to start with if you're new to Saint Etienne's sound.
