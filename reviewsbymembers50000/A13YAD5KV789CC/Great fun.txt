 I read somewhere that Tony Mansfield was never as happy with this album as he was with the two later ones (Anywhere & Warp).  I don't know.  I have always liked this one.  i bought it back in '80 when it first came out and as soon as it became available on CD, I was one of the first in line to get it.  I like the beat, the catchy riffs, the hooks, and just the whole general feel of the album.  Technically it was a product of its time.  Today's electronic music has a certain "BIG" production sound about it.  If you're listening to this you might hear a weak spot here and there and some of the electronic sounds used are used more than once.  But just listen to the songs and you'll enjoy it.
