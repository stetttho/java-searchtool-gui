 I must agree with the other people who have offered reviews about this book.  If you have been teetering over the suicide/murder scenario since  that fateful day in August, 1962...then this book should put to rest any  questions you may have over how Marilyn Monrie died.  There is no question  in my mind that it was murder. It's right there in black and white and it  is totally infuriating that a new, honest investigation has never taken  place.  Wolfe thoroughly researched this with all resources he could get  his hands on.  It's disgusting that so much vital evidence has mysteriously  disappeared.  A new investigation needs to take place now.  We've already  lost some major witnesses over the years and survivors like Pat Newcomb and  Norman Jeffries won't live forever.  As far as the book itself.  It is hard  to put this book down. However, the only reason I don't rate it a  "5" is because a lot of pages are spent on Marilyn's life story.   I've read that all before.  But these new revelations from Jeffries cannot  be ignored.
