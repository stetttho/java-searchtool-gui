 If you're reading this review, you probably like science-fiction. But do you like mystery and court room drama too?  Then you will very much enjoy "Illegal Alien."  Sawyer takes a science-fiction concept and mingles it with a courtroom case.  This Canadian author has done his research on the US Justice system.  I felt that I was reading the transcripts from any one of the thousands of US court cases that occurs every day.  The book holds your interest and twists just enough at the end to satisfy your desire for a good whodunnit. Highly recomemnded for both sci-fi and mystery fans.
