 Fun, fun, fun.  Telex was a throughly unique band.  Think of Kraftwerk and the Human League meeting Maurice Chavalier.  I was pleased to find this in a relatively affordable CD.  I had their material (rare as it is) on vinyl, which I purchased during the early 1980's.  I was not aware of the French version of "B-Sides."  I only knew the English version.  That was a personal treat for me.  This has a lot of the band's secondary "hits," not that they were producing Top 10 tunes every three months when they were together.  It doesn't have their better known "Moscow Discow" or "Twist A Saint Tropez."  But the selections here are definitive Telex.
