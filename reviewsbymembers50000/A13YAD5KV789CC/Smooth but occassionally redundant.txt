 I have been a longtime fan of Saint Etienne and it was recommended that I check out Ivy.  So I did.  This is an extremely pleasant pop album with  catchy songs.  As I heard each song I would think to myself, "Isn't  that nice."  Next one, "Isn't that nice."  Next one  "Isn't that nice."  But in a way the songs all sounded the same,  albeit very nice.  Dominique Durand sings like she looks, sultry. Yet her  vocal range seems a little limited compared to Saint Etienne's Sarah  Cracknell and The Sundays' Harriet Wheeler. It is missing something.  Standout cuts were "The Best Thing," "I've Got A  Feeling" and "Baker." However I was still impressed enough  to place an order with Amazon.com for their 1994 release  "Realistic." I'm anxious to hear more of their material and  perhaps my opinions will change.
