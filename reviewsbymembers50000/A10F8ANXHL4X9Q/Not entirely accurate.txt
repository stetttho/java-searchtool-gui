 The trouble with scholars and academics is their middle-class presumption that the world is middle-class.  This book suffers from this presumption. I married a Cuban, have been to Cuba five times, and know that there are both rich and poor in that country--just as there are in the U.S.  There are Cubans in government and baseball stars and artists with access to dollars who are chauffered in their Benzes, live in gated mansions with electric fences, and swim in their backyard pools.  In the meantime, my relatives live without running water or a phone.  They have an extension cord leading from the neighbor's house to get electricity.  When the annual hurricane hits, they live in the local secondary school's gymnasium, along with everyone else in their neighborhood in Cerro who lives in a plywood house. Let's decide not to idealize the Revolution. I'm not on the side of the anti-Castro supporters in Miami (I'm not Cuban)--I think free quality healthcare and education is an amazing achievement.  And despite the last ten years of intense lack of material help since the Soviet Union dissolved, Cubans have an amazing stamina and love of life that gives them the hope to survive. But let's not--especially for the academics who travel to Cuba and see only the middle class Cubans living there--idealize the country.  Reader:  check out "Afro-Cuban Voices" to get another side of the story.
