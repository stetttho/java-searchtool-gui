 In Chamberlain's use of ethnographic narratives, she shows how her informants reveal a deep attachment to the idea of "place," through one's familial ties, through relationships and kin systems, and through an extended sense of "belonging."  For women, the impact has been doubly hard-leaving the homeland requires leaving connections to children, parents, and loved ones that the "solitary, single male" migrant does not face:  "Women's migration was likely to be a more permanent, more searing experience for those left behind..." (p. 104).  For both women and men, however, "the decision to go, the logistics of leaving were not isolated, individual events but the result of collective action.  The family, for instance, through loans, through material support, through child care, enabled and supported the migration of its individual members" (p. 93).  This community support allowed for a strengthening of the ties to the home community and the expectation of "return."  But "return" carries with it the expectation of "success"  for the individual and the community. The economic pressures of migration, the revision of concepts of kin, identity (individual and communal, national and racial), and the reevaluation of situations in which Caribbean persons feel a sense of "belonging," need to be bound within all anthropological discourse about "place."  The work of Chamberlain goes a long way toward a reexamination of these issues and contribute to a deeper understanding of how Caribbeans see themselves in the world.
