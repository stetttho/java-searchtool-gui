 OK, let's pretend for a second that you had never heard Latin Jazz before.  Perhaps you're from Mars, or you were born in the late 80's, or you live in the rural U.S. and don't have a satellite hook-up.   Well, get ready, because this is going to blow you away! This is the good stuff-the best of the very best of Latin Jazz, from the roots.  Although it skips around radically between very different styles, all the music is outstanding.  The narration is very understated (at times I wish there was more of a historical perspective, or interviews with some of the artists to explain more of their backgrounds).  But the subtlety of this film makes you hold your breath at times.   My only complaint (and why I can't make it a perfect score) is the director's decisions on cuts--a musician just wants more of the music.  You just want to the camera to linger one more moment on Elaine Elias' hands, not her face.  You want to see Cachao do that run in close-up.  You want to see Puntilla's group perform a few more numbers--and this time don't cut away during the solos. All in all, this video is superb, and all I can say is there is nothing like it.  This is what Buena Vista Social Club SHOULD have been, times 10. Get it--you'll love it, and like me, watch it over and over.
