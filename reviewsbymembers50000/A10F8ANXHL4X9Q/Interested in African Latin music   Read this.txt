 This book needed to be written.  It is the story of Afro-Cuban musicians in the pre-revolutionary atmosphere of commercialism and imperialism from the US.  Part of the story revolves around the racism of that era, which existed as well in the genres of big band and jazz.  And part of the story revolves around the music of that time period--some of the richest and most complex in Latin American history.  If you want to understand the use of African cultural identifications in popular music, this is a good place to start.  It fills in some of the history which led up to the Buena Vista Social Club phenomenon today.
