 Marshall's strength as an author of fiction lies in her ability to write rich, detailed characterizations.  Throughout "The Chosen Place, the Timeless People," the variety of ages, races, class identities, and cultural backgrounds is woven into a fascinating narrative about a fictional Caribbean island in the early throes of multi-national post-industrial capitalism.  How the characters react to these outside influences of globalization on them is the focus of the struggles: in their interpersonal relationships, in their determination to remember and re-enact the history of oppression and liberation from slavery, and in the larger struggles between nations and nationality.  As a metaphor for colonialism, this book is stunning.  Harriet, the American woman who finds herself so out of place in the West Indian world, so unable to understand the "laws" by which this world operates (as seen in the arrogance she displays by taking the eggs meant for trading and making omelets for the children, which go uneaten), gets swept away by the force of a carnival crowd.  She feels the power and feels the fear of that power as she falls to the ground.  Without understanding, she watches the recreation of the past and senses its full force, then becomes overwhelmed by it-but she is unable to comprehend it or stop it.  This representation of the local history is too much for the American to take in, and she is ultimately undone by its power.  Although she never understands why, the force of this collective memory changes her life forever, and her incapacity to understand it forces her to her final end.
