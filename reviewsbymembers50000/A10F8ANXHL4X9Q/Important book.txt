 This is an excellent book for understanding the present "state" (no pun intended) of the world.  Why is the globe chopped up into these seemingly arbitrary political units?, is Anderson's question.  How can one make sense of nationalism and its development throughout the world in the last few hundred years? Anderson's reliance on "print capitalism" and the literate class (elite and educated bourgeois) as the predominant community to imagine itself seems limited to me.  The politically dominant group's use of nationalism as a reinforcement of power structures, or in order to re-form power structures in the case of revolution and resistance, in Anderson's argument, developed through a widespread choice of language and access to information within that language group.  Religious affiliations, and ethnic communities shaped not only through spoken/written languages in the pre-capitalist period were gradually replaced by nationalistic groups developed through colonialist projects.  If you read this book, you will open your eyes to the present reality of nationalism, which is now being contradicted by the rise of super-national constituencies based on religious affiliation.  Almost a step backward to feudalism, and I await Anderson's next book and some illuminating theory on recent world conflicts.
