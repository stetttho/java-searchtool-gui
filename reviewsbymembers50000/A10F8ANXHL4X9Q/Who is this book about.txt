 I read as much as I can about the religion of Lucumi/santeria because I believe it has much to offer.  Its music is deeply healing, and the understanding of what the orishas can do for their children in this world is comforting. I am also an "omo a" (a drummer who is initiated to play for rituals). I have been to Havana five times.      I bought this book expecting to learn something about the music and Cuban people.  However, I am afraid the title of this book may mislead people into buying it for its information.      This book by Katherine J Hagedorn is not a book about the religion.  It is a way for her to drop names of musicians she knows and friends of hers--and present her own views of the way these people perceive their religion.  I was upset by the book because I am afraid that people may be misled into thinking the book is valuable when in fact it is just about Hagedorn.      If you want to know more about this author and her strange ways of incorporating someone else's religion into her academic career, buy this book.  If you want to learn about the religion and the Cubans who practice the religion of their ancestors, buy a book by Raul Canizares or Joseph M. Murphy.  If you want to know about the music, it is more instructive to buy Robin Moore's book "Nationalizing Blackness"--you will learn more about the history and people without wasting your time with someone trying to impress you with her name-dropping.      The publisher should release the CD without the book, because the CD is the only valuable part.  The musicians are playing the music with a lot of "bomba" (heart) and it's too bad this author doesn't discuss the music in any context except to talk about herself.
