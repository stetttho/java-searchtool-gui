 This video documentary of musicians and dancers in Cuba includes so many aspects of daily life, conversation, religion, rehearsals, and performances.  I would recommend this to anyone who is seriously interested in learning about Afro-Cuban music.  One of the rare things about this video is that it lets the musicians and dancers talk about themselves in their own words, and therefore you get a more realistic view of their lives.  It's fascinating to see how people live and interact with eachother.  Because several of the people filmed are no longer alive, this is even more valuable as a document of historical importance.
