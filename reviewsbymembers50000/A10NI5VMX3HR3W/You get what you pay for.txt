 The only reason I bought this was because it only cost $16.99 with my Gold Box coupon.  I was really excited to get it, but I was disappointed.  It's REALLY loud and there's all this hot air blowing out of the sides (which would normally fill a vacuum bag in a different vacuum).  Since it's a handheld vacuum, your head is pretty close to the vacuum and I found myself hurrying to finish vacuuming because I couldn't take the noise anymore.  And it heats up really quickly, making it uncomfortable to handle. It IS powerful, but the suction surface area of the attachments is so small, that it's only good for "quick pick-ups", not large areas, like an area rug, which takes a long time.  Hair tends to get stuck in it and it was easier for me to get it off the rug by hand.  I wish I could return it, but the shipping would cost almost as much as the product, thus it's not worth it.  I will not be throwing away my old hand vac.  I'll save this for cleaning the car out, as the attachments allow easy clean-up of small corners and seats.
