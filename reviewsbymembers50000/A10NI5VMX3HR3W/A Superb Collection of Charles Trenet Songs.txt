 Although it took a few weeks for Amazon.com to obtain this album, it was worth the wait.  The songs selected (all pre-WWII) fit perfectly within the "Cocktail Hour" series' theme.  All the songs are short and cheerful, putting a smile on your face when you listen.  You can tell that Trenet is having fun while singing them.  If you are interested in the French lyrics, do a google search for "paroles des chansons de Charles Trenet" and you'll find all of the songs in this album.  I am very happy with this purchase.
