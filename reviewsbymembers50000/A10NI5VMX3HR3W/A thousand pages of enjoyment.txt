 Although this book may seem intimidating due to its length, it kept me entertained the whole time. I am a huge Jane Austen fan, and I had also read Burney's Evelina. After reading Camilla, I have found an author that I enjoy as much as Jane Austen: Fanny Burney.  Burney's works seem neglected by Hollywood; while reading this novel, I kept imagining what a great role some of the characters would provide for a movie. (However, I couldn't think of one scene which I wouldn't be disappointed to have left out in a screenplay of normal length.) Camilla's uncle (Sir Hugh Tyrold), her brother Lionel, and various suitors actually had me laughing out loud. This book is 1000 pages entirely composed of "the good parts" of Jane Austen's novels. I felt like I was there in the world of Camilla. I cringed everytime Camilla did something that Edgar, her love interest, interpreted in the wrong way. It was almost painful, and I could sympathize. It is a great novel which should be a part of the library of any fan of Austen or 18th century literature.
