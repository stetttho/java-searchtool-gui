 This is a very suspenseful book---each chapter ends with a surprise.  The title of the book says it all "a long fatal love chase."  It is full of twists and turns and you'll be finished reading it in a day or two because the adventure never slows down.  Not what I typically think of for a Louis May Alcott book... as this was much more fast-pased.  However, never predictable at all... even to the last page!
