 Well, as with Burney's other novels, don't let the length scare you.  The focus of this book is centered on "female difficulties" as the subtitle indicates, rather than a romantic relationship which many Jane Austen fans might be looking for.  The romance is definitely there, so don't worry, but the more interesting part of the book is the interplay between one woman, an Incognito, and the people she encounters and must depend on for her survival.  The prejudices she encounters and the female snobbery and male disrespect keep the plot relevant to modern readers' interests.  It is really a travel/adventure story about a woman who starts out with nothing (in order to hide herself from danger) and runs into various people and mini-plots along the way. There are a few length philosophical debates between some of the characters at some parts of the book, but they don't weigh down the light style of the rest of the novel.  This book really made me think about how others perceive a person and how their opinions, unfortunately, are often based solely upon reputation and prejudices.
