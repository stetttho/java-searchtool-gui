 From the very start of this novel, you know that you're not going to like Lizzie (Lady Eustace), the main character.  She's one of those women who does ANYthing she can to get her way...and she'll be damned if she doesn't get it.  She can flirt, act sweet and innocent, step on other women's toes, turn on her tears in a timely manner...and all of the men are just bending over backwards to help her. She was born with nothing, and she's going to get what she wants in life.  She starts out by getting herself a rich husband who will conveniently die right away and leave his riches and jewels to her.  But, wait, did he "correct" his will in the exact manner Lizzie wanted before he died?  Well, it doesn't matter, she'll get what she wants (the Eustace diamonds) in another manner---wear them around and refuse to take them off! It's difficult to contradict this extremely clever woman, but she has enemies who are certainly going to try.  Some of her "tricks" to get her way just want to make you scream--she can be SO cruel and heartless. This novel is a battle of wills...a woman and her enemies. You don't have to like her, but you must admit she's on a higher playing field than everyone else...and she should at least get credit for her effort and her cleverness!  Everyone knows a woman like Lady Eustace and hopes she gets what she deserves.  This book will show you if she does.  It's very long, but the political plots that are a part of the other books in this series are left out and make for an entertaining, can't-put-it-down read.
