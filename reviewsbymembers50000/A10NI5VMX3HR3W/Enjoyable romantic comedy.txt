 Jennifer Lopez's character is hard not to like.  She seems so lonely, yet she is not bitter.  Instead, she makes it her career to bring couples to the altar.  Watching her struggle as a woman in love with a client and choosing between her career and love makes this movie truly enjoyable. While this movie is not going to be an award winning film, it provides everything that a fan of romantic comedies desires: a happy ending and a lighthearted story with many laughs. The DVD also includes some deleted scenes which were very interesting to a person who has already seen the movie and just wants more.
