 I truly enjoyed watching all 5 hours of this BBC adaptation of Vanity Fair.  I found it as humorous as the original novel was intended to be.  While some parts of the story are necessarily left out of this miniseries, I couldn't really complain.  The casting was excellent and I found myself laughing out loud at times.  Although some have complained about the soundtrack, I found it only added to my enjoyment.   It was a great story, and a great film, and I highly recommend it to fans of this genre.
