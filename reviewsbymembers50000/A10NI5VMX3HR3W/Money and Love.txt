 As a fan of Jane Austen, and now Fanny Burney, I had high expectations for this novel.  The only reason why I don't give it 5 stars is that it wasn't my favorite Burney novel....and I was expecting a pure love story.  The love story part of the book is good, but it is not as satisfying as the deep romance between Lizzie Bennet and Mr. Darcy... or even that of Camilla and Edgar in Burney's Camilla.  However, the plot is very interesting as it taught me a lot about money in this time period (making other novels of this time more easily understood). The footnotes in this edition, while frequent, are very helpful and informative.  I finally have some grasp of the value of each type of coin that is mentioned in all of these types of novels.  And MONEY is central to this book, more so than love, I think.  It is a story about those who have it, those who want it, those who steal it, those who abuse it, and those who are willing to give it all away.  This is all very interesting and tied up with a love story, but don't expect it to be a pure romance like Camilla. It is a great novel, but for a change, Burney decides not to give her readers the perfect sweet and sappy plot that we take for granted.
