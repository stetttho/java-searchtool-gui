 I chose to buy this CD because I was looking for a good collection of and introduction to French musicians (past and present).  A major attraction of this album is the lengthy, detailed booklet it comes with that tells about each group or singer on the album and gives a rough translation of the lyrics in English.  (Note: a complete translation in English is not provided, just a few lines)  Summaries of the songs' subjects in English are provided, though.  If you understand/can translate French, I highly recommend reading the lyrics because it just adds another dimension of enjoyment and appreciation of the songs. I was able to find the French lyrics to all of the songs, except for the last song, on www.paroles.net.   While it is true that this album is most likely not an accurate representation of the music playing at French cafes today, it is still a great collection and introduction to some great French artists.  I will definitely be looking into buying the albums of some of the groups/singers on this CD.  The music is jazzy, light-hearted, and relaxing and has been playing and replaying in my stereo for days.
