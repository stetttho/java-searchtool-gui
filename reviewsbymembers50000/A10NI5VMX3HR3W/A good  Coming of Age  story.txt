 This is the story of Ormond, an orphan who is raised and influenced by several very different men.  It is a reflective story, but not a slow-read.  You learn how Ormond chooses his values and learns how to judge people based upon his own opinions and beliefs, not what others try to tell him.  It is a good novel, worth reading, not necessarily a great "adventure" but more a life story about how a young boy grows up and becomes a man---one with morals, when those around him sometimes lack all morality.
