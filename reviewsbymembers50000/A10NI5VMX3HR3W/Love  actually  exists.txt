 This movie comes as advertised---it's a feel-good movie about love and the fact that is is "all around" wherever you look, not just in the movies or in novels.  It's one of those movies that has about 10 different storylines going on in a large community of people, loosely connected to one another.  Each story is unique and entertaining.  The movie is long...over two hours, but if you like it, there's more than a half hour of deleted scenes, with director commentary, provided on the DVD version.  I watched the whole thing.  There is a great cast in this movie and the message is very simple...love exists if you just look around you and are willing to see it.  This movie leaves you with the feeling that you are going to fall in love tomorrow!
