 I am a huge fan of the original Earthsea Trilogy.  The world Le Guin has created is so intriguing and it seems that she could tell an endless number of entertaining stories about Earthsea.  When I got this book, I was really just hungry for more stories of Ged or more tales of heroes---the greatest wizard ever, the powerful wizard who defeated an enemy no one else could defeat, or the greatest "whatever" in Earthsea.  It was those kinds of exciting feats and heroes that I was looking forward to reading more about.   However, it seems that Le Guin had a different focus which began with Tehanu and continues in Tales from Earthsea...an extremely feminist approach.  I agree with another reviewer who says he can't help feeling that maybe Le Guin didn't like the original trilogy and that she seems to undo everything by making women responsible for Roke, etc. and she downplays the feats of the male heroes told previously. Of course, there can and should be room for the female heroines of Earthsea, but why did they have to take away from the male heroes, the great wizards?  Le Guin even has same-sex marriages between women as a part of Earthsea life.  Was this necessary? No, but it certainly fits well with her new feminist look at Earthsea.   The Tales are still well-told and entertaining because Le Guin is a wonderful writer.  However, I guess that I am just nostalgic for the amazing feats and heroic adventures found in the first three books...and I was disappointed to find so little of that kind of story in this collection.  The inclusion of women and their importance is also great to read, but this didn't need to come at the expense of the male part of the world of Earthsea.  It was an imaginary world to begin with, and never offensive to women---sometimes it's nice to read a book that is not overly politically correct.
