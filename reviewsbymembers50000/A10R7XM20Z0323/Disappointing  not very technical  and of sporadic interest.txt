 After reading the other reviews of this book, I expected to find a light read more likened to "America's Most Shocking Police Videos", but I was mostly disappointed. The first series of articles on the Denver  airport  debacle (reportedly they set out to build the largest airport in  the country but ended up with second-largest airport in Denver) made  virtually no reference to software. The contractors of the baggage system  ran into problems with physical access to the terminal, changing  requirements, and uncooperative City officials, but they didn't discuss the  software issues much. It was a typical political mess. The story behind  the FAA's failed air-traffic-control system was the most interesting  technically, and the failed New Jersey DMV project was enlightening about  using the wrong tool for the job. The story on the failed California DMV  system is *two pages* long, and they mention "unspecified software  problems" as being involved. The story about the Adidas warehousing  software failure was three pages long, and I did not find a single lesson  to take from it. These do not look like any inside information to  me. This book was a fairly enjoyable four-hour read (really!) but it was  not worth the $30 I spent on it. Borrow it from the library or a friend  before spending yours.
