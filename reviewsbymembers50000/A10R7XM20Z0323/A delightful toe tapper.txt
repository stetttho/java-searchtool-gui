 I first heard the New England Ragtime Ensemble on PBS many years ago, and the wonderful sounds from these talented musicians has stuck in my head ever since. The 17 tracks on this album are generally quite up-tempo,  though the "slower" songs certainly wouldn't qualify as ballad  (and hence would not be ragtime). I was surprised to find any ragtime  collection that does not include Joplin's "The Entertainer", but  they have clearly not been wanting for good material to fill a CD -- every  one is a winner. My favorites are Rob Carriker's "Matapan Rag"  and a delightful (non-piano!) arrangement of "Dizzy  Fingers". Any fan of ragtime will love this album. I did.
