 As one would expect from Dr. Sowell's works, this one contains an extraordinary amount of research. Most of the political arguments in the United States center around preferences for minorities, and it seems that  many of the proponents feel that this is somehow a uniquely American  phenomenon. It is anything but. What is surprising is the variety of  preferences found worldwide. It is probably assumed that preferences are  only applied to minorities, but Dr. Sowell details other  "versions" of preferences, such as Malaysia's official  preferences for the majority members of the population intended to reduce  the impact of the Chinese minority. One would think that people would  learn from the lessons of experiences all over the world, but one would  never know this without such a well-researched exposition as _Preferential  Policies_. Really, a fascinating read (or listen, if you get the  unabridged book on tape as I did). It always amazes me how interesting  Thomas Sowell makes a potentiall dry subject. Also good reading: Ethnic  America.
