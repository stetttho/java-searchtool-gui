 Actually, zero stars I had high expectations for this book but was utterly disappointed. This book has not had even elementary copy editing performed -- I found *hundreds* of typographical and technical errors -- and the writing style had short, simple sentences that was maddening to read when compared to the wonderful writing of (say) Stroustrup. The authors have chosen a graphical model to represent class hierarchies that I have not seen before and found very hard to visualize, and their "introduction" to inheritance and class construction was disorganized and confusing (a new C++ user would be lost). Their description of manipulators was cursory and disappointing, and their real examples later in the book didn't seem to use any extended ones. Some of their code examples have merit -- notably communications ports -- but the technical material surrounding the code was bug-ridden (all the the RS-232 diagrams had mistakes, for instance). The Stroustrup *chapter* on iostreams was much better than this whole book, so I cannot recommend this book to anybody. I'll be sending mine to the authors with my markups in the hope they fix the bugs, but even without the bugs it was a terrible book.
