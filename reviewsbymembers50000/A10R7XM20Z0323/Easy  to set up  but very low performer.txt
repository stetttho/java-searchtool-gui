 This unit took nearly no time to set up: the DHCP server on the network gave it an address instantly. It happily supports JetDirect (port 9100/tcp) printing, but performance is lousy. Even on a 100mbit network, it did no better than 58kbytes/second throughput measured during careful tests. Our application included >22 megabyte image files to a color printer. For low-volume printouts (say, text reports from an accounting system), this looks like a winner, but for anything requiring any real throughput, it's not going to be too useful. The same image that took two and a half minutes using this device took eleven seconds to a real HP LaserJet 4100 printer.
