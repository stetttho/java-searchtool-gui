 These two cassettes are not a Reader's Digest version of biology: this is very intense coverage of the innermost workings of the cell. The material starts with electron valence and moves up from there, and it moves VERY  fast. Clearly this is not intended as the first learning source for this  material, but it probably would be fantastic review for those who learned  it elsewhere and are cramming for a test. This receives only four stars  not for content but for the media itself: this is just not the best way to  learn this topic. It's hard to visualize (say) chains of hydrocarbons from  a verbal description, so pictures in the companion text (ISBN 1884612016)  would probably be a welcome addition. Mine is on order. I must say I  learned a lot from these tapes, and I will surely listen to them again, but  it was quite exhausting.
