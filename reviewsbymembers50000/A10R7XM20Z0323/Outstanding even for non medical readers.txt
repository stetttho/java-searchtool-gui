 What a wonderful book. I am not a health-care professional -- just a layman -- but this book is positively captivating. I was able to use Dr. Netter's crystal-clear illustrations to understand a shoulder injury, and  while there is virtually no descriptive text other than the labelling of  the body parts (it's an atlas, not an anatomy book), there is much here to  learn from. Every medical professional I've spoken with knows Dr. Frank  Netter's work, and it's great that he now has a single volume available to  the layman.
