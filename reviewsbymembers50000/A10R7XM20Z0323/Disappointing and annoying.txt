 The feature set of this phone looked fantastic, but it's been a source of constant annoyance in our house. As other reviews mentioned, the "hold" feature is extremely inflexible, and we've had to reset the entire base unit to have it "let go" of a call on hold. More than once. The handset itself is exceptionally uncomfortable and nearly impossible to hold with just your shoulder and chin. The belt clip is well done and helpful. Even with a full charge, we routinely get the "out of range" beeps ten feet from the base. This is particularly annoying since the call itself never cuts out anywhere inside the house. The caller-ID feature is well done and *extremely* helpful. The menus and navigation work pretty well. The uncomfortable handset and annoying hold/transfer arrangements make this an extremely annoying phone, but not quite enough to have returned it. We've not found another two-line phone that works this well (with the remote bases), but for a one-line phone this is at the bottom of the list with very few redeeming qualities.
