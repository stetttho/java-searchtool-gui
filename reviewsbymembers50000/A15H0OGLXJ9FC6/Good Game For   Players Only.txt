 When I first played Deluxe Sequence, I loved it, even though I lost the game.  :)  The REASON I loved it was that I was playing against only ONE other opponent.  And that's why I give Deluxe Sequence (or any version of Sequence) only 2 stars, because the game insists (and even includes a third set of chips for a third player or team) that the game is fun for 2 or MORE players or teams (up to THREE).  But this just isn't so.  False advertising was never falser!  Try playing Sequence with a total of 3 players or teams, and inevitably, you will run out of board spaces WELL before any of the 3 players (or teams) obtains 2 sequences (the winning combination).  And thus, games involving 3 opponents end in stalemates, 99.9% of the time.  This has been my experience, 99.9% of the time.  But don't take my word for it.  If you doubt me, find out for yourself.  But don't say I did not warn you.  So if Sequence (Deluxe or otherwise) were to REDUCE their chipset to simply red and blue (scrap the green) and advertise the game as a 2-player or 2-team competition, I would give Sequence 4 stars, perhaps even 5.  But this is NOT a 3-opponent game whatsoever, and touting it as such is tomfoolery at least, (...) at most.  Because when ANY game is forced to end in stalemate "like clockwork" every time 3 players (or teams) sit down to a "friendly competition," this is no recipe for fun, but a waste of everyone's time, and nothing but an exercise in frustration.  Enough to cause this "third player" to exclaim, "Sequence sux!"
