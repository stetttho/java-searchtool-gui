 This double-CD collection is definitely worth the price (your valuable "bread," that is).  Production quality is superb, magnificent. This is one of those collections where you just have to say, "Yes!   Yes!  Yes!"   Every Bread or David Gates song your heart could  conceivably desire is on here, my audiophile friend, fan and lover, and  everything sounds Top-Drawer!  Clear, Crystal, Beautiful, Brilliant, Warm,  Excellent.  I'm very glad I bought this labor-of-love anthology, and I  think You, Gentle Listener, will be as well.  Nothing but Extremely High  Kudos for "Bread Retrospective."  Plus this compilation includes  a very-well crafted 29-page booklet of great pictures, Bread lore, history  and stories.  Enjoy immensely.
