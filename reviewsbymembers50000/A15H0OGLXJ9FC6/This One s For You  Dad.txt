 "Peter's Trip," "Green and Gold," "Psyche Soap," "Synesthesia" and "Senior Citizen" in priceless digital recreation!  These are outstanding songs in my estimation  (however biased by the sirens of nostalgia), and this CD is a welcome  "replacement" for my extremely weathered original vinyl LP, which  I'll surely never throw away (a gift from my late father, a Communications  Professor, in 1968) but have trouble enjoying fully these days from the  vantage point of an audiophile.  Now I've got the CD!  And the sound  quality is quite decent!  Whoopee!!!  My only question is, "What the  heck happened to the rest of the original soundtrack?"  There were a  bunch more tracks (whose titles elude me now in a green and gold haze (I  think one of them was called "Peter Flips Out")), yet this CD  runs only about 26 minutes!  Maybe the other tracks didn't survive the test  of time (or acid?) so well.  In any event, I love what DID make it from  Peter's Trip in psychedelic '67 to present day.  There's magic here, and  you've conjured the spirit of My Dad better than any other medium might.   Thank you from the bottom of my purple, pleased heart.
