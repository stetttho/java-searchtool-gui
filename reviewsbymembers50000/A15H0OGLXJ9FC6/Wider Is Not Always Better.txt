 This review is much more about the crummy VHS "wide screen" format of this film than the movie itself.  Unfortunately I never got to enjoy this piece on the silver screen; I wish I had.  In VHS it's  frustratingly painful.  What seems like the top fifth and the bottom fifth  of my TV screen go unused; blacked out; wasted.  Of course this is  ostensibly the bane of converting (i.e., cropping) 70mm film down to VHS.   Yet if the bottom fifth of my screen could have been adapted somehow to  accommodate the subtitles (instead of these cluttering up the remaining,  already hypercompressed 3-fifths of the screen) that would have been  perhaps at least partially redemptive.  As it stands however "Happy  Together" on VHS won't make any viewer too happy. Concerning the  plot itself of the film now, if you're looking for a deeply moving gay love  story, I never quite felt it here.  There's precious little passion or  compassion evinced betwixt our primary protagonists.  The far-too-fleet,  almost token love-making scene in the beginning of the film leaves us  begging for much, much more which alas, never comes to pass.  Too bad.  Or  maybe I was just so bummed out by the VHS problem to enjoy "Happy  Together" in a manner it more fittingly deserves.  Is it possible the  DVD-formatted version isn't fraught with such shortcomings as I've  described?  One can only hope so.
