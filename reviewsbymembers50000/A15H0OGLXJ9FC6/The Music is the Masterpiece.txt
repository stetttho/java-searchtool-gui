 For all you can say about John Carpenter films, and there is much to be said admittedly, one factor which seems to be overlooked time and again is John's personal soundtrack (in coordination with Alan Howarth on some films) he creates out of synthesizer keyboard for (practically) every film he's ever created.  The best example is "Halloween."  Without John's soundtrack, this film never would have become the classic it did.  The music made the visuals.  A synergy was created between sight and sound, and sound trumped sight wherever necessary, and complemented it at the appropriate frisson moments.  Owning John Carpenter soundtracks is like owning a Halloween Bonanza.  John's simple, straightforward approach to the keyboard, with punctuated motifs and repetition of terribly haunting riffs, is akin to the way Stanley Kubrick uses sound, sparingly but overpoweringly.  Whereas Kubrick relied on the genius of Carlos, John Carpenter's journeyman's handicraft with the synth is MORE THAN SUFFICIENT to drive every film he's ever crafted, from "Halloween," to "The Fog," "Escape from New York," "The Thing" to "Prince of Darkness."  There's something organic and alive in John's music, and whatever it is living within it, "benign" is not the adjective I would use to describe the inhabitant.  Take in Carpenter movies for the soundtracks alone.  And then let the music move you, to a place sepulchral, shocking, and deathly terrifying.  "The Fog" is a prime, perfect example of "the sounds ghosts make."  Listen to this movie, and allow "all that we see or seem, to [echo] a dream within a dream."  Or in this case, a lingering nightmare.  Listen.
