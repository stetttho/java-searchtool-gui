 Benighted as this might sound, the first song I ever listened to in stereo on Sennheiser headsets was "Can't Let A Woman" by Ambrosia.  Yup, on a 10-watt Realistic receiver in 1976 no less.  I was 10 years'  old. Albeit it this was a life-changing experience.  The idea, nay the  technology, of stereo had been around a lot longer by 1976 than I had of  course, but for me it was the sensorial equivalent of enjoying BC bud for  the very first time.  I forgot all my life traumas up until that kismetic  moment in November and entered unqualifiedly into the Elysian Fields for an  aboriginal, out-of-body, mind-expanding, spirit-melding, soul-healing  experience. Ambrosia is just that, my dearest audiophiliacs, an elixir  for the senses, an emollient for the lifestuff.  This CD does justice to my  weathered pyrimidical foldout LP, worn but not forgotten, enabling me to  more effectively relish a perfectionist's oeuvre of musicalities I might  otherwise have only to deal with in a frustratingly scratchifasic,  timeworn, spaceshaven, effaced milieu.  God Bless Digital Media! Get  "Somewhere I've Never Travelled" by Ambrosia, my Gentlest  Listener.  On CD it's scratchless and flawless.  Pure without being  puritanical.  So salvific.  Good enough for this sound junkie, minus the  foldout pyramid.  You won't miss it.  Get it.
