 Except for a rather infuriating problem with the mix of "Suicide is Painless," this is a fine album, which is a little like saying, "besides that, Mrs. Lincoln, how did you enjoy the show?"  The  recorded volume level drops out dramatically about midway in the opening  track... jeesh! I bought this album specifically for that one outstanding  and memorable song.  Everything else on this album sounds satisfactory, but  after the major production-value disappointment of Track 1, how can the  listener feel anything but cheated?
