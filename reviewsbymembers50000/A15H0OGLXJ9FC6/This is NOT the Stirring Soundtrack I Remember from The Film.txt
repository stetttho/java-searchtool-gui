 Track #12 on this album, "An American Symphony (Mr. Holland's Opus)," which was the resounding, resonating and shivers-up-the-spine-sending capstone of a very heartfelt and moving piece  of cinema eponymously titled, doesn't move the listener at all here, except  to thrash himself vigorously for tossing his dinero away foolishly; is this  really the ORIGINAL soundtrack from the ORIGINAL film?  The answer alas can  only truthfully be "NO.  NO.  NO."  This isn't the original  filmtrack at all (at least not from the film I enjoyed at the theatre in  1996); not the same mix; here we have, at best, "Mr. Holland's Opus  Manque."  Sorry, gentle listener-- This recording is bogus,  lackluster, jejune, muddy and muddled, inauthentic, a big mistake to  purchase.  Who produced this deceptive, uninspired spool o' dreck?  Mr.  Holland himself would be mortified.  (Track #12 honestly sounds like it was  mixed in a coffee can.)  Don't make the same mistake I did, fellow  audiophile; My advice:  Rent the wonderful movie on videotape or DVD and  record the soundtrack you desire off of THAT.  Don't buy this miserable  knockoff, unless you have an inescapable urge to be sonically chagrined.
