 The original "Creepshow" with its immense all-star cast is a seminal, campy, highly energized and creative sendup of the comic horror genre, a gem of a hybrid piece wrought out of a labour of true love for mixing media molecules.  Inspired, nonpareil fun. This "sequel" is anything BUT true to the original, and owes more to "Friday the 13th" sophomoric cinematic sensibilities than anything remotely redeemable horrifically.  C2 does to C1 what "Aliens" (Cameron's unsubtle sequel) did to Ridley Scott's artful, original "Alien," or what Hollywood's "Point of No Return" did to France's "La Femme Nikita."  In a word-- "massacres" the muse. As bad or worse as C2 is than even something as atrocious as "Exorcist 2" (hard to imagine anything much worse than this shy of "Plan 9 from..."), I came away from the cinema feeling much less certain of the continuing genius of even horror master mavin effects magician himself, Tom Savini.  Which isn't really fair to blame Savini for any of this dreck.  Nobody could've probably saved C2.  It rightfully belongs where it began no doubt, strewn on the editing room floor, rather than in the hands of you the buyer. Lack of inspiration speaks for itself.  C2 ranks right down there with a "raft" of other decidedly unKingly cinematic forays, including but not limited to "Maximum OverDrive," "Children of the Corn," "Pet Sematary," "Christine," and "Graveyard Shift."  Not that King himself necessarily had anything to do with some of this dross.  Yet we've come and known to expect GREATER things from "our King" and his consorts like the usually incomparable George Romero, yet sometimes, as is the case unfortunately here, "le roi est mort."  Uncork C1 again instead - "vive le roi."
