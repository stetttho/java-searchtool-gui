 "The Janus-faced composer" - that's how Francis Poulenc  described himself. Contradiction permeated Poulenc, both the man and his music. He was at once a devout Catholic and a Parisian bon  vivant, "part monk, part guttersnipe" (Claude Rostand's words). As a composer he is at once an unsentimental, objective   neoclassicist (a la Stravinsky, whose stoic monumentality looms over the STABAT MATER), and a misty  chromaticist in the French tradition; one part is hard steel, the other pastel-colored. It is with this paradoxical style that Poulenc crafted some of the most devout, strikingly original religious music of the 20th century. Both the STABAT MATER (1950) and the GLORIA (1959) are among Poulenc's masterpieces. The former is more dramatic, consisting of a number of short movements for the most part alternating slow and fast. Jubilant and succinct, the GLORIA is one of the 20th century's most popular choral works. LITANIES A LA VIERGE NOIRE dates from the onset of Poulenc's religious conversion and is a typically heartfelt and intensely prayerful work for women's chorus and organ (it also exists in a version with orchestral accompaniment). For me, the ideal recording of the STABAT and the GLORIA is the one on Deutsche Grammophon with Seiji Osawa leading the Tanglewood Festival Chorus and Boston Symphony. But these works are well served by a chorus which lends proper French diction to the Latin. (Poulenc heard Latin in a distinctively French way, resulting in accentuation such as "in EX-cel-SIS De-O"). The acousitc is spacious and churchy rather than "concert-hall" (it was recorded in a Paris church) and the orchestral playing is notable for some strong brass contributions. There are other recordings of these Poulenc works to consider; but given the idiomatic performances you get here for such a low price, this is well worth your consideration.
