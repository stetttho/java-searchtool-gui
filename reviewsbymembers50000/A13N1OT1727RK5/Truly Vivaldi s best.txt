 Here are some of Vivaldi's richest and most grandiose concertos. The A major concerto grosso (with organ), the B-flat concerto for four violins, and the B-flat violin concerto "in scordatura" (especially the stunning slow movement) are exceptional. As for the performances, I would have preferred period instruments or a more period style. But for the quality of the music, this disc is worthwhile - I doubt you could find this same combination of pieces elsewhere.
