 This CD will make you ask yourself, "Why on earth do people think that Vivaldi was facile, repetitious, or formulaic?" These concertos - the majority of which are in minor keys - are amazing. The string sonatas "Madrigalesco" and "Al Santo Sepolcro" and the C minor violin concerto are extraordinary! The first two I could imagine being played during a Passion Week mass, while the latter is positively experimental in its length and harmonic and expressive language. Europa Galante has built a reputation for scintillating performances of Baroque music, and this is a prime example. This CD is a winner. Buy it!
