 THE LOST EPISODES, VOLUME 1 (4 cassettes) is a must-have for any Bob and Ray enthusiast. Here you can enjoy dozens of choice cuts from the great comedic duo's live radio work on station WOR in (I believe) the 1970's, many of which show them at top form. The highlight is the episodes of their mock soap opera "Mary Backstayge, Noble Wife". Join "America's favorite family of the footlights" as they tour New England towns with their Broadway show, WESTCHESTER FURIOSO, the centerpiece of which is "In Your Hat" - an appallingly bad production number worthy of "Springtime for Hitler". There are also such delightful nuggets as The Trophy Train, Charles the Poet, "The Gathering Dusk", "Elmer W. Litzinger, Spy", and more. Bob and Ray spoofed the snail's-pace of soap operas to perfection. Their wizardry with voices, sound effects, and music is enthralling. Bob and Ray INHABITED their characters, imbuing them with layers of reality and with interior lives - witness the wonderful Studio Talk bits. This is creative radio at its best. Buy these tapes and travel to dizzying heights of laughter!
