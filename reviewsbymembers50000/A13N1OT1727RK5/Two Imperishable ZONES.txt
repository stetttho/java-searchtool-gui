 This video features two imperishable TWILIGHT ZONE episodes dealing overtly with totalitarianism, oppression, and freedom. This is Serling at his most "on the surface" and preachy, but his preaching fits the subjects perfectly. The wonderful Burgess Meredith is back, giving an endearing and startlingly real performance as the "obsolete" librarian. And Joseph Schildkraut (from THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANK) is eloquent as the ghost of a Nazi prisoner. These important episodes are essential to any ZONE collection.
