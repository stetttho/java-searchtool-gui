 Francis Poulenc (1899-1963) was one of the most lovable and accessible composers of the 20th century. He worked in a stylistic melange that was strikingly original: a quirky blend of Stravinskian neoclassicism, the residue of French Impressionism, and even unmistakable hints of French vaudeville and popular song. His tone was remarkably wide, encompassing both Parisian wit and gaity and elevated religious feeling. Much as he may have worked from other models, his music always sounds unmistakably his own and quintessentially French.   This compilation CD provides a fine sampler of Poulenc's work. What a splendid performance of the GLORIA! Osawa favors more brisk tempos, and reveals all the vibrancy of Poulenc's orchestral colors, the vitality of his rhythms, and the piquancy of his harmonies. The first two movements are sensational in their vigor and clarity, and there are some lovely solo contributions from Kathleen Battle in movements 3, 5, and 6. The fantasia-like Organ Concerto (1938), another of Poulenc's masterpieces, is given a gripping and multi-faceted reading by Simon Preston and the BSO. The multi-movement concerto builds inexorably from the terrifying grandeur of the opening, through the many spirited episodes, to the touching conclusion. Organ and strings are well-balanced, creating a glorious massed sound in the climactic moments. The collage-like CONCERT CHAMPETRE (1928) for harpsichord and orchestra is less serious in intent or well-integrated than Poulenc's later works, though it is still a lot of fun with its free-associative silliness and absurdism. (Still, I would have preferred to hear the Double Piano Concerto on this disc.)  Poulenc said "Do not analyze my music, just love it". This CD will help you do just that.
