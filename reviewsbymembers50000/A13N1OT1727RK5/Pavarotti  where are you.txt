 I have a strong feeling that this was a fine performance of the Verdi Requiem. Just look at the stellar line-up of soloists. But unfortunately, I am unable to tell, because the sound quality is just DREADFUL. It's all cloudy and murky from beginning to end - you can just sense the wonderful voices of Pavarotti and Scotto lurking underneath the mud. Please don't get this recording if you plan on doing anything with it other than enjoying the cover art and the program notes.
