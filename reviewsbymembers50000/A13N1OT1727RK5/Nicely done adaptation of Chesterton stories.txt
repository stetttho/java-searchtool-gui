 G. K. Chesterton's clerical sleuth Father Brown is one of the great creations of British detective fiction. The Father Brown stories are a delightful mixture of wit, intrigue, and  philosophical reflection. In 1954, Father Brown came to the silver screen in the person of the versatile Alec Guiness in Robert Hamer's classy adaptation. Although Chesterton's stories are set in the Edwardian era, the film updates the action (very stylishly, I think) to the 1950's. The screenplay, basically an expanded version of the story "The Blue Cross", has Father Brown chasing after stolen art treasures and trying to convert the thief, the flamboyant Flambeau. The movie does a nice job of distilling Father Brown's world; we even get to see him preaching a sermon at Mass and visiting his bishop, things which are only referred to in the stories. Though (I think) little of the dialogue comes directly from Chesterton, the writers have managed to come up with some very Chestertonian lines (some examples: "The first thing you noticed when you came in the room was what was not there", "It's all so nonsensical, it must make sense", and "The only visible door leads nowhere...perhaps there is an invisible door leading somewhere"). Alec Guiness is truly a marvel, miraculously transforming himself into this bespectacled, round-faced priest whose foolish countenace conceals a keen detective mind. (Guiness, incidentally, became a Catholic shortly after making this film.) The musical score is by Georges Auric, a noted French composer who also wrote the score for Coctueau's LA BELLE ET LA BETE. This is altogether a delightful British comedy-mystery.
