 Any lover of American theater should own the original cast recording of THE MUSIC MAN. For me, the high point of this recording is Preston's intoxicating performance of the speak-song number, "Trouble". His performance here is cool and rhythmically precise, unlike his "white hot", vitriolic performance in the 1962 movie. But the whole CD is a lot of fun. Enjoy!
