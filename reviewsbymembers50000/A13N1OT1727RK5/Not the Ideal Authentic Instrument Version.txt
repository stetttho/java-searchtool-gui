 I believe the Penguin Guide's dictum on this recording was something along the lines of "only for hard-core baroque enthusiasts". I have no doubt that Ms. Wallfisch plays with all the requisite historical knowledge and insights, and that her articulation reveals an understanding of the inner workings of Bach's polyphony. But the tone of her violin is so thin and astringent that it will all but repel many modern listeners; the fact that the violin is tuned down nearly a whole step makes it doubly hard to get used to. Although this recording has been vital in helping me as a violinist to interpret these works in a historically conscious manner, it is not my first recommendation. For a more pleasurable (and inexpensive) authentic-instrument recording I reccomend Jaap Schroeder's version as re-released on Naxos; you get two CD's for roughly the price of one middle-priced label CD.
