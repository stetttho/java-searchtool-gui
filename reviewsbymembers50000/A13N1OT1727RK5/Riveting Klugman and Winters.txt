 "A Game of Pool" is a riveting two-man show (duodrama?) about winning, losing, and competition set almost entirely within the confines of a pool room. Jack Klugman, here in his second of four TWLIGHT ZONE appearances, gives a typically intense and subtle performance as pool champ-wannabe Jesse Cardiff. Jonathan Winters is terrific as his rival for the pool shark's mantle. One could hardly guess that Winters was a comedian rather than an actor and that this was his first dramatic role, so assured and witty a performer is he. "A Game of Pool" deserves to be compared with other films, such as 12 ANGRY MEN, that derive tension from a closed setting. I'd include "Pool" among the TWILIGHT ZONE classics.
