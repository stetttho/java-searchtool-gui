 One aspect of the founder of modernism that gets little press is his deep faith rooted in the Russian Orthodox Church. Stravinsky's ballets use the savage irregular rhythms and epigrammatic melodies of Russian folk song. The sacred choral works featured on this disc are "Russian", too, but theirs is the Russianism of icons, mosaics, and the Byzantine liturgy. The liner notes speak of the miraculous suspension of time in the slow final section of the SYMPHONY OF PSALMS; indeed, it could be described as an icon in sound. The Mass for chorus and winds is pseudo-medieval and incantatory, while Canticum Sacrum shows Stravinsky moving confidently into serial technique. The Westminster Choir and the London Sinfonia give all this music justice with warm, rich, and committed performances in a resonant, churchy acoustic. (The performance of the PSALMS is a perfect complement to more overtly "concert" renditions.) An extraordinary sampler of Stravinsky's sacred music.
