 To me, HARVEY is the greatest of the so-called "screwball comedies". Like other examples of the genre, HARVEY revolves around a harmless bumbler whom society considers a lunatic (Elwood P. Dowd); at movie's end, we are left with the impression that all mankind are mad and those in the sanitarium are no more lunatic than those outside. But unlike other screwball farces, HARVEY has as much heart and thoughtfulness as hilarity. If ARSENIC AND OLD LACE sends you into hysterics every time you see it, HARVEY will unfailingly induce a warm smile. Jimmy Stewart seemed at first an odd choice for the role of an amiable drunk (the role was turned down by Jack Benny and Bing Crosby before Stewart got it); but he plays the part superbly, winning our hearts as well as giving a subtle, naturalistic performance. His monologue in the alley behind the bar (when he explains his way of life and how he met Harvey) is a classic of Stewart's career and a scene I never tire of watching. So do yourself a favor and welcome HARVEY into your home.
