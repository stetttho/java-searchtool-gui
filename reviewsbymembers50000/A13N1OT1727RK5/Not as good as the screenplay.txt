 Correction: The defendant in the play is 19 years old, not 16, as one reviewer said.  This play, based on a 1954 television drama, can't compare with the classic 1957 movie (starring Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb). The play is interesting read and is probably fun to perform, but the movie screenplay is just so much better in terms of characterization, dialogue, etc. In addition, the decision to break the play up into acts is, in my view, a mistake; quite obviously, this play should be performed in one continuous act (since the movie is only 90 minutes, this doesn't seem impractical).Read the play, but also see the movie! (I would suggest this especially to schoolteachers who are using this script for class: show the movie to your students as well!)
