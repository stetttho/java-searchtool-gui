 Rossini's delightful LA CENERENTOLA is well served in this 1995 recording, which gathers some of the best Rossinians of our day. Larmore with her even, creamy mezzo soprano is a wonderful Angelina and a nice alternative to the more idiosyndratic Cecilia Bartoli. Gimenez exhudes elegance and poise as Don Ramiro. As Don Magnifico, Corbelli is, as always, a delight - ever the polished musician, subtle comedian, and master of rapid PARLANDO. (He can be heard as Dandini in the 1992 London recording.) Gino Quilico is a lightweight and stragely un-Italian Dandini (in this latter respect he makes an odd pairing with the VERY Italian Corbelli), while Miles sings Alidoro's magisterial aria with solemn dignity. Carlo Rizzi gives a quicksilver, fleet-footed reading of the score. This recording is at the forefront of modern recordings of this opera and a worthy condender with the London recording with Bartoli.
