 With a generous selection of recordings of FALSTAFF available, (including, I imagine, a few budget-priced ones) I wonder why Naxos decided to contribute this rather superfuluous issue instead of turning to more unfamiliar repertoire. This set does not do justice to Verdi's comic masterpiece. In the title role, Domenico Trimarchi is rather awful: constantly wobbly of tone, and with lines delivered in a scratchy parlando rather than suavely and cantabile. Worst of all, he doesn't sound the least bit fat. Needless to say, a FALSTAFF that lacks a good Falstaff is not really worth getting. Pass this one up.
