 With an intoxicating score by Jule Styne and ingenious lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, GYPSY is understandably considered one of the greatest musicals ever created. Though it didn't seem possible, this remastering of the 1959 recording is even more enjoyable than the original. Improved sound enables us to enjoy Ethel Merman's brassy voice and the orchestral details even better, and several delightful extra passages and alternate takes have been added. Also, two songs which were cut during tryouts are presented as bonus tracks. One of these, "Nice She Ain't", was supposed to be sung by Jack Klugman, and since he was not a singer he decided against tackling it (though it is a "talking song" and would have suited his limited range well). The other, "Momma's Talkin' Soft", is a sort of cynical comment on Rose's character and was meant to be sung by Louise and June in counterpoint to "Small World" in Act I. The loss of both of these songs from the first production was a colossal shame, and they deserve to be revived for future productions.   As other reveiwers have affirmed, this album crackles with the excitement of live theater, and allows us to hear character and storyline in addition to a mere succession of songs. One example of this occurs in Track 2, in which Baby June and Baby Louise audition for a vaudeville act. At one point in their duet, Louise enters a split second too late for the line "I'll dance when she's done" and is scolded by Rose, "You're behind honey, catch up, catch up!" The only reason she's "behind" is that June held her note too long in the previous bar. Rose, of course, is blind to this. Marvelous.  Enjoy this incomparable Broadway musical in a sparkling remastering!
