 The screwball comedy was a popular genre on stage and film in the 1930's and 40's. It featured eccentric characters engaged in daffy behavior and caught in an intricate, farcial plot. In these plays, the whole world is shown to be crazy, and often - as in ARSENIC AND OLD LACE - the plot centers around a clinically insane person (ie. Teddy) who comes off at play's end looking like the sanest of the bunch. ARSENIC AND OLD LACE is one of the most hilarious examples of the screwball comedy, as well as an excellent send-up of the horror movies and melodramas of the time; its comic treatment of torture and murder must have indeed seemed cathartic during World War II, when the film was made. Pull up a tombstone and enjoy this wickedly funny comedy!
