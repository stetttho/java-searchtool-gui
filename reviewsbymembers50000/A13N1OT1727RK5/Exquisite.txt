 THE RAKE'S PROGRESS is not only one of my favorite operas, but one of my favorite works of music. This may seem strange, as Stravinsky's neoclassical operatic morality fable is considered by many to be a cold, cerebral work. But quite on the contrary, THE RAKE is a jewel-like score full of lyricism (often of a Broadway-like accessibility), warmth, razor-sharp wit, and crystalline beauty - all of which John Eliot Gardiner and his forces bring out marvelously in this recording. Listen to the exquisite trio in Act II Scene 2 - perhaps the most beautiful number in the opera - and you'll see what I mean. Ian Bostridge's sensitively sung Tom Rakewell has just the right vocal personality - boyish, innocent, eager, and vulnerable. His and Deborah York's pure-toned voices are an extraordinary match: hear them blend seamlessly in their duets or the trio. Bryn Terfel's vivid, boisterous Nick Shadow and Anne-Sophie Von Otter's subtly witty Baba complete the cast. Conductor Gardiner uses his expertise in early music to emphasize THE RAKE's 18th-century roots and "chamber" texture. THE RAKE falls into the class of what I might call private favorites - works that are not universally "popular" but hold an extraordinary attraction for me personally. Both the Auden/Kallman libretto and Stravinsky's music are endlessly fascinating, and this CD has become the perfect means for me to enjoy them.
