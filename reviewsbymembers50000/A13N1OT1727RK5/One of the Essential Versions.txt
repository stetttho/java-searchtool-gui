 Among recordings of this brilliant opera, Stravinsky's own rendition is one of the only three serious options - the other two being the Kent Nagano version on Elektra and the John Eliot Gardiner recording on Deutche Grammophon. It is always interesting and valuable to hear a composer's interpretation of his own music, and this recording is a historical document as well as a first-rate performance. However, I take issue with Ted Libbey's description of THE RAKE as a "comedy" and as "parodistic". Though it has plenty of wit, the opera as a whole is hardly comedic. This is, after all, a Faustian tale about a man who rejects "true love" to chase after "shadows" and dies in a madhouse. Even the ironic epilogue, in which the singers step out of character to deliver the moral, does not succeed in turning this essentially tragic fable into a comedy. I think of the opera's genre as analogous to Mozart's dramma giocoso (eg. DON GIOVANNI). My favorite musical moments in the work are not the comic relief but those of great emotional depth and introspection - eg. "Love, too frequently betrayed", "No word from Tom", "Vary the song, O London", the trio, the madhouse scene; these pieces are as close as 20th-century music ever got to the crystaline clarity and perfection of Mozart. (Stravinsky was decried for the "coldness" and cerebral quality of his music, and the above-mentioned pages certainly blow that criticism out of the water.) Secondly, THE RAKE is not parodistic or satirical. Though both the music and the libretto do present the 18th century as though viewed through a distorted mirror, the intent of the opera is serious and very little actual poking fun at Mozartian opera goes on. I think we undervalue and trivialize this profound, meaningful (and yes, entertaining) opera if we think of it merely as a powdered-wig pastiche - though many critics since the opera's premiere have fallen into that trap.
