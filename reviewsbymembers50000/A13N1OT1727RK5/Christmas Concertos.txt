 The Christmas concerto is an interesting subgenre of the baroque concerto grosso. Several Italian baroque composers wrote concerti designated for performance at Christmastime - this designation being by virtue of their pastoral or "musette" movements, such music being associated with the music of the sheperds of Bethlehem. Here Il Giardino Armonico performs a batch of Christmas concertos by Corelli, Vivaldi, Gemignani, and others. Giardino's astringent tone lacks the sweetness of Europa Galante (my preferred Italian period instrument ensemble), but their interpretations are bracing, sometimes startling in their dynamic contrasts, and full of life. They are, if you will, like a severe German alterpiece rather than a sweet Italian madonna.
