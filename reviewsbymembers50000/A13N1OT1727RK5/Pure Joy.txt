 This recording is a joy to listen to. The "Classical" Symphony is fast-paced, witty, and energetic. The Fifth Symphony is noble and majestic, with glowing contributions from all sections of the orchestra. (The striving, heroic theme of the first movement is one of the iconic themes of 20th-century music.)These recordings, incidentally, were made by the Philly Orchestra in Town Hall and Brentwood Hotel in Philadelphia, respectively. Sony should be commended for putting out these low-priced reissues of classic recordings. They're perfect for people on a budget who want to put together a catholic classical CD library.
