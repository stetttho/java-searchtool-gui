 Biondi's disc is without any doubt the definitive version of the FOUR SEASONS. This scintillating, buoyant, energetic performance leaves other versions lying in the dust. If you thought you had heard the SEASONS a million times, you're wrong: you haven't heard it truly interpreted until you hear this disc. If you were accustomed to think of the SEASONS as banal elevator music, then buy this disc - it will change your mind in an instant. This disc should belong on every music shelf. Don't dally - GET THIS CD!
