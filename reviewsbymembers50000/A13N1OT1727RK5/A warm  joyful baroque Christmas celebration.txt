 The beautiful, varied, and well-chosen repertoire on this disc will keep you returning to it season after season. We start with a 17th-cantury French NOEL, lovingly and simply rendered a cappella by Richard Duguay. There follow some more French carols in instrumental arrangements by Marc-Antoine Charpentier, two traditional plainchants, some sumptuous madrigal-style pieces by Schein and Monteverdi, Purcell's florid and expressive vocal monologue for the Virgin Mary, and finally the most substantial piece on the disc: Charpentier's Christmas Midnight Mass, a very interesting work based on French carol themes. The performances by the Boston camerata are warm and vibrant. This early baroque Christmas disc is a real winner.
