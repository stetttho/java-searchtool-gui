 It has become a tradition for me to listen to this CD around Passion Week. The disc includes Gregorian chants associated with the liturgy of Good Friday. The Passion narrative from the Gospel of John - over a half-hour of uninterrupted chant - is absolutely mesmerizing. This piece is performed by a tenor (playing the evangelist) a bass (playing Christ), a second tenor playing various other characters and a group of singers representing the crowd. Each role has its clearly circumscribed range and speed. Far from being monotonous, this stark style of delivering the sacred words actually makes you concentrate on the text more closely. The singers (from the Nova Schola Gregoriana of Rome) are sweet-voiced and lend beautiful Italianate diction to the Latin words (a refreshing change from many Gregorian chant recordings, which feature French or German singers). All the texts (without translations) are included in the CD booklet. This disc takes you to the crossroads were music and religious ritual, art and liturgy, meet. Naxos should be commended for stunning low-priced releases such as this. 5 stars, with no reservations whatsoever.
