 "To me, the worst fear is the fear of the unknown - the fear which you cannot share with others. That is the most nightmarish of the stimuli." These words of Rod Serling could apply to "The Hitch-Hiker", one of Serling's most chilling, evocative and memorable TWILIGHT ZONE scripts. It concerns a young woman driving alone across country. She is frightened by the sight of a sinister-looking hitch-hiker who seems to appear at every turn. In a story that resembles a religious parable, she encounters a good-natured auto mechanic, a drug store owner, a heartless gas station owner, and a selfish young sailor. The episode plays with some of Serling's favorite themes: human cruelty, and the loneliness and helplessness caused by a secret anxiety. Its dark, unsettling atmosphere - especially during the terrifying night the woman goes through when her car breaks down - remain vivid in my memory.
