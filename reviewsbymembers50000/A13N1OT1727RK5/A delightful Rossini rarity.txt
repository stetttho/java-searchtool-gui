 Gioacchino Rossini wrote two kinds of comic opera. First there was the manic, almost farcial "opera buffa" (eg. THE BARBER OF SEVILLE). Then there was a kind of serio-comedy akin to the "dramma giocoso" of Mozart. IL TURCO IN ITALIA (1816) definitely falls in the latter category (as does LA CENERENTOLA). This little-known opera is a real gem. It is about a Muslim prince (Selim, sung by Michele Pertusi in fine voice) from Turkey and the comedy and conflict that ensue when he visits Italy. A clash of cultures ensues as the polygamous Selim tries to steal Don Geronio's young wife, Fiorilla (mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli, singing a role written for soprano). While the opera does not have as many memorable melodies or outstanding individual numbers as THE BARBER or CENERENTOLA, it is still a funny, compassionate comedy with some of Rossini's best music. The opera is surprisingly contemporary in feel, especially in the character of the Poet, who "writes" the opera as it unfolds. Bartoli, Pertusi, and Vargas are all excellent, but for me the stand-out is Alessandro Corbelli, who portrays the henpecked husband Geronio with musicality and sympathy. Just about any opera set with Corbelli on it is worth getting, as he is an extremely fine singing-actor in the Mozart/Rossini repertoire.
