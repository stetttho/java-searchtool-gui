 Dirk and Al do it again!  I've followed every single one of their adventures and am proud to say that they are two marvelously fearless characters who I would follow anywhere. Cussler, while perhaps not  sticking to the facts of earth's evolvement, has some grand description  that is worth reading and even educational.   It never ceases to amaze me  how Cussler manages to take an event that happened hundreds, or in this  case thousands, of years ago and weave it into a modern tale. This book  is a wonderful read.  It is exciting and contains the usual Dirk and Al  wit.  This is a perfect action yarn to read on a cold winter's day by a  fire - or even on a sunny beach. Dirk and Al, once again, become  embroiled in a conspiracy that might end life as we know it.  Once again,  Dirk and Al are victorious over evil.  To know them is to love them.  If  you like intrigue, adventure, and an almost blase attitude toward danger -  Cussler's Dirk and Al are for you.  Read them all and you won't be  dissapointed!
