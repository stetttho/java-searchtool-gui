 Mr. Coben outdid himself this time!  This novel had more twists and turns than a mountain road.  Before you even read the first page, you might as well resign yourself to the fact that you won't move until you finish it.  I was somewhat disappointed to find that Mr. Coben's book was not about Myron Bolitar as I had become very fond of him.  Tell No One, however, is Mr. Coben's best story yet. Halfway through this book, I was asking, "Myron Who?" Imagine having your wife be your best friend since the age of seven and after a few months of marriage, she is dead.  Eight years later you are still mourning her death only to find that she might not really be dead.  Everywhere you turn to discover the truth, you are met with roadblocks and dishonesty.  Nothing is what is seems and no one is who you thought they were.  Friends aren't necessarily and help comes from the oddest places. The plot is so interwoven that you really need to read it with little or no knowledge just so you can enjoy the ride, and it is quite a ride - right up to the last page. The character development is outstanding.  This is a book where you really have feelings about all of the characters - maybe not all are favorable, but feelings, nonetheless. Anyone who enjoys a fast-paced mystery filled with intrigue and surprise must read Tell No One.  If you haven't read any of Coben's other books, you might even want to spend the rest of the summer with them.  You won't be disappointed and you certainly won't be bored.  I will be waiting with great anticipation for his next book.
