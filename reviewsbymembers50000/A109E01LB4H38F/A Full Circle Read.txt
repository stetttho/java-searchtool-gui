 I don't want to give away the end of the story, but the end might as well be the beginning all over again.  This was, without a doubt, the absolute worst book John Grisham has ever written.  I think he has rested on his laurels long enough and it is time he returned to writing exciting novels or give up the whole thing.  I know I won't buy another of his novels without reading a few reviews first. The "hero" of this book appeared to be a bit slow witted for a professor of a top notch college.  I kept thinking he would get with the program, but he never did.  Imagine running all over the country with a rather large sum of money in garbage bags and or boxes in the trunk of your car.  That is the basics of the book; where will he hide the money next?   The plot was silly, the story never lived up to its potential, and the end was the worst.   Don't bother to buy the book.  I'm sure there are millions of folks around the country who are carrying it around in the trunk of their car and they will willingly loan it to you.
