 The saga of Johnnie Wise continues with this book and another great job by Keith Lee Johnson.  In this book, Johnnie is torn between Napolean and what he can give her, Lucas whom she loves, and the Beauregards, her white family.  If these aren't the ingredients for a KLJ novel, I don't know what are.  Mr. Johnson doesn't fail the reader with his sterling ability to add twists, turns and leaving the reader wondering how he ever thought of that, much less put it all together in one book. What with some authors could be a confused mess, with LBGL2 it is a wonderfully woven story running the gamut of emotions. Another thing that separates KLJ from others is his desire to "be real" in his fiction.  People who make poor life choices even for good reasons, in Mr Johnson's books, must pay a price.  While I, for one, can enjoy a little leeway in punishment in fiction, am glad to see one author stand up for what he believes is right.   Mr Johnson is a fantastic author!  Upon finishing his books, you immediately want him to write another....now! I can't wait for LBGL 3.
