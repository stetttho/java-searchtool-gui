 The time has long come and gone for Patricia Cornwell to put the readers, Kay Scarpetta, Lucy and their various friends out of their collective misery and end this series.  There is nothing happy, uplifting, or even conclusive in this latest Cornwell offering.  Looking for an ending?  Looking for a continuation of Blow Fly?  Not even close.  Blow Fly never happened and this novel has no particular ending. It is like Cornwell just stopped writing, said the end, and moved on to book #14.  We have Scarpetta returning to Richmond.  Why, one wonders?  Even Scarpetta can't answer that question.  There ensues a typical Cornwell plot - working on the same case as Lucy and Benton, one side keeping as tight-lipped as the other.  Scarpetta is charged with helping her totally inept and seriously neurotic replacement solve the death of a 14 year old girl.  Meanwhile, Lucy and Benton are trying to understand who is stalking her and attempted to murder Lucy's latest bad idea in a relationship. Does it come as any surprise that the two plots are related? Rudi has lost all patience with Lucy and Marino continues to pine over Scarpetta.  I've lost patience with the whole group and have decided I no longer care what happens to any of them.  This novel is entirely too dysfunctional and too depressing. Save your money, read the synopsis, and hope there is an ending eventually.  That is what I intend to do in the future.
