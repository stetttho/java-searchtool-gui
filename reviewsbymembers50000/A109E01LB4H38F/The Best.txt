 I received the Honey House Bee Bar as a gift and am amazed at how well it works.  It does everything it says it does.  It isn't greasy, it keeps your hands soft, it lasts a long time,  and is better than any lotion I've tried - and I've tried them all.  The only downside is that it doesn't go on easily - rather like putting dry soap on your hands.  But it is well worth the effort.  Fishing,cleaning fish, and gardening doesn't make for smooth hands, but the bee bar makes it seem as if I never cleaned a fish or pulled a weed without gloves.  This is one outstanding product and I would recommend it for anyone.
