 Harlan Coben did it again!  This is a great book in a great series. Myron returns from an extended disappearance to find Esperanza in big trouble. With the help of Big Cindy and Win, Myron is determined to  help, even though Esperanza and her attorney are just as determined that he  will not even try to help. The story continues with more twists, turns,  humorous, and serious situations. I highly recommend reading all of the  books in this series.  The writing is excellent, the story lines absorbing,  and the best is the relationships among the characters.  Coben writes as if  the characters could jump out of the book and carry on a conversation with  you.
