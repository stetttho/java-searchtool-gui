 Being an avid reader of mysteries, I am thrilled to find an author such as Coben to add to my list of must-reads.  Thanks to Amazon.com's recommendation, I first read Fade Away, then scampered to the computer to order the rest of Coben's books.   Even if you aren't a sports person, this book will be a joy to read and hard to put down.  His characters are interesting and just neurotic enough to be believeable.  The reader instantly likes both the hero, Myron, his best friend, the anti-hero, Win, as well as Myron's assistant and girl friend.  The plot is intricate and you wonder if it will all be tied together at the end.  This is one of the best mysteries I've read in a long time.  Try it - you won't be disappointed!
