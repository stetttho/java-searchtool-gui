 When reading Evanovich, the first requirement is to suspend belief.  She isn't a reality writer.  Even with the Plum series, Evanovich has become more and more slapstick with each book. Before you buy this book, you have to know that real-life characters and situations aren't going to be there.  This new character, which one must believe will replace the Plum series and none too soon, isn't bad.  She isn't great either.  Barney is a girl raised by a dad who owns a garage and she is most adept at fixing cars and engines.  She didn't want to continue with this kind of work, so after getting a degree in Engineering she gets a job with an insurance company.  Her brother, "Wild" Bill, is always getting into one kind of scrape or another.  This time, he appears to have fallen into a serious, if fail the world is lost problem.  Barney, as she has done all of her life, goes to Florida to help her brother and save the world in the process.  She meets a man who drives race cars for a living and calls himself NASCAR Man. Of course she does. Just knowing this much, you know that the situations are over the top and a bit out in left field.  Barney is a classier rendition of Stephanie.  There are still the Evanovich trademarks of car chases and the humor that comes with those, strange,somewhat evil characters, and a studly romantic interest.  This isn't the best book you will ever read - nor is it the worst.  If you are in the market for total and typical Evanovich mind candy that is occasionally laugh out loud funny, often roll the eyes and groan slapstick - then spend the $$.
