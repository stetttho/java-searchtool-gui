 Nina Reilly is back in Lake Tahoe, Paul is out, Whitefeather is in, and Sandy reamains the same.  This time out, Nina's case comes from a masseuse who wants Nina to help her uncle, whose wife was shot during a robbery in a motel, in return for free massage therapy.  Nina doesn't take the deal, but does take the uncle as a client.  Add to the mix three rather bizarre mathematicians who were cheating casinos by, simplistically, counting cards at the blackjack tables.  There is much written about prime numbers and various other mathematical theories and while commendable that the O'Shaughnessy sisters understand these, they certainly don't add to the book in any way.  I rocked with the first foray into college math 1A, but by the continuation of the "class," I was seriously skimming through it.  These little asides seemed to slow the book considerably.  I've been a fan of the sisters since reading their first book, but this one leaves a bit to be desired and is not up to their usual 4-5 star rating.  In a nutshell, I really didn't care who murdered whom or why before I was halfway through the book. I finished it out of mild curiosity and the hope that it would get better soon.  Perhaps Paul was the glue/stability that held the previous storylines together, perhaps Nina needs to "get a grip and stop dithering," perhaps this series is running out of gas - whatever the reason, this is not a must read or even a must buy.
