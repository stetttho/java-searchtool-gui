 Reminiscent of the TV show 24, Special Agent Phoenix Perry is having a very bad day and more.  First there is a serial rapist running about raping men.  He has been doing this for over 2 years - but no one knew as none of the victims reported the crime.  As if this weren't enough for your average writer, enter Coco Nimburu, a trained Ninja, master of disguise,  speaks a million languages, and a top notch hired assassin. Her only downfall appears to be that she is something of a sex addict.  Phoenix, who is also a grandmastger of Shaolin Kung Fu, may have met her match.  There begins a gripping story of intrigue, betrayals, people who aren't who they appear to be.....just about anything a reader of mystery and adventure would want.  All rolled into one story.  I will admit that it took me a few pages to become accustomed to Mr. Johnson's writing style, but the story soon overcame any problems in that area.  The author does a great job in telling a story and developing the main characters.  I felt as if Phoenix was a friend and I even developed an understanding of Coco and liked her - except for the little matter of her choice of professions.  This is a good read by an author I know we will hear more and more about as time goes on.  Give the book a try, it is worth it.
