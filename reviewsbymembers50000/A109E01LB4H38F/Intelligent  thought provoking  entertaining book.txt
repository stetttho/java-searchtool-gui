 This is the story of three brothers raised by a wise, intelligent, yet flawed father who instilled character, morality, and philosophical views into these men.  Mr. Johnson cleverly weaves the stories of these individual brothers into an entertaining tale.    William, a psychologist attending the Annual Psychological Convention is sabotaged at dinner by his four white associates who want answers to racial questions.  Their pointed questions bring up his own prejudices as he finds himself in love with one of his white associates.  Sterling, an attorney who is fired from his prestigious law firm just as he wins the biggest case of his life.  He is fired for street talking in the office, but lands on his feet when a very wealthy woman offers to set him up in a new office with clients, help in becoming a sports agent, and a million dollars. All he has to do in return is insure that the pregnant girlfriend, who is black, of this woman's son, who is white and on the presidential track, gets an abortion and accepts 5 million dollars never to see her son again.  Then we have Jericho, the eldest and the black sheep of the family - no pun intended.  He owns a hotel and casino in the Cayman Islands, but he also is a drug and munitions supplier with CIA connections.  He is having a few problems with the government and rival gangs, for lack of a better word. Jericho is a violent, in your face force, but adds much excitement to the story.  Mr. Johnson conjures marvelously diverse, yet believable characters and puts them in a storyline with just enough twists and turns to keep the reader highly entertained.   The street talk became a little overdone for me, but I am a white person and perhaps that is my prejudice.  All in all, this is a good story yet simultaneously thought provoking with differing views on interracial relationships that will have you examining your own prejudices.
