 The Brethren was a different type of book for Grisham.  This wasn't a story about the world of law, but more a story of politics gone awry.  (If you think politicians are corrupt now, this book certainly will  reinforce that belief). This is a two pronged story line where the lives  of one cross the lives of the other.  It is about 3 judges in a camp - type  federal prison and a senator who has been picked to be the next president  by the head of the CIA. While the former are scamming, the latter are  campaigning.  When the two story lines intersect, the book becomes quite a  page turner.  It is a story of greed and the power of money, and what might  happen when the two collide. Throw in the threat of war, a little  "gayness," a little blackmail, and add a little Wag the Dog, and  you've got yourself a good story. The ending is probably a good ending  from a writer's point of view, just not real satisfying for the  reader. All in all, the book is entertaining, interesting, and one that  is difficult to put down. I wanted another chapter for a little more  closure,but maybe Mr. Grisham is thinking of a sequel.
