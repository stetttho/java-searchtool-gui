 This is a cute little mystery with characters that are believable and likeable. Carrie Carlin is a lovely lady with a penchant for being in the wrong place at the right time.  She has an interesting first career;  teaching people how to cope with various problems through biofeedback and  other technologies.  She is also a pretty fair detective. Ms. Tesler  keeps the pace of the book moving, allowing no time for the reader to sit  back and "ho-hum" for a few pages. It is a very fast read.  I  read it on a plane trip that took less than 3 hours. If you have a couple  of hours on your hands and want a book that will hold your attention, this  is the one for you.
