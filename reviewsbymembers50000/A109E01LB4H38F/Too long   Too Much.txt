 I finished reading this book a month or so ago and couldn't even face  thinking about it until now.  This was like the Perils of Pauline  revisited.  Or, to use another "old" phrase, "If it wasn't  one thing, it was another."  Where is Jack Ryan when you need  him? I've always liked John Clark as a supporting character, and might  like him as a lead if Mr. Clancy hadn't put in so many disasters.   Mr.  Clark has found himself the head of a unique organization set up to fight  world terrrorists - but only when asked to help.  This man was busier than  the CIA during the Cold War.  It became too improbable, even for a diehard  Tom Clancy fan like myself. The action was so non-stop, I began to ask  myself, "Will this insanity never end?"   I think there might  be a future for John Clark and his son-in-law as new crime fighting heroes;   they are both very likeable and talented.  Mr. Clancy just needs to calm  his exuberance and deal with one or two major world-peace shattering  terrorist events rather than 10 - one right after the other. I was  exhausted after reading this one!
