 This book was recommended to me by an Amazon.com customer, and am I glad I decided to read it. I began this book on an airplane and found I could not even begin thinking about a vacation experience until I finished the  book. I hate to oversimplify, but this book is a terrific tale of a bunch  of good guys, of the secret intelligence variety,  trying to stop the bad  guys from doing a very bad thing.  There are only a few problems; the good  guys haven't a clue what or where the bad guys are going to strike and, the  good guys aren't always perceived as the good guys. This book is fast  paced, dramatic, and has enough suspense to keep anyone on the edge of  their seat.  It also gives the impression that this is pretty much the way  the real world works; at least the real world where I would like to reside.    If you enjoy spy/terrorist type books, this is a must read!
