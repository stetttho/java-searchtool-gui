 This book is about twins who spent entirely too much time being abused in prison, finally get out and go on a killing spree to repay those who "done them wrong"....or not.    Special agent Phoenix Perry is on the job once again.  She and her sexy partner, Kelly McPherson, think they have solved the gruesome killings only to find other victims with nothing apparently connecting the victims to each other.    Sugar and Spice is a great story, filled with intrigue, twists and turns with every page.  I found it impossible to put down.  Just like Special Agent Perry, every time I thought I had it all figured out, I discovered I was very wrong.  There are new surprises with every page.  This is a great read. I predict Mr Johnson will soon become one of the top mystery writers.
