 One more time, Harlan Coben has written a superb mystery where every page adds another totally unexpected twist.  This book didn't have as many extreme plot turns as his last, "Tell No One," but it is really close. As you have read, the plot revolves around poor Will, who has to be the unluckiest man in love ever.  His first love is murdered, his worshipped brother is the suspected killer and has been on the lam for 11 years, his current lover is missing.  Can things get much worse?  Of course they can because Coben makes up good stuff!!  I refuse to say any more about the story because to do so would ruin it for you. Suffice to say, the different story lines become interwoven, and downright creepy.  I have followed Coben's writing since his very first novel and, in my humble opinion, he keeps getting better and better. If you only read one or two novels a year, this is a don't miss for sure.  If you read hundreds of novels a year, this is one you won't forget.  "Gone for Good" is a great read, filled with suspense and the knowledge that Coben won't let you figure it out; he always has one more surprise up his sleeve. And the surprises just keep on coming.  Buy it, Read it, Relish it.  This book is one of the year's best!
