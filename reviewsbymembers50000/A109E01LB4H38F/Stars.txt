 In my humble opinion, Harlan Coben is one of today's best mystery and thriller writers and stands above all of the rest.  I agree with another reviewer who said that Harlan on a bad day is still better than many on their best days.  Having said that, The Innocent, wasn't Mr. Coben's greatest endeavor to date.  While still a page turner, his novels are becoming formulaic and you just expect twists and turns.  This is a story of a guy(Matt)who was convicted of murder, spending 4 years in jail when, in actuality, it was an accidental killing and "our hero" was just trying to stop a barroom brawl.  Usually I can go with Mr Coben's flights of fantasy, but he lost me right here, in the beginning.  Matt's family could afford a good lawyer and in today's world, Matt would be a lawyer himself "with a past."  Matt's wife has a past of her own unknown to Matt.  Using the old picture in a cell phone trick, Coben is off to the races and doesn't stop until the last page. The pace is fast, there are some surprising twists (although I had many of them figured out), but I never did "warm up" to the characters.  The truth of the matter is that while I certainly wanted to see what happened, I really didn't care enough about the characters for it to matter if the ending was happy or not.  From another author, this would be a very good story.  From Harlan Coben, it is only good.
