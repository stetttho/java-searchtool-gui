 I have read and enjoyed almost every one of the cat who books and this was, by far, the least enjoyable.  Reading this book was like going on a Sunday drive; passing nice scenery, and returning home.  There was no  excitement, no suspense, no amusement, just a pleasant excursion with  little to show at the end. We gathered a glimpse into Qwill's past, but  even that was cut short with no hope of ever hearing the end.  The murdered  suspect was just a cardboard cutout with some innuendos, but nothing  substantial.  The same with the murderers.  There was absolutely no  character development at all. Even the cats played a minor role. This  book was like reading someone's journal of daily activities over a period  of a week or so.  Interesting, but certainly not worth the price of  admission. Wait until this one comes out in paperback, or avoid it  altogether.
