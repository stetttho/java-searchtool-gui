 These are the best slippers ever.  I should know as I'm always in search of something comfortable to wear on my feet since gravity has taken over my body.  These slippers are soft, the foam is fantastic and can make any sore feet feel better. After putting them on it is almost impossible to resist saying, "Ahhhh!" They hold up quite well even after numerous washings.  My first pair is well over 2 years old and still going strong.  Remarkable since I have worn them every day for the entire two years except when they are drying from being washed. I'm only buying another pair for a change of color. You can't go wrong with a pair of these slippers.
