 Roadblock is a re-mold of Energon Inferno, in Superlink, he is simply called "Inferno Volt". Roadblock is Inferno re-born when Inferno throws himself into the sun to escape the Decepticon program Megatron infected inside him. The toy Roadblock is reminiscent of G1 Grapple, and is definitely worth what he costs.He's very poseable, so he's a great toy for kids and collectors alike
