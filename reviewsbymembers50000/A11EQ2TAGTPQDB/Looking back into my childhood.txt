 Watching Rescue Rangers again for the first time since a good 17 years ago, it's surprising how much I actually remember of the show. It's not like I thought of the show every day since watching it, but my love for the show was apparently stored away in my brain, because upon watching the shows, I remembered what would happen in each episodes, even most of the lines, precisely. This is the kind of Disney cartoon that was made when the people involved making the show ACTUALLY cared enough to make an interesting show. I mean, the plots are still unique and enjoyable for my adult mind, even more so, because now I understand all the subplots, in-jokes, and hidden messages in the show that I would have never caught in my youth. It's not that the show had anything dirty, it's just that my young mind couldn't comprehend it at the time. Parents, pick this up for your kids. It's much better than anything they're watching on Cartoon Network. Cartoons today are made to sell the merchandise related to the show, and thusly, little thought goes into making a show with substance. Disney was the exception with these cartoons. Yes, these shows had merchandise, but it was not the focus. Disney made these because they wanted to keep constant appeal with their target audience, the children. Rescue Rangers is like an animated series of serial novellas, like the Allan Quartermain, or Tarzan books, but for children. Why are you still reading this? Buy it!
