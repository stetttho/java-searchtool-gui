 This game follows a similar formula to "MK Mythologies: Sub Zero", except the gameplay is much more well done and enjoyable. You play as Liu Kang and Kung Lao (or Scorpion and Sub-Zero by unlocking them). The story takes place at the end of the first Mortal Kombat tournament and proceeds through the tournament of "Mortal Kombat II" in Outworld. The game has a lot of replay value, though the final boss (Shao Kahn) is very difficult to beat if you're not fighting as Liu Kang ( since he fires projectiles the fastest). Now that the price is down to $29.99, the game is more than worth it's price! Even those who aren't fans of Mortal Kombat will enjoy this, but only the fans will catch the nostalgia from the old "MK II" game.
