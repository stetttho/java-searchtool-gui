 The only thing that sucks about "Ripping Yarns" is that only 9 episodes were made. The show itself is extremely well made, and well done. Each episode tells a different story, that parodies "serial" novels/shows. The stories range from tales of war, horror, suspense, coming of age, adventure, action, exploration, romance, and it's all parodied by Michael Palin. It's a great show for lovers of British comedy, and those who are new to British comedy. It's a bit pricey, for only 9 episodes, but it's worth it
