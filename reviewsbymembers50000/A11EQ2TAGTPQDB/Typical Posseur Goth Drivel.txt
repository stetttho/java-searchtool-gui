 So Tim Burton and Danny Elfman have once again demonstrated how stale their creativity really is. They have one theme, and even if they try to drift from it, it leaks in. That theme? Gothic.  Well, they tried the forumla that worked on me before (Nightmare Before Christmas), and re-worked the style into a new story, Corpse Bride. Too bad it's not interesting. The film was an extreme let down, and the music...gah  The music where characters sang seemed so unbelievably half-hearted.  And the instrumentals? Let me say this: Did you like Danny Elfman's instrumentals in Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, and the Nightmare before christmas? Good, because you'll be hearing them again, blended together, for "Corpse Bride"  Skip this, the movie and the CD.  But, if you regularly shop at "Hot Topic", you won't listen to a word I say, will you?
