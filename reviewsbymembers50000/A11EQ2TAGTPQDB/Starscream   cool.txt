 This is a really good Starscream. Actually, it's supposed to be like Starscream's Ghost from the G1 series since Starscream's body was destroyed by Scorponok and he was restored as a being of energy by Unicron. Great toy, somewhat annoying to transform with the arms, but still worth it. Highly reccomended
