 I'm glad to see they are moving production along on this. Now all I have to do is wait for Season 2 to come out. Hopefully it won't take too long. Anyway, this is a great item for any fan of G.I. Joe or fan of 80's paraphenallia. There's so much that can be said about this show, and so limited a reviewing space, so I'll simply sum up that this is one of the best shows ever made. EVER.
