 I personally think this is a great movie. This also references to the first person's review about "Ninja's aren't supposed to have wings". The thing is, this movie is an adaptation of a popular manga("Karasutengu Kabuto") by Buichi Teriwasa. The character, Kabuto, is a member of the raven tengu clan, and being part of that clan, has the power of the raven, which is what Karasutengu means in Japanese, which is why he has large raven wings. There are only two things I didn't like about this movie. First, the original manga villain, Douki, the demon lord, was not the villain in the movie. And second, the Demon Sword, "Flying Dragon", that Kabuto possesses, was featured in the film, but did not carry the significance that it carried in the manga, for instance, in the manga, the sword talked. But, all in all, an excellent film for anime fans, and great music too. I wish their was an available soundtrack!
