 Disney animation is the best even if not a full feature. The saturday afternoon fare such as the Pooh series,Aladdin and others, represent the Disney studios willingness to continue with what works best in animation and story.Not only great stories,but lessons to be learned as well."The Piglet Who Would Be King" is a perfect example.Being able to watch these with your kids is a joy.
