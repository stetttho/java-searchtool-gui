 I watched this show when I was a kid, and I have to say that now I'm an adult, it's even better. When I was young, I liked the show for the nephews, because they were cool. But now I watch the show for Scrooge, and I actually get some of the in-jokes intended for the adult mind ( Like the fact that the Beagle Boys and their mother are based off the real life criminals Ma Barker and her sons.) The problem with Disney is that they don't value their old work. Perhaps the release of this and Chip n Dale Rescue Rangers means they're getting the right idea though. I wish Disney would make cartoons like this again, but now all they're concerned with is making the graphics as flashy as possible. Trust me, measure up "Chicken Little" and "Ducktales Treasure of the Lost Lamp" and Ducktales will win EVERYTIME. Parents, do yourself a favor and pick up this DVD for their kids and let them watch a GOOD cartoon for a chance. Even if you don't watch cartoons anymore, if you're in your early 20's, you probably watched this as a kid, so pick it up, the nostalgia will hit you like a tsunami.
