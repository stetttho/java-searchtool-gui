 Anastasia is one of the best animated movies that has ever been created. It surpasses Disney's constant futile attempts at animation which are always too cute for their own good. The best character in the movie is Rasputin(voiced by Christopher Lloyd and sung by Jim Cummings). His comical way of falling apart adds a likeable element to his personality and with his eerie ,but catchy tune " In The Dark Of The Night". Christopher Lloyd really does an excellent job at bringing the spirit of Rasputin to life, and also, the comedic sidekick villain Bartok the albino bat brings a balanced out amount of evil in the villain to this movie.
