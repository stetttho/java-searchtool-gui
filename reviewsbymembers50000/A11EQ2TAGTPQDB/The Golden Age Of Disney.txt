 It's been a long time since Disney has done something truly inspiring. This isn't to say Disney hasn't made any good animations, but it's been a long time since Disney gave recognition to the characters that FOUNDED the empire that now embodies Disney. Disney is concerned with making their movies as state-of-the art as possible, like "Chicken Little", which make nice eye candy for kids, but lack the magic and imagination of the way Disney is SUPPOSED to be. Well, with these cartoons, you can still see that magic of Disney. Nowadays, you have to go to Disneyworld to experience Disney's magic, or you can get these DVDs of these classic cartoons of one of Disney's most loveable characters : Donald Duck
