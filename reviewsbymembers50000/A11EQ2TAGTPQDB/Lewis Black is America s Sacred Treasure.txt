 This audio book is a semi-autobiographical- and a compilation of thoughts by Lewis Black. And let me tell you, it is automatically my favorite book ever. Even though I have the audio book, but I also bought the book. Lewis has many insightful thoughts in this book, and it is incorporated with great humor. You'll love it.
