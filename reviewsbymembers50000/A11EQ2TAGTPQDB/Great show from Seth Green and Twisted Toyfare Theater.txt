 Adult Swim's programs have gotten more and more disappointing, from the forgettable "Tom Goes to the mayor", the seldom humorous " Perfect Hair Forever", the completely awful "Boondocks", and the loss of Captain Murphy on "Sealab". Fortunately, "Robot Chicken" is a saving grace for Adult Swim. It's a show that is always entertaining, though it may be difficult for some to fully appreciate, as the show has heavy overtones of referrencing science fiction shows, comic books, and cartoons. In many ways, the only way to "get" all of it is to be...well.. kind of a nerd. But still, the show can be enjoyed by all. The only downside is each episode is only 15 minutes long. But still, pick this one up. You'll enjoy it
