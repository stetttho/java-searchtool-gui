 Perhaps I'm a bit biased, since Scrooge McDuck is my favorite Disney character, but I found this to be one of the most captivating and amazing stories I have ever read in comic form. This comic tells the tale of Scrooge McDuck from his humble beginnings as a poor boy in Scotland with dreams of fortune and adventure. The comic follows Scrooge's exploits throughout the world, from meeting the Beagle Boys, encountering Flintheart Glomgold, founding the town of Duckburg, and meeting his nephews for the first time. It's a shame there aren't more backstories like this for other Disney characters. You'll enjoy this book if you're a fan of Scrooge, watched Ducktales as a kid, or just a fan of Disney in general.
