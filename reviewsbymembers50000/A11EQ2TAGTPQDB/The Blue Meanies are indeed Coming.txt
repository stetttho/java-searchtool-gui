 This is my favorite animation of all time. I am a huge fan of anime but I choose this movie over any of them. The thing is, alot of people think the producers were on drugs when making this. That simply isn't so. They made the film surrealistic in a drug-induced essence to hint at the fact that the Beatles were deeply influenced by illegal narcotics during the time of this film.In any case, the film is a visual treat for any age, even children because the strange images and creatures opens the vast imagination of children's mind. The characters also are always fun to watch. Like the cute lil' nowhere man, the psychotic effeminate Chief of the Blue Meanies, and of course, the wise-cracking Fab Four. Buy this movie, or at least rent it.
