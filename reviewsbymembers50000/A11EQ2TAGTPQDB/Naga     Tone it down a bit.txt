 I love this series. And I have a strange affinity for Naga....Hmmm.. I wonder what it could be. I love how Lina calls Naga the "Bondage Queen of Darkness". Also that outfit of hers....My god... The only thing I can't stand is that ridiculous laugh of hers. It drives me mad.. But still, it's a very funny anime. You really should see it if you enjoy animes, or comedy...or both
