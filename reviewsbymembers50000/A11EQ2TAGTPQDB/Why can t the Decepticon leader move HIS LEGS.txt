 Ok first, this toy has educational value because it comes with a small comic that shows English, Spanish and French translations. It's a great toy, it really is..BUT Megatron cannot move is legs back OR forth, hence, he can't bend his knees necessary for WALKING. But he can bend his legs to the sides....something NO human can do! ...
