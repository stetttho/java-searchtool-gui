 I can't. I mean, I love Aquaman. Always have. But I must admit the game does get repetitive at times. Other than that, it's a fun game. The problem is, they don't change the cut scenes at all. When I finally got the Black Manta as available character, I was disappointed. The cut scenes are still the Aquaman story. To be honest, I was hoping for a little more effort on their part.
