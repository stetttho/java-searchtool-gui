 Mortal Kombat's triumphant return with "Deadly Alliance" leaves somewhat of a sour taste leftover. The plus side is fatalities are easy to execute, however, each character only has one fatality, and some are downright silly. Deception plays the same as this game, but has a much better Konquest mode, better characters, and more fatalities. I only reccomend getting this if you want to play as Quan Chi, Kitana, Shang Tsung, Sonya Blade, Jax, or Raiden without his new "dark look" in deception. Or you could just...you know, wait for MK Armageddon to come out, which is a long way off.
