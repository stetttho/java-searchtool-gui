 This is a great deal for the entire series. For 40 bucks, you get all 50 episodes. It's a great show, that follows the manga, somewhat loosely, but hey, it keeps to the basic idea and the animation quality is spectacular. I don't exactly like Astro's voice though, it's not high-pitched enough, but it suffices and it's definitely worth your time and money. It's perfect for Tezuka fans, like myself, and a great show for kids as well.  I wouldn't mind the original series from the 50's being released either, but hey, at least Astro boy is finally on DVD in the US.
