 This is a 50's Japanese cartoon dubbed for American kids...in the 50's. I have to wonder if the dialogue was this ridiculous in the original Japanese. But then again, you have to release it this way because one of the great parts of the show is it's nostalgia factor. Granted, I was not alive in the 50's, but it gives me a TINY insight on what children of the 50's watched. Now if only they would release Astro Boy. All in all this is a great show, and try to get ahold of the 80's re-make if you can, because it's great like this show, but has a bit more of a serious side
