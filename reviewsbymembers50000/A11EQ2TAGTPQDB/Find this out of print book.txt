 A truly comprehensive look at the movie villian.Starting with the very early films such as  The "Great Train Robbery"(1903)through the early sixties when screen stars like Joan Crawford  starred in "Straightjacket",Everson creates a truly inside view to"The Bad Guys".Especially interesting is the influx of the Japanese villian during the height of World War 2.If you are in you mid fifties to late sixties, the photos of some of these film scenes will spark memories of your childhood film going days. Likewise, if you are a film history buff,it's an incredible journy to the past.Long out of print.(1964)
