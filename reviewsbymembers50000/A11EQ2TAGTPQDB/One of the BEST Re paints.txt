 Aside from Energon Galvatron, Energon Starscream is the best re-paint in the entire line. Why? It's simple. Because this Starscream is painted to have a paint scheme almost completely similar to G1 Starscream, except for his legs. For only 10 bucks, this toy is a steal, and he's very durable and poseable, so he's alot of fun to pose for display purposes, or to play with.
