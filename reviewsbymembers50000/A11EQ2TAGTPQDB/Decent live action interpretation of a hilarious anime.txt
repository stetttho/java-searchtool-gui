 This film from the 70's (based on Monkey Punch's "Lupin the 3rd") is actually an interesting film for Lupin fans. The story is like a prequel to the mangas and animes. The movie shows Lupin the 3rd's first encounters with Fujiko Mine, Daisuke Jigen, and Inspector Zenigata. Though the film relies heavily on slap stick comedy and 1970's music, which actually works well since Lupin's plot has a very "70's" feel to it, it's a very good comedy. Reccomended for Lupin fans, and anyone who enjoy asian comedies "Like Kung Fu Hustle".  Warning, this film is entirely in Japanese, with English subtitles. No English dialoge.
