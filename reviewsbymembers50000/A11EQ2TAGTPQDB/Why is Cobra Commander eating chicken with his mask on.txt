 The only thing I don't understand is why it's called "Revenge of Cobra" when it techincally starts or rather introduces the terrorist organization, Cobra. Eh, it doesn't matter either way. It's a great cartoon. Hint: Parents, if you want your children to be patriotic without boring them, get them this. They'll love it.
