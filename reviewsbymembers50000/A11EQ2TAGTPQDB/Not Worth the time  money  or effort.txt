 Even as a big Lovecraft fan, I have to say this film really is not worth seeing. The basic CONCEPT remains faithful to Lovecraft's work, but the main storyline (concerning Paul, Barbara, and the other characters) has nothing to do with any of Lovecraft's work. Ok, here's what you basically get when you watch this movie. Any horror movieever that operates in the vain of most spanish/italian horror films, which for some reason involves the heroes (victims) stranded SOMEWHERE, unable to escape some horrible evil, usually a monster or ancient legendary creature, or the undead. In this one, you have a town of people who are becoming more and more like sea creatures, because they worship Dagon, and will eventually join him to live forever in the sea. The cultists occaisionally cry out "Ya Yah Cthulhu Ftaghn" during their ceremonies, which doesn't really make sense. If they worship Dagon, why are they making a prayer to Cthulhu? Anyway, the story is about our nerdy Woody Allen-esque hero Paul stumbling awkwardly away from the pursuing fish-people of Imboca (Spanish for Innsmouth) until 40 minutes in... Then it's mostly cult stuff.  If you're buying this movie to see Dagon, don't bother. Dagon is only seen in the film for roughly TWO seconds. Yes, he's very cool looking, but it's hardly worth the payoff to spend all that time watching Paul run around in a scooby-doo fashion.
