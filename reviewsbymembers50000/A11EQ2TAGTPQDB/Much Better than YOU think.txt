 You think you hate Armada, but you don't. Armada starts off as, admittedly, a bad show, because it focuses way too much on the kids and moral issues. But the show REALLY starts getting good after Scavenger is introduced, and becomes great along the lines of G1 when Thrust and Jetfire are introduced. Most people who speak hatred for Armada because they only watched a couple of the first episodes, then gave up. After you've watched the episodes a couple of times, it becomes very entertaining. Here's hoping Rhino gets off their lazy butts and brings out the next installment of Armada
