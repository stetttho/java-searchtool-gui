 The episodes of this DVD are mainly concerned with the plot points of Shockblast escaping prison on Cybertron, Wing Dagger being upgraded to Wing Saber, and Megatron gaining total control of Unicron. The problem is that they skip episodes, like the episode that shows Wing Dagger and Tidal Wave getting destroyed. Now, they include the episode that shows Wing Dagger being upgraded to Wing Saber, but in the episodes, Tidal Wave turns to Mirage for seemingly no real reason. The episodes are good, but they really should put more episodes in
