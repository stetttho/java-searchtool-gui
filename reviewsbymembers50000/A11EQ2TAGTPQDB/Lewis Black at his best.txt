 I have to say that Lewis Black never ceases to outdo himself with standup comedy, and this CD only proves my point. In this CD, Lewis Black touches mostly on subjects like the Super Bowl, and Janet Jackson's breast. He does of course touch on many political issues, but this CD seems to be a slightly different approach, which apparently works. Highly reccomended
