 The show itself is very well made, considering the time that it was made, in Japan, and the story of "Tetsusawan Atom" or "Astro Boy" is very captivating, but the dubbing for US television is absolutely pitifuly. Of course, this was the 50's and they were trying to make the lines match the plot AND lip movement exactly, which resulted in the characters speaking very fast, or very slow. And it comes of as just plain silly. Of course, it has a nice 50's feeling to it, so it's good for nostalgia. I would prefer to watch this show as it was meant to be seen... in japanese, with english subtitles. Unfortunately, only TWO episodes are availble in Japanese with english subtitles. If they can do that with 2 episodes, they could do it with all of them. That's why I can't give this set 5 stars, despite how much I love Astro Boy and Osamu Tezuka's work
