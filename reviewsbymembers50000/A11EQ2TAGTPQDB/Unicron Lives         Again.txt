 In this disc, the episodes include the introduction of Omega Supreme and Roablock, the Re-birth of Unicron, and the death of two characters, who I won't mention if you do not know and don't want it spoiled. These episodes mainly concern Unicron's re-birth and possessing both Megatron and Shockblast. These are some great Energon episodes, but again, they skip episodes and it interferes with continuity
