 This movie is wonderful. It is a fictional story based around Hans Christian Andersen's life and how he day dreamed his classic stories with the help of The Sandman(Cyril Ritchard), such as Chris's encounter with the little mermaid(Haley Mills) and the Evil Sea-Witch(Talluah Bankhead), His adventures with Thumbelina(Patty Duke) ,Mr. Field-Mouse(Boris Karloff) and Mr. Mole(Sessue Hayakawa), and of course the Emperor (Ed Wynn) and the two rogue tailors (Victor Borge and Terry Thomas). An All star cast comes together ! this is a wonderful family film!
