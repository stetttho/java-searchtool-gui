 This film is either hated by those who simply "don't get it", or loved by self-proclaimed film buffs and art students. The film is a horror film about a man who cuts himself with an electric razor, and through a completely bizzare infection, starts to become metal himself. This "infection" also causes him to have frightening nightmares that allude to him being a homosexual, and homosexuality is the underlying message. "Tetsuo" is a film that clearly has something to say, but it delivers the message poorly. Metal and Homosexuality have little to no metaphorical connection, so it really becomes confusing. Later, this man has to confront another man who he hit with a car, and infected him with the same ailment, and that man is the physical symbol for becoming open with his sexuality. The ending actually gives a message that homosexuality is destroying society, or will destroy it. All in all, it's decent as a thriller, but as an art film, it falls flat.
