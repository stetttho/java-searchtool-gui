 I really liked the book as others share in their review.  But, I guess I really need some basics in regards to a break down.  This book covers how to just get in and do the whole body, slowly laryering with charcoal.  I like working in the charcoal, it is fast and easy to work with in regards to fixing mistakes.  Once charcoal is in place, other mediums can be used over it if you are wanting to make your drawing into a painting.  It is a good book though.  The fours stars is only because I was expecting some breakdown of the figures.
