 The book had many pictures of finished products and a lot to read.  I am visual and was thinking maybe it would show step by step pictures and how it is done.  I have never used clay or done any sort of pottery, so it didn't really help me.  I bought it for my class in college, but I never used it.  Instead, I just got my hands dirty and learned by doing.
