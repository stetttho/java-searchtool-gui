 This was a good book.  It helped alot.  Of course the test is not that hard.  So anybody using this book should be confident to do well on the test.  It has a good review over what will be covered on the test.  I was so nervous, but as I was taking the test, it all came back to me.  I would definately recommend this book.  I don't think any other book is needed.  I know some preparations require a few books, but since the CBEST is an easy test, this one book should do you fine.  It did for me.  I passed ya know!  FYI - The CBEST only covers stuff at a BASIC high school level.
