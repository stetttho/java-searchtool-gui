 The CD's do look like they are made from someones home.  When I opened it, some of the CD's fell out.  They are not securely placed in there, making it easy for the CD's to get scratched. More importantly is the learning process.  It turned me off.  The english speaking guy is so monotone and drab.  He asks the spanish speaker to say this, now say that, lets learn this word now.  He doesn't tie anything together, I find it hard to learn and pick up on it.  THE PIMSLEUR method is better.  I learn so much quicker, and immediately from the beginning of the CD.   It was definately a waste of my money.
