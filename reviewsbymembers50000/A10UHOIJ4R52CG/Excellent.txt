 Very good works in this book.  Great for developing ideas of your own.  There are a few step by step instructions, but it is mainly just pictures of artworks by various artists.  Some of the work in this book is fantastic.  The book is a bit expensive, I suggest getting it from a library first to determine if you really want to buy it.
