 Not only educational, but inspiring.  I not only learned about each artist and what when on during their time of certain artworks, but I was able to get inside their head.  The words of the artist's in their letters were captivating.  I was caught up in the reading.  I especially enjoyed Matisse and Kandinsky.  Kandinsky is very spiritual about his writing and gives a deep explanation of colors.  Anyway, it is a great read.  It was required for my history course, but I enjoyed it.  Not very many in my class could understand what they were reading.  I guess you not only need intellect, but sophistication.  I liked it!
