 I bought this a few days ago, I'm going to get my money back.  Because I can't communicate with it past a few blocks!  It says 7 miles, but I can't even get close to a mile!  What a waste of money.  I got four for the family plus with a charger.  I spent too much money for this to be not working like it says it should.  I think motorola would be a better brand, or even pac bell!  Stay away from this!  Find a different brand.
