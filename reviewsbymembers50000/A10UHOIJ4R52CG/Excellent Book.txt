 I had to get this book for my Design class in college.  Great book.  We didn't go through the whole book, but I kept the book after the class was over because there is some practical information for the art student.  There is a bunch of information that i can use to apply to my own artwork, as well as a history of some past art works used as examples.  The photos are all in color and there is many of them.   This book is a great introduction, but it is a wealth of information.  The reading is easy and doesn't bore me.   I don't know about some people, but reading a text can be cumbersome, but not this book.  I really do learn alot just from this book alone without a class.
