 I like this book.  The techniques are awesome.  This is a good book for a beginner, or one who wants to explore other ideas that they may not have thought of.  What I like is that it is focused on acrylic only.  There are not many books on just acrylic.  Many painting books seem to cover oil techniques and claim that the techniques can be applied to other mediums.  But, you can only go so far, becuase oil and acrylic have two different characterisics.
