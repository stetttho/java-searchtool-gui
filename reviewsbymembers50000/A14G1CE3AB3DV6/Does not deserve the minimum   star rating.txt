 This is about as good as a "Laser Hawk." Do they even have a C or D rating for a flick? Too bad. What is amazing is that there is TV stuff that is so much better - and this has the look, feel, plot, and acting of a really bad 70s TV show.  I think this movie should be revised as follows: 1. Dub all the dialog, ala woody allen, and create a spoof on bad sci fi movies. 2. Make the Amtrog company an operative of Folgers coffee, and they are planning on using the missile to stop Starbucks coffee production. 3. Let the Meteor Tycus be the wrath of god (purely metaphor) upon the entire stinking C and D movie genre, portrayed as the coffee shop of the 90's culture. 4. Let the undercover reporter be a guy who really wants a job there, and is just trying to get in to get all the great Amtrog Benefits. I can't imagine the rights to the piece of junk cost more than 1000.00 - it is the worst of the worst. So, I have some home movies that are a tad better than this - does some schmuck out there want to print them on DVD in major distro for me? NO? Then why this junk...
