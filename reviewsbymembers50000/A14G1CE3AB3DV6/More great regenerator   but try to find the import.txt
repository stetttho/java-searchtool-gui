 It's great, has some unique mixes, but why doesn't Amazon carry the import version? I have both, and enjoy the US Version - but the two disc import is permanently loaded in my CD Changer! If you're not familiar with this duo, they are a unique blend of industrial, goth, and techno - haunting vocals, substantial social commentary, and great groove. Try to get the import set - but if you can't, pick this up - better yet get them both.
