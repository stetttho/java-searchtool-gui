 This is not a review - writing a review of this album would be ludicrous. It would be like chiming in to state that the earth orbits the sun. Instead I'm just dropping in to pay homage at the shrine.  Hendrix stands alone, like some psychadelic induced cosmic prophet, translating time and space into something new. But rather than being a product of the drug, he became the vision of the drug; the psychadelic experience itself was changed by the impact of this man's vision and consciousness, and changed permanently and irrevocably. This stands as the most influential vinyl ever cut, a monument of human genius.  If God is an art collector, then this is the prized masterpiece, and Jimi is the art prophet incarnate.
