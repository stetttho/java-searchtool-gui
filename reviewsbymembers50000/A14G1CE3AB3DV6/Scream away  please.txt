 Death Ride 69 is still a cool name, takes me back to the Crypt, Zombie Zoo, or the Scream. I used to really like this band - and highly recommend Elvis Christ if you can find it (the CD on little sister).  It amazes me how a project like this, despite having changed every member but linda, for the last 15 years, could possibly still be putting out material. The current release gets better with listening, however I do not hear anything entirely original. The original lineup was extremely original - and very influential of the LA Sound. Keep our fingers crossed and hope Linda finds a home.
