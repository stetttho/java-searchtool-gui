 I have to say I have some mixed feelings about this bands work, however it is on a purely theological basis... bottom line the tracks themselves are awesome... it is a statement to their artistic abilities to bring so much emotion to the surface in a listener, sometimes subtle, and sometimes right in my face. Othertimes I catch myself slipping into this erie dream with them, buying it all lock, stock, and barrell. Grinding beats, proto-plasmic electronica dripping from every groove, Patrice with her haunting voice and lyrics and Wrex's backdrop of deep, sonorous, and sometimes apocalyptic overtones... this record gets better with each listen. I disagree with those that say it is prophetic of the events of the past year, rather I would say that they were in tune to the underlying darkness, unrest, and hatred which our society (conveniently) ignores. For me the mix of what I find beautiful and sometimes revolting about their work reminds me much of the end of Herman Hesse's Sidhartha, when Siddhartha is enlightened, and the beauty and tragedy of life is canvassed upon his face, from the brutality of murder, to the innocence and potenitial of a newborn baby, it's all there. Hey, it's all there on this CD.. Buy it. For those into industrial and techno, it is a must have.
