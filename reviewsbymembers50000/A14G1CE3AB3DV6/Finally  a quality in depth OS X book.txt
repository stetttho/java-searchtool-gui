 This book succeeds where most others fail. The index is wonderful. Each section has the information presented from high-level point and click to low-level details for configurationn. Succint, yet very readable. Highly accurate. I am mainly a Solaris user, and often find myself in strange territory dealing with netinfo (Solaris is all text file based configurations), and this book covers all of the services you will want (and need ) to configure. I unfortunately bought two other books before this one, desperate for the information. They were the Max OSX missing manual, and Max OS X The Complete reference. Save your money, the other two are now worthy only of paper weights. This book does what the others set out to do. I certainly hope they upgrade it for Jaguar. With the release of 10.2, much of the information presented could be outdated.
