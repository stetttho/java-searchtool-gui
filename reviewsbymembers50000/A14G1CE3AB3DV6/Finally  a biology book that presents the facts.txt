 Rather than harping on about the many Icons of Evolution errouneously included in many Biology textbooks, this book cuts to the core by carefully presenting the Biological facts - and nothing more. Hopefully, this text will become more widely used in universities replacing much of the misinformation now disseminated. I would also recommend this as a good home reference book, to help educate your children on what really is, and answer some of their more difficult questions. 5 solid stars!
