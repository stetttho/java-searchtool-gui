 This is a movie that makes fun of retards. Produced by hipsters. Think about it. Wow. Because believe you me, MTV screenwriters are so ultra-slick and hollywood gleaming cool, that they can make such a crappy movie about pathetic mid-west retards, and people will think it's cool. That's just MTV. The humor is the crappiness, see? And you're supposed to laugh. That keeps them in the cool. Because otherwise, well, you see, then otherwise they're not cool. They'd be jerks. But far better for you to think they're cool, so the real jerk will be you, and not them. And then far worse, you can think anybody who actually says this is crap-de-la-crap is a real jerk.  This is a movie about people who are so pathetically nerdy that they are clearly caricatures created by those who seem them as such - yet the caricatures will win over the jocks at the end of the movie - thereby attracting a certain type of nerdy retard wannabe to think it's cool; and that's the jocks turned MTV screenwriter plan, because only somebody as truly pathetic as these characters in this story could like it.   It's really a simple test they've created ...did you like it?  Aren't you cool?  Sorry, I'm not so hip. I think this is trash, and have found better stories on urinal walls.
