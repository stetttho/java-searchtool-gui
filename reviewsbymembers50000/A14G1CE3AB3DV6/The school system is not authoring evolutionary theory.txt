 While I am overjoyed that somebody is exposing some of the incredibly stupid notions that have filtered down to the school systems from the scientific community, I am depressed that his focus is on all of these SECONDARY sources!   It is in effect an argument against the copyists, not against the scientists themselves, who are in no way the source or defenders of such claims. It is akin to waging a war by focusing entirely on media misconceptions - never sending an actual troop to the front lines.  Let's focus on what the Evolutionists are saying - not the poorly educated and uniformed school teachers, whom have nothing to do with the formation of current evolutionary theory.
