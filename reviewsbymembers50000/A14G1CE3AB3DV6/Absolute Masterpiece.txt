 This is an exceptional movie.  This movie has a depth that is rare; seldom are movies like this made. The plot reveals itself slowly, carefully, winding to an incredible and inexorable revelation at the end.  How could  such a thing, made by mortal hands, have such a captivating (even  enslaving) effect? Watch and see.  To me this was fascinating because  never has a movie so closely revealed the power and attraction of music;  this violin captures the very soul of music -- an all consuming passion,  evoking the best and worst in us all. This is simply one of the best  movies made. After watching it one feels that 99.99% of movies are garbage.   The Red Violin is a masterpiece.
