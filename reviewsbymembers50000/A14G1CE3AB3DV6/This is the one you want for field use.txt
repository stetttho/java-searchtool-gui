 Been through several others - this is the definitive one. The black background white stars are perfect for field usage. I hold my flace a suitable distance to make it the same scale as the sky. It actually works. If you dim your light (or squint your eyes), the lower magnitude stars disappear - instant recognition of what you can see through your finder. It includes overlays for a Telrad (heads up bullseye 1x finder). Other overlays include co-ordinates to use with your setting circles (or DSC style counters/readouts, etc). This is a must have, no matter what scope you use. I use this with my Meade LX90. Even if your scope is computer controlled (like my LX90), you will want and need a good star chart. Believe it or not, this star chart is so good it inspired my wife, using only a pair of 16x50 binoculars. The lamination is important. Nothing worse than the inevitable bug smears on a star chart. You can sponge these off. Combined with a decent book like the Sky Atlas Companion you are armed for year round viewing. They are so beautiful and complete, on a cloudy night you can enjoy reading them and preparing a night's journey for clear skies. Get this one - you will never regret it.
