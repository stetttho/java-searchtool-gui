 This book has some awesome documents which in themselves contain a side of United States history that is often untold.  Thus, the way I would approach this book is to read the documents and only the documents.  Zinn, I think, gets a little caught up in that looking on the other side of things and starts to preach.  He not only preaches, he actually starts telling you what to think.  I mean, if you think about it, that's what every book attempts to do, but he really hits you hard, and after a while, it's kind of like, I just can't take it anymore.  In fact, he is so interested in looking at the other side, that he becomes really one-sided.  He becomes so indulged with the side that no one looks at, that he, at times, does not even give merit to the side that is generally accepted.  He seems unable to recognize anything but what he wants to say, and that annoys me.  I think that this book would have done better as a collection of documents, because it really contains some excellent documents, but as a book with commentary, it's mostly unreadable.
