 This is about the most boring and dull AP prep book that I have encountered, and believe me, I have seen a lot of them.  It gives you good practice and a lot of words to study, but is so boring!  I mean, there is nothing in the book that helps you to at least try to focus on what you're doing.  But maybe that's good for some people.  It's very straightforward and it will give you more than enough practice.  For example, to prep you for the speaking section, it offers a couple hundred(about three-hundred or so?) of possible questions that they could ask you.  The tapes that are included are excellent.  They really help you to practice for both the listening and speaking questions.  So I don't know, this might be the perfect for some people, but as for me, this book was not just another one of those, argh, I have to study again type books, this was a bite the bullet and force myself to use book.  I don't expect to be entertained or anything, but something that would occassionally keep me awake would be nice.  By the way, the grammar review is not that great.  It's not that long and at times, does not go as in depth as one would like.  I passed the language exam, and whether or not its due to this book, I don't know, but I know that this book certainly did not elevate my knowledge to some divine level like some other test prep books have done.
