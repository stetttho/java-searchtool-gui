 This is a good book, I'm not denying that, but it's got some serious flaws that everyone definitely needs to be aware of.  Its end of the chapter  questions and simulated test questions are WAY too easy!  Basically, I got  almost all of them right since they came nowhere near the difficulty of the  actual AP exam.  Also, brief is good.  We all like brief.  But some of the  chapters are just way too brief.  I mean, sometimes, all the book did was  like laundry list formulas.  That's great and all, but that's like telling  someone, okay, PV=nRT, now you know the ideal gas law.  I mean, a little  explaining would help. I don't mean to sound all like I hated this book  or anything.  I didn't.  Its cracking the Descriptive Chemistry part of the  test is so absolutely, amazingly helpful, that I think that I would have  gotten everything wrong on that section without the Princeton Review.  But,  I cannot stress enough the fact that using this book alone is a big no-no.   If your budget can only afford you to get one book, get the Barron's.  But,  if you can buy two, getting this book and the Barron's should help you  conquer any question that the evil maniacs at ETS stick in front of you.   It sure helped me.  I got a five...=)
