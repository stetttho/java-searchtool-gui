 I'm sorry, but I just don't understand how people can not like this book.  This book was amazing and awesome and I owe any and all of my score to this book.  My teacher taught us nothing and my textbook was even worse.  I did not know anything nor did I understand anything.  I saught this book out of desperation after even reading the Cliffs confused me.  Biology at that point was just confusing and frustrating, and none of it sank in.  This book made it all make sense.  It helped me understand so much.  Photosynthesis, respiration, mitosis, meiosis, ecology, it all started to click.  After finishing a section in this book, I went to the Cliffs to get the nuances and a deeper understanding.  Did I mention that I hated my textbook?  I did not read more than a fourth of that book, it was just aweful, and in class, I did my math homework, because trying to pay attention was a complete waste of time and effort.  Thus, at least for me, this book and the Cliffs replaced a bulky 1,200 page textbook, a teacher, and a year of biology.  I went into the test feeling prepared enough to pass, but my score amazed both myself and everyone who knows me and my experience with biology.  Somehow, I managed to get a five.  Did the Princeton Review help?  You bet!
