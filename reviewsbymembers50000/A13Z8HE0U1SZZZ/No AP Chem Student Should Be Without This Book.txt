 I'm serious too.  The guy who found this book tediously long is only saying that 'cause he hadn't taken the test before he wrote his review.   But for me, the test is over, and as a reflection, I don't know what I  would have done without this book.  Seriously, I had an awesome AP Chem  teacher.  I mean, his homework and test questions were harder than the ones  on the actual AP exam, but this book helped so incredibly much. As I was  working through this book, I quelled my dissapointment of missing about  half the questions at the end of each chapter and in the sample tests by  assuring myself of the fact that Barron's is known for its harder than  actual thing type simulations.  Not this book.  The test was totally hard,  but luckily, not harder than the sample tests in this book.  If you want an  accurate representation of the actual AP test, I strongly recommend this  book.  And, if you're thinking of getting the Princeton Review, DO NOT buy  it without buying this book as well.  I was hardely missing a question at  the end of the chapters with that book and the sample tests were assuring  me of high fives.  It was just insanely easy.  Also, it screwed me over on  one of the free response questions(I wrote like a page for part i of part a  and ran out of the time for the rest of the question).  For some miraculous  reason, I still ended up with a five, but now that I look back, it wasn't  so much of a miracle.  I was just prepared because I bought this book at  the beginning of the year and I recommend that you do the same.  It doesn't  work miracles unless you use it, but if you do, I think that you'll find it  a very helpful guide for the incredibly hard AP test(and yes, it is a VERY  hard test).
