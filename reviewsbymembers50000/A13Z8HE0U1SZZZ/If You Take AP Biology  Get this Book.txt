 Buy this book, borrow this book, steal this book.  I don't care how you get this book, just get this book!  There is no better book out there for the AP Biology test and I am living proof of that.  The Princeton Review is a great book that helps you get all of the concepts nailed, but you won't get all the details from the Princeton alone.  You will, however, from this book.  I normally don't say this about prep books, but you really don't need a textbook.  This book does not just offer you a review, but used properly, it can teach the material as well.  The text book we used was horrible and unreadable(If you're using Biological Sciences by Keeton and Gould, know that I feel for you) and our teacher was not exactly much help either.  Oh yeah, this book features a great review of the labs too.  This was extremely helpful considering that out of the fourteen required labs, our class managed to do none of them.  How did I get a five?  The question baffles me too.  But I certainly know where to start.  This book and the Princeton Review, nothing more, nothing less.
