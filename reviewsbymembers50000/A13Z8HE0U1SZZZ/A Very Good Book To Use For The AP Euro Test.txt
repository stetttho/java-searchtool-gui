 I bought four books for the AP European History test(this one, the Princeton Review's, REA's, and this book called Modern European History).  This was actually the only book that I got all the way through(and I did  the last two chapters right before the test).  This is an awesome book.   The chapters are short, but you really get a good understanding of the  material.  The book focuses a lot on the essay part of the test(which is  good 'cause my strategy was to ace the essay part, get 50% right on the  multiple choice, and get a 5).  It gives a lot of prompts for essays for  you to write(if you actually have time) and also gives you sample essays.   One thing to beware of.  Do not attempt to write essays like the sample  essays they give you.  I mean, like the ones they rated a five were like  seventeen paragraphs long or something!  Like you're going to have time to  do that on the test.  Stick to your five paragraph essays.  However,  despite the fact that you're not going to write essays like the ones they  give you, I found the sample essays really helpful.  They summed up a lot  of things and made connections that really helped me see the causes and  effects of certain events.  This is just a great book.  I really recommend  that you buy this one if you're studying for the AP Euro test, although if  you can, try to get the Princeton Review's too.  I think that the books  work better together than they do alone.
