 A very good test prep book to use for the AP European History test.  I used this book, Barron's, the one from REA with software, this Modern European History book that my teacher made us buy from him.  I recommend  this one, the Barron's, and the REA, but I recommend this one the most.   However, if you didn't have a good teacher, this one might be a bit brief  for you and you should probably try the REA instead.  But if you did, like  I did(Cummings!), this is the book to get.  You can read the 100 page  history review like the night before the test, but it's probably a better  idea if you had already gone through the book and just did that just to  quickly refreash everything.  Heck, you can read the 100 pages right before  the test(if your test is in the afternoon).  They bold all the main points  and give you the ideas that connect everything, so you see how events  relate to each other instead of just learning facts.  I ended up with a  five on the test, which is amazing considering the fact that I knew nothing  that happened after World War II, except that there was some cold war or  something like that between the United States and Russia.  Oh yeah, and get  this book at the beginning of the year rather than a couple months(or days)  before the actual test.  It'll help you with your in class tests too.
