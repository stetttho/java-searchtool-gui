 I was skeptical about ditching the traditional Barron's and Princeton Review study guides and switching over to this book.  But, since this  seemed to be the latest edition out there, I thought that I'd give it a  shot.  Basically, after working through the whole thing, taking the test,  and receiving my score, I knew that I would never buy another Kaplan book.   I expected to get a much higher score after coming out of a very rigorous  AP Chemistry class and as, I would later find out, getting a five on the  extremely hard AP test.  Obviously, I was dissapointed.  But I don't know,  maybe this just wasn't the right book for me.  I knew my chemistry, I just  didn't know the SAT II test, and basically, Kaplan did a pretty lousy job  of explaining it.  It could have given a lot more practice for the totally  bizzare 'Relationship Analysis Questions' just because they're so out of  the ordinary.  Also, the diagnostic tests are pretty bad in that they  include quite a bit of problems that you absolutely cannot do without a  calculator, even though the SAT II does not allow the use of a calculator.   The review section, though, wasn't that bad.  Not to say that it couldn't  have been better, but I think that it gives a pretty good review of  chemistry.  If all you need is more chemistry review, then maybe this is a  good book for you.  But as for me, I'm sticking to Barron's and Princeton  Review from now on.
