 If there's one thing that this book has taught me to do, it's how to really deconstruct.  I used to have absolutely no idea what to write when an essay asked me to analyze rhetorical devices.  I would be like, uh, yeah, the author is trying to say this, but I could never understand the techniques that the author uses to get things across.  This book has really helped me to do that.  Even though it's a pretty short section, it opened my eyes up to possible things to discuss.  For example, the length of sentences say a lot.  The author may have many long, convoluted sentences, but then one sort, terse, to the point sentence.  This sentence is what the author really wants to drive home and is used to create mood or the atmosphere.  I have only really looked at the first section because I took the AP English Language test and the first section is dedicated to that test.  I, however, am looking forward to using this book again next near when I take the Literature test.  There is only one flaw with this book, however, and that's the sample tests.  I appreciate that they're harder than the actual thing, which is how most Barron's books are, but I also feel that they don't give you an accurate feel of the way things are and they're not good for pacing yourself.  If you want sample tests, try the Cliffs, but for writing pointers, defintely take a look at this book.  I'm sure that it's at least part of the reason for my five on the Language exam.
