 My AP European History teacher actually made us buy this book from him at the beginning of the year.  To tell you the truth, I probably only got a third of the way through this book.  It was just way too long and detailed.   I mean, seriously, it's like 600 something pages!   And, all it gave you  were facts, facts, facts.  It does nothing to help you make connections,  and the AP Euro test expects you to make connections.  I know someone who  like basically memorized this whole book(that's like 600 pages of european  history), but only ended up with a 3.  That's because the test does not  just test your knowledge of facts.  It tests how well you can put those  facts together.  Buy the Princeton Review's prep book instead.  It's brief,  concise, and to the point.
