 I bought this album only because of how much everyone talks about how good  this band is.  Wow were they wrong.  When I first listened to this CD after  I bought it, the first thing I thought was that I had heard this before.   This CD sounds, sadly like a half-and-half mix of KoRn and Limp Bizkit.   Just think old Limp Bizkit guitars with less punch, with Jon Davis' whiny,  nasal vocals and horrible lyrics, with a rhythmic verse.  It's really not  that hard.  This is just another rap-metal album in a long line of  mediocrity.
