 I saw Jebediah with Jimmy Eat World a few months ago and I must say that I didn't like them at first.  I didn't understand what he was saying, and quite frankly, was just looking forward to Jimmy Eat World.  My friend bought both this and the split EP with Jebediah and JEW and both are really good.  I only give this a 4 because my fav. Jeb. song, Harpoon, isn't on this, but I like the song Animal alot.  The rest of the album is emo-tinged but is really just Austrailian pop-rock.  It's good, though.
