 grade broke up 2 years ago, but i was lucky enough to see them before they broke up.  they were such a good band and this is their best record.  it's a shame that everybody seems to forget about them these days.  any idiot kid who thinks that the used and story of the year are the best bands ever seriously needs to be locked in a room with this record on repeat for about a week.  i can't really explain why i love this band so much with words.  i just do.
