 first of all, i don't understand why kids have always had such a phobia about their favorite bands changing, especially after one album.  anyone with half a brain know that while tell all your friends was fun, there wasn't much substance to it.  it was a pop-punk record, catchy as hell but not particularly mature or interesting.  backstory notwithstanding, fred from breaking pangaea (a very underrated band to begin with) joined taking back sunday for their new record and his impact is undoubtedly felt here.  this album is so catchy but also seems to have some substance.  taking back sunday are still a pop-punk band but are less pop-punk and more indie rock and mature pop-rock than before.  and that's okay.  there's no 'cute without the e' but there's doesn't need to be.  this album is perfect summer 2004 music and that's just fine as far as i'm concerned.  it was the album that they needed to release and i was kinda shocked that it was so good to first hear it, but i dig it.  in conclusion, kids who don't like the change:  you'll always have story of the year and switchfoot.
