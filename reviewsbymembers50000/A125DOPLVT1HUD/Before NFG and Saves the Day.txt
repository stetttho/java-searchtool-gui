 When emopunk was actually emo and punk, with good pop writing, there was  Samiam.  These guys did the whole non-whiny emo thing when grunge was still  big, with Jawbreaker, and is one of the few bands from then that's still  going strong.  This is an album I enjoy very much.  That's all I have to  say.
