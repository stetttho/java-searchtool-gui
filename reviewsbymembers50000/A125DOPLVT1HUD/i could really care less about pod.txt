 but the reason that i'm writing is to let you idiot kids know that "whoever that guy is that does guest vocals on 'without jah, nothin'" is H.R. from the LEGENDARY BAD BRAINS.  maybe you kids might wanna check them out.  aside from being the first hardcore band ever...  (or one of the first)...  they know a thing or two about good music.  which most of you kids don't.
