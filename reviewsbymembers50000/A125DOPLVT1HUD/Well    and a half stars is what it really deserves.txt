 This CD rocks.  It's the kind that you can put in your CD player and listen to from beginning to end without getting tired of it.  With that said, I must also say that I can't give it 5 stars.  Why?  Because I've  heard better.  It's not them.  I've given 5 stars to other CD's that were  not any better than this, but I feel that it's time now for my standards to  get a little higher.  But enough about me, this doesn't change the fact  that it's a great CD, it's just not quite perfect.                    P.S.  It's very close, though.
