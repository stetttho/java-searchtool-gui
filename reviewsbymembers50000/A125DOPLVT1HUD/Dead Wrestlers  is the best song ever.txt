 What a great song.  Probably one of the best songs that I've ever heard.  The rest of the EP is good even though I don't think that they could ever write a song as good as "Dead Wrestlers" again.  That's the only thing.  If every song by Bis was as good as this song, they'd be the best band ever.  All of my friends like this song, even though they don't like dance-pop.  The difference between this and radio dance pop is that this is actually intelligent.  Something in music that I've been looking for quite a while for.
