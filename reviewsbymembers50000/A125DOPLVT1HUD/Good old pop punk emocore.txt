 Nobody can deny that "pop-punk-emocore" is *finally* making a dent in the music industry, everyone is trying to be like the Get Up Kids.  Well, here's a band that does without sounding like they're trying to.   Their music is punky and poppy at the same time, the singer has a very  powerful voice, but they're not really obviously derivitive of any one  band.  They have really catchy melodies, but their words are, well, weird.  Not as in a bad weird, it's a good weird. It's a very interesting weird.   And the booklet is awesome, with the funny little "party" story.   Why are these guys so awesome?  I think it's because the lyrics were  obviously not written for music, they were written seperatly, which  therefore makes them a little odd.  But singer Chris Conley does a  tremendous job of making the otherwise odd lyrics work great with the song.   And he does that whole "singing with your stomach" thing, which  really enunciates the words and makes them take on different meanings the  way he says them.  This is just a really, really cool band.  They're not  "great" in the "Elton John" sense, but I really don't  think they're trying to be.  They're just, well, themselves.
