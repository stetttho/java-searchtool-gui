 when suicide notes and butterfly kisses came out and blew up, i hated atreyu.  i had only heard parts of their record and thought it was total crap.  i saw no redeeming value in atreyu's music, and found it to be bad emometal.  friends of mine who i would have never guessed to like that record kind of did, however, and when this album was released and they were touting it (some being metal fans and some not so much), i didn't really put a ton of stock into it.  until i heard the track "right side of the bed" and found that, wow, there's an atreyu song i actually like.  and on a whole, this is representative of much of this record for me.  they incorporate more diverse metal-type influences, and steer away from being a bad emometal band.  there are still parts of this record where it certainly still sounds like old atreyu, but there's increased songwriting ability.  the album opens much stronger than it closes, and i still don't think, on a whole, it a terrible good album, but it's worth checking out for a couple of very good songs, and hopefully atreyu continues in this direction.
