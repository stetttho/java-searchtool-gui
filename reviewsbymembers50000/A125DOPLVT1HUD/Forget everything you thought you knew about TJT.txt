 1 word can be used to describe this album:  Different.  Even the version  of "If I Told You This Was Killing Me....." is different than it  was on the EP, with wacky effects and stuff.  I don't really know what to  think, I love it but it's missing something very important that Understand  this is a Dream had, I don't know what it is, I want to say passion, but  not really.  I've come to the conclusion that the Juliana Theory's goal is  to keep people on edge, and make them freak out whenever they hear new  stuff.  I don't know.....it's not Understand this is a Dream, but I think  that TJT has reached their goal of what they wanted to do.   And if they're  happy then so am I.  Now I realize who they remind me of musically on the  new album:  Third Eye Blind.  Take that for what it's worth.
