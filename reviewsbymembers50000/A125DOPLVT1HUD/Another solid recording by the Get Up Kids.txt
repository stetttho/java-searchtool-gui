 Released in between Four Minute Mile and Something to Write Home About,  this recording isn't great, but it's standard Get Up Kids, who are of  course awesome, and therefore, while not being great, still gets 5 stars  for being flawless.  The version of Red Letter Day on this is better than  the one on the album, and the rest of the songs are good as well.
