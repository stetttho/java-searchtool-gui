 OOOOOOH I USED TO BE IN VERUCA SALT THAT MAKES ME PUNKRAWK.  I must be Stacy Jones, singer of American Hi-Fi, and former drummer of Veruca Salt.  I must be a Grade A jerk because I put out my self-titled album with a pop-punk song that was all over the airwaves.  Lots of dumb teenagers named bought my record and were upset when the rest of the songs weren't punk rawk at all but friendly, unoffensive poprock.  Now here it is in 2003 and the hot new thing is garage rock and emo so I think I'm going to put out a new single that sounds like garage rock, cut my hair and wear a Thursday shirt in the video so people know that I'm really "down."  Buy our record.  We're GODAWFUL!
