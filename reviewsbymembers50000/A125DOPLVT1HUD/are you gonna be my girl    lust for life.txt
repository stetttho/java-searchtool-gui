 jet = trendy "retro" pseudoclassic crap.  who seriously like this?  you'd have to have amnesia or something to not know that this is a complete ripoff of important music from the '60s and '70s.  somebody should push these guys, kings of leon, the vines, the white stripes and all the rest of them off a cliff.  seriously.
