 Buy it now before they become just another poppy whiny Vagrant band.....From Here to Infirmary was good, but hinting at where they're probably going from there, which is pure Blink-ish pop.  These are their best songs.  Get these songs, because it's not an album.  Oh yeah, and if you just heard "Stupid Kid" and you get this and you don't like this, it's just proof that you're part of the new millenium "emo" crowd and you should just go buy "Stay What You Are" by Saves the Day.
