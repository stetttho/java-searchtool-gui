 these guys seem to be one of those "you'll absolutely love them" or "you'll absolutely hate them" bands.  when i first heard taking back sunday, i fell into the latter category.  i thought they were just basically saves the day part 2 (back when saves the day were still good).  the whole nu-screamo (tbs, finch, the used, thursday, every "emo" band on victory nowadays) thing hadn't really started taking off yet, and i liked thursday, so the overall sound isn't what initially turned me off to them.  it was the fact that i thought that they were extremely derivative and sounded like just about everybody else.  i still feel that way.  however, taking back sunday and i have had quite the love/hate relationship over the past year, since i got a burnt copy of "tell all your friends".  the first thing i noticed was how amazing of a song "cute without the e" is.  right there is perhaps the perfect example of the perfect pop song.  not brainless, but simple and catchy enough to have mass appeal.  there's a few other songs on this album that i genuinely thing stand out.  "there's no i in team," "you're so last summer" and "great romances of the 20th century".  otherwise, this album is frustratingly narrow-sighted.  i imagine that, with 2 new band members, tbs will most likely go the route of bands such as saves the day and brand new, changing their sound by next album, and that's probably a very good idea.  just a whole 10 songs of this is kind of overkill, not to mention the whole new generation of clone bands that have followed.  it's not that taking back sunday don't have loads of potential, or that they are bad, they're just not quite as removed from their pop-punk roots as most of their fans would like to think.  this isn't screamo, kids.  it's not bad, but it's not screamo.
