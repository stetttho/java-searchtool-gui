 just a few facts to start you kids off with: 1)  emometal is huge right now (poison the well, from autumn to ashes, etc...) 2)  most people tend to be scared of christian bands 3)  scandinavian metal rules! and now, what this record has to do with those 3 facts: 1)  as i lay dying are, perhaps, emometal.  however, there are no overdone melodic sung chorus parts here (with the exception of maybe 2 songs, but they're short and actually fit, as opposed to just being thrown in to make the record more accessable or catchy). 2)  i'm not religious.  and i tend to hate preachy christian (or whatever) bands based on my own preferences.  i didn't find out that as i lay dying were considered to be a "christian band" (as opposed to just being a band that happens to have some christian dudes in the band) until after i heard them for the first time.  seriously.  so if i loved them then, why shouldn't i love them now? 3)  this record has some elements of scandinavian metal in the songs.  you can never go wrong there.  seriously. on a whole, i feel that some of the songs on this record tend to blend together a little bit too much, but, track 6 "behind me lies another fallen soldier" breaks up the monotony right at the perfect time.  what an amazing song.  when i first heard that song, my first impression was "this is what mineral would've sounded like had they been a metal band."  as a whole, i have to say that this is a promising effort from a good band.
