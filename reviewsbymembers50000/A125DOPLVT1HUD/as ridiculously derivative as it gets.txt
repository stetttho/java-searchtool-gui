 it's kind of amazing that the boys in sparta can make an album so uninspired and completely leeching off of the genius of cedric and omar (for those who don't know, their former bandmates in you-know-who) and still find people who likes/buys this.  i'm not going to say much, other than, if you want to hear anything interesting, pick up the mars volta record.  thank you.
