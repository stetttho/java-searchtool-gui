 if any of you kids ever decide that you're sick of listening to mediocre crap like matchbook romance and the used and beloved and silverstein, you really need to check out grade.  they're broken up which is a shame because i'm sure that kyle bishop would kick all those stupid kids' butts.  i'm serious.  grade's only crime was arriving about 7 years too early (late '90's for separate the magnets & and such is progress...) and not sticking it out for another year and a half or so.  if they would've, they'd have been huge.  come to think of it, probably not, as most of you kids wouldn't know good music if it took a dump on your leg. this record is not as poppy as under the rader, considerably more metal and the production is so high on the treble and low on the bass.  but it's just as good, in my opinion.  then again, it's not like any of you kids know who grade are to begin with.
