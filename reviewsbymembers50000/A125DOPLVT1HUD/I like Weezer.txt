 I went and got this album as soon as I got out of school yesterday.  I went home and listened to it.  I think it's very good.  But I don't think it's as consistent as their other efforts.  Then again, it must have been so hard to try to live up to the hype surrounding, well, =w=.  Everyone likes Weezer, and for having not put out an album in 5 years, they must be more popular now than they ever were.  Even they have said that they don't understand it at all, and they don't know where all this came from.  People have called them the forefathers of emo.  Emo schmemo.  Rivers & co. have said they don't know what emo is.  They had never heard of the Get Up Kids before going on tour with them.  I think that may be part of the problem.  All of these self-proclaimed "emo" kids look at Weezer as way more than what they are, which is a good rock band.  They think that Weezer are musical gods, but in reality, I think that Rivers just knows how to write a good pop song.  I think that part of the problem with this album is that it's so short, but then again, if you take out the long 10th tracks on the Blue Album and Pinkerton, those albums would be just about as long.  I think that this album sounds like the Beatles, and I'm sure I'm not the only one that notices that on the second half of the album, Rivers sounds like Ringo Starr.  I don't think that this is a bad album by any means though.  It's much better than anything you will hear on the radio these days.
