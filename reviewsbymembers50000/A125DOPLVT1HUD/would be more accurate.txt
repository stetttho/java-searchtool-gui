 Samiam seems to me to be one of those bands that keep chugging along and writing good music.  They haven't branched out or tried new things, but in this case, why would they?  Samiam is one of those rare bands that could put out the same album 10 times and each time it would be fine for them to do so.  They keep putting out good tunes and that's good enough.  A rock radio station around here actually plays the song Mudhill regularly, even though they usually play Creed and Styx.  That's not where I first heard Samiam though.  I heard about them in the emo scene, so I think that's the most accurate description of their music:  commercial emo that doesn't compromise its' integrity.  And that's one good feat there.
