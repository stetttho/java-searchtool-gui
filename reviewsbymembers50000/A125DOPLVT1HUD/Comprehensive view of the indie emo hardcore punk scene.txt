 I bought this back when I was just getting into the whole scene and the only band I knew on the comp was Texas is the Reason. This comp opened me up into a vast prarie of great bands just screaming for my attention. It got me to get albums by The Promise Ring, Braid, At the Drive-In, Samiam, and Knapsack. The reason I don't have the other albums is because I cannot find them, or am not a big fan of their other stuff, which is the case with Drve Like Jehu, Jawbox, and HUM. But every song on here is beyond solid, and the comp plays like an album. It's a very emotionally and intellectually stimulating package of music, one which I strongly enjoy.  My only problem is that there haven't been any other titles like this put out, because I would love for there to be a NOWCORE 2, and possibly many more after that, maybe including some stuff from bands like Sunny Day Real Estate, Lifetime, Rites of Spring, Embrace, Dag Nasty, Fugazi, Brandtson, Far, Jimmy Eat World, Sense Field, etc.   I'd totally buy it.  Just an idea.  But until there is a NOWCORE 2, pick this up.
