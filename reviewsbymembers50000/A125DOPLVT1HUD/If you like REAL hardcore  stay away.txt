 There is perhaps one decent song on this album, short stories with tragic endings, however, it is far too long and not "epic" like so many people claim.  FATA aren't a "hardcore" band nor are they an "emo" band like so many claim.  They're basically a metal band with stupid sludgy guitar parts, childish guttural vocals and whiny singy parts.  Metal fans, stay away too, because this is maiden-esque metal played poorly, with some shades of what nu-metal has evolved into.  This is for kids who were fans of slipknot 4 years ago and think that they have "matured." If you like emo, check out Sunny Day Real Estate. If you like hardcore, check out Bane. If you like metal, check out Shadows Fall.
