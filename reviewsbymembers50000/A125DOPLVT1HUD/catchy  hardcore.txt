 this record is one of the "catchiest" hardcore records released in a while.  the only thing that i had previously disliked about comeback kid was their tendency, at least on their previous full length, to occasionally revert to old hardcore stereotypes of the breakdown, the "two-step" part (whatever that is...) and lots and lots of gang vocals.  this record ups the ante and takes the bane-esque modern hardcore sound and thankfully keeps true to both the music and the message, while adding their own interesting spin at times.  while neither a ground-breaker nor a classic, this is still a solid record that avoids falling into the generic pitfalls that overwhelm so many other bands in this genre.
