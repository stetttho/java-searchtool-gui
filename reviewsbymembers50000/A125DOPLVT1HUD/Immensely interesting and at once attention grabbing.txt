 When I had first heard these guys (and girl), truthfully, the first thing I thought of was a more serious Reggie & the Full Effect or the next line in the evolution of the poppier, more keyboard-heavy Get Up Kids.  Then I bought the Vagrant comp, Another Year on the Streets, and at once fell in love with the song "The 'D' in Detroit."  Finally I knew I just had to have the rest of the album.  The more I listened to it, the more haunting the female vocals are, and the more I'm liking all of the '80s influences.  This sounds like what would happen if the Get Up Kids and the Cars put together their own supergroup, recruiting Nina Gordon from Veruca Salt.  And I guess it makes sense, considering that you can trace the Anniversary to the Get Up Kids, who you can trace to Weezer, who you can obviously trace to their producer, Ric Ocasek of the Cars.  Now to be fair, it doesn't work all the time, and towards the end of the album, a few of the songs seem like re-hashings of the first 5 or so, but those songs are good, so it's okay and not annoying.  The best songs are tracks 2, 3 and 4.  I'm certainly feeling the '80s influences.
