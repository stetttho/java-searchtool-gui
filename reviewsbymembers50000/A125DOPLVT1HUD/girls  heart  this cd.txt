 well, they do.  i'm not really sure why it seems to hold this incredible mass appeal amongst teen-age girls, but it does.  so if you're a desperate 16 year old guy trying to get in with some 16 year old girl who doesn't seem to like you like "that", well, just take her to the American Nothing/Glassjaw/Coheed/Blood Brothers show near you.  the other three of those bands will probably scare the ... out of her, or bore her to death with their incessant screaming and whatnot (though she may like new glassjaw, and hey, she might already be a blackhair and you don't even know it, and own all the AN releases already.....).  but you can bet that when coheed takes the stage and claudio sings "sweet josephine, will you follow me home?", she'll instantly fall in love with you.  and you will be soooooo in.  or maybe you could wait til they come around with the juliana theory.  girls LOVE the juliana theory.  either way, the point is that you probably won't mind seeing coheed either, seeing as though they're actually a really good band.  just don't tell your scenester guy friends you like them.  they'll probably beat you up, kidnap you, and take you to the next lamb of god show.  sweet!  hopefully agoraphobic nosebleed is opening!!!
