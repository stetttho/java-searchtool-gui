 This album is amazing.  No, it's not incredibly wacky or "out-there".  On this album is 10 pure pop rock gems.  Emotion is Dead was pretty good, but it showed the direction that they were to head in.  Their newest EP shows the pretentious jerks that they have become.  Understand this is a Dream is still an amazing album though, chock full of pop gems, if you understood music you'd understand that it takes more talent to be a genuine songwriter than to rip off all of your favorite classic rock bands..... Pink Floyd they're not.
