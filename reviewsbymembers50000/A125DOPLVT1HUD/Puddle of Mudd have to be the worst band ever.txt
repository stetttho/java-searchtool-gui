 Seriously.  I can't believe that it hasn't become illegal to write this kind of music.  I think that Dave Grohl needs to sue this band immediately for ripping off Nirvana so much.  It's frankly unreal and ridiculous that a band could get away with this.  Puddle of Mudd have to be kidding us in some way or another.  Whatever.
