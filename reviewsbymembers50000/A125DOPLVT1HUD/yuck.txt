 this kind of stuff is super-hip nowadays.  it seems the more breakdowns a band can cram into a song, the more the kiddies will love it.  i, for one, think it's a joke.  this is not what bands like red roses for a blue lady and poison the well were thinking of when they married nu-emo with metal and hardcore.  this all just comes out sounding like really bad nu-metal, except the kids are WAY more concerned with fashion.  hopefully this whole terrible trend goes the way they all do, and soon.  watch out dudes, your 15 minutes is up right about now.
