 I will admit that at first, I was a Creed fan.  I have My Own Prison, and even though it's a bit cheesy, I liked it because it rocked and was pretty good.  Then I heard the song Higher and I figured that it was a really good song and got Human Clay a little over a year ago.  I couldn't get into it but I tried to convince myself it was good.  Well looking back I know why I couldn't get into it.  It's total and utter crap.  From track 1 to the end, all the songs sound exactly the same.  Scott Stapp's lyrics are horrible and he needs to quit Veddering about how gray and dark everything is, because then he mentions something about God (Come on, Creed is such a Christian band, they're an embarassment to all the good, upstanding, religious bands of the world by denying it) and tries to be inspirational.  It's sickening.  Really, I wouldn't despise it as much if all the stupid people of the world didn't think that this was the greatest thing ever.  It's not good.  It sure as hell isn't innovative.  It's incredible how people don't realize how much they sound like what would happen if you put Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Stone Temple Pilots in a blender and got some brown disgusting goo that not mixed together was made of some pretty damn good elements.  I give it a star because they tried and I guess some people like it, even if I can't for the life of me see why.
