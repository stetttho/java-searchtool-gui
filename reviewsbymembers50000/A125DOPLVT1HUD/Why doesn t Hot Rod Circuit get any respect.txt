 Hot Rod Circuit is a lot Rodney Dangerfieldl; they both get no respect and they're both twirling twirling twirling towards death.  This album is very good and believe it or not If I Knew Now what I Knew Then is even better.  But Vagrant Records has once again lured one of my favorite bands into the world of record sales and headline tours.  Hot Rod Circuit played the Olympics recently.  Their newest songs on the new Vagrant Comp. are popped out to the max.  Not that they're bad or anything (they're waaaaaayyy better than Audio Learning Center or Viva Death) but they've taken a step backwards.  Pick up this album in the meantime.  Highlights are the Power of the Vitamins and Flight 89 (North American).
