 Now, being from Easton PA, the, dare I say, poseur capital of the East Coast, I know all about these crappy pseudo punk bands popping up nowadays.  See, what happened is everyone in my school got into MxPx, convinced themselves they were punk rock, and started wearing spiked dog collar bracelets and dying their hair blonde.  Then they all got into the Get Up Kids and A New Found Glory, and declared themselves emo and started trying to be artsy.  Needless to say, that didn't last all that long.  Now the kids have split into 2 factions, it seems:  The first one being all the kids who are now into Jimmy Eat World and the Juliana Theory and the Ataris (this is the group of kids whom I actually like and respect:  they stuck with it), and the other one being all the kids who decided that they weren't emo and were just punk rock.  See, now, instead of getting into bands who have been around for awhile and have worked their respective butts off, they got into this plethora of pseudo punk pop poseurs, and Good Charlotte, as well as such crap factories as SR-71, Sum 41, Mest, OPM and Wheatus, are worthy of that title.  So what exactly is it that makes this band so incredibly bad?  Is it the trite half-witted lyrics?  The repetitive music?  The horrible quasi-punk imagery?  Yes, yes, and especially, yes.  I know that my review is not going to stop anybody from buying this album, because if you're here, you like this music already.  All I'm hoping to do is maybe open somebody's eyes, or maybe just some confused, bleached blonde moron will see the words "Juliana Theory" or "Jimmy Eat World" here and decide to check these bands out.  Because they're actually good, unlike this crap.
