 Thursday is a young emocore band out of New Brunswick, New Jersey that has been making a lot of noise on MTV2 and in the music world in general.  They're all over the place, and I can understand why.  This CD has many excellent tracks, especially Understanding in a Car Crash and Paris in Flames. I don't think that they have fully reached their musical potential yet. I once wrote a review for this CD when the album first came out, and nobody particularly cared about them, but they have won many converts.  I don't really respect their promotional methods, though.  They have commercials like a Creed tour or something for their most recent tour.  WHY?  Their music could carry them to new heights in the indie rock world if they just would keep their integrity!  Oh well, I suppose that I talk big but if I made music that was marketable, I'd be speaking a different tune.  Their sound is only comparable to a more emo, much less political Boy Sets Fire or perhaps a much angrier Texas is the Reason.  If you enjoy this album, you should check out their first album, Waiting, if you can find it.  I personally think it's better.  I'd give this album a 3.5 if I could, because, like I said, there's many excellent tracks, but eventually it can get to seem like you're listening to the same song over and over again, and the lackluster, almost apathetic screaming in the background gets a bit annoying.  In the meantime, though, this album, "Full Collapse," is still a very worthy addition to the CD collection of any Emo, Hardcore, or Indie Rock fan.
