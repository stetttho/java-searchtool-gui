 i have been a fan of new found glory for nearly 5 years now, and have watched them grow into major mtv superstars along the lines of good charlotte, simple plan and others.  with that said, i had always held nothing gold can stay and the self-titled near and dear to my heart.  when sticks and stones came out 2 years ago, it was disappointing.  it was a mediocre record at best that mostly just sounded like filler around the hit single, with the exception of maybe 4 songs which i felt were good enough to stand on their own.  with that being said, i was a little cautious about this record, but i bought it the day it came out anyway.  i was shocked.  new found glory seems to be, at last, growing up.  catalyst is a record which finally treads new ground for the guys.  the intro is very reminiscent of bands like american nightmare or bane, and the first single "all downhill from here" is their strongest since "hit or miss."  standout tracks, other than those two, are this disaster, i don't wanna know, failure's not flattering (featuring keyboards by james dewees of the get up kids and reggie and the full effect), at least i'm known for something and no news is good news. all in all, an impressive effort from a still young band.  jordan looks SO much like morrissey.
