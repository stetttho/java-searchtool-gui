 it's not that i can even say  was never a fan of korn.  about 6 years ago i thought these guys were the best thing next to...  well, limp bizkit and metallica.  oh, how times have changed.  the thing is, there's some other nu-metal bands that i was into at the time that i can honestly say are still good.  the deftones remain one of my favorite bands.  spineshank are still pretty decent, i guess.  p.o.d. aren't that bad, i suppose, and neither are papa roach.  korn, on the other hand, have done nothing but sound exactly the same.  maybe i don't get it, but i really think issues was easily their best album, however, they seemed to be losing some of their steam once "falling away from me" was released as the lead single from that album.  truthfully, korn only ever really had 2 hits, and they were "got the life" and "freak on a leash."  their first 2 albums weren't so bad because at least they were doing something innovative.  now they just sound like a bad korn cover band.  maybe the relative failure of limp bizkit's newest album will make them wake up and smell the coffee:  the nu-metal phenomenon is over.  OVER.  jon davis needs to realize that he's like 30 now, and can't keep writing about the same things over and over.  fieldy is a joke.  munky and head stopped being innovative YEARS ago.  who is david silviera?  do you get my point?  who still listens to korn these days, anyway?  aren't the 7th and 8th graders who thought they were awesome moved on to either emo/pop or metalcore?  eh, either way, at least this crap isn't on the radio anymore these days.  check out shadows fall for some real metal, kids.
