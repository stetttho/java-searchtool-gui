 Go pay your $10 for these 4 songs to that money-grubbing pseudo indie label Vagrant Records.  I thought that it was the best label until I realized that every band gets worse after they move for the $$$$$ to Vagrant Records.  They stole my Hot Rod Circuit.  Punk rock.....heh.  Tell Chris I hope he enjoys that brand new car he just bought for charging $15 pop to watch him whine in person.  Dan Hoerner sold his soul to the devil.  Go listen to the Strokes, you quasi-indie kids.  Check out Grade.  They're not Satan.
