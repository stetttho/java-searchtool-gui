 The Get Up Kids' debut effort, Four Minute Mile, is a CD with all the right elements.  It's a great, emotionally energizing CD with good ballads as well.  It's not as polished as Something to Write Home About, but it's  still borderline great.  If you heard StWHA first, you might be a little  surprised, but you won't be dissapointed.  And if you've never heard the  Get Up Kids before, imagine Green Day mixed with the Goo Goo Dolls with  touches of Third Eye Blind and of course, Weezer, but with better lyrics.   It's awesome.
