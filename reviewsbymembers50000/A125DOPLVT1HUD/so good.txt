 every once in a while, i hear a band that changes my outlook on music.  these guys are one of those bands.  they make me feel like music can be something more than it seems.  the only band i can think to compare them to at all is braid in their later years, but with crazy tap solos.  no, not metal tap solos.  imagine if you took a crazy metallica solo and kept the guitars clean and played the tap solo at half-speed during the entire song as melodic accompaniement.  it's completely nuts.  they sound like a disco-influenced indie rock band.  i've not heard anyone that really sounds like them.
