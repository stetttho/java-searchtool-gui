 if you're a fan of hardcore and don't have any material by turning point, the best you can do is start here and get this discography.  it actually starts with their latest work which is amazing and goes backwards in time, which shows their progression in a different way.  it's a shame that these guys don't really get their due until now, but it's a fitting tribute, these 38 tracks.
