 a.f.i. didn't sell out after "answer that and stay fashionable."  they got better.  a.f.i. were a TERRIBLE hardcore band.  shut your mouth and open your eyes was their best work as a hardcore band, and even that was inconsistent.  then they got 2 new members and put out the all hallows ep, a fire inside ep, black sails, art of drowning and this album.  it's not that i don't like hardcore, i do, and a.f.i. weren't a good hardcore band.  they've stopped sounding like the misfits and it's for the better.
