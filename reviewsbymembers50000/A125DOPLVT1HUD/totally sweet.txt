 i bought this like 4 years ago for a dollar and it was totally awesome.  brill curses a ton and talks about how real he is and stuff.  he sounds like he is about 14 which is pretty rad because it makes all of his typical gangsta boasting sound really unbelievable and ridiculous.  i've been real is the gangsta rap single and the a side...  and it's totally sweet.  brill and his crew (who sound like a couple of other brills) are definitely shotcallers.  the radio edit version is not nearly as good as the explicit version.  keep it real is the b side and it's kind of a slow jam.  he's telling his lady to keep it real with him, and he says in the chorus: "put them games to the side and let me know something if you keep it real with brill, i'll let you hold something it's not about breaking your heart or bringing you pain but if you play your cards right i can give you them things." which proves that he is letting the girl know that if they do not keep it real, he will not be very happy, but if they keep it real with brill, he will give them lots of stuff once his record becomes a hit and the money starts rolling in (which it never did, i suppose, so the girl is probably long gone by now). poor brill, man...
