 four records into their career, hot rod circuit are at an odd place.  never ones to be lumped in with the nu-emo craze of the early 21st century, they've found themselves forced to make some sort of choice in the direction they choose to go with their sound.  their first two records were great because they stood out amongst their peers.  you must figure that they were touring the country with bands like new found glory, jimmy eat world and the juliana theory right around y2k, bands who would help usher in a new phenomenon in teenage pop culture (disagree with me?  look around the local high school or college, and check out all the kids with band pins all over their messanger bags with spock haircuts and tight girls pants).  the irony in this is that these bands never meant to usher in this new era.  while many of those other bands from around that time period have become reluctant icons to legions of teens and young adults, hot rod circuit has been seemingly left in the dust.  sure, they made the leap onto a larger quasi-indie label in vagrant records (long story) but they're still opening shows for younger, inferior bands.  sorry about tomorrow was probably their big hope at making a record that would resonate with the kiddies, but it suffered from poor production.  2 years later they offer us reality's coming through, which is an odd record in that it's not so much bad is it suffers from a lack of continuity.  i will say that i don't like the single, save you, but other than that, the tracks are all decent at worst, with a few standouts.  there is even a song that charts some new territory for hrc (the best you ever knew).  the record only gets 3 stars though for it's lack of continuity as previously mentioned as well for what else it's missing:  passionate emotion and dynamics (if i knew now...) and/or furious energy (if it's cool...).  hopefully somewhere along the line hot rod can find a new direction.
