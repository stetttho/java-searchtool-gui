 it's actually not a bad record, but boy does this band sound like they want to be fall out boy.  it's so blatantly obvious that it's impossible to overlook.  this record is very well-written and catchy, and it sounds good.  however if you don't like fall out boy i can't even begin to understand how you could like this record.  it really goes both ways.  however, lots of bands totally rip-off lots of bands to don't judge this record based totally on that.  if you're into today's pop-punk there's probably a few songs that you'd find enjoyable.  if you don't like fall out boy, however, i'd say don't even bother.  another thing, how exactly are these guys a "dance" band in any sense?
