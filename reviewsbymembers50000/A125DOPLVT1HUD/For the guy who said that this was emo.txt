 you obviously have no idea of what "emo" means (or doesn't mean).  This is just NFG-lite.  Give me the real thing any day.  "Cheek to Cheek" is a decent song.  Too bad it isn't on here.  Expect to see these guys on TRL with Saves the Day and Thursday any "day" now, get it?  The joke is, these guys used to be named "Sunday Drive."  Hahahahahaha that was cheesy I know.
