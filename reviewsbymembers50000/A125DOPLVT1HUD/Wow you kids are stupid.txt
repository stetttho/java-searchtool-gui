 okay: 1)  Bert McCraken.  What a name.  The poor guy.  He vomits on stage.  That's soooooooooo cool. 2)  Mr. McCraken used to date Kelly Osbourne, until she was stolen away by Chad Gilbert of New Found Glory.  He couldn't even keep the ugliest/stupidest girl in TV Land from running off to a pop-punk goofball. 3)  Guess what, "emo" kids...  The Used don't write their own music.  They are just as prefabricated as a boyband. 4)  The band Glassjaw did this about 3 years ago, and did it about 1000 times better. 5)  The Used are NOT a hardcore band.  They are a phase that lots of 14 year old kids will go through before they are ready to handle music with any real substance.  When you decide you are ready, go pick up a Planes Mistaken for Stars or Breaking Pangaea record. 6)  If the Used are a part of Rock's "comeback," I hope Rock crawls back into the hole that it was supposedly hiding.
