 Now even though I have some Korn, Limp Bizkit, Staind, System of a Down, etc... I'm not really into the whole nu-metal wave.  I find it to be quite contrived and just plain uninteresting.  I'm usually into more emo-punk-pop and even some hardcore like Snapcase and Boy Sets Fire, but I have 2 friends who are (were) very much into the nu-metal thing when it first blew up.  Spineshank was a band of their choice, but I never really got to listen to Strictly Diesel.  Then I heard the song Synthetic a few times on a digital cable music channel, and the chorus I thought was incredible.  I bought the album sort of on a whim to whet my metal appetite because I hadn't done that in a while, and when I first listened to the album in a car, the first thing I thought was "Geez I coulda gotten some Promise Ring or Texas is the Reason with this money."  Then I got home later on in the night and listened to it not very intensively, but enough to appreciate the good things, and I found much to my surprise, I actually like this album alot.  Sure, the lyrics are pretty trite, and it reeks of Orgy (Amir Dekrah was responsible for the Pre-Production and Song Arrangement), but I really like the way the singer sings and the blend of hard guitars and techno beats.  It sounds like early Refused meets less abrasive Slipknot.  These guys will more than likely go down in history as just another nu-metal band, but I think that in the meantime this album is worth at least a listen or two.
