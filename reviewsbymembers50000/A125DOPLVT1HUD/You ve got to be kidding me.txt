 If these jerks ripped At the Drive-In off any more with their stage show, they'd be liable to get sued...  oh wait, that already HAPPENED.  And the music is godawfully boring and derivative...  get into something with some kind of substance...  this is the worst record ever made by anyone, i think.  There's not really much else to say that, since it's terrible, it figures that tons of stupid American Teenagers will eat this audiopoop up...
