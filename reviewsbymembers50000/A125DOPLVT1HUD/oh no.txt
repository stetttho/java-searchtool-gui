 another one of those terrible "screamo" bands.  i hope these guys, along with the used and story of the year are on an airplane to rockandrollville and die in a fiery crash on the way.  and for no particular reason, they can take goldfinger with them. bleh. check out dag nasty, the wedding present, or the comeback kid.
