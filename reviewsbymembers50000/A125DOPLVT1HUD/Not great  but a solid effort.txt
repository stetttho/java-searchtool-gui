 This album is just a solid rock album, through and through.  Without any of the pretentiousness of emo or hardcore these days.  Member/s of Strike Anywhere in a band that sounds nothing like them.  It works, though.  I like the music, man.  I like.  Best track is #2, whatever the hell it's called.  Cause I don't know stuff.
