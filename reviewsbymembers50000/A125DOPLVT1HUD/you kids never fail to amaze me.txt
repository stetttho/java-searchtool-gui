 wow, first of all:  the "new guy" is jon bunch from the excellent band sense field, who most of you god punks have never even heard of.  way back when i was younger, i dug the moon is down (and i still listen to it sometimes), but how to start a fire is such a boring record.  it took something like jon joining this band to make me care about them again.  and, as a whole, this is a good record.  not as good as previous sense field efforts, but i've always kind of liked fsf musically.  and to add mr. bunch just makes this a solid effort.  nothing earth-shattering or mind-blowing but definitely quality.
