 I bought this album about 5 months ago after hearing their EP that my  friend had from a show.  I was supposed to see them live, but the car broke  down, yada yada yada.  Anyway, this album is great, even better than the  EP.  It's a shame that these guys don't get the recognition that the Get Up  Kids and New Found Glory do, because this is as good as if not better than  those respective bands.  The singer doesn't have as whiny as a voice, and  the music is a bit less bouncy.  They are emo though, I guess, but they're  not really punk or pop that much, but don't get this thinking that you're  getting something along the lines of Rites of Spring or anything of that  nature.  This album is great though, even though the boys do seem to be a  bit obsessed with octaves.
