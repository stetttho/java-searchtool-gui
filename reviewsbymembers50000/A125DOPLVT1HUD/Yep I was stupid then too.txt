 Not that I think that this is much of an album as it is, but, I have to say that, overall, Fat Lip is a wonderful radio novelty, In Too Deep was a catchy summer-like song, and it's got some other decent songs on it.  But Sum 41 is nothing special, either way, and in another year or 2 they'll probably be cast aside with Smash Mouth and Fastball and Semisonic and Good Charlotte and American Hi-Fi and all of those bands who will never see the light of day again, probably.  And the world will be ready for the next huge pop radio party punk hit and everybody will be happy.
