 the alkaline trio were one of my favorite bands from goddammit right through from here to infirmary.  i loved the early stuff (for your lungs only ep, the rest of the tracks on the self-titled compilation cd) and i loved all of their records right through their vagrant debut.  i thought that infirmary sounded somewhat different from their earlier releases, but it still contained an edge and was still a very fun record.  however, to me, good mourning was just sort of flat.  they tried some new production tricks, and even though the songwriting was still very good, the sound and feel of the record was a little inconsistent.  it still had the dark-yet-poppy feel of their previous records, except i felt that mourning had lost some of the edge that kept them standing out amongst the other pop-punk bands of that late '90s-early 2000's era.  it sounded like a logical progression from infirmary, that much is true, but, to me, did not seem to be a positive direction.  with that much said, i really like crimson, based on one huge difference from good mourning.  this is an album that takes chances, and has a general theme, found not necessarily just in the artwork or the lyrics, but in the music itself.  this record shows a musical growth in the alkaline trio that doesn't, unlike good mourning, leave you wishing for the "old days."   there's enough going on here to make the listener intrigued by this new alkaline trio, which still, in many ways, resemble the goddammit-era alkaline trio in both songwriting skill and aesthetic.  all in all, i am happy that they are still making records, and hope that they now settle into another groove of making good, fun, interesting records again.  it seems like good mourning (which, i want to clarify, i don't think is necessarily BAD, i just didn't really care for it) was just a pothole in an otherwise consistently good (and still growing) discography.
