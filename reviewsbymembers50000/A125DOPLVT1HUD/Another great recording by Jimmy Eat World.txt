 We all know that Jimmy Eat World is an incredible band.  So what else would you expect from them but a bunch of great songs.  The songs on this album are very close to the genre of Static Prevails, with Tom Linton doing most of the singing.  You can tell how they evolved, they were much more of a punk band years ago than they are now, but even then they were far above average.  It's a good holdover until the new album which according to the band, should be out somewhere around Februrary/March 2001, which we know will be great, and those of us who have heard the new songs can testify to that.  In the meantime, make sure you pick this up.
