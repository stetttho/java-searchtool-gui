 I really really liked Nothing Gold Can Stay.  These guys are really good songwriters.  So why did they waste their time doing this?   I mean covers can be a cool thing to do at a show, or on a comp or to just have one on a  regular album, but to make a whole album is just asinine.  Well, if you  like hearing punk versions of songs that aren't punk in the slightest, then  buy this album.  It does absolutely nothing for me, but, hey, at least it's  only 8 bucks.
