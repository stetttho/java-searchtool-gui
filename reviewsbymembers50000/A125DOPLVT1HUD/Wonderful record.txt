 The new .hopesfall. full-length "The Satellite Years" is a triumph in the land of melodic post-hardcore.  Combining elements of traditional hardcore, Poison the Well-esque nu-hardcore, Thursday-ish melodia, deftones "White Pony"-era ambiance and pop sensibility, .hopesfall. are genre-bending without any elements of fabrication or insincerity that is plauging the hardcore and post-hardcore scenes these days.  This is a great record from band that doesn't just sound like any nu-metal/"emocore" bands these days.
