 i like this album.  whereas i don't think that anything will be able to recreate the feelings i got from both four minute mile and something to write home about in my highschool years, i can appreciate and enjoy the get up kids' newer albums on their own.  on a wire, to me, was an enjoyable record with one major flaw:  a lack of continuity.  i could tell that they wanted to do something different, but it seemed as though they weren't even quite sure what they wanted.  some of the album was acoustic, some had classic rock tendencies, some of the songs were a bit more progressive and some were a bit more slowed down.  all i know is that when i would listen to it, i just kept waiting for the get up kids to just rock out.  i could tell that they wanted to, but they never did.  it felt somewhat forced, like they were trying so hard to change that they never really got their style.  which brings me to guilt show.  this is, as many people have said before me, the album that should've come between something to write home about and on a wire.  but i see it as a very welcome return (well, a half-return) to the catchy, wonderfully chipper and poppy sound that we've all missed.  this album has a more mature feel than something to write home about did, but it still rocks wholeheartedly.  the first song, man of conviction, is somewhat of a false start, as it leads you to think that this record is going to be fast and furious, and that's not the case.  but there's definitely an energy on this record that was missed with on a wire.  i can say that the record does begin to lag around track 7 or track 8, but the last few songs are very good and if you stick it out through the slightly boring parts of this record, it winds up being worth it.  welcome back, get up kids, you were missed.
