 The Juliana Theory used to not be bad.  As a matter of fact, they were good.  Very good.  And now they aren't good anymore.  Brett Detar decided "Hey, I like Pink Floyd!" and made a record that sounds like their prog-rock heroes of the 1970s.  Don't worry kids, there's no "August in Bethany, If I Told You This Was Killing Me, This is Not a Love Song, Pictures Stars and Dreams, Duane Joseph, Top of the World (to the Simple Two), Musicbox Superhero, The Closest Thing, Don't Push Love Away, To the Tune of 5000 Screaming Children, etc..." here.  There's just a bunch of really bad prog-rock songs, and a remake of "Into the Dark" off of Emotion is Dead which isn't as good, but is still easily the best song on here.  There isn't even a song as good as "Breathing by Wires" or "Liability" on here.  This is absolutely terrible.  Ugh.
