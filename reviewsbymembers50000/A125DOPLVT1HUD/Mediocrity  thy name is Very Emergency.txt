 Well, when I first got this album, I was like "Yeah, this is catchy, cool, etc."  and I liked it.  Then I heard early Promise Ring stuff, and I was like "This new album sucks!"  But then I thought about  it, and I was like, well, it's okay.  It isn't emo in the slightest, but  what's emo anyway?  I don't know.  It's plain pop, but it's still cool.   Very cool, if not great or anything.
