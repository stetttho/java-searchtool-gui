 this must be a joke.  this band, which seriously sounds nothing like ANYTHING but mainstream radio rock with some "emotive" lyrics, are getting lots of attention in place of many other bands who have been doing the same thing, and BETTER, for months.  i heard good things about them and downloaded a few of their songs but promptly forgot about them in about 5 minutes after giving them a listen.  these guys aren't quite as bad as the used, and for that they get 2 stars.  however, i don't understand how this colossal crap gets popular.  especially in the wake of the release of the newest thursday album, war all the time, which actually deserves a listen.  utterly forgetable and generic...
