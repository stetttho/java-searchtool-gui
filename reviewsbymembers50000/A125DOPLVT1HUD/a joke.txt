 i suppose that i believed boysetsfire a little more when they were on indie label initial records.  then they went to victory and put out after the eulogy which really has about 3 or 4 good songs, with "rookie" and "still waiting for the punchline" being the best, by far.  then they signed to wind-up, home of such awesome bands as creed, finger eleven, drowning pool, evanescence and others.  as you can tell, i'm joking.  they wound up (no pun intended) on the daredevil soundtrack and this album still boasts some of the "political" lyrics but more of a nu-metal attitude.  these guys were never really a hardcore band to begin with, but at least kind of fit in the whole punk scene thing.  now, they just aren't good at all.  it's a shame, sort of.<
