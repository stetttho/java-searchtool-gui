 but i do actually like this album nonetheless.  See, usually being into emo/punk/whatnot in the vein of Jimmy Eat World, Hot Rod Circuit, Grade, and the like, one would not expect me to enjoy such teen-pop fare as Avril Lavigne.  But, alas, as one would have it, I do, and here's why: Okay, totally ignore the fact that "Sk8er Boi" is perhaps the worst song ever written.  Listen to the rest of the songs.  It's standard girl-pop fare.  But who can argue with that?  I love Michelle Branch, Vanessa Carlton and the like, and this, depsite it's "PUNK RAWK" attitude and image, is a teenage girl and her guitar writing songs about being 17.  And honestly, being 17 isn't anything that should be held against somebody.  It should be embraced, as didn't we all once have the same feelings that Avril has?  Considering that she's Canadian, we'll afford her this one slip up (the aforementioned track "Sk8er Boi"), but otherwise, as with her megahit "Complicated," it really is a relatively solid, unoffensive, even at times *gasp* enjoyable album.  Granted, everybody over 20 will think i'm crazy, and maybe i am.  But I honestly think this is a really good album.
