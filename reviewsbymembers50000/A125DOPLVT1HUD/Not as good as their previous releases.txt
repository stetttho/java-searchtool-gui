 but catchy and good in its' own right.  It's definitely been popped out, and hasn't escaped the Rites of Vagrant in that regard, and has met the same fate of Saves the Day but the only difference being the fact that Hot Rod Circuit was original in their own right to begin with.  They had and continue to have their own sound, which I suppose has hurt them in record sales but helps to distinguish them from the crowd of Lifetime/At the Drive-In/NFG/Braid imitators.  Best songs are tracks 2, 4, 6, 8 and 9.  If you had to get just one release from Vagrant records over the past year, I'd make it this or 'Your Majesty' by the Anniversary.
