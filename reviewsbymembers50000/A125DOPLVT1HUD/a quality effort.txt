 canada's stars are a band that in many ways both fits in and stands out from today's indie-rock climate.  these songs, stripped to their core, are just very good pop-rock songs, some with great hooks, some seemingly intentionally hookless.  overall, it works.  also, in an admittedly over-simplified way, this record just plain "sounds" good.  the keyboards & the crisp, pulsating bass make just enough of an impact to give this band a distinct sound, one that is pleasing to the ear in a purely aesthetic sense.  while the male-female vocal interplay is nothing unique, it fits perfectly with the overall mood that this record seems to be aiming for.  there's a small amount of postal service-esque blips and beeps that could probably be, for the most part, done without.  in most cases though, they do not take over the central theme of these songs and are generally well-placed and tastefully executed.  a promising record from a band who i think might still have a classic up their proverbial collective sleeves.
