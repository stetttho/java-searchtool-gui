 from here to infirmary was good.  not as good as goddammit, the singles collection or maybe i'll catch fire.  the hell yes 7" and the split with hot water music are also both really good.  this change is damn near inexplicable.  oh well.  nobody really cares that much about this album.  for every band that changes their sound and makes it big...  (dashboard, saves the day, nfg, the ataris, afi, many many others...)  there will always be bands who change their sound and nobody likes the new sound (JULIANA THEORY).  whatever.  check out armor for sleep, minus the bear, the red hot valentines, and the macho man randy savage.
