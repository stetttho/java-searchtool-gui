 wow.  out of all of the reviews on here, only a couple of people cited the fact that even before this colossal poopbucket of a record came out, the used put out a record that was even worse.  for some quick facts about the used, check out my review of their first record, which is nearly as bad as this record.  eh, i just contradicted myself, they're both awful.  anyway, the point is that the used didn't 'innovate' a damn thing (glassjaw) and are certainly not a screamo band (antioch arrow, saetia, etc...).  what you kids don't know about music you certainly make up for in dressing like idiots.
