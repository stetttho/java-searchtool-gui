 have gotten into brandtson around the year 2001 via their first full-length, brandtson always remained slightly under my radar.  i enjoyed that record, but it wasn't one of my favorites and to be honest i just sort of forgot about these guys.  which brings me to this summer, at wal-mart of all places, i saw this album and i was surprised to see that a)  they were still around and b)  a large department store chain was carrying their cd.  so on a whim i picked it up.  at this time i was getting frustrated with the indie-pop emo/rock world, and in addition to this record i also picked up the latest by black metal band dimmu borgir.  i did not know how much i would love this record.  if you haven't heard their last few records (dial in sounds, fallen star collection, dying to figure each other out) you will be surprised to see that they're not so much of an emo band these days, and most references to mineral or sunny day real estate in their sound no longer apply.  but what they have found, however, is that they're battle-tested and their chemistry is at an all-time high.  it's a shame that this record hasn't been getting too much exposure by the press because i think it has enough mainstream accessability to appeal to many different types of music fans.  i have yet to read a single negative review of this album as there just aren't many flaws.  if you get the opportunity, go see this band, as they sound just as good live as they do on record.
