 let me first say that this band has always been a sort of hit-or-miss type group;  the stuff that they do that's good is usually downright amazing, however, they occasionally have a huge mis-step that can be downright embarassing.  typically, their covers have always been good (and good choices of songs to cover as well), and the cover of "savory" by early '90s post-hardcore stalwarts jawbox, as well as helmet's "sinatra" and the smiths' "please let me get what i want" all stick out, as well as "no ordinary love" by sade which might seem to be completely out of left field to your average nu-metal fan.  however, some of these cuts suffer from poor production (perhaps a re-mastering of some of these works would have been a good idea).  overall, a decent stopgap release before they complete work on their next record, however, i wouldn't put this record in the 'essential' category for anyone but big deftones fans.
