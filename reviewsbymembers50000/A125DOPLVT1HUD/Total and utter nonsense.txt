 I can't believe that Tom DeLonge and Travis Barker even had the gall to put this junk out.  It's just the next Blink 182 album, minus the singer who's voice is actually tolerable (Mark) and plus more awful, awful lyrics from Tom.  Not to mention that the music isn't much of a departure from Blink's usual poppy, 3-chord fare.  It's only amusing to think that Box Car Racer are referred to as Tom and Travis' "emo" band and they compared themselves to Fugazi and Quicksand.  If you want to buy something that is good, maybe actually get a Fugazi album or something.  Dare to explore.  These 30-something teenagers sure didn't.
