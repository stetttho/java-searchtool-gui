 Most of Suzanne Vega's songs have a story behind them, including most on this album. The tone can be anything from amused to somber to sad to funny. This album is particularly varied in musical styles, with the fast, loud "Blood Makes Noise" contrasting sharply with tunes like the slow, sad "Bad Wisdom." I like the sound of her voice and the variety of the songs on the album.
