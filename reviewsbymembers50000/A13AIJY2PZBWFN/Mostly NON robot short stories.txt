 I expected this to be a collection of robot stories because of the title, but only two are robot stories.  They are the first two, and the first one is also a story from _I, Robot_ (which I just re-read).  The second one is "Robot Dreams" from which the book takes its title, and it is another Susan Calvin robot story like those from _I, Robot_ but was written in the mid-'80s (_I, Robot_ was written 30 years earlier).  It is in the same mold with the earlier stories, but with a nod to advancing technology (small computers, for instance). Many other stories in this collection center on "Multivac," an immense computer.  The name is an obvious derivative of UNIVAC, a large, vacuum-tube based computer of the early 1950s.  UNIVAC became famous for predicting that Eisenhower would win the 1952 election based on early returns (against pundit predictions that Stevenson would win).  That led directly to one story, "Franchise," which takes the ability to sample a small number of votes to predict a total election outcome and drives the idea to an absurd (but nevertheless interesting) extreme. There are a variety of other stories, from ones dealing with beings without bodies to one talking about an alien medical investigator who has come to Earth to find out more about a disease.  All are worth the read, and some are truly fascinating and end in very unexpected ways. Ralph McQuarrie provides the cover illustration and several others for individual stories; they are of the style familiar to anyone who has seen original art from "Star Wars" (which he worked on).  Asimov's introduction is amusing; he explains what he got right in predicting the future--and what he got spectacularly wrong.  He discusses this with respect to both stories in the book (Multivac, for instance) and to other books and stories he had written decades earlier. All in all, this book was a fun read.
