 I came across this movie while playing flip-the-channel on TV one evening.  I had heard of the Arrow before, but I had not realized how ambitious and successful the project had been, how precipitously it had been cancelled, and how all the airplanes, equipment, and plans had been destroyed.  It seemed from the movie (I want to read more on this) that many officers in the U.S. military were impressed with the Canadian machine and wanted to buy it or at least investigate it.  I wish they had been able to win the day, and that Canada's fighter had been fairly evaluated.
