 I wish this magazine came out more often (as another reviewer said).  It would be fascinating for anyone with the slightest interest in the history of technology and engineering.  Recent articles have covered vacuum tubes, their history, and why some are still used now, and nuclear power and how that industry stalled in America.  I remember reading another article in the mid-'90s about a guy in New York City who shoveled coal for a public school furnace.  He explained his job and how hard it was to buy a coal shovel (the hardware store people couldn't believe it).  A few years later they followed up with a note that all public schools in NYC had been converted from coal, and that the coal-shoveler's job was MUCH easier maintaining the new furnace.  Stories on iron bridges and how Necco wafers are made (with the same machine for 100 years or so) and how buttons are made from seashells and how paper clips are made and how a Hollywood actress designed a frequency-jumping weapons guidance system and all sorts of others are included.  Lots of cool articles about how everyday (and not-so-common) technologies went from ideas in someone's mind to products that are ready for use.
