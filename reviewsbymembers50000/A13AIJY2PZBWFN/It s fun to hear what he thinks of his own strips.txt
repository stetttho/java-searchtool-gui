 This is the second time Scott Adams has published an annotated guide to some of his better strips; the first was "Seven Years Of Highly Defective People."  This time, the book is just a straight-through compilation of his favorites over a seven-year period, with his handwritten notes below each one.  He comments on everything from what he thinks was funny in a particular strip to reactions he got from them (some confused people, for instance).  I always think it's fun to hear the cartoonist talk about his work.  But I'm a comic strip geek.
