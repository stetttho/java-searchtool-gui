 Often, comic strips issue smaller collections with black-and-white Sunday strips, then, later, compile two or three of these into a larger "treasury" which is no different except for color Sundays.  This treasury is different.  It reprints strips from both of the two previous "Pearls Before Swine," but Stephan Pastis adds to this with both an unusually detailed introduction that explains how the strip got started and with comments on many individual strips.  The individual comments range from detailed explanations of a problem with a strip to funny comments about a strip.  I have not seen this type of thing in a "regular" treasury before; I have seen it in "greatest hits" strip collections.  It's nice to see this kind of thing in a regular strip collection.
