 The singer can sing well and the songs flow well. My favorite track is the one that's not listed at the end of the CD; let track 10 play through and wait a bit, and you will hear "The Close of the Day," which is a powerful and compelling song. But the whole album is good, and I look forward to driving somewhere if I know this CD is in the player.
