 This is a companion book to "Robot Dreams," but unlike that book, all the stories in "Robot Visions" are actually about robots.  Six of the stories also appear in the collection "I, Robot."  The stories were written over a wide range of time, from 1940 to 1989, and they reflect the character of their times.  (The way to check when a particular story was written is to look at the copyright page at the front of the book.)   The stories cover a range of issues well, mostly hinging on the three laws of robotics that Asimov quotes and uses repeatedly.  One might think going back to the well like this would result in repetetive stories, but that is not the case at all; robots are involved in these stories in jobs as mundane as checking galleys for publication to jobs as unforgiving as performing microsurgery, and in all cases Asimov carefully considers how the humans and robots--each acting on their motivations (the robots' is hardwired, of course)--interact with each other and the situations they are confronted with.  One stands out: "The Bicentennial Man," about a robot who was unusually creative, and over a period of decades acts on his desire to become more independent and acquire more rights, going so far as to replace his robotic systems with organic ones in an attempt to become closer to being human.  The book includes a number of essays by Asimov about how he sees robots in the future, how he conceived of them in past stories, and what issues will crop up as mechanical intelligences become reality.  These essays were written in the '70s and 80s, some apparently for American Airlines' in-flight magazine (again, check the copyright page).  These essays are each relatively short, making them good bedtime reading when you're tired.  The short stories earlier in the book vary in length, so they don't work as well for that purpose.
