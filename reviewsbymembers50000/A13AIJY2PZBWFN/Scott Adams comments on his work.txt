 The best part about this collection is that Scott comments on individual strips, saying what he likes (or doesn't like) about them or commenting on early stages of his characters' development.  The strips are arranged (initially) by character, taking you through their changes over seven years.  Some have changed dramatically, like the boss, who was originally tall and thin and now is short, rotund, and pointy-haired.  Scott even explains the minor characters, like accounting trolls, dinosaurs, and generic co-workers.  On their own, the strips would have been a good collection, but the comments by Scott Adams really make this collection fun.
