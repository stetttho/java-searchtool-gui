 I purchased this book at the telescope gift shop on Mount Palomar back in 1996.  I read it in the next few days.  It is the fascinating tale of George Hale, a remarkable man who had to battle personal demons (in the form of debilitating mental breakdowns) to build the world's largest telescope--then do it again and again!  I can't remember the first one offhand, but the 100-inch Hooker Telescope on Mt. Wilson was next, then the 200-inch Hale telescope on Mt. Palomar.  This book talks about all the technical, financal and other difficulties that were overcome to make the giant telescope possible.  It explains large earlier telescopes and how the problems encountered in their construction provided lessons for the designers and builders of the Palomar telescope.  Anyone interested in the history of technology or astronomy should give this book a look.
