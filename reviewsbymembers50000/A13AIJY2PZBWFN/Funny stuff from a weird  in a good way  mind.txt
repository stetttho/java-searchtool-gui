 Pastis will go to ANY length to set up what would normally be a semi-lame word play; it ends up being great.  He also is the master of writing conversations where each participant consistently misunderstands the other to humorous effect. Rat is funniest at his most threatening.  He tells the neighbor to get rid of the kumquats on his lawn--or face Rat's secondhand Soviet missile.  Pig is funny just being Pig--only dimly aware of the reality around him.  And Zebra's interactions with various potential predators is hilarious.  Great book; buy it!
