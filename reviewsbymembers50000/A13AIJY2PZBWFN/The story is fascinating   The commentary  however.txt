 I saw the movie with Henry Fonda on video while I was in high school.  The story was fascinating, and years later I read this book.  The details of the story, again, were fascinating and Lewis relates them well.  But along the way, you have to slog through a LOT of commentary about how selfless these lawyers are and how we owe them a debt of gratitude, etc.  Well, fine.  But it just got a little heavy-handed for my taste.  The story on its own would have made that point FOR him.  The constant "just-the-altruistic-lawyers-against-the-evil-system" argument is annoying mostly because it is precisely that system that ALLOWED the case to be brought forth and decided in the first place!
