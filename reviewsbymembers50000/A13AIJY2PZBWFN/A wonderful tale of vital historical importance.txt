 The beginning of this film makes clear the importance of knowing one's position at sea.  Disasters--some of epic proportions--were distressingly regular when doubts about one's position relative to land or dangerous reefs were the order of the day.  This film tells two stories in parallel.  The first is of John Harrison's efforts to make accurate nautical clocks--called chronometers--that could be used at sea and provide a simple means of acertaining longitude (by comparing the time at the home port of known longitude to that of the ship determined by the sun or the stars).  Harrison had to struggle against many technical odds to make his machines--and against many bureaucratic barriers to getting them accepted. The second story is that of Rupert Gould, the Royal Navy officer, who, suffering from his experiences in the first world war, begins the process of restoring the old Harrison clocks to working order.  This story is of less historical significance than the first, of course, but it is why we are able to go to the Royal Observatory at Greenwich and see the clocks running today.  The poor fellow turned the clocks into an obsession as his life changed dramatically around him. Well done, and well worth the time.
