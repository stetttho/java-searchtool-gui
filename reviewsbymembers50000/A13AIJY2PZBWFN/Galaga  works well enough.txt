 I got this primarily for Galaga and secondarily for Ms. Pac-Man.  As others have indicated, the joystick has "issues"; specifically, turning corners in Pac-Man is just as likely to send you careening back the way you came (into pursuing ghosts in my case) as it is to actually turn the corner.  So why did I give it three stars, instead of one?  Entirely for Galaga.  I was one of those geeks that could spend a half-hour playing Galaga using one quarter.  The nostalgia value of that alone is worth $20 plus shipping.  Even for just Galaga, there are issues.  It is hard to hit the fire button in the rapid, staccato shots needed for "challenge" stages in Galaga (and helpful elsewhere).  You have to use your thumb because of the small size of the unit.  On the arcade Galaga, I use the tips of my fingers on the fire button, which is placed several inches away from the joystick.  Some intrepid video game maker needs to make a "universal" video game.  It would look like an '80s stand-up or table-top game, but would be able to play many (say, 50) classic '80s games.  The software issue would be trivial; the hard part would be having buttons, joysticks, knobs (Tempest), trackballs (Centipede, Missile Command), etc. able to handle the different games.  Perhaps there would be modules that could be plugged in to the controls area as needed for different games.
