 This was written soon after the war (initially as a secret document) and is a candid assessment of the double-cross program's successes and failures; fortunately for the Allies, the former greatly outnumbered the latter.  The author explains which operations worked, which did not, and why.  He also explains how they could have exploited the system for further gains had they been more confident of their effectiveness in deceiving the Germans, but he also explains why they were cautious and why it was reasonable to be cautious given the circumstances.  Details of individual cases are often fascinating, including meetings with German handlers in neutral nations and dealing with uncooperative agents.  My only complaint was that the acronym glossary did not cover a lot of the acronyms used in the book.
