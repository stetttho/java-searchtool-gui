 This book is basically a well-organized laundry list of hoaxes.  The author arranges hoaxes in logical categories based on the type of deception involved.  Some, especially those from further in the past, sound preposterous, but one must always account for the differences in knowledge and thought processes between times past and now.  What was most disturbing to me is the fact that some of the hoaxes sounded plausible; it makes you wonder how many pieces of knowledge we take for granted might be well-contrived hoaxes.  Conspiracy theorists take THAT attitude to the extreme, seeing hoaxes everywhere.  But hoaxes are most prevalent when it is hard to get independent supporting data about a topic, which this book points out.  For instance, if a white fellow turned up in Europe and claimed to be a Taiwanese native, we would laugh at him.  But a white fellow did turn up in Europe several centuries ago, claiming to be a native of Formosa (Taiwan's former name).  Without additional information (that Taiwanese are Asians), the people of Europe were unable to quickly discount the story.
