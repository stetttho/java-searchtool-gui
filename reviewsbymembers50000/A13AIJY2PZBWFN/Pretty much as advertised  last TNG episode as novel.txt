 This book takes the last Star Trek: TNG episode and turns it into a decent, short novel.  Having seen the episode a few years back, I read the book already knowing the story.  But the novel does a good job of taking you through the story and adding a few elements here and there to more fully explain what's going on and why.  This book isn't the kind I'm likely to ever re-read, though.
