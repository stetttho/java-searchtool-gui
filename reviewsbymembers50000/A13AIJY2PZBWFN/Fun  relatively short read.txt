 I found this book in a used bookstore and read it, having not seen the movie.  It did help with the movie (which itself is good) when I did see it, as it delved a little more deeply into what was going on (as books always do).  The concept is vintage Crichton: a new technology (in this case, a theme park populated by robots) seems great, but then begins to go wrong in life-threatening ways (the robots become too independant, chasing the humans around).  It's a fun, short read.
