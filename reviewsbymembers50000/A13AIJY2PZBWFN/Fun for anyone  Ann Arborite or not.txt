 This mystery takes place at the University of Michigan in the mid-'90s.  Anyone around town then will find a lot of fun, familiar elements in this book.  Early on in the book, a meeting is held in Michigan Stadium, which is unusual but not unknown since the stadium is generally open during the day.  For the uninitiated, "maize" is the specific shade of yellow that Michigan uses in its school colors. There is a lot of journalistic intrigue in the book, too, as a writer for the campus paper (the Michigan Daily) competes for scoops with the Detroit dailies.  All in all, it's a fun read.
