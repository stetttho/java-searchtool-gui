 This book is about maps in general, which must, as a matter of necessity, reduce the level of detail from the reality they represent.  So all maps "lie" in that regard.  This book then explains how maps can be made that distort the perception of reality through a variety of methods, both unintentional and otherwise.  Along the way, the reader will learn about many different types of maps and the kinds of problems to look out for when using maps.
