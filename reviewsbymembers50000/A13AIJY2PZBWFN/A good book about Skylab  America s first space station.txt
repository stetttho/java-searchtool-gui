 I hope this book returns to print sometime.  It is a history of the Skylab space station   program.  It discusses in detail the experiences of the astronauts who called Skylab home  for months at a time, and the experiments they performed.  I hope that the people who   designed the International Space Station read this book, because it talks a lot about how  different types of people (scientists versus pilots) reacted to different aspect of  living in a gravity-free environment and how people coped with the various problems  associated with space station life.
