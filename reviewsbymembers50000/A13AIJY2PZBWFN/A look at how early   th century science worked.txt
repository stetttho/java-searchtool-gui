 This book takes you to England of around 1800, when a young amateur scientist managed to come up with the nomenclature we use to this day to classify clouds.  The life of Luke Howard is fascinating in and of itself as he goes about his scientific and business dealings.  The author also notes why Mr. Howard's system became the system used today, even though it was only one of several major attempts to classify clouds as meteorology became more systematic.  The book covers its topic well and would be of interest to anyone interested in the history of meteorology or scientific inquiry.
