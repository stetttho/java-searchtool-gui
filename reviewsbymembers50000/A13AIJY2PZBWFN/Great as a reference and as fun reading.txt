 If you have even a passing interest in chemistry, this book is a lot of fun.  You will learn a wealth of interesting facts about the chemical elements, each treated in its own section.  It turns out that even obscure elements often have their specific uses important to our lives.  The book is ideal as a nightstand book because of its short sections on each element; read a few each night before going to sleep and you'll end the day with a little more knowledge of how the world works.
