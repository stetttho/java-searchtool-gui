 It's always interesting how few pieces the LEGO people can use and still create cool little kits like this Imperial shuttle.  Of course, they "cheat" a little with the increasing array of special pieces at their disposal!  I've had this little shuttle sitting on top of a Pringles can as if it were a landing pad; it looks cool that way.  Yes, I'm a geek.
