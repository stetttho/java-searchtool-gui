 But you knew that already, right?  It follows three different alternative timelines.  One is the "normal" one, one is an alternative where Jack Crusher is alive, and Picard is his first officer on the Enterprise, and one is the alternate from "Yesterday's Enterprise," in a losing war with the Klingon Empire.    Along comes Trelane, of an original-series episode, to mess things up.  Turns out that Trelane is a young Q, and Q himself is his guardian, trying (with very limited success) to guide Trelane to adult Q-hood.  Trelane becomes petulant (as he was with Kirk), and all hell breaks loose as he crashes the timelines together and sends Q into near-oblivion.  Sorting it all out is a fun ride, but this is definitely a book I feel no need to keep after reading it.
