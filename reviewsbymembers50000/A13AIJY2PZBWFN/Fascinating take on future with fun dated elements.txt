 One must remember while reading this that the book that it was written in the early 1950s.  Lots of dated elements along the way (EVERY character smokes, for instance) make it interesting.  See how many little ones you can find, like Jakarta referred to by its old name of Batavia, or calculations done on slide rules (!).  There are some strikingly prescient elements, though, as when he mentions continuous television coverage of the front door of a politician involved in a controversy with meaningless commentary in the background (how much of THAT kind of thing have we had to put up with from the all-news channels?!).   Putting that aside, this book is a series of short stories about robots as Asimov sees them and how they follow the three "Laws of Robotics" he set up for them.  But it's more than that; the stories explore how humans might interact with these machines that can think for themselves--especially when human life is on the line or the robots malfunction or both.  Some strain credulity, but this is science fiction so go with it and see where it leads.  The ride can be pretty interesting.
