 This screenplay should be said to be "inspired" by the book _I, Robot_, since it takes the world described in Asimov's short story collection and extends it in all manner of ways.  Four of Asimov's short stories appear in this book in one form or another, usually as flashbacks.  The story, though, is of one reporter's quest to find robopsychologist Susan Calvin, who, in her later years, has isolated herself almost completely from the outside world.  The reporter tries every avenue possible to learn more about his subject as he pursues the goal of actually interviewing her.  This is a screenplay, not a novel.  Reading it takes some getting used to; it uses abbreviations freely ("CU" for close-up, etc.) and is formatted as the movie script that it is.  There are color plates of illustrations based on the screenplay (perhaps from a storyboard for the proposed film?).  They are numbered by scene so that the reader can find the part of the action the picture is depicting.  There are also occasional black and white drawings in the main text.  The illustrations are quite evocative and set the scene well.  The story is a fun read, but near the end it gets a little weird (a metaphysical contest is a little hard to decipher).  But overall, I liked this take on the book and wonder how it would have looked as a movie.
