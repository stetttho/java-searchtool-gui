 This book was written around 1969, when astronauts were first landing on the moon.  There was a serious concern about the possibility, however slight, that there were micro-organisms on the moon that might return to Earth and cause an epidemic.  This concern led to the quarantine of returning astronauts (and the rocks they collected) from the first few missions that landed.  This ended when the fears proved unfounded.  (There is an interesting side note.  The second moon landing recovered several pieces of an unmanned probe that had landed several years earlier.  It was found that bacteria in the probe had survived the launch, the landing on the moon, and several years on the airless surface of the moon with temperature swings of hundreds of degrees.) This book plays off of this idea of "bad stuff from space causes problems on Earth."  There are more than 300 other reviews, so I'll mostly leave the plot alone here.  What I liked about it was the sense it gave of scientific investigation of an important topic on a short time scale.  Trying to "beat the clock,"  the scientists have to come up with and discard theories for how the unfamiliar organism works with unaccustomed speed, which (as you might imagine) stresses them out.  In parallel with other Crichton books, the action takes place over about a week, with simple errors and accidents costing valuable time.  The book is newly relevant with the possibility of "designer" biological agents from labs in rouge nations (or from terrorists) playing the role of the alien infectious agent in the book.
