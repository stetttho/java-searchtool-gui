 Martin Lloyd does a good job in this book of telling the story of the passport.  He uses a fair number of illustrative stories to show how international incidents could come about (an assassination attempt on Napoleon III, for instance) because of passport rules (in that case, passports could be issued by one nation to another's citizens at that time).  The book kept my interest throughout, and it includes illustrative pictures of passports and similar documents.  The author is very conversational, occasionally letting his viewpoint come through but in a non-irritating way.  It is interesting contemplating being a customs officer before passports were at least somewhat standardized.  It's hard enough NOW to determine their authenticity!
