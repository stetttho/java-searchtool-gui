 These are not your typical cuddly cartoon characters.  Sharks eat other fish--and people--with regularity.  (The fish refer to people as "hairless beach apes.")  But they carry on like people most of the time: ordering from catalogs (Sharker Image), watching TV, taking trips to exotic (for them) places.  The guy who writes this has a really funny turn of mind, and each character has a well-developed personality.  Take a look at the current strips at www.slagoon.com if you want.
