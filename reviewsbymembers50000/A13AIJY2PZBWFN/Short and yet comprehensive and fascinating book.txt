 This book is short and reads fast, but it covers its topic--how the compass came about and how navigation was changed by its use--very well.  It talks about how navigation worked before the compass (dispelling the myth that ships hugged the coastline to avoid getting lost).  It looks worldwide for evidence of magnets used for direction finding throughout history, not always for use in navigation.  All in all, a fun and informative book.
