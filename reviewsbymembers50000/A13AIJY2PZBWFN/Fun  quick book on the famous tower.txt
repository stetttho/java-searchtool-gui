 This book isn't just about the tower itself; to set the scene, the author recounts, briefly, the history of the Mediterranean from Pisa's perspective.  Pisa grew to be a prosperous and politically independant town in the middle ages, and to show off it did what most towns then (and some now) do to show off: it built grand buildings.  It started with a massive cathedral and other projects.  The tower was actually just the finishing touch of the grand cathedral; it was its bell tower.  But these huge buildings take time to build, and by the time the tower really got going, Pisa was in decline.  It took great effort just to finish it, several centuries after its foundation was laid.  And the tower's tilt was noted long before completion; upper floors were actually slanted with respect to the lower part of the tower to try to keep them level.  The author recounts how the tower became both an embarrasement (as a defective building) and a part of legend (as the place where Galileo supposedly dropped different weights to disprove Aristotle).  The author is quick but thorough as he recounts how the Galileo thing got started, and why it's likely fiction.  The author does not recount with engineering detail every nuance of its tilt, but he does cover why it started tilting, how it almost collapsed with the "help" of a 19th-century architect and, later, Mussolini, and how it almost got annihilated in the second world war.  He talks a little more briefly than I would have liked about the successful 1990s effort to lessen the tilt.  However, he does cover the politics of the situation well (people were alternately happy and angry with the commision that solved the problem).  Overall, the book covers its subject well in a relatively brief book.
