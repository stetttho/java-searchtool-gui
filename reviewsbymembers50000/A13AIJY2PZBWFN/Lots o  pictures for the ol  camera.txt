 The first thing you need to know is that a Memory Stick Pro stick won't work in a device designed for just the regular Memory Sticks.  So you can stop drooling over the 1GB Pro sticks now.  That leaves regular Memory Sticks, which must have some memory-addressing issue that only allows 128 MB to be available at any one time.  So, to have a larger Memory Stick, you need one with a switch so that you can switch between the two memory chips which each can be no larger that 128 MB.  That's what this stick has.  Of course, you have to take the stick out of the camera to flip the switch.  And the switch is small, but it is surprisingly easy to operate with a fingernail.  Right now, I'm using it with a 2 megapixel camera, so I get over 100 shots per chip, or over 200 shots on the stick.  For a photo geek like me, that's great.  I've been very satisfied with this Memory Stick.
