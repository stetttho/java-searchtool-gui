 This book continues the adventures of Satchel and Bucky and their "owner," Rob Wilco.  This book begins the epic battle between Bucky Katt and Fungo Squiggly, the next-door ferret.  Darby Conley is amazingly creative with coming up with new ways for the "pets" to mess with Rob's life or fight each other or just hang out at the house. This set of strips covers the period around Sept. 11, which Conley handles very well and even manages to get a few giggles in as Rob goes to the Red Cross to donate blood.  That's not easy to do.
