 No doubt I'll be lambasted for lack of political correctness, but I'd probably like this anthology better if the word "lesbian" wasn't in the title!  I didn't find a single story that reflected sex the way I've enjoyed it with women throughout my life and I've tried a lot a wide-ranging things - and liked most of it, too. I think that in order to be deemed "cutting edge" this series has gotten so far away from the way *most* lesbians experience their lesbianism that it bears no real reflection of anything but bizarre and isolated sexual kink. If one - or both! - of the people in the scene do not identify as lesbian, how is the sex "lesbian"? I have to assume that the inclusion of such stories under the label "best lesbian" means the editors think these are lesbian sex acts.   I beg to differ. For example, ask any sex worker who identifies lesbian - sex with a male customer isn't lesbian sex. I also know many butches who don't recoil in shock and horror if a femme reaches down their pants wanting to touch female flesh.  And this is the "best" such talented writers have to offer as insight into lesbian sex in the year 2005? What's with the men, and the straight women, the lack of clear consent, and the endless, endless, endless genderbending and calling it "best lesbian" sex acts? There are stories with "lesbians" yearning to be and acting so much like men that the sex is het! That's simply not what I want in an anthology of "best lesbian" sex.   I thought last year's anthology was as far as they could go labeling the contents "lesbian" but this year went way over the line that works for me. I'll be looking elsewhere from now on for reflections of what I (and I know I'm not alone) call "best lesbian sex."
