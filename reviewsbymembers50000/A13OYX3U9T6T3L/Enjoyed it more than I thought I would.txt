 I am not a romance fan and most of my lesbian focused reading has been erotica anthologies. Recently I ran across a hot hot hot story by this author in one. I had presumed she was basically vanilla and had never read any of her books. But the story was great and so I ordered a couple of her novels.   I didn't realize that she writes two styles and that I was ordering a "traditional" romance (if you can call a lesbian romance that). My mistake, but I thought I'd read this one anyway. (The other was All the Wrong Places, a romantic/erotic novel that I was so pleased with I still can't get my head around how to review it.)  I truly enjoyed this story, though romances aren't my cup of tea. It was funny, to start with, and touching at times. Other reviewers have pointed out that the main character could be your next door neighbor and it felt that way to me too. I  liked it, to my surprise. Not the love story - though it was convincing and sweet - but the sense that this ordinary story of two women falling in love was NORMAL...what we all should have in our lives without denigration from Jesusland types.  I felt good when I finished and might even read another again sometime, and if you knew me, then you'd know that's a major compliment. The sex is indeed vanilla in this tale (not so in All the Wrong Places!) but still explicit enough to be steamy. I am giving it 5 stars because it is exactly what it's supposed to be, and well-written.
