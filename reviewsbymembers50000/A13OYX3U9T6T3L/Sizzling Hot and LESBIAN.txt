 Like Szymanski's first anthology, Back to Basics, this collection sizzles, start to finish. Every story is strong and well-told and focuses almost exclusively on really hot lesbian sex. Women with women doing women in the dark. It's a keeper.  Full of names I don't recognize and many that I do, I think this anthology makes a real effort to find good stories foremost and not just the same old names. But the new writers (at least new to me) are not amateurish. Clunky sentences and tired cliches can ruin a good sensual buzz, and there was none of that in this anthology.  A warning, though, these stories are meant to be creepy and spooky (though some are amusing and light) and in a few cases, demons of the dark have their way with unsuspecting women in less than consensual acts. If that's going to bother you you might want instead to pick up Back to Basics, another great anthology. If you can roll with the occasional vampire who doesn't wait for a signed consent form, you're going to love every page of this book.
