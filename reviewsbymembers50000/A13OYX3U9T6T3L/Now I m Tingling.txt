 The stories in this collection are very good, for the most part, though they are sometimes a little repetitive given that they are purportedly "true." The writing is good and, thankfully, most of the stories are about women who identify lesbian and it is mostly male-free space, which is my preference for erotica about lesbians (as opposed to the "Best of Lesbian Erotica" series which has fewer and fewer women who identify lesbian every year and more and more queer/genderbending; it's just not my cup of tea.) This is a must have for the general lesbian erotica afficianado. A couple of the stories are a little awkward in style, but again, they are purportedly confessional type true stories, not polished works of fiction.
