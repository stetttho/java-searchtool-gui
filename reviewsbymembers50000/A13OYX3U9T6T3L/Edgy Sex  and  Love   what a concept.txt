 I really liked Shadowlands a lot, even though a couple of scenes were not at all to my sexual tastes. What Radclyffe does so successfully, however, is show how much emotional connection heightens sexual tension. So much erotica out there is filled with people searching for their limits and they rarely seem to realize that risking it all emotionally, not sexually, is a powerful thing.   When you do both, as Kyle and Dane do, it can be the most erotic power exchange of all. I have liked all of Radclyffe's books but I was still surprised by the skillful way she conveyed this message of sex and love, power and healing. Very few of our authors write at this complex level.   Some readers might find some of the scenes hard going, but the overall journey, for me, was well worth it. Also, it's very refreshing that this book is about women who love women. Genderbending, to my great relief, was not a significant theme. I'm lesbian, I like erotica about lesbians and this book was right on the mark for me.
