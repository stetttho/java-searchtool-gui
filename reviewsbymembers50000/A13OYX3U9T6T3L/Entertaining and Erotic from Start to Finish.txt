 In the last year I've discovered the real "lesbian" in lesbian erotica - women having sex with women. Sometimes that can be hard to find in a tome with "lesbian erotica" or "lesbian sex" in the title. Not so the books from Bella Afterdark. I've read several of their anthologies, a novel and most recently this collection of novellas and have discovered enjoyable reads about the pleasures of women sharing love and passion with other women.   This collection contains a wide range between the four novellas. None of the four are anything like the others. One dark and spooky, one hilarious, one light and creepy, and one that made me bawl like a baby. Interwoven were moments of pure lesbian passion, the joy of female explorations and sex. It was entertaining from start to finish.  If I have a complaint it's that there was plenty of plot to get in the way of lots of sex, but if you are looking for good, strong stories that also get you hot, this volume is *exactly* what you're looking for. I would recommend that the stories be read separately as the styles are very different. For example, Barbara Johnson begins with sex on page 1 while Therese Szymanski makes you wait quite a while for the payoff. Julia Watts brings lots of laughter in with sexy moments, while Karin Kallmaker turned me on with a character's memory early in the story, then left me in tears by the end - and yet feeling unbelievably positive and hopeful about, well, the universe.  These stories left me in a positive frame of mind, though a happy ending wasn't always the case. There weren't only goodie-two-shoes lesbians, either, but heroines and villans, larger-than-life and so real you think they probably live next door. That, to me, takes real skill on the part of the all the writers. It's part erotic, wholly great storytelling and I enjoyed every page. It was worth the time and money.
