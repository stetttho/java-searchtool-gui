 I won't bore readers with my own synopsis of the book; others have already done much better than I could.  However, a best selling author should have her facts checked carefully.  I'm sure she can afford good researchers.  No aboriginal peoples could have chiseled a cow for archaeologists to find (as they did in this book).  They had never seen one. No cows in North America before 1611.   Secondly, no university would permit a dig to continue with people dying all over the site.  Liability!  If you don't mind suspending reality, you may enjoy Birthright.  In my humble opinion, Nora Robert's Birthright doesn't hold a candle to any of Beverly Connor's archaeological mystery novels.
