 This author has become my favorite.  Her characters are strong, realistic, the kind of people you would like if you knew them.  Her books combine forensics, archeology, and mystery.  Interesting plots, a fast pace and good science make for a great read.   Why her novels aren't at the top of the bestseller list, I don't know.  She's head and shoulders above Cornwell, and as good or better than Reichs.
