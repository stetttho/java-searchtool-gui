 This author is getting better and better.  Like a lot of female mystery writers her novels focus on creating a bigger and better boogey man.   (Male authors don't dwell nearly as much on this theme unless it's within the horror genre.)     The plot twists and turns, the characters are interesting, and it's guaranteed to give you a few goose bumps.  Highly recommended.
