 Kellerman's books don't move with the speed and urgency of say a John Sandford "Prey" novel.  These are slow, carefully plotted stories where the police theorize, interview and in general plod their way to a conclusion.  Alex Delaware serves as a somewhat whitewashed version of a profiler.  Milo Sturgis is a course, rough, genius of a cop.   It's always interesting to see Kellerman reveal the motives bit by bit.  He feeds the reader information in disjointed pieces and manages to throw in a few red herrings.  One little thing about the author that annoys me is the way he describes his characters.  Alex Delaware is, of course nearly perfect in appearance and manner.  But Alex is supper critical of everyone else he encounters.  He notices  that Milo has food on his chin and spots on his ties.  He focuses on  sweat, drool and  shinny bald spots, pimples and bad teeth.   Odd that he doesn't become too graphic with the blood and gore but dwells on physical inperfection
