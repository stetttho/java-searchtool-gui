 Big Susan Conant fan for many years, I've enjoyed her entire Holly Winter's series.    Scratch the Surface is a hundred-eighty degree turn around from the somewhat believable, always enjoyable, dog obsessed Holly Winter's mysteries.  Now we have a totally unbelievable, thoroughly unlikable, idiot named Felicity who has based her career on her lack of knowledge about cats.  Some authors are good at humor and some are not.  When it works it's great, but it's difficult to carry off well.  Susan Conant doesn't have the knack for it.  The reader shouldn't have to play "guess who the author is spoofing".  If this novel is a big inside joke, it's lost on me.
