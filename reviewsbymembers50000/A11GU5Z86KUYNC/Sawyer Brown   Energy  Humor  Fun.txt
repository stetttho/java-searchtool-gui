 This CD captures a little of the energy of a Sawyer Brown concert.  The audience's response to the music, the band's response to the audience.  The only thing missing on the CD is Mark Miller's perpetual motion.    From the upbeat "The Boys and Me"  and "Drive Me Wild" balanced by the more serious "Caf on the Corner" and "All These Years" this is a great mix of songs.  You can't help but move to the music of this band.  And you're bond to smile a little at the lyrics, especially "800 Pound Jesus".   (I just wish they would have included "Betty's Been Bad").
