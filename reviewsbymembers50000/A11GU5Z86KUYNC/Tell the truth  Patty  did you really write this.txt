 As I read Southern Cross, I found myself rechecking the book jacket to see if I was actually reading a Rita Mae Brown mystery.  Dogs fixing computer glitches and cats using the telephone's speed dial are exactly what I would  expect from Rita Mae but not from Patricia Cornwell. As I read doggedly  on to the end, I realized that Patty is determined to show us her sense of  humor. And show us she does with wit as subtle as a Mack truck and just as  funny.   All authors evolve---some not for the better.
