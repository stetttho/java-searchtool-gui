 Stephanie Plum doesn't need more excitement in her life, she just needs `different' excitement.    Evanovich is understandably reluctant to change a formula that has worked so very well for 9 previous novels.  Unfortunately, Stephanie and her posse are beginning to stagnate.   Exploding cars and burning funeral parlors were great fun, but when she reached a dozen, it was time to look for some new interests for her characters.  Having said that, Janet Evanovich remains one of my five favorite authors.  A mediocre Stephanie Plum novel beats ninety-percent of the other literary offerings hands down.
