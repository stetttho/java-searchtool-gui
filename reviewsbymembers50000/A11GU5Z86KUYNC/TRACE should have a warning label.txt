 Patricia Cornwall is laughing at every single one of us that bought this book.  She must be, and so must her publisher.  Readers continue to make her mediocre books bestsellers based on the Cornwell name and what it once meant.      She hasn't written a really good book since Body Farm.  If we continue to buy this quality of book, why should she try to write a better one?    I think Ms Cornwall's personal issues have destroyed that spark of talent that made her first few novels great.   She obviously has come to hate her characters and so have I.   There is not another really good book left in this author.    From now on, for my forensic fix, I'll read Kathy Reichs and Beverly Connors.
