 Mixed feelings about Relics.  I'd rate it an average book with good and bad points.  As a great fan of Beverly Connor's archeological mysteries, I found Mary Anna Evans' Relics just a little disappointing by comparison.  The pace was slow, the plot  improbable.  Also the main character's chip-on-the-shoulder attitude about her race is a little off putting.  I liked it well enough to order a copy of Artifacts, another book by the same author.   I'd recommend one of Beverly Connor's novels in the Lindsay Chamberlain series if you are interested in archeology, forensics, or crime solving in the good old-fashioned Sherlock Holmes style.
