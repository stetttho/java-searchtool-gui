 What a great surpires to find a good mystery that includes a quirky pet psychologist, lots of lovable dogs and an odd combination of murder suspects.  Add to this the author's delightful sense of humor and you have  a very enjoyable read.  I can't wait for Leslie O'Kane's next book in this  series.
