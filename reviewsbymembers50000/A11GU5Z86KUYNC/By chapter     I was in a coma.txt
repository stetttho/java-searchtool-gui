 This book could have had a plot. It did have a plot-for the first chapter.  But then it took a way-wrong-turn and disintegrated into one continuous self-centered whine.   Can't remember when I disliked a character as much as I disliked Carly Linton.  I started to hate her because of the way she treated (or mistreated) her poor cat.  Negligence in the extreme.  Cat lovers won't like that.     Matt Converse did her wrong twelve years ago.  So she hates him, but she wants him, but she hates him.  He's a creep, but he's a hunk, but he's a jerk, but he's a hunk. Imagine those sentiments repeated over and over for three hundred and ninety-four pages.   If you like shallow, silly twits, and you don't like cats-this is the book for you.
