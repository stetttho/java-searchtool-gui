 This is another can't-put-it-down mystery from Beverly Connors.  Her trademark has become the telling of a story within a story.  In this case greed over a centuries old treasure leads to death.  The moral; murderers may change, but the motives remain the same.  Get this novel and you will find yourself voraciously reading the entire Lindsay Chamberlain series and begging for more.
