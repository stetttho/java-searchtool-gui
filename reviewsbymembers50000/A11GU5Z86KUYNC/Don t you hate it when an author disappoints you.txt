 I feel like Linda Howard owes me the price of this book.  You get comfortable with an author and you buy his/her books because you are sure you will enjoy them.  This book could have been written by Linda Howard's Barbie doll, or maybe her 17-year old neighbor.  Shallow, self-centered characters and the male love interest is nothing less than a stalker.  Half way through the novel, I was hoping the killer would find what's-her-name and put her out of all our misery.  Never finished the book and that's the lowest rating I can give a novel,
