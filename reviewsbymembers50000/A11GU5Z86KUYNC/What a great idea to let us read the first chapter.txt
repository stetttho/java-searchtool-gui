 After reading the first few pages online, I couldn't wait to buy the book.  Once I started reading, I didn't want to stop and I wish the story had been much longer.  Today I'm buying Slaying is Such Sweet Sorrow.  If there is such a thing as a comfortable murder mystery, Patricia Harwin knows how to write a darn good one.
