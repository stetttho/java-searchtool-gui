 I really wanted to love this book because I so enjoyed her first novel Arson and Old Lace.  Catherine Penny moves to a small village in England and it's almost as though she is transported to a simpler time and place.  A place where you really know your neighbors; a  place where friends drop by for coffee and gossip; where you plant your own garden; where you can walk for miles through the lovely countryside and never cross an expressway.  Her characters were appealing and warm and Catherine's own strengths and weaknesses made her seem a very believable and likable person.  When death and arson occur in this idyllic setting, the reader is caught up in the attempt to identify and eliminate this menace.  Unhappily the characters in her second novel were just not as interesting.  They were sophisticated and shallow and it was very difficult to care about their petty problems.  When the worst among them is murdered, it just didn't matter very much to me.  Instead of Slaying is Such Sweet Sorrow, I would recommend one of Elisabeth Ogilvie's novels, perhaps A Theme For Reason.  This author had an amazing ability to paint word pictures of rural Maine and to create warm and sympathetic characters.
