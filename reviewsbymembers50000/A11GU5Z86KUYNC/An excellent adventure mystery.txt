 Beverly Connor has become one of my favorite authors.  She keeps the suspense level high while creating complicated plots and sub plots that always leave me guessing.      Dead Secret may be her best Diane Fallon (series) novel to date.  While cave mapping with friends, an accident reveals a skeleton hidden within the cave for decades.    Diane investigates the cause of death and attempts to learn the identity of Cave Doe (the name given to the skeleton).  As she works on the first body, Diane is asked to analyze the bones of yet another cave fatality.  These bones, as legend goes, belong to a witch murdered centuries ago in an English cave.  Diane combines the resources of her crime unit plus those of her natural history museum to discover the identity of both skeletons.    Beverly Connor manages to include just enough forensic detail to create interest, but she doesn't bog the plot down with an overload of scientific data.  She also throws in a bit of archeology, anthropology, and earth science and weaves them into her tale of adventure and mystery.   And what a shocking end to this story.
