 Look out Patricia Cornwell and Kathy Reichs. Beverly Connor's books are as good as anything written by the two reining queens of forensic science.  Connor's heroine is a combination of Sherlock Holmes and Indiana Jones.  Her books are fast paced and extremely entertaining.  If you like archaeology or forensics, or if you just plain like a good mystery, give Beverly Connor's books a read.  You'll be pleasantly surprised.
