 The suspense level is high in Nevada Barr's latest offering.  I kept turning pages late into the night wanting to know what would happen next.  There were some serious plot flaws as pointed out by other reviewers.  Possibly the most serious-nobody every dialed 911.  When you consider the death and destruction that could have been prevented with a call for help.  But then again, we wouldn't have had another hundred or so pages of cat-and-mouse with a maniac.  Hard Truth has an abundance of strong, capable female characters.  It also gives us a fascinating portrayal of the young victims of severe abuse.  Children driven to a point where they have lost all sense of right and wrong and exist in a delusional state of mind created by their abuser.  I hope Nevada Barr will eventually read these reviews because her long time fans are expressing their unhappiness over the gratuitous violence she has introduced in the last few novels.     Nevada, we love Anna, we love her beautiful parks and wildlife, but we hate the sadistic violence.
