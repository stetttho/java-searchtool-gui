 I have really enjoyed every book in this series and this may be the best to date.  I never re-read a mystery.  Once I know who-done-it there isn't much point in reading the story a second time.  Beverly Connors books are the exception to my rule.  There is enough excitement and enough detail to keep you going back a second or even third time.  I gave my original copy  of AIRTIGHT CASE to a friend (who loved it).  Now I have to buy a new copy so that I can get my Lindsay Chamberlain fix before the next novel in this series is published.
