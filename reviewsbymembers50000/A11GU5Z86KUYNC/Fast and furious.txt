 Like all John Sandford's "Prey" novels, Broken Prey is fast, tense and ugly.  This author knows how to grab his readers and drag them along on a frantic hunt for a monster.  You're right there speeding across a farm field during a midnight car chase.  You can see yourself running blindly through hospital corridors seeking a mad man before he kills again.  I confess to skimming over the blood and gore scenes--too much information, but it's not a big problem.  I've loved every one of Sandford's novels and I can't wait for the next.
