 I have no idea what I mean by that.  Really, though, along with This Heat's "Deceit" and G of 4's "Entertainment," this represents the high point of the whole "art punk" movement (well, I really should throw in the Slits' "Cut," as well).  Yet, in a certain sense, this record stands apart from all of them - simply put, I can't think of another record that sounds anything like this, and I mean that as a HUGE compliment.  The dub elements are used more effectively than anywhere else I could point to on a rock album, and once you've thrown in some free jazz, angular post-punk, and killer musicianship, you're left with one heady musical stew, my friends.  You may hear a more tuneful album this year, but you won't hear one that's any more intriguing or disorienting (in a good way).  So angry, yet so much fun!
