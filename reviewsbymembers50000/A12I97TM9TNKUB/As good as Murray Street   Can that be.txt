 Look, I will openly admit that I did not believe that Sonic Youth could pull off a records like their last two (including this one) at this late date in their career.  All I can say is, I'm glad they're proving me wrong.  I've only lived with this one for a couple of days now, so I'm just not prepared to say it's as good as Murray Street (my third fave SY after Daydream and Sister), but it's definitely in that league, and time could prove it to be even better, in some ways.  I will agree with the previous writer that said that nothing on here matches the transcendent Rain on Tin from MS, but frankly, little does in my opinion.  Otherwise, this record may be even more consistent, if not matching the mercurial highs of the last record.  I've already listened to this album five or six times in the last two days, and it only continues to improve with each listen.  In some ways, it actually reminds me of Sister, without the flat out punk interludes like Catholic Block or Hot Wire My Heart - and let me tell you, folks, that's high praise in my book.  If you are a fan of any period of SY's output, you need this record.
