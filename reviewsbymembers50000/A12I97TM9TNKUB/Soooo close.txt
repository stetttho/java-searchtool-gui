 Look, I'd really give this more like 4 1/2 stars, were I able.  ZZ Top are possibly the greatest white groove band ever, and Reverend G's gee-tar playing is worth five stars alone.  But, there are problems here. See, disc four is practically useless.  There's way to much of the fairly lousy "Recycler" album represented, and the bonus cuts practically define "filler."  Ordinarily, I'd just enjoy the first three discs and move on, but... WHERE THE HELL IS "BACKDOOR LOVE AFFAIR"?!  WHERE'S "I NEED YOU TONIGHT"?!  WHERE'S "DUST MY BROOM"?!  Get my point?  There are some genuine classics that are omitted here, and knowing that they padded disc four with mediocrities therefore really irks me. Otherwise, the packaging and music are stellar, and it really is PRACTICALLY all the ZZ Top you need.  As it is, I'm certainly not selling my copies of "Deguello" or "Best of ZZ Top," and I must say that if Warner ever gets around to remastering the Top's first several albums (without all the late 80's retooling that practically ruined them), this set will go, and I'll be picking those up, pronto.
