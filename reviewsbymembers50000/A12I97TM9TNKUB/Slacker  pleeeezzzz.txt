 I got really angry and disturbed when I noticed on another page here that "Slanted" was only boasting a four star review in its original CD incarnation.  This amazing re-make/re-master is currently sitting at a respectable 4 1/2, but come'on! This is, without an doubt, one of the five most influential (and best, frankly) albums to emerge from what will one day be revealed as the morass of Nineties music.  What a friggin' schizo decade it was, indeed.  Sure, there were "Nevermind"'s and "OK Computer"'s to be had, but let's face it, we're talking about a decade that came in with NKOTB's epochal "Step By Step" and endend with Britney, the Backstreets, et al, ruling the nation.  Oh, and throw in a little "I'm Too Sexy" in the middle, just for seasoning. "Slanted and Enchanted" probably did more to save thoughful, provocative, and challenging rock music than any other album during the decade (for evidence, look at Pavement's followers (i.e. Archers of Loaf, Built to Spill, and the like, and compare them to Nirvana's, i.e. Silverchair, Creed, and yes, most of all, the Vines).   Get off your butts and vote, people - "S&E" is as much a five star item as should be Can's "Tago Mago," Zeppelin's "IV," BB's "Pet Sounds," or any other album that helped shape the aesthetics of future bands, while providing reams of great tunes. Y'all be cool!
