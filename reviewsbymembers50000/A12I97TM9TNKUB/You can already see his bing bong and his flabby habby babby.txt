 Good lord, there are some great things in life, but I don't know if anything else is this great.  I've only seen about six or seven of the fourth season episodes, but based on what I've seen, I'd have to agree with others here that this season stands atop Mr. Show mountain as the finest they produced.  I feel like I've been waiting an eternity for this set to arrive, so another month and a half isn't going kill me, I suppose.  Mr. Show is phenomenal comedy, but it's really so much more - a way of life, a way of looking at the world, perhaps.  I've never been witness to smarter comedy, where the material often actually gets funnier after repeated viewing.    Mr. Show is the true way!
