 This is art damaged punk, but more punk than art.  Helios Creed brings the noise - and the phase shifter - in abundance.  These are really exciting tunes, and at the price this is goig for, it's truly a bah-gain.    A little abrasive and, perhaps, off-putting initially, it gets under your skin in the same way that the Fall does (though the two sound nothing alike).    This anthology is a great way to discover a neglected, highly influential indie rock touchstone.  Seriously recommended.
