 Taken on its merits, let's face it: this is easily a four star record.  What many pundits (and even Clinic fans) have fixated on is the relative lack of change in their sound over the course of three albums (and several ep's).  While I understand this view, to a certain degree, I think that using such a standard would also damn many other great bands that created an iconoclastic sound, then milked it for all it's worth.  Think Ramones.  Think AC/DC.  Think U2, even!  Sure, they've veered off their trademark sound over the course of their long career, but with one or two exceptions, those have been their least successful records, artistically and commercially (yes, "Pop," I'm talking to you).  So, what I'm saying is, to say that Clinic are treading water is only fair inasmuch as the music fails to move or excite the listener.  On that score, I'll concede, this is Clinic's weakest record.  But, as I am a huge fan of the first three (especially "Wrangler" and "Three EP's," both of which I consider essential), this is not to imply that I dislike this album - I think it's very good.  And I agree with the others here who've said that there is growth to be found here - especially in the doo-wop fixtures of the great tune "Falstaff," and in some new sonic trickery here and there.  I won't pretend that wouldn't like Clinic to start to move their sound into some new areas, but again, in subtle ways, I think they are doing so, and I think that album is a tentative step in the right direction.
