 Don't you all realize that Radiohead keep getting better and better?  Okay, "Bends" was a great record, but honestly, their last three records trump it!  I mean it!  I don't know how to get this through to all of you Coldplay fans, but hell, even Chris Martin admits that Radiohead are head and shoulders above anybody else right now.   I truly love this record!  My prescription for the haters: listen to Neu!'s first record and Can's "Future Days," come back to "Kid A," and it will all make sense, and you'll never be able to live without this record again. Believe it!
