 As my heading states, I'm nearly convinced that this is Malkmus' best work since the demise of the late, great Pavement; that's saying something, because I am actually quite a fan of "Pig Lib."  This album, as some reviewers have stated, is probably the most Pavement-esque solo record he's made, and man, is that a good thing.  The weirder tunes and noises, truly some of the strangest in his entire recorded output, only enhance the quality of the work.  His lyrics are typically inscrutable, and also typically brilliant.  I don't know what the world would be like without this man's contributions, but it would certainly be a sadder place, indeed.
