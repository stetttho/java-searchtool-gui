 I'm listening to this on, of all things, a six pack, and I can't even tell you how beatific it sounds!  I'll openly acknowledge that this is my first Bardo record, so, accordingly, I'll speak as a neophyte.  This is head and shoulders above so much of what is masquerading as neo-psyche, etc. now a days.  I'm definitely going to investigate other Bardo recordings, but for the time being, this will feed my head just fine.  Don't be misled by the Yo La Tengo or Mogwai comparisons (though I am a big fan of the former); this is its own thing, all together.  And, I know from my listen on the way home from the record store, this doesn't require any sort of altered state to ensure serious enjoyment.
