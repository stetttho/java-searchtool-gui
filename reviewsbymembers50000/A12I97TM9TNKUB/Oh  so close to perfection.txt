 I'm not giving any Sam Cooke compilation that's this comprehensive less than five stars, but I personally prefer the tune stack from "A Man and His Music," and wish they'd just remastered that with some annotation included.  Why, oh, why did they have to omit "Soothe Me," "Rome Wasn't Built in a Day," or "When a Boy Falls in Love" (I don't care HOW shmaltzy that song is, it's a beautiful Cooke performance).   Nevertheless, this collection is pretty spectacular, and the sound is definitely better, so I guess I'm just going to have to dig up those other tunes on other albums.
