 And, frankly, that song is why I bought it.  That the rest of the album is solid 70's metal is icing on the cake.  "Sails" is, quite simply, one of early metal's crowning achievements, especially for Uli Roth's disciplined yet mind-blowing guitar solo during the intro.  Blackmore has NOTHING on this guy.  Further, it's rhythm track is surprisingly funky, if you can buy that without hearing it.  Trust me.  With the exception of a few tracks on "Blackout," I'm not much of a Scorps fan, but this album is really great, in its idiom.  And, seriously, if you want to hear some of the finest hard rock guitar playing ever, pick up this bad boy.  You best believe!
