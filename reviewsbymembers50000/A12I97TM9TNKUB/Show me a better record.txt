 Well, I'll give it up: Amazon's good.  This was just posted to me as a recommendation, and not only do I already own it, but it's one of my very favorite records. Buy this.  Seriously.  I can't say anything else.  I give no caveats, I offer you nothing else.  "A Rose for Emily," "Beachwood Park," "Time of the Season," and "Care of Cell 44" are among the greatest pop tunes of all time.  REALLY, BUY THIS!  I can't sing it strong enough.  If you don't own this album, please correct that.   Really!
