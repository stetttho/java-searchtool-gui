 I'm going out on a bit of a limb here to say that this is Sir Richard's best record since "Amnesia," and with time could prove to be his best solo record ever!  The songs are mostly top notch (though there's nothing quite as perfect or timeless as, say, "Waltzing's for Dreamers" or "Dimming of the Day" here), and the band and production are both among the best Thompson has ever enjoyed.  God bless John Chelew!  First John Hiatt's "Bring the Family," now this.  I can't think of a producer that gets better performances or sound than Chelew.  I mean Ry Cooder and Jim Kelter's sounds have never been better represented than on "Bring the Family," and I'd say the same about Thompson's guitar here. I'm not going into individual songs, for lack of time, but I will offer a RAVE for the song "Jealous Words."  Honestly, if you're any kind of Thompson fan, this album is worth the purchase for that tune alone.  It's a great song, but the guitar playing is what really sends it over the top - the solos in this rank with the playing in "Shoot Out the Lights," "Can't Win," and "The Way that it Shows" as some of his best studio work ever.   The bonus disc is too short, but it's really good, and the Prince cover is priceless.   Yes, indeed - go get this record now!
