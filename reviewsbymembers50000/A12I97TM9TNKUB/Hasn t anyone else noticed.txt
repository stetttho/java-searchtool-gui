 First off, disc one of this set is superb, no question.  It's like Sly's Greatest Hits expanded, with considerably better fidelity.  I'd say that, if you're not planning on buying the first several Sly albums, this set is crucial. Having said that, I feel I should lay out a caveat about disc two - am I the only one who's noticed that most or all of the "Fresh" tracks are seemingly alternate takes?  Further, though they're interesting (especially for someone, like me, that already owns "Fresh") for comparison, they are mostly inferior to the versions on the album.  In any case, "Fresh" should be in anyone's funk collection - this disc omits great songs like "Thankful and Thoughtful" and, yes, once again, "Que Sera, Sera."   Finally, though the sound on the "Riot" tracks is brighter, and probably "better" from an audiophile's standpoint, I don't think that the new master does much for the record, to be honest.  Though cleaned up a bit, the songs still sound muffled and tinny, and the brightness is almost distracting, in my opinion.  So, in the final analysis, if you get this set, I wouldn't get rid of my copies of their great early 70's albums.
