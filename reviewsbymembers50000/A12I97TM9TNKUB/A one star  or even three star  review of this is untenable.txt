 I've only had this album for a few days, and it has, in short order, become my favorite purchase in quite some time. I can honestly say that this album is quite unlike anything I've ever heard, and it's musical and emotional peaks are simply staggering. I hear elements of Mahavishnu, Orff, and early music, yet its sum effect is something completely different than any of them. The idea that this album offers mostly difficult noise is simply completely off base. It is very through-composed, with impressive improvisation in spots (and killer drumming throughout). Although I don't know if this music is traditionally "accessible," I certainly found it immediately likeable and intriguing. Since then, it's only become more forceful, in my mind. I've already ordered another album of theirs (no slight thing, since it cost me $30), and I'm excited to see what other surprises Magma holds. If you have even slightly adventurous tastes in music, and if you can find this record, I can't recommend more highly that you get it.
