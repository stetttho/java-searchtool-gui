 Thank you, Amazon (or, more correctly, one of your associate dealers)!  Thanks to you both, I now finally own the album that I have most coveted for the last 10 years or so.   I must say, my review was very helpful to me (just a bit of meta-humor there).  All I can say is that this is one of Scofield's two or three best records, in some ways, still my favorite to this day (it was the second one that I heard, after "Still Warm).  I truly believe that, though Sco has grown as a player over the years, he's never quite surpassed, on record, the tune "Holidays" from this album.  Simply put, I've never heard anything quite like it in jazz, rock, fusion, or from the jam band scene (something about it's loping feel suggests some Grateful Dead material, though it's light years beyond them in every way).  Also, Steve Swallow's bass solo on that tune is probably my favorite ever; it's incredibly beautiful, and operates like a mini composition within a composition. Though the album never again achieves the same staggering level of achievement, that's really no insult to the other songs, which are all terrific.  It simply means that "Holidays" is, for me, up there with things like Sonny Rollins' "St. Thomas," Coltrane's "A Love Supreme," or Sam Cooke's "A Change is Gonna Come" - a rare, perfect musical achievement that feels as though not a single detail could be any different, much less any better. Wow, I'm glad I finally found this album.
