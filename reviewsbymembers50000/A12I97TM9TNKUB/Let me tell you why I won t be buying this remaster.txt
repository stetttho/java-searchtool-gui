 First, off, let me say that I couldn't be a bigger fan of "Odessey and Oracle."  I have the '98 30th Anniversary edition, and I love it to death.  If this remaster is your best shot at getting the album, buy it, by all means.  It's a very nearly perfect record, easily one of the best of the sixties.  Having said that, the clips that I've listened to of the bonus tracks sound completely out of character with the album at hand.  Most of them sound much more like a group trying to ape the Rolling Stones' sound circa "Flowers" or "Between the Buttons," and while that's not a bad thing, necessarily, I simply don't think that they achieve anything near the craft or individuality of the album itself.  For that reason, I doubt I'd even listen to them much.  Moreover, the previous issue included, as part of the stereo version of the original album, the stereo take of "This Will Be Our Year," certainly one of the highlights of an album full of them.  Personally, I greatly prefer that version, which, for technical reasons, does not include the horn charts of the finished version.  In my opinion, the horns do nothing for the song, and in some parts, they are downright obtrusive.  If the new master included, even as a bonus cut, the "sans horns" version of that tune, I might consider it.  As is, no thanks.  And, again, I just don't think that these bonus tracks, which were recorded apparently somewhat piece-meal for a follow-up album that was never released, really add to the value of the album.  Okay, that's it.  Like I said, if this is the version that you can find, don't hesitate to get this amazing album in any form that you can.  Me, I'm sticking with my tried and true Big Beat version.  Like the Beach Boys "Pet Sounds," to which this record is often compared, bonus cuts are relatively beside the point.  This record is a perfect, unique entity, and recordings made by the band shortly thereafter are simply superfluous.
