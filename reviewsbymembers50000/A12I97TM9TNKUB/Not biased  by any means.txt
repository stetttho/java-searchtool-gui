 I can't believe how many of the reviews here almost seem to have been written about another book!   First off, let me say that this book is excellent.  Having been raised Mormon, having served a mission, etc., I understand the doctrine quite well.  I, myself, noted very few errors in Krakauer's book, and none that seemed deliberately malicious (i.e. Krakauer states in a footnote that LDS members refer to Jews as "gentiles," which I've never heard (though it is true that other faiths are so termed), but this is also a negligable error).  My take is that Krakauer stumbled across the polygamist colony in Colorado City, was astonished by what he found, and decided to investigate.  Krakauer, unlike so many who undertake such studies, is not a disgruntled ex-Mormon, and has no reason to paint the Mormon church in an unfavorable light. And, can I make one other slight clarification?  The book is sub-titled "A Story of Violent Faith," not "Story of a Violent Faith."  The "a" may seem a small difference to some, but it is most certainly not, in this context.  Krakauer is specifically referring to the actions of Dan and Ron Lafferty, along with perhaps the early Mormons who committed the atrocities of the Mountain Meadows massacre.  He is not calling Mormonism violent, as a whole; rather, he is referring to what can occur, at its worst, through religious fundamentalism of any kind. As far as I'm concerned, this book was extremely interesting and readable, and I think it's the most balanced book of its kind that I've read.  His prose does not resort to invective, and he rarely, if at all, impunes the modern LDS church.  The problem, as so many others have stated here, is that some aspects of LDS history are controversial, with or without spin or commentary.
