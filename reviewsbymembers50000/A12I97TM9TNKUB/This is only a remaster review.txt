 If you're buying this reissue, chances are you already know what you're getting.  So, I'm just speaking here to the quality of the remaster, which is superb.  On the previous edition, some of the tunes evinced some tape distortion, etc.  All of that has been cleaned up, and the end result is a much more pleasurable listening experience (god, it sounds like I'm writing for Gramaphone or something).    "Yoo Doo Right" and "Father Cannot Yell" are still what make this album worth owning, of course.  As an album, musical merit and all that, I'd say that this is really more of a four star record.  It's very good, but clearly not up to the remarkable standars of "Tago Mago" or "Ege Bamyasi."  More than worth owning for those two tunes, though.    Speaking of those other records, I'm seriously bummed that they've been pushed back to November 30th.  I want an explanation, and it better be a good one!
