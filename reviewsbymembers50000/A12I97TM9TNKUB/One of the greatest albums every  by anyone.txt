 Once in a blue moon, I feel absolutely compelled to review an album, simply because it has recently absolutely blown my mind.  This is one such record.  As much as I love the Birthday Party, and several other Cave output, this may be the single greatest album that I've heard with his name attached.  "Nobody's Baby Now" is so good it almost hurts, and I don't care who the hell has covered "Loverman" (including Metallica), there's no topping the version included herein.  Once you add in masterpieces like "Do You Love Me" and "Thirsty Dog," along with the supernal "Red Right Hand," there is barely a chance of topping this record.  In terms of consistency alone, it's one of the greatest albums I've ever heard.  If you have any curiousity about the work of Cave, with the BP or the BS, you absolutely MUST check this album out first.  If ever there was a record that will lead you to pursue other records in an artist's catalogue, this is the one.  Simply put, this is brilliant beyond words.  I've studied the holy books, and this album will put you closer to "the truth" than most of them.
