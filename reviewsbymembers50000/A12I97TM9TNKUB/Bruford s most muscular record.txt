 I don't have much to add, other than to say that the claims of this record's sound quality being p-poor have been blown out of performance.  What's more, this record really is a bit of a revelation, truth be told.  The performances stretch more than on the studio albums, yet the players are still rock solid, and very tight.  Plus, it's great to have all of the good tunes from "Feels Good" on one record with the highlights of "One of a Kind," as well.   Okay, so the keyboard at the beginning of "Hells Bells" is a bit too distorted and high in the mix - by mid tune, it's been corrected, and otherwise, this is prog-fusion at it's very finest.  I'd swear by this record.  Oh, and I still have a hard time believing that the "unknown John Clark" isn't just a pseudonym for Allan Holdsworth.
