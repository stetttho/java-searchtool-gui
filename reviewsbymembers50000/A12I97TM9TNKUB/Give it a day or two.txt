 Having loved Scofield and his music forever, I tend to count on him to deliver with each outing.  But, to be honest, when I first listened to this here platter, I was somewhat let down.  Initially, I would have whole-heartedly concurred with those that opine that melody has taken a back seat to texture and groove this time out. And you know what?  It has.  What I've found, though, is that it helps to treat this album as an entirely different creature than "Still Warm," "A Go Go," or even "uberjam."  There's much more in terms of dub and psychedelic elements to the new record, and if you give the album time to grow on you, the amazing array of trippy sounds will become their own reward. And, since that might not be enough for some of you, know that the playing is just as stellar as ever.  Scofield's soloing, though heavily effected, is still ridiculously inventive, especially on the great band performance that is "Creeper."  Plus, Scofield has never released a more stylistically diverse record - there's even a drop dead Fela Kuti/Sunny Ade tribute here.  Hell, I'll admit that the album takes a little time to sink in, but once you submit to its charms, "Up All Night" more than repays the effort.
