 Look, I'll be the first to admit, I've given a lot of Scofield's albums five star reviews here, and some of them may or may not deserve that ultimate accolade ("Bump," anyone? - though I do really like that record, make no mistake).  But, if ever an album has deserved five stars, it's this here live outing featuring three absolute masters at peak form.  This album is inclusive of so many of Scofield's virtues, it's not even realistic to name all of them.  While nearly all of the material here is new to John's canon ("Over Big Top" is an extrapolation of a riff from his "Groove Elation" album), it all feels instantly accessible and memorable.  And the playing!  People, jazz improv literally does not get better than this.  All three solo and swing at the peak of their abilities.  I've seen Scofield live four times, and though he was mind blowing each time, this is at least representative of Scofield on a great night, if not better than that.  And the same holds for Swallow and Stewart. If you are a fan of straight-ahead jazz in any way, shape, or form, I can't recommend this album highly enough.  It is (only time will tell, for me) very possibly the best album Scofield has ever released, and certainly features his best recorded work.  Do yourself a favor and order yourself a copy.
