 Good Lord, this record is fantastic.  It was my first Silkworm purchase (I've since bought "Developer," and anticipate buying more), and I have a hard time believing any of their other albums are better.  If so, my brain will fry!  I'm not sure that, barring Robert Quine or Marc Ribot, I've heard a better guitarist from the "alternative" world than Andy Cohen.  I wish I knew which of their records had the most of his soloing, because I'd buy it instantly. As far as "Italian Platinum" is concerned, everything works magnificently.  Albini's production is stellar, the songs get their claws into you on the first couple of listens, and the additional musicians add a nice touch to the proceedings (especially Kelly Hogan's vocals).  This is an early contender for my rock album of the year, and I can't recommend it highly enough.  Other than Spoon, I can't think of a band right now that shows more promise - but Silkworm's been at this for years now!  Very impressive stuff, indeed.
