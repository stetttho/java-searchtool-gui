 Look, these guys are good (well, Jack is, anyway), but this album's hype is WAY out of proportion to its musical merits.  I'd say that, at best, half of the record is good to borderline-brilliant, but that other half... whew!   It makes me sad that the rock cognicenti are so desparate for the next leader of the new school that they are willing to lavish such unrelenting praise on a fairly mediocre album - and I say this as someone that quite liked "de Stijl" and "White Blood Cells."  Here, more than occasionally, White's ambition gets the best of him, and when such occurs, it's embarassing, frankly.   A good album, in the end, but five stars from RS?  Record of the year in Spin?  Give me a break - I'd much rather something deserving, like the new Outkast, or the Sun Kil Moon record, see the accolades (not that Outkast needs help in that regard; they were No. 2 on Spin's list).
