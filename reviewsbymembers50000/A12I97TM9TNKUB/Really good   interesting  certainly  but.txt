 Frankly, I object to the way that this album and "International Recue" were compiled.  Each one manages to give, on it's own, a frustratingly inaccurate portrayal of what Swell Maps are really about (IMO, a real Swell Maps album somehow resembles closely Pavement's "Wowee Zowee," and the Stocktonites were certainly influenced by SMs).  This album leans heavily on the Krautrock-ian, experimental side, while IR presents them as a bordering-on-conventianal, if very good, punk band (i.e. "Read About Seymore," "Let's Build a Car").  The ideal would be to mix and match these two collections on your own mix-tape; so, buy 'em both, and do just that!
