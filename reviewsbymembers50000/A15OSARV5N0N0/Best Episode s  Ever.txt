 This set might be the very best Dr Who adventure of all, certainly the most significant of the Tom Baker/Liz Sladen period. Significant in terms of how the story deals with very grown up ideas [war, genocide, race hatred and the Doctor's moral responsibility to the future] in a way that even a 13 year old can make sense of. Characters are richly drawn and believable, even when they only appear for a scene or two and then are killed off. This was also the episode that introduced me and my American pals to the Daleks when Dr. Who was exported to American Public Television in the late 1970's, and I can still remember waking up from Dalek nightmares in a panic; none of the Doctor's other adversaries produced such a reaction from me. They are like R2D2's sadistic, amoral bretheren and amongst the best villains ever concieved of. Going back and watching the story as an adult I am struck by how grim this sequence of episodes actually is -- we get everything from trench warefare [including attack by poison gas shells] to Daleks gunning down the Kaled Elite en masse and even a weapon of mass destruction that wipes out an entire race. Nice. Add to all the carnage the story of the Doctor trying to stem the Dalek menace before it even starts and then having to come to grips with the moral consequences of how his actions will effect the future and we have Sci Fi worthy of Kubrick or Lucas. The special effects shots look kind of phony at times, but the unremittingly bleak picture painted by the story tones their effect down. Even the traditional Dr Who camp has a droll, fatalistic air to it. Coupled with the 2 parter "Sontaran Experiment" quickie this is a must-have for any serious Dr. Who afficianado and a great starter for a collection. Higly recommended.
