 This is kind of an odd entry into the Tom Baker Dr Who episodes, set in Renaissance Italy and concerning a vaguely defined interstellar Space Threat that wants to enslave humanity through a pagan religion. At stakes are the Duchy of San Martino, Leanardo daVinci, and a whole lot of great looking period costumes. This is kind of a hard episode to really get enthusiastic about (even though it is very well made) if only because there are times when one isn't sure if the actors are playing straight with us or laughing up their sleeves when the camera isn't on them. Baker especially at times seems to step outside of the seriousness of what the story tries to set and embarks on fits of histrionics that seem like desperate attempts to make the story more interesting for Doctor Who fans that might be getting bored. My favorite character is the mysterious seer Hieronymous [just listening to the actors speak his name is fun], but it's never really clear just what the threat he propogates is (though Baker does his best to explain it to us through Sarah) or just how the Hieronymous became involved. Or the Doctor, for that matter. The effects-dependent final slaughter by the Bretheren is especially awkward, and sort of hints at a script that needed an ending rather than a successful conclusion to an involving story. Still, it's a fun episode to look at and listen to -- costumes and sets all appear appropriate, Count Frederico makes a worthy, sneering, period-insult spewing villain, I love the scenes set outside it what are certainly authentic Medeterranian ruins, and the episode seems to slyly hint at a relationship between Duke Juliano and his companion Marco that is ahead of it's time for 1976 era televison. Worth a look; recommended for fans.
