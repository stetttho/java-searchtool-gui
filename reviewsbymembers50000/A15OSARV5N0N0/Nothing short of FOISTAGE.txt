 I am delighted to see the universal intolerance voiced here with SD's little DVD of one of the most important of the 1970's Italian Sex & Horror Show movies. THE NIGHT EVELYN CAME OUT OF THE GRAVE is a total classic, with a showcase appearance by Erika "LEGS" Blanc as a stripper involved with a plot to drive a wealthy young duke out of his skull. Classy, filled with great colorful sets, "cool" music and a fabulous modernist look, this is a Giallo that really isn't a Giallo at all & sort of mocks that specific sub-sect of Italian horror by having  the killer wearing yellow gardening gloves [Giallo is Italian for "yellow"] instead of the usual sexy black variety. With that said, you'll be better served buying one of the cheapo fullframe releases from Alpha Video or on one of the Brentwood Home Video box sets TALES FROM THE BONEYARD and FRIGHT NIGHT: This is a reburn of Sinister Cinema's DVD-R release, which suspiciously found it's way into the market about 6 - 10 weeks before this release and wasn't even transferred at the proper aspect ratio by SD, which is why the picture looks "squished" -- all of Sinister's widescreen releases are optimized for 16:9 screens with the flick of a switch, but sadly nobody told SD's technicians this before they ripped off the transfer.  So whatever: If you want a codefree reburn of Sinister's work that appears to have been engineered by circus chimps who had acess to DVI technology, here you go. Just be forewarned that it will look awful, you'll want your money back, and then you can come here & share your pain with us. We feel for you, and want to try and help.
