 One of the signs of a great TV series is how it can cross genres and use it's characters to produce stories of differing flavor. This episode is essentially Dr Who as a period Creature Feature that is as entertaining as anything Hammer films ever made, tossing Baker's Who and Leela (always my favorite of the Doctor's companions) onto an isolated lighthouse island where the indigenous lot are killed off one by one by the fabled Creature of the Rock. The formula of the story follows that of a standard horror flick -- a group of people are trapped in an isolated place they can't escape by something that takes a feindish pleasure in killing them off while generating terror. And as with the best of the Who episodes, what makes us care about them is the attention to charictarization, even if they do border on stereotypical roleplaying. I still remember this story creeping the heck out of me as a youngster and was pleased to see that it still holds up after all the years. Other than a rather goofy shot of the Creature crawling up the side of the lighthouse, the effects shots in this episode are remarkably convincing, especially the inspired "Creature's perspecive" views. This is an episode that relies more on plot and atmosphere than gimmicks and dopey space weapons, and it's a nice change of pace. And then there is Leela ... this is the episode that finally gave Louise Jameson a reason to shed the brown contact lenses she had been wearing to cover her beautiful blue eyes, and if I might say Leela never looked better than in black trousers and that wonderful, figure fitting sweater Vince manages to dig up for her. Even without her delightfully skimpy animal skins this manages to be an enteraining "adult" episode that I have a very soft spot for, though it might be downright scary for younger viewers. It was for me back then. Highly recommended.
