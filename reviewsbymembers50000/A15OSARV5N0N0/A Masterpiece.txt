 This really is a great episode, combining aspects of "The Thing" with a gloriously improbable story about plants taking over the world that would have seemed ridiculous under any other circumstances. But as described by Tom Baker's Who, it is a believable and convincing threat and we are actually concerned about the characters involved who get trapped in the Meglomaniac's gothic mansion in a scene borrowed from "Night of the Living Dead" as they nail boards over the windows. As with the best of the Who stories what makes this one click is not the Monster [looking at various times like a man who has been smeared with Gardenburger and a huge, quivering glob of vegetable lasagne] but the concise characterizations of the principal players. My favorite is the wonderfully named Scorby [he doesn't even have a first name], a mercenary type that would just as soon kill everybody and be done with it. His final crackdown isn't too convincing -- anyone who has seen combat in "Africa, the Middle East, you name it ..." wouldn't go spare if a few creeper vines started cracking the glass, but his exit scene is a true inspiriation. Parts of the story  rely on what can be referred to as an Idiot Plot where people wander off to be locked outside with the monster or idle by the examination table to be contaminated by something they already know is dangerous, but whatever. I love the arctic research base set and the general air of apocolypse, and hearing Baker recite lines like "Waffle ... Waffle! Waffle! Waffle!" is exactly why I watch this stuff in the first place. Highly Recommended.
