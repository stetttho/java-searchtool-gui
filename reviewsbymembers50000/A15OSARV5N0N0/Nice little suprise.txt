 A friend put this on for me the other night and the minute I heard the words "Dennis Hopper" and "low budget sci fi" I groaned with anticipated discomfort, but was pleasantly suprised by Space Truckers' contents. While far from profound, the film's acceptable Odyssy-esque story takes second chair to a wacked-out, 100% convincing vision of the future and the community of characters who inhabit the portions of it that the film concerns itself with, some of which was quite memorable; A pirate thug named "Scummy", square zero-g pigs, a bar/diner set in a revolving hub ala 2001 to simulate gravity, self-defense mechanisms with apparent senses of humor, and an uproarious, innappropriately hilarious death machine monster that is right out of Red Dwarf. The film has an irreverent view about it's idiom, manages some effective sex appeal amidst the laughs, and has a kind of upbeat infectiveness that might be tied into the comic book/cartoonishly bright color palette that manages to seep into almost every shot. And in the end what impressed me the most about Space Trucker was that, like the great satires that have come before it who also fashion their own self-contained universes where our laws of physics might not necessarily apply [The Simpson's and Shakes the Clown coming to mind immediately], the filmmakers wisely kept within the framework of the genre they were creating for -- schlocky modestly budgeted sci fi -- and by not bothering to aim any higher produced one of the most entertaining films I have sat through in months. Highly recommended, and destined for some sort of "cult" status when it is rediscovered.
