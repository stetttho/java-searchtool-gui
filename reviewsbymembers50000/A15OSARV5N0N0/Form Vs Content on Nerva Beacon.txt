 I'm pleased to see that the majority of folks reviewing this tape have given it high marks. "Ark In Space" was my favorite Liz Sladen era episode as a young 'un, and I was delighted to finally have the episode on tape to view as an adult and contemplate the very eloquent story it aspires to tell. Sadly, in my eyes, this is one of the scripts that really suffered because of the limited budget and time alloted to its filming. After thirty years of Kubrick and Lucas and Ridley Scott, there are moments in this adventure where the nickle and dime set construction and effects shots really mar at one's suspension of disbelief. I admit that the white, sterile atmosphere of the Beacon [along with the THX 1138ish white jumpsuit costumes, in which Liz Sladen has never looked better] does create a convincing sense of place that is well suited for the teriffic story the episodes relate, but there are moments when you can see through the world they represent and realize that we are looking at a low budget Sci Fi TV set. The hybernation pods that the Nerva crew emerge from look especially phony -- you can even see the saw marks on Vira's chamber as the camera lingers on her face, revealing that it is indeed a carved piece of styrofoam and the door hinged with a brownish packing tape. But then again, when you put a Doctor Who tape in your deck you are sort of signing a "suspension of disbelief waiver form" where stuff like that isn't supposed to matter, so I am just being picky and spoiled. The charictarizations and complexity of the story line more than make up for it, and I love the scenes of the tortured Noah as he transforms into a half man half walking glob of green spray painted bubble wrap. You gotta love it. Recommended.
