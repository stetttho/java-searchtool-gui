 I have a particular fondness for what might be referred to as 'public domain material'; films/TV shows that are either un-licensable or not currently licensed & pretty much fair game for anyone to do what they like with. And I must say that for the dollar cost these 50 Movie Packs by Mill Creek & Treeline Films are usually worth taking a gamble on -- for about $.50 cents a movie you are bound to find something worth watching more than once, and this box set is probably their best collection to date.  There literally is something for everyone on here: Giant rampaging monster movies (MILPITAS MONSTER, TRACK OF THE MOON BEAST), cult Euro horror (WITCHES MOUNTAIN, THE BLANCHILLE MONSTER), urban slashers (DRILLER KILLER, DRIVE-IN MASSACRE), 80s teen oriented trash (DEADTIME STORIES, FUNERAL HOME, MEMORIAL VALLEY MASSACRE), a classic Euro crime/revenge thriller (DEATH RAGE), some genuine classics from American horror (SILENT NIGHT BLOODY NIGHT, MESSIAH OF EVIL), even some stuff completely out of left field that sort of defy description (HORROR OF SPIDER ISLAND, REVENGE OF DR. X, PANIC, THE COLD) and will command multiple viewings. Something which cannot be said of say, the new KING KONG DVD. Heck, you even get Mr. Jackson's BAD TASTE, an aptly named film that is ten times more imaginative, clever and endearing even if a bit primative compared to what his computer programmers can whip up. Anyone else had enough of that junk? Well here are 50 movies that don't use any CGI and some are actually very well made, even if the DVDs aren't.  And while the print quality is uniformly poor -- most are old fullframe home video or television prints -- the content is so diverse and some of it so utterly obscure that they sort of transcend the "bargain bin" nature of the collection and makes the box set a very rewarding investment for those who like to see stuff that might be a bit more obscure than what you can find on Netflix: This box set marks the first ever DVD pressing of WITCHES MOUNTAIN, the 85 minute print of SILENT NIGHT BLOODY NIGHT is the most complete version currently described (most run 83 minutes, including the old VHS versions), nobody else seems to have TRACK OF THE MOONBEAST or THE MILPITAS MONSTER, and who can resist stuff like THE REVENGE OF DR. X, DEADTIME STORIES (with all of the nudity, sleaze & gore), DRIVE-IN MASSACRE and Alfonse Brescia's WAR OF THE ROBOTS?  One other thought, which is that these sets kind of represent the future of this medium of public domain collections. The packaging is bare-bones, two movies per side on 12 double sided DVDs, cardboard sleeves for the discs inside of a larger carton, and so much material to sample & choose from that if a movie stinks, let it. Just move on to another title and let fate take you where it will. For $.50 cents apiece the movies are allowed to stink and the DVD transfers be somewhat sub-par: The collection very easily pays for itself just by being so darn watchable. I highly recommend taking a chance, and Mill Creek did a wonderful follow up with their '5O DRIVE-IN CLASSICS' collection too. Someone working there knows what they are doing.
