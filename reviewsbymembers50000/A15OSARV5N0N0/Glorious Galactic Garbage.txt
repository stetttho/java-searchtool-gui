 This was always one of my favorite episodes as a kid, and as an adult I watch it and marvel. They literally just don't make 'em like this anymore. In fact, they can't; a budget, capable acting and a more plausible script would get in the way of all the fun. The story is of course preposterous, the acting laughable [Salomar has to be the biggest idiot ever given command of a space crew in the history of Sci Fi] and the special effects are so goofy that you have to laugh the first time the show the Space Probe (where was Derrick Meddings when they needed him?). Well, so what. That's why I watch Dr. Who in the first place, thank you. I revel in the cheap, shoddy interior sets [dig the office supply store chairs on the command deck], grin from ear to ear at the histrionics of the actors ["Psycho-Stimulators Not Responding!!"] and would love to slog through that space jungle they created on a soundstage. In fact, the most effective sequences are the ones set in the jungle and shot on film, especially Baldwin's hectic run through the jungle right at the beginning of the episode and then the unforgettable Occuloid Tracker (great name for a band) following The Doctor and Sarah through the lush, purple plastic and coaxial cable foliage. I will always be a kid when I watch Dr Who episodes like this one from the Tom Baker years, and that is what makes it such brilliant trash -- (...)you can be 13 again any time you pop this tape in the machine. Sounds like an equitable price to get your youth back for an hour and a half. Recommended.
