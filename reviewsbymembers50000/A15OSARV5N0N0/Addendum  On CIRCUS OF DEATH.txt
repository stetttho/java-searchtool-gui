 In my review of WEB OF THE SPIDER I noted that "matters weren't clarified much by the release of Brentwood's CRICUS OF DEATH 4 DVD box set, featuring the exact same video transfer". That is INNACURATE, folks; while I did not stopwatch time it or check the run time on my player, the Brentwood Media CIRCUS OF DEATH DVD with THE WEB OF THE SPIDER does contain material that had been excised from the same print used by Timeless Video for this release. They ARE made from equally dismal transfers, and perhaps even the same one, but bits have been sliced out of Timeless' release [i.e. Tony Franciosa wriggling on the bars of the gate after being spiked] that have been clipped off the VHS release ...  Of additional note is that I just noticed Amazon has an "R" rating and 94 minutes for their item description [as does the Timeless box], but Brentwood lists it's WEB OF THE SPIDER as "Not Rated" and provides a 102 minute running time ... I would then state that this tape is probably best suited for collectors, or those who still haven't figured out the benefits of DVD technology. Worth getting, but it is now documented that there is a better source available.
