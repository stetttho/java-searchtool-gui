 I must admit that I gave up on "The Hitchiker's Guide ..." after about 20 pages and hated the TV series (though the BBC radio special has its moments), which looked suspiciously similar to Doctor Who but lacked that certain ... special ... something ... Douglas Adams was an important innovator in our culture's history who will be sadly missed, but his work just goes over my head. And what I see here is essentially a Doctor Who adventure superimposed onto an Adamsesque idea of galactic apocolypse. My lack of familiarity with the "Key to Time" episodes may be a factor here -- American Public Television chose not to air them and skipped forward to the Lalla Ward series. So I am viewing this as someone not "in" on the gist of the encompassing premise and only look at the episodes for what they are. What this particular episode is, is unconvincing; I don't believe anything that is being presented in this installment, and other than the amusing interplay between the Captain and Mr Fibulis [or however his  name is spelled] there really isn't much chemistry in the story. What the story DOES have is Mary Tamm's Romana, decked out in marvelous white slacks and heels and looking far too ravishing (her lipstick assistant must have been on constant call; she always looks like a model in every shot) to be in such a childish premise of a story. The question remains, then, is she alone worth watching the episode for? YES. Recommended for fans of Mary Tamm and Douglas Adams.
