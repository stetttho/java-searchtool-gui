 This was the first of Tom Baker's adventures as Doctor Who, and shows it, though it's popularirty is cemented due to the fact that it's Baker's debut episode and he offers a tour de force performance as an undeniably unhinged Doctor. The story is actually rather silly and looks aimed at a younger audience than the majority of the Baker episodes. This is undoubtedly because of the Loveable Robot Syndrome created by the giant Robot the adventure is named after. The Robot is supposed to be the Menace figure in the episodes, and sure it kills people and blows up stuff real good, but it doesn't want to, then feels bad about having been ordered to kill people and break things. It's a good hearted robot, you see, made by a funny little old Professor [who like all professors in Doctor Who lacks a first name] that doesn't really want to hurt anyone either. Aww. Meglomaniacle killing machines with a consciense just don't pan out as scary threats. The heavy in this film is actually the diabolical scheming head of ThinkTank, and as played by the actress that portrays her makes about as scary of a threat as my third grade homeroom teacher did. Too bad they couldn't have decked her out in some leathers and Nazi-like dominatrix attire and created a villain with some color, but no. All of the color is provided by Baker in one of the most delightfully unrestrained performances in his career. The scene where he works on his wardrobe is perhaps the best of the whole story -- too bad they couldn't come up with a Menace worthy of his energy, because Dr Who adventures pass or fail based upon the effectiveness of their villains. This one fails, but I give it marks for effort. Recommended for fans of the series.
