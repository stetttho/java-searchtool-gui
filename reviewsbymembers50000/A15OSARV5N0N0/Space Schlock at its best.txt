 This is an episode I will always have a soft spot for because it not only has a shuffling, half witted Igor-like character with a hook, but also a clear brain cased shuffling Monster Menace with one human arm ... and a CLAW. RAAAAWR. I love hokey  horror and space hokem, and this is one of the hokiest and enjoyable contrivances in all of Who ... even with the annoying sub-plot involving the Sisterhood and their stupid Flame of Life. The Doctor and Sarah inadvertantly (or not -- it's never made clear) land on  the forbidden planet of Karn, where the Victor Frankensteinish Dr Solon has set up shop and waits for a suitable cranium in which to put the brain of Morbius, all that is left of the most dispicable of the criminal Time Lords. The truncated version I have is the clumsily edited cut referred to above, and it is a real shame -- wieghing in at about 60 minutes, the episode is fun to watch and lives up to the goofy, low budget excesses of Dr Who at it's best, but the story doesn't really make sense because so much has been edited out. [...] As is I'm happy with what I have at one hour, because it contains everything I need -- a hideous vaillainous Menace, the hulking but personable Kondo ["Girl, not see. Kondo, help."] and a great role in the diabolical Solon, insanely driven to his complete greatest triumph -- making a walking joke of a space monster that talks like a Dr Who villain. Perhaps one day I'll shell out for the "collector's edition", but only under one condition: more low-angle shots of Sarah in those great, figure hugging trousers. Yowsa. Recommended, but get the full version.
