 OK I'll admit, this episode kind of does a dis-service to the series in the way that it draws attention to the junky, klunky, kitchy cheapo Sci Fi TV that actually WAS the essence of Doctor Who. This is amongst the first episodes I remember seeing as a kid, and I don't think I was very impressed by the look of it even back then (some of the dead bodies in the quarrantined section of the Beacon are so obviously mannekins that I am surprised they were allowed to get away with it -- sooo fake). But what I am still impressed by is the story and the charictarizations of the principal players. Even the Cyberleader exudes a sense of "person"; he seems to have a twisted sense of humor under that silver spray painted wetsuit of his. And like the "Genesis of the Daleks" episodes, I am struck by how unremittingly grim the elements of the story are for a *family* oriented show. Not only are all of the humans from the Beacon slaughtered to serve the plot, but dozens and dozens of bug eyed Vogans bite the dust in a hopeless, one sided battle against the Cybermen -- why did they bother? So they could die on camera, of course, and show how ruthless the Cybermen are. Unnecessary IMHO, but whatever. I think that Vorus is one of the great anti-heroes of the Dr Who series, and love the part where the slimy Professor Kellman gets his poetic justice [ever notice how these Professors never have a first name? odd] and Lester's scene of ultimate self sacrifice -- that look on his face as he twists the release harnass is well worth sitting through all the dreck. This is also probably the most claustrophobic episode of the Baker years, shot entirely either on the Beacon or the caverns of Voga. After watching it you may want to take a stroll just to feel some wind on your face. Recommended.
