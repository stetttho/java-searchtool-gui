 No matter how many times every comedian in America has tried to imitate her, it's true that no one before her or since ever sang quite like Cher, with her absurdly sultry and dark voice and her powerful way of phrasing. These classic songs from the start of Cher's solo career were some of the finest musical moments of the Seventies. You not only get her most famous ballads, "Gypsies, Tramps and Thieves," "Dark Lady," and "Half-Breed" (dig those groovy war chants in the background during the chorus!), but you also get some of her best unknown songs: the lovely torch number "I Saw a Man" and my own very, very favorite, "Train of Thought" (why wasn't it a hit?).
