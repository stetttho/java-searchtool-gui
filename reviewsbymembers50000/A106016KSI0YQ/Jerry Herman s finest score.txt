 This show probably represents Jerry Herman's best work, even though (heartbreakingly) MACK AND MABEL wasn't a success in Broadway. There are a few weak songs ("Hundreds of Girls," for example), but otherwise the score is marvelous, and offers two beautiful songs which have since become cabaret standards: Mack Sennett's "I Won't Send Roses" and Mabel Normand's lovely melancholy "Time Heals Everything." Robert Preston is very fine as Mack Sennett, but the show's real sensation is Bernadette Peters as Mabel Normand. This was the role that first got her really noticed, and she's astonishing in all the many and very differing songs Mabel gets to sing--including my own favorite song from the show, the marvelously exuberant "Look What Happened to Mabel." Lisa Kirk, the original Lois Lane from KISS ME KATE, is also a knockout in her big number, "Big Time."
