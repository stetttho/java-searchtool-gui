 HAPPY SONGS represents McDonald's rendition of some of the most beautifully evocative songs fo the Forties, and I think represents her best solo work to date. I just think McDonald is the best Broadway singer in years--her voice is glorious, and she interprets her songs with real tact and understanding. I found her first two albums, however, were too quirky and eccentric in their choice of selections, sometimes highlighting new work by young American composers for the simple sake of doing so (and not always choosing the best possible pieces). Almost all of McDonald's pieces on this album, though, are lovely older numbers, she does a remarkable job with such less well-known works as "Lose that Long Face" and "I Double Dare You." And one fo the only newer or truly eclectic pieces she does--Michael John LaChiusa's sexy and funny Latin number "See What I Want to See"--is the highlight of the album.
