 The Eighties saw many recordings of classic musicals by operatic stars; many of them were passably solid (Frederica von Stade's SOUND OF MUSIC and ANTHING GOES), some were astonishingly odd (the WEST SIDE STORY with Kiri Te Kanawa as Maria and Jos Carreras--!!!--as Tony). But John McGlinn's loving re-creation of SHOW BOAT--in all its entirety, with all its many variations in songs and music--was by far the most spectacular and most beautifully accomplished. The operatic cast is ideal, from Teresa Stratas as a terrifyingly vulnerable Julie to Jerry haldey as a suitably overripe Ravenal, and the musical comedy stars like Paige O'Hara and David Garrison shiune in their roles. Best of all, it showcases many of the songs Kern and Hammerstein wrote for diofferent versions of SHOW BOAT that have been lost over the years, from the dark and haunting "Mis'ry's Comin' Round" chorus from Act I to the thrilling New Year's chorus of Act II. McGlinn has a great Magnolia in Frederica von Stade, who--unlike most operatic stars--has a voice ideally suited for musical theatre. She seems truly willing to try anything, and she's as fine as the bizarre specialty numbers written for the part (such as "Gallivantin' Around") as the classic standards (such as "You are Love" and "Make Believe"). Best of all, she does a raucous version of the amazingly difficult number "Nobody Else But Me" that Kern and Hammerstein wrote for their favorite of all Magnolias, Jan Clayton; pay attention when you listen to it both how infectious its melody is despite the fact that every other phrase changes key!
