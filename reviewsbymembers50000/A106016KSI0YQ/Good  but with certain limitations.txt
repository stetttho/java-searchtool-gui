 I'm a bit surprised by the ecstatic reviews of this book listed below: while I think this is a very intelligent and well-crafted novella, it's not as category-defying as others might imply. Indeed, Fox writes very much in a kind of style that often is termed "NEW YORKER fiction," because it reads quite a bit like the many other stories of New York anomie that have come from that magazine in the Sixties, Seventies, Eighties and Nineties: there's lots of descriptions of small observations, the characters are unhappy but have trouble articulating this, random acts of violence in their carefully-ordered lives echo the disruptions of the wider world outside, etc. Indeed, to some extent Fox's work was very influential for a lot of fiction--good and bad--that followed in its wake.
