 It would be a bit hard to understand why someone would want to remake a Doris Day/Rock Hudson "battle of the sexes" comedy, but when you see DOWN WITH LOVE you realize how much fun it must have been for all concerned. The sets and costumes are marvelous (there are great color schemes), the Marc Shaiman score really swings, and the cast really seems to be having the time of their lives. Renee Zellweger continues to surprise with her versatility, and though she can't get as hilariously angry as Doris Day used to get in the same roles (no one could get mad like Doris Day), she brings a great deal of charm and vulnerability to her part. David Hyde Pierce exactly channels Tony Randall (who is also here in a small and welcome role), and Sarah Poulson uncannily recalls Paula Prentiss and Jane Fonda in their younger and kookier days. Only Ewan McGregor seems miscast: although superb at being a smooth operator, he doesn't have the physical presence nor the fundamental wholesomeness Rock Hudson used to bring to his Lothario parts. As a result, where Hudson used to make you feel he was fundamentally decent when he would inveigle Day with his lies, McGregor just seems like a snake. Fortunately he is redeeemed in the film's closing credits where he gets to sing with that marvelous voice of his. The film was not a popular success in theatrical release, mostly because the recreation of the early Sixties did not seem particularly relevant; it is a tremendous kick in the head, however, and well worth your time.
