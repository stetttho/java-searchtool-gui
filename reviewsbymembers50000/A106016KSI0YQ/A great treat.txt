 Tomalin wrote this book in part as a response to those (like Austen's brother and cousin) who noted the great novelist's life was one of little incident. Despite her noble intentions, Tomalin doesn't prove anything to  the contrary--Austen's life was pretty routine, and we have so few  documents pertaining to the particulars of it (since her sister and niece  burned so many of her letters) that we have yet to find a biographer who  can shed great light on her inestimable genius. Tomalin, however, gives  us a full and beautifully detailed analysis of what we CAN learn about  Austen's life from the documents which are still extant. Best of all, she  enriches this information by presenting rich, gossipy details about the  many fascinating people whom Austen knew and loved. The somewhat nouveau  riche society (pretending to be landed gentry) of late eighteenth-century  makes for reading almsot as much fun as Austen's own books, and Tomalin  writes with great verve. This is a marvelous read.
