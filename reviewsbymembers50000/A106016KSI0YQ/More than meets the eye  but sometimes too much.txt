 Mun, the beautiful heroine of this Asian ghost thriller (the gifted Angelica Lee) has been blind since the age of two, and receives a cornea transplant as an adult, after which she starts seeing people who aren't there. Realizing she's seeing the dead, Mun and her doctor become determined to help her find the donor of the corneas. The ideas behind this film are much better than the execution. The creators, the Pang brothers, have a tremendous visual sense so the screen compositions are often extraordinary. But oddly enough in a film where so much depends on seeing what the heroine sees, the film suffers from weak shot-to-shot continuity: often you're not quite sure what Mun sees as she sees it, which makes thematic sense given her own trouble believing and understanding her visions but that greatly interferes with the suspense. Only afterwards do you realize how frightening the sequence MIGHT have been had it only been edited slightly differently and with a different kind of kinetic rhythm: in the restaurant scene, in the elevator scene, and even in the crucial bedroom scene in Thailand near the end. Only the sequence in the hospital hallway near the beginning and the great scene in the calligraphy classroom seem to achieve the effects the filmmakers intended.
