 For someone who has yet to really carry a Broadway show by herself, the diminutive Kristin Chenoweth has garnered more "star" attention that any Broadway musical performer in years. And why not? She's got more talent packed into her tiny frame than the Broadway stage has seen in years, and this, her first solo cd, amply demonstrates that fact. The songs have been mostly chosen to demonstrate her wide range of talents, and that range is indeed incredible. She's quite funny in the title number and in the novelty Jule Styne song "If You Hadn't, But You Did," and gets to show off her operatic and jazz skills on "The Girl in 14C." She also does a very unusual and likeable take on the marvelously difficult Jerome Kern song "Nobody Else But Me" (with its tricky rapid key changes) that one wouldn't get to hear in a normal staged version on SHOW BOAT. There are a few weaker numbers, such as the Gershwin duet with Jason Alexander (it's really just stunt casting), but on the whole this is a splendid showcase for a superior performer. A last note: the highlight of the whole album for me was Kristin's dreamy wordless rendition of Duke Ellington's "On a Turquoise Cloud," which is like an Art-Deco vision of heaven--I would love to hear Kristin sing a whole "mood" album of songs in a similar vein!
