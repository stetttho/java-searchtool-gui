 Just as she changes little Patrick's life forever, so too does Auntie Mame change the life of just about everyone who comes across her in this movie version. This is one of the funniest and most enjoyable movies of the Fifties, and its anti-conformist attitude was (surprisingly, given the era) so popular that this was the top money-making film the year it was released. very wisely, the film's prodcuers asked Rosalind Russell to re-create her Broadway success by starring in the title role. Although it's undeniable that much of the surprise was taken out of Russell's work here after so many performances onstage (she seems a bit overrehearsed for someone supposed to be so spontaneous--especially during the scenes where she's asking for poignancy), she's undeniably very funny--especially in the foxhunt scene (a real classic). Some of the supporting roles don't hold up so well over the years (especially the Japanese houseboy, Ito, who is asked to perform a caricature that makes most audiences extremely uncomfortable today). But the screenwriters, Betty Comden and Adolph Green, have a field day with the foil for Mame in Gloria Upson, the snobbish idiot debutante who threatens to steal for Patrick's affections in the film's last third or so. They wrote almost all of the very best lines in the movie for her, and the magificently funny actress who plays her, Joanna Barnes, is more than up to the challenge. With her cement jaw and thick Smithie accent, Barnes not only triumphs with Comden's and Green's best lines  ("My, what a STUNNING apartment... books are awfully decorative, don't you think?") but even makes their throwaways hilarious (arguably my personal favorite: "WHAT'S wrong with Muriel Puce?!?"). She walks away with the film.
