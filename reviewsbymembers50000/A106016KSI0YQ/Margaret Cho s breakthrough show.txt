 One of the pleasures of watching Margaret Cho perform is that she can make you laugh yourself silly at the same time she can really move you. In this show she takes the character of her mother (always a staple in her routines) further than she ever has before, and in one very funny and sweet bit about her mother's best (and second-best) Mother's Day ever, she offers a very poignant (and yet still funny) tribute to this very tough, admirable, and curious woman. Most of the show is a kind of "I 'm a survivor" recounting of ABC's disastrous handling of her sitcom and its devastating effects on her self-esteem. The show does suffer a bit from some punchlines that are repeated far too often ("Hi, my name is Gwen..."), but it bgins with a brilliant bit about Karl Lagerfeld that had me laughing out loud.
