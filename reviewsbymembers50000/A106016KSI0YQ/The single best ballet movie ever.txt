 Pairing the singular vision of Guy Maddin with the Royal Winnipeg Ballet's production of "Dracula" was sheer genius: "Dracula," with its emphasis on the advent of modernity and corporeal corruption and repressed sexuality, is the ideal vehicle for Maddin's peculiar talents. What's more, using ballet dancers allowed him the opportunity to make a completely silent film (scored only with excerpts from Mahler's first and second symphonies). The results are stunning: this film has the most beautiful cinematography of any I've seen in years, the performances are superb, and Maddin even allows his trademark campy humor to creep into the titles (though not so much that it becomes annoying). The most beautiful sequences are danced in Lucy Westenra's mansion near the beginning, but the only thing is spectacular.
