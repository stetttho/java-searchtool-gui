 Despite the praise heaped on this novel here by other reviewers, I found Besson's novel pretentious as well as painful to read. The narrator's narcissism was absolutely insufferable, and I found his relationships he shares both with Proust and with Arthur, the son of one of his servants, peculiarly unaffecting, despite the big surprise at the end of the work. I adore IN SEARCH OF LOST TIME and have long been interested in Proust's work and life, but I found this book practically unreadable...
