 This is one of the finest novels to emerge from the Second World War, and greatly deserves to be back in print. Mollie Panter-Downes's debts in this "day in the life" of a family (a father, daughter, and, most crucially, a wife) in a small village outside of London during the year after the cessation of war activities was clearly influenced by Katherine Mansfield's great story "At the Bay" and--even more saliently--by Virginia Woolf's MRS. DALLOWAY, in form, content, and tone. (Key phrases like "The war is over," here as in Woolf uttered by a wealthy woman past her sexual prime in relief, are directly taken from the Woolf novel.) But despite its derivativeness this is a masterful little novel, and should be accorded a special placed in the literature of the 1940s. Mollie Panter-Downes really could write, and her characters really come alive off the page. The descriptions of the English countryside on a hot day when the world seems still even though the class structure is forever changing are something to relish.
