 McEwan is a talented writer, but this work is a decidedly minor effort--and its winning the Booker is an utter puzzlement. It's a very plot-driven piece (though at less than 200 pages, with enormous font size,  it is more of a novella than a novel--and not worth the expensive price),  but the characters seem very thin indeed. It's hard to care much about a  morality tale when the characters are so thoroughly dislikable. With their  elite educations, glamorous occupations, clever bitchery, and  self-aggrandizing behavior, Clive and Vernon seem to have stepped out of a  P. D. James novel--unfortunately, there's no Inspector Dagliesh around to  provide any sort of moral compass (or real suspense).
