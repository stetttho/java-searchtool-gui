 This nice little chiller never received the attention it deserved because (as many reviewers have noted) it came out nearly at the same time as THE SIXTH SENSE, which has a similar plot and was a huge hit. It's too bad, because this juicy little thriller has some terrifically scary and surreal moments, particularly whenever the ghost that keeps contacting Kevin Bacon and his son shows up. Bacom plays Tom, a blue-collar Chicago father who starts receiving psychic messages after a hypnotic party trick conducted by his siter-in-law (Ileana Douglas, in a strangely mistimed comic performance) goes awry. Though the chills are genuine, the movie is almost set offkilter by a rare bad performance from Bacon, whose overripe Chicago accent is utterly unconvincing. He seems to be giving his audience a kind of postmodern salute to famous male film performances of the Seventies, and at times directly apes Jack Nicholson in THE SHINING, Richard Dreyfuss in CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, and Robert De Niro in almost everything. As his determined, likeable wife, Jeanne Tripplehorn fares much better, delivering a very quietly intelligent performance (replete with a much more convincing accent).
