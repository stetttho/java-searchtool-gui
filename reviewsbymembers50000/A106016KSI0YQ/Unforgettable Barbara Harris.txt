 One of the greatest of all musical comedy singers, Barbara Harris never appeared in a show that was an unqualified hit, but her great turns in two flawed but much-loved mid-60s shows, ON A CLEAR DAY YOU CAN SEE FOREVER and THE APPLE TREE, have made her a great cult figure for Broadway fans. THE APPLE TREE, for which she won the Tony, is really rememberted best today as a vehicle for her amazing voice, charm, and versatility, and the cast recording of the original Broadway cast her beautiful open voice shines through to its best advantage. The show features three short stories all centering upon the Eve and temptation theme, and all set to music by Bock and Harnick, the team behind SHE LOVES ME and FIDDLER ON THE ROOF. The last of the stories, "Passionella" by Jules Feiffer, was said to have been the funniest (and Harris's strange adenoidal intonations in the title role are pretty funny) but certainly did not have the most memorable songs, nor did the middle story, an adaptation of Frank Stockton's "The Lady or the Tiger?" The best songs by far are from the first of the trio, a version of Mark Twain's "The Diary of Adam and Eve," and the beautiful combination of the shimmering orchestrations and Barbara Harris's soaring voice on "Here in Eden" is a revelation. The act's other highlight, "What Makes Me Love Him?" should have survived as a standard: again, it brings out the best in Harris's lovely mellow voice.
