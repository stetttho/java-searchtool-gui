 Gregory Maguire's complex and dark revisionist telling of the life and avdentures of the Wicked QWitch of the West, WICKED, is something of a contemporary classic: more than just a reexamination of the imaginative worlds of L. Frank Baum, it's a very toughminded philosophical and political novel brilliantly told (and it improves in the re-reading). He has been beleaguered with requests for a sequel since the first novel's release, but unfortunately this follow-up, chronicling the further adventures in Oz of the Wicked Witch's possible heir, Liir, following the death of Elphaba and the departure from Oz of both the Wizard and Dorothy, doesn't seem to have much of a point to it. Even darker and more cynical than its predecessor, SON OF A WITCH seems a re-telling of the Waste-Land myth, with Liir acting as Parsifal to the Amfortas of the Winkie Princess Nastoya; but there seems to be little point to his actions, and the book suffers greatly from the fact that it touches much more tangentially on Baum's Oz books than its predecessor did. Though Tip and Mobi (and her four-horned cow) and the Hungry Tiger make the briefest of appearances, Maguire's book seems to make little sense when read against the events of THE MARVELOUS LAND OF OZ--which makes the whole revisionist project seem a bit pointless. But the tale does showcase Maguire's bracing philosophical cynicism and his strong narrative drive.The novel does seem to position itself open for another sequel at its ending, so we can hope that there will be more to come that will make sense out of what is a promising but disappointing follow-up to the excellent WICKED.
