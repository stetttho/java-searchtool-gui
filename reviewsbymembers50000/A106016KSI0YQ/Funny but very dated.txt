 Fran Lebowitz is a real one-of-a-kind humorist: basically, she's a Manhattan-centric, curmudgeonly, Jewish lesbian who writes in Wildean aphorisms. She's delightful, and if you've ever seen her on TV it's almost impossible not to hear her sentences in her bemused tones. This collection represents almost all of her writing she's ever published: two bestselling studies from the Seventies, "Metropolitan Life" and "Social Studies." They're funny but extremely dated: Lebowitz's observations on "discotheques" and CD radios seem extremely quaint today. Famously, Lebowitz has suffered from writer's block since publishing these (very short) two collections. True to form, this edition advertises "A New Preface by the Author" which is only one paragraph long. I can't give this much higher of a rating because these pieces are so dated: it's time for Lebowitz to write something new and of our time.
