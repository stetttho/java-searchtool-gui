 This is a book I've recommended to just about everyone I've come across recently: it's one of the most absorbing reads I've had in years. Pullman creates a world very much like our own but still very different, and its details are absolutely fascinating. Every human being has a daemon--a materialization of his or her spirit in animal form--, and the entire world is governed by a Popeless Catholic church; an enormous conspiracy forces the work's heroine, Lyra, to venture to the frozen North, where she encounters tremendous wonders and stupefying dangers. Although Pullman wasn't able to bring off the following books in his trilogy to the same degree of satisfaction, THE GOLDEN COMPASS reamins an absolutely fantastic read, with thrilling detail and breathtaking ambition.
