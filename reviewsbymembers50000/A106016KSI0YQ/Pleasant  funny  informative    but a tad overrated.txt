 Frayn's novel is yet another fictionalization of the pleasures of scholarship, resonating with the same sorts of delight which informed Byatt's POSSESSION, Barnes's FLAUBERT'S PARROT, Hollinghurst's THE FOLDING  STAR, Stoppard's play ARCADIA, and on and on and on. Perhaps this theme may  have been done to death in the last twenty years, but that didn't stop  Frayn from producing a very charming and informative novel about a man who  has discovered a painting which may or may not be an important undiscovered  Brueghel. The best things the book has going for it are its wonderfully  inept and likeable hero (who is free of the tiresome sexual and  intellectual arrogance that far too often dogs similar protagonists of  similar works on this theme), and its real pleasure in delving to the  arcane details of Brueghel's political and cultural milieu. This is a  pleasant timekiller, but it is no great work: the plot is thin, the  denouement is unbelievable, and the wife is an extremely shadowy and  thinly-drawn character. Accept this novel for what it's worth, but no more.
