 Renoir's first color film is based upon Rumer Godden's novel of first love in Bengal. The heroine, an adolescent budding poet, lives with her large family in an estate on the Ganges; the visit of an American army captain to the small house on the family estate sparks interest from, and bids rivalry between, the narrator, the Eurasian daughter of the small house, and a loal heiress. An extremely lyric and liquid film, THE RIVER offers several of the most remarkable film sequences of its era, including a spectacular of the family members taking their siestas on the verandas and lovely footage of the life upon the ghats along the Ganges. The film at times is so attuned to its own rhythms that it becomes at times difficult for dramatic highpoints of the action to have the attention the narrative requires of them. The biggest drawback, however, is the extremely odd casting: there have been few films that have assembled so physically unappealling a group of actors as this.
