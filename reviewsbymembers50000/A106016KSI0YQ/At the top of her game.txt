 The so-called "beige album" was recorded near the start of Anna Moffo's career, and displays magnificently her beautifully milky lyric soprano. There have been very few American singers who have ever approached Moffo's mastery of the French repertoire, and this recording features two of the finest renditions of Gounod's Jewel Song and Meyerbeer's Shadow Song you are ever likely to hear. The Meyerbeer, in particular, is a real standout: Moffo executes the familiar coloratura passages with real facility and grace, but where many sopranos only use this aria only as a display of pure vocal flourish and range Moffo also makes the pathos of Dinorah's madness in this song extremely evident and moving. The only selection that doesn't seem here to be a wise choice may be the Rossini, which always sounds better with a  voice like Sutherland's which can make those trills a display of pyrotechnics; Moffo's voice and technique just aren't suited for such a militant aria. But this is a tiny quibble. This album displays Anna Moffo at the top of her game at the beginning of her career, and shows what a lovely, warm, and dulcet voice she possessed.
