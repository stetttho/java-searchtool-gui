 It's still somewhat astonishing to remember that THE WOMEN was actually written by a woman, since it must be one of the most misogynistic movies ever made: though not a single man appears anywhere in the film, all the women characters do is obsess about them both in terms of the two things they can bring them (sex and money). But that aside, this movie is an awful lot of fun: it featured an almost who's who among all the best actresses on the M-G-M lot, and most of them are having a grand old time. True, there's not much fun to be had with Norma Shearer's archly noble Mary Haines, but Joan Crawford, Paulette Goddard, and particularly Rosalind Russell seem to be having the time of their lives with their over-the-top roles. Even little Virginia Weidler manages to camp it up in the great bathtub scene she has with Crawford ("And another thing, Crystal... this bathroom is perfectly ridiculous!"). The film is also endlessly quotable even down to the most throwaway lines (one of my favorites: Olga the manicurist greeting Mary by saying, "Reading a novel, huh? How *do* those writers ever dream up those plots?"). Best of all, everyone is gussied up in the most sublime Adrian gowns imaginable--the film even reaches its one moment of actual sublimity at the end of the famous all-color fashion show sequence, when the soigne mannequins stalk off the whirling giant test-tube rack (don't ask) while enormous chords thunder on the soundtrack. Truly a mixture of terror and awe!
