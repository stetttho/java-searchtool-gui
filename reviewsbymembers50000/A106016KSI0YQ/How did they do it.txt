 This Republic serial has been almost universally hailed as the finest of all the old movie serials: it works on just about every level, and is about as exciting as you could want. The true wonder are the special effects: with careful photography of a dummy suspended from wires and truly ingenious stunts (aided by very thoughtful and careful direction), Captain Marvel's flying at time seems more believable here than Superman's in the multimillion dollar film of the late 70s. The storyline departs in many ways from the original comic book series (here the old wizard Shazam specifically turns teenage reporter Billy Batson into Captain Marvel only to protect a Thai mystic relic that is the key of the serial's entire plot), but the series really captures the feel of Golden Age comics, from the inventively scary deathtraps into which Billy and his friends are placed ito the mellifluously voiced villain, The Scorpion, who wears a shiny embroidered silken robe with a matching hood. The actors are terrific, especially the very winning Frank Coghlan Jr. who is ideal as Billy Batson--he has a appealling smile he flashes only rarely, but always to great effect.
