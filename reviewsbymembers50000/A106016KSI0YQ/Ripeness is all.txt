 Rene Fleming is like no one else working today in opera: her voice is so splendidly ripe and gorgeous that you find yourself swooning at times, and she puts more charming vivacity in her acting than any opera singer since Sills. This disc displays her at her absolute best. She performs two very different arias from what is unquestionably her perfect role, Massenet's Manon, displaying both Manon's poignancy on "Adieu, notre petite table" and her dizzy charm on the arrival aria. And then there's Juliette's waltz: as often as this aria is recorded today, can anyone else sing it with the same whirling delight as Fleming? If you like Fleming, this is a must-have.
