 "Confidence" is the operative watchword of Sarah Waters's splendid second novel set in the Victorian period: it is told through the confidences told in the diaries of two women, one a wealthy single woman who is visiting prisoners in a London pentitentiary, and the other a medium who has been arrested for fraud. As the novel continues, Margaret Prior slowly comes to gain confidence in the medium, Selina Dawes, especially when she herself is visited by ghostly manifestations. It is almost impossible to put the novel down: it gains your own confiedence as you go along, and you come to care desperately about the characters. But this (like Waters's next novel FINGERSMITH) is the rare pageturner that also builds a complex web of allusion and metaphor as it proceeds.
