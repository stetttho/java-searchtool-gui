 Another of Christopher Guest's wonderful studies of an odd little show-business world within worlds, BEST IN SHOW may not be as consistently funny as his previous effort, WAITING FOR GUFFMAN, but it's pretty hilarious nonetheless (and plus it has what is his funniest scene from any of his movies, the scene with Parker Posey as a furious yuppie trying to buy the replacement for her Weimeramer's favorite toy in a pet store). All of Guest's usual repertoire--Eugene Levy, Michael McKean, John Michael Higgins, Michael Hitchcock Jane Lynch, Bob Balaban, Ed Begley Jr. and Jennifer Coolidge and of course the sublime Catherine O'Hara--are at their usual superb best, with a special honorable mention going to Fred Willard as a hilariously vulgar and idiotic dog show television commentator. Through it all, the dogs themselves retain their beauty and their dignity (as Guest and Levy point out on the DVD's optional running commentary, you almost never hear any of the dogs even barking during the entire film).
