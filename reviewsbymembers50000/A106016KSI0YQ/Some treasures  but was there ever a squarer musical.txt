 If you haven't ever heard CALL ME MADAM before, you'll hardly be surprised to find out that there's a paean to Dwight David Eisenhower among the songs. Really, was there ever a musical more square than this one? While Sally Adams is about as risqu a character as Mamie herself, and you'll have to put up with some ghastly stuff like "Washington Square Dance" (not Irving Berlin's finest moment musically). But still, there are some real treats here, and not just "It's a Lovely Day Today" and "You're Just in Love," either. Both "Lichtenberg" and "The Ocarina" have extremely haunting melodies, despite their dorky lyrics, and the "Mrs. Sally Adams" song is extremely bouncy and catchy. The cast has some real delights in it, like Melissa Errico (whose lovely silver voice is always welcome), but Tyne Daly just isn't up to the vocal demands of the leading role. She has some real charm at moments, but the lower register of "Can You Use Any Money Today?" doesn't showcase her very well, and her Southwestern accent comes and goes.
