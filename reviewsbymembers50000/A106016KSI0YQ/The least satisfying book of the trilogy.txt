 All good things must come to an end, and so it's inevitable to feel a bit of disappointment with the third and final installment of Pullman's HIS DARK MATERIALS trilogy. Since the work was conceived in the epic tradition, it's inevitable that Lyra and Will make a trip to the underworld, but though the afterlife they encounter is authentically creepy (the harpies are a wonderful addition to Pullamn's mythos), there's almost no reason for the two young people to make the journey they do, or especially for Lyra to make the sacrifice she feels compelled to make to get there. In general, the largest problem in this third work is motivation: many things happen, but Pullman doesn't always seem to have a steady handle as to why his characters should do what they do. The new creatures Dr. Malone encounters in the new parallel world she visits--the mulefa--are wonderfully conceived, and authentically original; however, there's a somewhat boring war in heaven we have to slog through and a disheartening change of character for one of the trilogy's major players that seems to reduce her impact as a whole on the entire series. There are many rewards in this last installment of Pullman's trilogy, but it is by far the weakest in the series.
