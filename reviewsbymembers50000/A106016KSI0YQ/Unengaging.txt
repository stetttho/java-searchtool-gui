 Rose Macaulay often tried out many different styles when she wrote her novels, and was often very successful. Here, alas, she seems to have wandered into the territory of her protege Elizabeth Bowen with less than ideal results. Here, a typical Bowenesque unwanted teenage girl, Barbary, is forced to leave her once divorced, once widowed mother in Provence after World War II to live with her bourgeois father Sir Gulliver and his new wife in London and attend the Slade Art School. Left to her own devices, the heavyhandedly named Barbary (who used to fight with the maquis in France) wanders the bombed-out ruins in the City instead. The unusual setting is just about irresistible, and you wish Macaulay could do somehting more with it, but the obvious resonances to THE DEATH OF THE HEART keep hampering the book, and Barbary and her selfish mother and chilly father and stepmother are too shallow to care much about. There's also practically none of Macaulay's trademark humor.
