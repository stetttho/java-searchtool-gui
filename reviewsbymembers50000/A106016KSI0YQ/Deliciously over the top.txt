 This is Tim Burton's homage to the great Hammer horror films of his youth, and it may be his most visually spectacular film ever. From Burton, that's saying quite a great deal, and should let you know that no matter what else the film is absolutely worth a close look (though prefarably on as large a screen as possible): the muted nightlike colors of the town are sumptuous, the Horseman is terrifying, and the cinematography is absolutely stunning. The story is quite exciting, and hardly ever lets up, although it's pretty easy to figure out early in the filom who is responsible for everything. The actors Burton chose for the secondary parts are terrific, but the major players were less felicitously chosen: Johnny Depp tries mightily but is just too handsome to play Ichabod Crane convincingly, and Christina Ricci is just Not a Blonde (much like Winona Ryder in EDWARD SCISSORHANDS). The actor who plays the mastermind behind everything gives a spectacularly bad eyerolling, lipchewing performance--I won't reveal the name here, but watch for the performance given after the revelation of the mastermind's identity: it's pretty unintentionally hilarious.
