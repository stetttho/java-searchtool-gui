 Although almost completely ignored when it was released in 1999, DICK is one of the funniest films of the last decade. In many ways, the film is a cross between the classic 60s comedy THE WORLD OF HENRY ORIENT and (of all things) ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, but the result is completely original. Two self-absorbed teenagers in 1972 become involved (though all manner of coincidences) with the doings of the Nixon White House, and become key invisible players in the unravelling of the watergate scandal: indeed, they become collectively known to Woodward and Bernstein as the "Deep Throat" source. Sometimes the best kind of comedy is the kind you can't describe. Why it should be funny that one of the girls should fall madly in love with President Nixon--removing all her Bobby Sherman posters on the wall in favor of pictures of him, and fantasizing he sweeps her away on horseback on a deserted beach ("What about Pat?" "She understands...")--is almost impossible to explain, but hilarious it is nonetheless. Almost all of the humor in the film is to be found in the characters and the situations rather than in one-liners--signs of true comic minds at work. The pleasures of this film are best realized if you've lived through Watergate and the early Seventies (which may be why the film was originally a failure--it tried to hit the teen market), but it's just too funny a treat to pass up.
