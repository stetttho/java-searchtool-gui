 If you ever wanted to hear a song sung EXACTLY the way the composer wanted it sung, you can't do better than Julie Andrews, with her absolute exquisite diction (it is probably the single best ever of any singer ever) and her shimmering silvery voice with its amazing multi-octave reach. This disc only goes up to the late 60s, but that really is Julie's best period: you get her most beautiful songs from her stage hits MY FAIR LADY and CAMELOT (with the possible exception of "Then You may take Me to the Fair," which does show off her comic gifts) and from MARY POPPINS, as well as some of her greatest album recordings. I can't imagine a more perfect rendition of Borodin's "Baubles, Bangles and Beads" or Rodgers' and Hart's "Falling in love with Love" or Kurt Weill's "This is New." And then there's "Thoroughly Modern Millie".... there is just no one to compare to Julie Andrews.
