 There's not a lot of raison d'etre for this very amusing comedy of British class life, centered upon a decades-long academic controversy, other than to show the consequences of conscience upon an elderly wealthy history professor. This book, which has been  out of print for a few years in the US, is still quite enjoyable, and the cadre of curious characters that populate it are as memorable in their own way as those out of Dickens (to whom Wilson is often compared). There is a kind of creepiness in the latent homophobia of the comic ending (everyone receives his or her just desserts, which means in this case the major gay characters are killed or maimed), but the novel is of a different and earlier time.The description of Ingeborg Middleton's hideously frollicsome Nordic Christmas party alone makes the novel worth reading.
