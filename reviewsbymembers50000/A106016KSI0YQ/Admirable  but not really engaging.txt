 I'm addicted to historical novels, and had great hopes for this novel before I read it. I was a bit disappointed in the reading of it: while there's no question that Fitzgerald has done her research and is grappling with some weighty issues concerning Romanticism, desire, and the quotidian, THE BLUE FLOWER is hardly engaging or enthralling. It reads mostly like an intellectaul exercise (especially in that its language and syntax reads almost exactly as if it were translated from the German--as if this were Goethe rendered into English). While (for what it is) the book is quite well done, it wasn't what I was hoping for when I picked it up. It seems more like a writer's novel--that is, a novel for other writers to admire--than a book to really enjoy.
