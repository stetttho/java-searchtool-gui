 That's basically the fastest and most effective way to describe Baz Luhrmann's groundbreaking and much discussed musical, which is to say the movie is simultaneously self-redundant and its like nothing you've ever seen on heaven or Earth. It may well be the single most beautiful piece of filmmaking anywhere in the last ten years. That said, you have to get past  the silly and predictable plot. That its characters are clichs is often said to be "the point," but that doesn't mean it's a very good point, and having the characters code us into their emotions by singing pop songs rather than period pieces seems both juvenile and condescending. Nicole Kidman, though fundamentally miscast as a sexpot, works hard and sings creditably as Satine; Ewan MacGregor is also miscast but sings superbly as Christian.  But the real stars are the sets and costumes and camera effects: the whole thing is like an incredibly beautiful dream you want to relive over and over again. I know of no other recent Hollywood film that allows you to enter its own world of visual beauty the way this film does, and for that director Baz Luhrmann and his astonishingly gifted wife Catherine martin, the film's set designer, deserve full credit. Not only was the film groundbreaking but so was the DVD, which brought all kinds of tricks and enhancements which changed forever Hollywood presented DVDs. The "Green Fairy" sidebars are marvelous and show you exactly how Martin ingeniously planned her sets; the commentary also has terrific insights from her and from the film's magnificently talented cinematographer, although some of the other pretentious comments (a few by Luhrmann but particularly those by his co-writer Craig Pearce) make you want to cringe with embarrassment.
