 Gine McKee's being miscast as Irene Heron Forsyte is the greatest puzzle of this otherwise superb television adaption revisiting of Galsworthy's masterpiece of a wealthy family making the transition from the Victorian to the modern era. Although she looks splendidly chic and soigne in her costumes as Soames's trophy wife (she seems at times consciously to evoke Sargent's "Madame X"), she looks utterly unconvincing in her early scenes as a young unmarried girl who would capture Soames's attentions despite her relative poverty. Moreover, though she tries her best, she's just not up to the demands of the role, which requires her to be enigmatic (which she can manage) but also incredibly sympathetic (which she cannot). Otherwise this revisitation of the BBC miniseries which launched "Masterpiece Theatre" in 1969 is superb from beginning to end. The writers, Stephen Mallatratt and jan McVerry, did magnificent work in expanding Galsworthy's text, adding beautifully done scenes (such as Young Jolyon's heartbreaking leavetaking of his unloved first wife, Frances) that are only background material in the original source material. The extremely gifted actor Damian Lewis serves as the linchpin figure of the cast as the "man of property" Soames Fosyte, baffled by his violent passion for Irene and her refusal to reciprocate his affections, but the entire magnificent cast is a kind of "who's who" of BBC productions from years past, adding to the sense of accumulated history in the material. Special mention should be made of Joanna David (from the late Seventies adaptation of REBECCA) as Irene's pushing yet vulnerable stepmother; Judy Campbell (NANNY) as the formidable senior member of the Forsytes, Aunt Ann; the delightful Wendy Craig (NANNY, BUTTERFLIES) as the gossipy Aunt Juley; Corin Redgrave (PERSUASION) as the complex and dignified Old Jolyon; and especially Amanda Root (PERSUASION) as the increasingly wearied Winifred. The amazing performances of this ensemble--and the terrific production values-- make you eventually forget the weakness of McKee's miscasting.
