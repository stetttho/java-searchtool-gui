 So is this classic 1942 Warner's melodrama, which is probably the quintessential Bette Davis film. Some will debate whether her performances in THE LETTER or ALL ABOUT EVE were actually better, but there's no doubt that NOW VOYAGER shows Davis at the absolute top of her game doing her most typical glamorous women's picture work for Warner's at the height of her career. The film's attempts to take mental illness and depression seriously are of course very silly, but darned if Davis doesn't come through with a superb performance anyway--her scenes in the beginning as a coming-apart-at-the-seams ugly duckling of a Boston Brahmin family show her really giving it her all, despite the ridiculous caterpillar eyebrows and dumpy frocks she's forced to wear (all to later enhance her later appearance after her nervous breakdown breathtakingly gowned in the best Orry-Kelly outfits ever). The film's story may be slightly silly, but the dialogue is superbly memorable (Davis's great "I'm not afraid anymore... I'm not afraid" bit has been endlessly mimicked over the years), and somehow everyone in the cast gives splendid performances, from Claude Rains, given a rare chance to play a sympathetic character in a melodrama, to Gladys Cooper as Charlotte's domineering gorgon of a mother. Best of all, Davis not only gets to be exceptionally moving but also has the chance to show off her most characteristic bits of business, like the way she and Paul henreid light one another's cigarettes simultaneously with their own. It's a film impossible to get out of your memory once you've seen it, and worthy of multiple viewings.
