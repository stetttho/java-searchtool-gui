 Despite its unevenness of sophistication, in that it sometimes lurches back and forth between naive barrelthumping choruses (a la IL TROVATORE) and highly nuanced and thoughtful character studies (a la OTELLO), MACBETH may remain my alltime favorite Verdi opera, in that this change of tone is so perfectly suited to the material. Verdi was really trying something new here, and the excitement of his ability to set Shakespeare to music (and perhaps add a different dimension to it) shows throughout . Abbado's recording here is considered one of the best, and justly so: the conducting is very fine and crisp, and the production is genuinely exciting. Just as all versions of the play rise and fall on their leads, so too do all versions of the opera depend on theirs, and there are few finer Macbeths and Lady macbeths than you'll find here. Shirley Verrett may have been one of the greatest of all Lady Macbeths, and she's spectacular here: she's not only terrifying in her Letter Aria but just as equally convincingly attractive (if sternly powerful) in the Brindisi. The sleepwalking scene is perhaps the finest aria Verdi ever wrote, and is in and of itself a miniature lesson in the power of what opera can do to extend pity and terror in drama (just listen to that chillingly accusative English horn rising at the end of each measure!), and here Verrett does not disappoint. Although many other of the best Lady Macbeths, such as Leonie Rysanek and Maria Callas, *act* the scene out more dramatically--gasping, for example, on the second syllable of the last "immaginar"--, Verrett achieves her effects in a different manner, almost entirely by her choice of dynamics. She may be more controlled, but every bit as memorable.
