 When Walt Disney was haggling for rights over "Mary Poppins" with P. L. Travers, he already had secured the rights to the Mary Norton book upon which this film was based and intended it as a backup should the rights to "Poppins" fall through. Then the success of "Poppins" made sure this film was made anyway after Disney's death with much of the same creative team since the story is so similar. The disappointing thing about this film is that it just doesn't quite have the magic that "Mary Poppins" itself did, despite the fine special effects (especially for the time), the cute child actors, the exciting witchcraft plot and the superb voices of Angela Lansbury and David Tomlinson in the leading roles. There's absolutely no chemistry between the stars (Tomlinson was just too old by this time to be much of a romantic lead), and the music is TOO similar to "Mary Poppins," which was always the fault of the Sherman Brothers: you can basically sing either of the two best songs in the score, "Eglantine" or "Substitutiary Locomotion," in counterpoint to "Spoonful of Sugar." The story is also too similar, with an animated sequence in which the humans participate, a scene where magic makes simple things in the household run amok, etc.  The film will still be enjoyed by children but will of less pleasure for adults, although you do really have to hand it to Lansbury. Even though her part is underwritten--all she seems to do is page through books and look puzzled--, she's still a big enough star that when she makes all of her songs absolutely terrific. After her first two verses of "Substitutiary Locomotion" you basically want to stand up and applaud like crazy.
