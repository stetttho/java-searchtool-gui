 Tolkin's THE RAPTURE must surely be one of the most original films to come out of the 1990s. Its take on complex moral and ethical problems shows a fierce intelligence and deep sophistication. Mimi Rogers gives the performance of her life as Sharon, the hedonistic young woman in a dead-end job in Los Angeles who becomes converted into believing that the Apocalypse is coming--and its not giving too much of the plot away to tell you that she turns out to be right. Rogers' beatific splendor on the phone lines at her awful job after she's been converted is almost as touching as her terrible anguish after she's forced into committing herself to a horrible ethical choice near the end of the film. Although the film is somewhat marred by the appalling performance of a child actor as Sharon's daughter, this is one of the most sophisticated and intelligent takes on religious faith ever to come out of Hollywood.
