 Elizabeth I of England is a role almost all great actresses long to play, and yet none of them--not even Bette Davis or Cate Blanchett or Judi Dench--has been or will ever be as memorable as Glenda Jackson in the part. This was the role she was practically born to play, and what makes it truly fun is the amazing range she gets to play over the six episodes in showing Elizabeth as a frightened pawn within the Tudor court of her brother and sister, barely able to keep herself alive, until she becomes enthroned herself and yet is still vulnerable to her own scheming court's intrigues, the plots of the king of Spain and Catherine de Medici of France, and--most heartbreaking of all--her own unpredictable suspicious and vain nature. Famously, Jackson refused to play Elizabeth ever as completely sympathetic and retains throughout a sourness to the character that makes her seem very lifelike. The other actors acquit themselves very well too, most memorably Daphne Slater as the self-righteous and arrogant but incredibly pious Mary Tudor: there's an unforgettable moment in the first episode where, after having thought herself at last pregnant by her husband Philip of Spain, Slater's Mary realizes her "pregnancy" is a stomach tumor and runs frantically into her chapel shrieking "Mea culpa, mea culpa!"
