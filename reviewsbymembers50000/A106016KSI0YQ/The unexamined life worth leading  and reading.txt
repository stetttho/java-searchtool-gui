 Probably Ethel Wilson's most delightful novel, THE INNOCENT TRAVELLER began as a series of short stories about Wilson's own family, with a particular interest in her silly, attention-starved, irrepressible great-aunt; Wilson's publisher insisted she turn the stories into a novel, and this charming one-of-a-kind piece was the result. Topaz is born to a wealthy Victorian family in the Five Towns, and lives an extremely protected life free from much harm or much meaning. What saves her ultimately is her own essential triviality, which allows her to live through a century on two continents with her sense of wonder always about her. The description of Topaz's first cross-continental train trip from the St. Lawrence river to Vancouver is a remarkable set piece, and displays beautifully Wilson's famous skills at evoking landscape and atmosphere. I was so happy to have discovered this little gem--it's not quite like anything else I've ever read.
