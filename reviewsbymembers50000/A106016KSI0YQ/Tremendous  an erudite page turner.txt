 I'd been putting off reading this for years, and when I finally started it, I kept berating myself for having missed it for so long. I couldn't put it down, given the many mysteries at work in the text and the engaging description of monastic medieval life--the latter wasn't something in which I had been particularly interested in before reading this novel, but nonetheless I found the beautiful level of detail absorbing. The various monks stood out as very real and defined charcters, and the historical background material (while initially extremely complex and offputting) became more engaging as I went. Some of the bites Eco didn't quite manage to chew in this were the long, medievalesque catalogues, which he explained in his postscript he felt were essential to capture the flavor of the period but seemed neither particularly well done nor very interesting. To quote Sally from PEANUTS, though, I just bleeped right over them, and all was well. I highly recommend this novel for fans of historical fiction.
