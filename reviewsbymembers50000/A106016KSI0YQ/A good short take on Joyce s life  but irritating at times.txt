 Since there's little else intelligent on Joyce's life other than Richard Ellmann's whoppingly big book, this slimmer volume is quite welcome. While Edna O'Brien's "Joycean" use of language here seems initially quite clever as a means for telling the story, it tends somewhat to obscure the meanings of what she's trying to say. The book also sometimes doesn't explain things as clearly as it might--if I weren't a familiar with Joyce's works and Ellmann's biography, I think I would've been greatly puzzled by some of what O'Brien conveys. Moreover, as readers below have noted, her tendentious assumption that the novels (particularly PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST) are transparently and exactly autobiographical is a real mistake.
