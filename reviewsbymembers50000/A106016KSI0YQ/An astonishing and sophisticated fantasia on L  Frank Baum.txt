 Most of the disappointed reviews of Maguire's masterwork come from people expecting this book to be something it is not--to be somehow more like the 1939 movie THE WIZARD OF OZ, or like the 14 L. Frank Baum Oz books. Maguire's novel is like neither in tone, though it was certainly inspired by both, and uses as its coordinates the Oz mythology. Maguire's Oz is very thoroughly research-based on the Oz books and yet it is much darker and more sophisticated than Baum's Oz: Maguire manages to invent complex religious, political, and sexual-social systems for his version of Baum's wonderland. The novel ingeniously uses details and unanswered questions from the previous Oz books (why are the silver shoes so desirable? how did the two witch-sisters come to be rulers in the East and the West? what was the Good Witch of the North doing in Munchkinland, in the East, when Dorothy arrived?) and along the way presents a variety of deeply involving characters: Galinda, a Gillikin beauty will grow up to be the Good Witch of the North (Maguire tantalizingly never explains how Glinda will end up in the South at the end of Dorothy's jorney in a different guise); Nessarose, the armless and fanatically religious Eminence of the East; and, at the book's center, the marvelously complex and empathetic Elphaba, who will become the both the Witch of the West and Wicked by the novel's end. You're best off reading this book if you read the Baum books when you were younger, but you're also best off understanding they're not going to be quite the same. Maguire's is a rich, deep philosophical novel about the nature of evil and of governing systems, as well as a very funny and absorbing adventure story. It deserves to be the cult classic it has become.
