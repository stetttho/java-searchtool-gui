 Anybody who has ever seen this bit of kitsch will remember it's famous highlight: the enormous musical number set on a revolving wedding cake set that features snippets of "A Pretty Girl is Like a Melody," "Rhapsody in Blue," arias from various operas, and women in cat-faced headpieces (all topped by a colossal spiral screen that drapes over everything at the end). In some ways, this film was meant to out-do the Busby Berkeley spectaculars, and its most successful moment is actually a medley of four wonderful and imaginative staged songs at the rooftop of Ziegfeld's number: "You've Got to Pull Strings," "She's a Ziegfeld Follies Girl," "You," and "You Never Looked So Beautiful Before." The movie is worth seeing just for this, and for the glimpse of great showgirl costumes during the latter song. There's not much going for the movie in dramatic terms, although you do get Luise Rainer making her famous smiling-through-tears phone call (for which she won an Academy Award). Otherwise, things are pretty dull: in fitting with the usual santization of public figures' lives in biopics, Flo Ziegfeld is not a philanderer at all, but rather a poor completely honorable sap who keeps getting trapped in compromising situations by drunk showgirls like Virginia Bruce. Even Myrna Loy can't add much to the mix: her impersonation of Billie Burke is absolutely nothing like Billie Burke, and she and William Powell make a pretty dull couple in this film (you'd never know how much fun they had been in the THIN MAN films from this).
