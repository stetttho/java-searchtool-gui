 You can see why this was Bette Davis's favorite film she did for Warner's: as a impetuous Long Island socialite dying from a  brain tumor, she gets to run a real gamut of emotional states, from defensive nerviness to terror to giddy elation to fury and finally to the kind of noble self-sacrificing glamor Davis adored. And she IS splendid in the part--the film is worth seeing if only as a kind of astonishing catalogue of her techniques and styles (and she was probably the single most gifted star of the studio period). But this melodrama just isn't up to the standards of some of her later Warner's work, like THE LETTER and NOW, VOYAGER. The other actors, while competent, aren't even on the same planet as Davis in terms of their ability, and the script lets them all down. There's a subplot involving Humphrey Bogart as Davis's stablegroom--!--from Ireland--!!!--that goes nowhere, and the silly plot mechanisms of how Davis's rumor works (after her surgery, it is guaranteed to kill her but without any pain, and signalled only by a sudden dimming of vision that allows for some very maudlin final moments) are pretty laughable. But it's all worth it to see her great drunk scene singing along with a nightclub chanteuse when she learns she's doomed--the final extended close-up in this scene shows Davis at her most remarable.
