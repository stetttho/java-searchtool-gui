 This video is drawn from the first shows the brilliant British comedy team French and Saunders did for the BBC--and it's much less polished, and much louder and in-your-face, than their later work. As such its not quite as good--but still, these were the skits that first introduced me to French and Saunders (years before the world had heard of them through ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS and THE VICAR OF DIBLEY) and made me fall in love with them. If you ever hear someone saying a propos of nothing, in a loud accusatory voice, "She can't DRAW FINGERS!" you'll know they've seen the famous skit they do here sending up the performance artists Gilbert and George--for one of their performance art pieces, French at one point is chained to a wall and has a wrecking ball smash into her (Here's Saunders on the event in retrospect: "It was colossal, really, but I could never do it again...") This show also features their great parody of ballet-dancers, where they explain what's the proper age to have your hair stapled in a bun to your head ("The best part of being a prima ballerina," Saunders explains, "is having a pudding named after you"). The bits with them as loud overweight men are pretty obnoxious and dislikable, but this gives you a chance to see these two masters of comedy in utero.
