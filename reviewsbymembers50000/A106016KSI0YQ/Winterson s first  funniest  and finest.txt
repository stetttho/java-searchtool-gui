 All of Jeanette Winterson's novels are intelligent and worth reading, yet none of her later works have ever quite equalled this, her famous first novel that created a sensation in the UK in the mid 1980s. For one thing, almost none of her later writings show the fine sense of humor in this autobiographical Bildungsroman about a young lesbian growing up near midcentury among fundmentalist parents in the poor North country of England; for another, Winterson's themes here seem less abstracted and more organic. ORANGES owes debts to the magical realism associated with British writers like Angela Carter, yet it also plants its feet squarely in the comic realist tradition of Dickens and Pritchett. Its central ideas and themes about imagination, love, family, and community are dealt with a happily light and intelligent hand.
