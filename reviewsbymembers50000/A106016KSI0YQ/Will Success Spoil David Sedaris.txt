 David Sedaris's first books, BARREL FEVER and NAKED, brought him from cult status to national celebrity status because of his singularly hilarious vision of the world. But much of his humor in those books depended on his scruffy, outsider economic status (he made his money before he became famous cleaniong other people's houses in Manhattan) and his extremely bizarre and loveable large family from North Carolina. It was easy to love Sedaris's self-deprecating hero because he was such an underdog; you couldn't help wanting him to win. But since he's become a success his subject matter has changed while his tone has not. It's very hard to feel sorry and luagh at Sedaris's circumstances when his problems include assimilating properly into French culture (his boyfriend owns a farmhouse in Normandy) or choosing among overfancy dishes at expensive Manhattan restaurants. The best bits in this collection--the first story about his lisp correction therapy, his account of his father's peculiar eating habots, and his classic "Big Boy"--retain Sedaris' sense of himself as underdog, and thus are hilarious; the rest of the collection is quite disappointing for those who loved Sedaris's first two books.
