 Susan Glaspell's beautiful 1915 novel of a fallen woman may be the single best unread American novel from the first quarter of the twentieth century: it is proleptic not only of the later novels of Willa Cather (like THE PROFESSOR'S HOUSE and A LOST LADY) but even of Fitzgerald's Midwestern writings--and yet it remains its own one-of-a-kind work. The protagonist, Ruth, must return home for her father's funeral to the Mississippi River city of Freeport she left a decade earlier with another man's husband, bringing shame to her family and disappointment and feelings of betrayal from the polite society in which she used to excel. The book is far too intelligent to present the aftermath of Ruth's elopement in one-sided terms, and shows as many sides not only to the affair's consequences but to Ruth and her friends as possible. The novel is told deftly and complexly, with unobtrusive shifts from one time period to another; it also treats its Iowan subjects not as mere hicks (as Sinclair Lewis was wont to do) but rather as they see themselves--as complex and richly layered individuals. The highest compliment I can pay FIDELITY is to say it truly deserves the heartstoppingly beautiful re-edition Persephone Books has here given it, with its gorgeous endpapers pattered after a turn-of-the-century quilt.
