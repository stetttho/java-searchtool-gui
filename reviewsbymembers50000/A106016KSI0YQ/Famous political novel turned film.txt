 Time has been less kind to Robert Rossen's legendary adaptation of Robert Penn Warren's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel based on the rise of Huey Long than you might imagine. This film won a passel of Academy Awards in 1949 (including Best Picture) , and it has superb production values and very unusual experimental dialogue (the characters often repeat the same sentence many times for different effect), but the plot is at times confusing, given that many subplots are largely dropped but glancingly alluded to from the original novel. It's often hard to figure out why certain characters, particularly the women, undergo sudden reversals, and you feel constantly as if there were other crucial stories you're not being told. The acting is highly variable, with some very unmemorable performances in underwritten roles but also with some excellent work from Broderick Crawford as the megalomanical central character Willie Stark and Mercedes McCambridge as the hardbitten Sadie (both of whom won Oscars), and from Anne Seymour as Willie's idealistic wife who learns to compromise her values as Willie's star rises. The DVD used right now is fairly unsatisfactory, since the original screen ratio of the film has been significantly altered.
