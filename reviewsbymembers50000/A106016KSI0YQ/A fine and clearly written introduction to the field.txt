 This is one of the clearest introductions I could imagine to the field of sexuality studies--Bristow does a fine job giving an overview of a very dense and crowded theoretical field. The chapters on sexology and on Foucault and his influence on [homosexual] studies are the best; I think the section on postmodern theory was probably not a good choice. Most of the models Bristow proposes here--Lyotard, Baudrillard, Deleuze & Guattari--really don't fit into the rest of the discussion, which is mostly about the desirtes of individuals rather than of "culture," and thus seem like a sop to critical fashion. The space this section took up (half a chapter) could have been used to speak more in depth about Freud or Lacan, or to give a fuller account of newer psychological insights into sexuality. But otherwise, this is a great introduction for students.
