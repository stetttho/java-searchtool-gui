 Aidan Quinn, with his unearthly pale eyes and great handsomeness, would seem perfectly cast as a university professor exploring a case of a ghost haunting in a great English mansion; unfortunately, his harsh American voice seems wholly out of place in this period chiller. Though the movie is redeemed in part by its great wild ending (blunted in part by poor special effects), the director, Lewis Gilbert, seems to have little feel for the Gothic mode: the house itself isn't terribly scary (and doesn't even seem very large), and there's very little sense of atmosphere. All the nighttime scenes seem unusually well lit, for example. Perhaps to convey the decadent "Brideshead" atmosphere, Anthony Andrews is bizarrely miscast as Kate Beckinsale's brother, despite their twenty-five years' difference in age.
