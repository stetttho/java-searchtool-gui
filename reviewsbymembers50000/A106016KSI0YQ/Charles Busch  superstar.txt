 There's never been anyone quite like Charles Busch--he is so superb at campiness and mannerisms that he takes his drag performances to a whole other level, and this film allows the most extended chance to see him close up and in a starring role.  Originally a play he wrote very quickly for a short run in Los Angeles, DIE MOMMIE DIE!, is a reworking of Aeschylus's Oresteia as a 60s filmic Grand(e-Dame) Guignol (got that?), centering upon Angela Arde, a faded glamorous Fifties singer along the lines of Patti Page, plotting to murder her elderly wealthy husband. For good measure, Busch throws in as well much of the plot of Bette Davis twins films, and the silliness is really something when Busch can really let loose on the terrific set (a hilariously cheesy pseudo-glamorous actual Hollywood mansion) and in his  jawdropping outfits. There are certain moments--such as Angela's piano-accompanied medley at his husband's wake, which culminates somehow in "Spinning Wheel"--where Busch about the funniest thing you'vwe ever seen in your life. Unfortunbately, the director did not have such a sure hand with the other actors, and everyone else seems to either underplay their parts (like Frances Conroy as the maid) or, worse, overplay them (particularly Stark Sands as the gay son). But it's worth it all for Busch. The film gets funnier on repeat viewings, especially if you listen along to the commentary by the film's director, Jason Priestley and Busch himself--his sincere personal graciousness to everyone else and constant self-deprecation is always very winning, and his comments about the various homages to different screen goddesses are always appreciated.
