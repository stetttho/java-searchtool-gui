 The last two Adam Dagliesh novels have seen P. D. James close to the top of her form, but while this latest entrant in the series is not as distasteful as some of the worst books in it (such as A TASTE FOR DEATH), neither does it show her at her most cunning. The setting is somewhat typical for James: a Victorian house with interesting architecture converted into the Dupayne Museum, a small institution devoted to the cultural and social history of the Interwar period. The Dupayne heirs, a squabbling set of siblings (one of whom is of course soon murdered), also seem very much a typical bunch of Jamesian suspects. But the first one hundred pages setting the scene and introducing the characters is inordinately humdrum. We are told repeatedly how uninteresting the Dupayne is, and the characters all seem, like their creator, with a peculiarly circumspect and distanced vision of their lives and everyone else's: they all seem vaguely nihilistic and biding their time until the grave. Only when the first murder occurs do things perk up considerably in terms of interest, both for the Dupayne and the cast of characters, and then things do get humming and James seems to snap out of her writerly doldrum. The novel's other unhappy feature is its unconnected subplot involving the ever-distant Commander Dagliesh and his bloodless romance with the sickeningly perfect Emma Laversham, introduced in the previous (and far superior) Dagliesh mystery DEATH IN HOLY ORDERS. Why James wanted to continue with Emma's colorless character is a greater mystery than anything Dagliesh or his subordinates encounter in the novel itself.
