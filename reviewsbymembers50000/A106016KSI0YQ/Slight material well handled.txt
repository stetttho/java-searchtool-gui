 The Persephone Press, in its publicity material, compares this reissue of a 1932 Julia Strachey novel to A ROOM WITH A VIEW, but it's much more like Wodehouse or E. F. Benson in its breezy depiction of the life among interwar rich ninnies. This novel may attempt for something a little stronger in its attempt to adhere to the Aristotelean unities and its faint note of the tragic, but it doesn't quite pull it off. After all, why should it adhere to the Aristotelean unities, and what does the trragic note matter when the characters are so thin? But it's still amusing and likeable: there have probably been few novels where flowers are described incidentally in such detail.
