 I absolutely love the idea behind Carr's Laszlo Kreizler mysteries, and who isn't fascinated by the detailed workings of turn-of-the-century New York? They always turn out to fall far short of their intentions, however.  I finally gave up on this one 3/4 of the way through: although I love the  period detail, Carr's predilection for imposing 20/20 hindsight upon  history gets very annoying (for example, if anybody is sampling a new  alcoholic concoction new to the city, wouldn't you know that it would be a  martini), and his desire to bring in actual historical personages sometimes  stretches believability past the breaking point (if Dr. Kreizler had to  find a sketch artist, did it have to be Cecilia Beaux?). But what was  most objectionable to me in the end was the anachronistic dialogue and the  melodramatic, cartoonish plot events. I love the idea of recreating a  vanished world, but if you like this sort of thing, I recommend instead  sticking with Charles Palliser's novels (like THE UNBURIED and THE  QUINCUNX) or Anne Perry's. They can at least write well.
