 MARRIED TO THER MOB is not only Jonathan Demme's best film but perhaps the single funniest comedy to emerge from Hollywood in the Eighties. Its depiction of the New York area mob enormously influenced David Chase's THE SOPRANOS on HBO, and hasn't received the recognition for this it deserves. The genius of the film is that all the film's characters (with the exceptions of Michelle Pfeiffer, Matthew Modine and Sister Carol) are all mosters of taste as well as morality, and yet none of them seem to realize this: they think everyone else likes the same furniture, and beahves in the same way, as they do. This has the effect of making their awful choices in home decor seem sublime ("I see a great house!" Alec Baldwin complains, when he looks around at the illgotten and hideous goods his mob work has won him), and their moral choices hilarious. Dean Stockwell, as the randy head of the mob family after Pfeiffer's heroine, and Mercedes Ruehl, as his dumb but jealously devoted wife, almost steal the show (there's a great moment--just two seconds, really--when Ruehl decides to surprise her husband while standing at Kennedy Airport under an advertsiing sign that says, "Miami is for Lovers": her goofy look of inspiration is priceless). But the film in the end belongs to Michelle Pfeiffer, as the hapless heroine, the widowed wife of a mob enforcer. This was the film that really made Pfeiffer a star. Years before she began to perfect the irritating mannerisms that marred her work in the Nineties, she manages to make her character's sufferings and her innate goodness seem immensely touching and also, almost bewilderingly, deeply funny. She has a great date at a salsa club with Matthew Modine's character that remains one of the greatest first dates in film history: watch especially for their little dance outside the Criminal Justice Building in the outtakes during the closing credits.
