 As someone below wisely noted, Monica Ali's first novel, shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize (and expected to have won, though it lost out), is in many ways a response to THE HOME AND THE WORLD, the beautiful turn-of-the-century novel by Rabindranath Tagore, the Nobel prizewinning Bengali poet and novelist. As in Tagore's novel, Ali's work shows the very circumscribed world of a Bangla woman, her husband who adores her, and the young man who excites her, and the competing claims the public life makes upon her own inner sanctum. Nazneen, the central character of Ali's novel, is extremely beautifully fleshed out, and her inner life is probed with great profundity despite the quietness of her actions and the closed-in nature of her immediate physical world. Her stubborn and talkative husband Chanu--at times contemptible, at other times quite loveable, and always human-- also emerges as a memorable three-dimensional character, and their interactions frame an intelligent meditation on multiculturalism, on Islam, on women, on Britain, on Bangladesh.  This is a superb first work.
