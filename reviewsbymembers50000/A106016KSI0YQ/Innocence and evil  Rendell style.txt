 Twice in this novel, Laf, probably the least-damaged of its many vivid characters, asks if someone killed a human monster (like a Hitler or a Mussolini) and didn't know what he or she were doing, whether it would be an evil act. This novel is in large part a response to his question. Jeff, a very handsome con artist who lives off other women's money, intersects with the lives of a whole series of characters, from the emotionally disturbed Minty to the lovely wealthy Fiona to the ethically-challenged Zillah (his previous wife, and the mother of his miserable children). Although jeff isn;'t fully aware of the damage he inflicts on the women who he seduces and cons, he creates great emotional wreckage in his wake; midway through the novel he is killed, and the rest of the narrative attempts to sort out what happens to everyone else. As far as Ruth Rendell novels go this is right up there with A DARK-ADAPTED EYE in its ethical and narrative complexity: it's very hard to put down, and the characters greatly come to life on the page and then afterwards. Even the most ethically ambiguous characters, (such as the neglectful Zillah and her cruel and snobbish friend Jims) are nevertheless sympathetic to some degree. In Rendell's world there are no escape from the wages of sin: the world as she sees it is so fallen that even  the most innocent characters (such as Minty and Fiona) must suffer for the sins of others.
