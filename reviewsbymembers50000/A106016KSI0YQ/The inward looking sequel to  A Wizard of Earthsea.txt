 After encountering the broadly expansive world detailed so lovingly in "A Wizard of Earthsea," younger readers may be puzzled at first by the extremely different scope of the second book in the "Earthsea" tetralogy, "The Tombs of Atuan," which restricts almost all of its narrative to the title site. (The map in some editions of the labyrinth under the tombs seems almost to parody the indispenable maps of Earthsea in the first book in the series.) The hero of the first book, Ged, doesn't even appear until well into the narrative: while Ged was a wanderer, this book is about a young woman, originally named Tenar, who has been since infancy marked out as the most important religious figure in the largest political power in earthsea at the time of the book's events, but who is nonetheless restricted to a dreary life of ritual serving the Nameless Ones in a desolate shrine. You'd think Le Guin couldn't pull off such a purposeful reversal of scale and tone after the stunning achievement of the first book, but she does, and the respectful (and non-romantic) relationship between Tenar and Ged is deftly limned, as are Tenar's revelations about the nature of the gods she serves.  It's not a book for everyone, given its decidely dismal atmosphere, but it is nonetheless accomplished with brilliant skill.
