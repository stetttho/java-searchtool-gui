 As Harry Potter has grown older so have JK Rowlings' storylines. This, the 6th in the series, is by far the darkest so far but also perhaps the best constructed and the most emotionally satisfying. Adult and teenage fans of the series will have the most enjoyment from this entry, but it may be too upsetting and violent for the youngest Harry Potter fans. Although the scene begins with the muggle Prime Minister of the UK being visited by the former and new Ministers of Magic to warn him about the chaos wreaked by Lord Voldemort, the political emphasis of the 5th book in the series is refreshingly less absent than before, though Hogwarts (and the world of wizardry) are basically in a state of siege from Voldemort and his Death Eaters. Harry, having passed his O,W.L.s, is now captain of the Gryffindor quidditch team, and is also engaged in private research with Dumbledore regarding the past of Lord Voldemort. There's a superb new character--a pompous and namedropping, but essentially genial, former professor asked back to Hogwarts by Dumbledore--, and there is much hormonal mischief up among Harry and his friends, Rupert and Hermione. Be prepared for a darker tone than even the last Harry Potter installment, but also be ready for a more mature focus on character and ethics.
