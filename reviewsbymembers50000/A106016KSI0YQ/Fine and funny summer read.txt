 Julian Fellowes, himself a member of the British aristocratic circles (his wife is a lady in waiting to Princess Michael of Kent) and the co-writer of Robert Altman's GOSFORD PARK, was the perfect person to write this frothy but very funny send-up of the British fascination with titles and privilege. Edith Lavery, a daughter of an arriviste family, manages to hook Charles, Earl Broughton, the only son of the extremely wealthy Marquess of Uckford. Edith must combat not only the snobbish and exclusive Broughton circle but her own colossal boredom when she realizes that  her life as a countess will consist of little more than flower shows and hunts. Things become extremely complicated when she leaves the earl for a handsome television actor, but then realizes how little she gains in the exchange.  This was an absorbing read, and Fellowes is able to skewer British elitism fairly deftly. (A very funny underlying theme is how the Broughtons always have to admit new wives with New Money whom their mother-in-laws object to as parvenus.) The lethally exclusive and polite Marchioness of Uckfield, is a fine comic creation, and Fellowes makes fine observations about manners and morals in the age of Tony Blair. Although the novel clearly borrows much from Thackeray, Wharton and Waugh, it really isn't in the class of THE CUSTOM OF THE COUNTRY or A HANDFUL OF DUST although it echoes both their plots: it's a summer page-turner, nothing more. But it succeeds very well for what it is.
