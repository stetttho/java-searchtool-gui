 This is the novel I always go back to when I want to recapture that great "Primal Read." It's almsot impossible to put Thackeray's masterpiece down: its depiction of the corrupt world of the Prince Regent seems to leap off the page and acquire its own reality, so that for days after I first read this I seemed to be living in Thackeray's universe rather than late twentieth-century America. Its genius is not only in its humor (which is considerable--episodes like Becky Sharp's impression of the Countess of Southdown are almost unforgettably funny) but in its rounded depiction of characters who seem to have lives of their own outside of the book itself. No character, no matter how trivial, does not get his or her own moment, and just when you've written off one of them as two-dimensional Thackeray suddenly makes you aware of that character's ability to suffer in an acutely human way. Thackeray never wrote anything better, but nor did perhaps any other Victorian novelist.
