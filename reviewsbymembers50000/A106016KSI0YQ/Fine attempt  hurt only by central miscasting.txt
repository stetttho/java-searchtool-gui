 The reviews posted here are almost all one stars or five stars, with few in-between votes, showing how deeply people care about Patricia Highsmith's creation of Tom Ripley. Minghella very clearly brings his own unique interpretation of the character to the film, and thus casts a very gifted actor in Matt Damon who nonetheless isn't very much like the Ripley of the book. Whereas Highsmith's Ripley is deeply pained and vulnerable below the surface, Damon (under Minghella's direction) brings it all to the forefront, making Ripley less of an antihero and more of a sad soul. It's an interesting reading of the character and the novel, and Damon essays the role with real intelligence, but it just doesn't allow for the film to have the kind of scary zing of the original novel. Fortunately, just about everything else about the film is right: the Italian scenery is gorgeous, the period details are marvelous, and the supporting performances are knockouts. Gwyneth Paltrow has been given some flak here for the coldness of her Marge, but it's actually a very well thought-out performance, and paltrow very bravely chooses to emphasize some of Marge's less likeable qualities. Law is terrific (although it's silly that Minghella didn't choose two actors for Dickie and Tom who look more alike), and Hoffman is superb (as always) in his small role. The film's greatest acting honors go to Cate Blanchett, though, who might have given the single best performance of 1998 in what amounts to basically a throwaway role as a flighty heiress (her character isn't even in the original book). Her portrayal of Meredith is nothing short of astonishing: silly, loving, and very vulnerable--her little scene with Paltrow in the cafe near the Spanish Steps is the highlight of the whole film, and just about breaks your heart.
