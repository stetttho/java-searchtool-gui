 This unusual noir film has acquired an impressive reputation, mostly because of its distinctiveness and its blending of one of the most iconic of Hollywood actors (Humphrey Bogart) with one of the most intensely  personal of Hollywood directors (Nicholas Ray). Adapted from a pulp novel about a serial killer, the film veers widely from its original source: the murder mystery that sets it off fades very quickly to the background, as the film becomes much more about the volatile relationship between the abusive but romantic screenwriter played by Bogart and the woman he loves (Gloria Grahame, in a very fine performance that makes much of her odd combination of flowerlike beauty and tough will). The film's searching exploration of raw emotions combined with its complex use of mise-en-scene only partially obscures the fact that Bogart's performance is quite erratic. Although believably incensed in the final scene, he seems too bored and tired to  be credible driving his car at high speed in a fury or beating up a star football player. Moreover, the initial scenes with Bogart and the murder victim seem from another movie altogether, and you feel cheated when the likeable murder victim turns out to be so irrelevant to the story. This DVD version has a sometimes illuminating, sometimes fatuous short starring Curtis Hanson providing commentary on the film.
