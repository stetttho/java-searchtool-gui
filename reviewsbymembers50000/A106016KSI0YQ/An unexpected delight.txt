 Few people remember that Carol Burnett got her start as a singer as much as a stand-up comedienne, but she was the original Winifred the Woebegone in ONCE UPON A MATTRESS and of course was the original choice to play Fanny Brice in FUNNY GIRL. She has a very big, very strident voice (it's the vocal equivalent of a trombone), and it's often used for terrific effect in very bright upbeat songs ("The Trolley Song" has always been one of her best). She often overplays her hand a bit when she goes for pathos, as in "Happiness is Just a thing Called Joe," but surprisingly she can be very effective in quieter numbers--the highlight of the CD might even be the catchy little "Give a Little--Get a Little" by Jule Styne.
