 This is the best BBC adaptation of a classic British novel since the golden years of the Seventies and early Eighties. Gaskell's most atypical (and most Austenian) novel is given the full treatment, leaving in all the sweethearted romance and yet retaining some of the slightly disturbing Freudian underlay of the original novel. Justine Waddell is marvelous as Molly, the spirited heroine who adores her father and is disheartened when, for the sake of actually making his daughter happier, her doctor-father marries a well-meaning but pushing arriviste wife, played to splendid perfection by Francesca Annis. True to the character of Hyacinth in Gaskell's novel, Annis's Hyacinth steals the show: while you can't help but be as mortified by her meddling and selfishness as is Molly, you still can't bring yourself to despise her given Hyacinth's enormous capacity to suffer (Annis is especially moving in the proposal scene in the show's beginning hour). A terrific supporting cast led by Michael Gambon makes this adaptation of this previously (and unjustly) neglected novel sparkle.
