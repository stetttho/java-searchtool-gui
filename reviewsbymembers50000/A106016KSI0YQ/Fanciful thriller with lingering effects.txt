 Two films were made at about the same time based on, of all things, the Arthur Conan Doyle scandal from the early 20s about the supposed photographing of actual fairies playing with children. FAIRY TALE: A TRUE STORY garnered more attention, and largely took the children's perspective; this little thriller from the same year used the tale more as a point of departure, imagining instead an adult fantasy with erotic and philosophical overtones about a photographer haunted by the death of his first wife who becomes involved in a similar incident. The film has unusual and wonderful effects that stay with you for a long time, and wish it were up to the ambitions the first-time director, Nick Willing, clearly had for it. Unfortunately, his inexperience shows, and the odd bridge he tries to naviagte between fantasy and realism doesn't always hold together. His use of expressionistic techniques--the bloodied head of the hero at the funeral, the linking image of the pocketwatch (brought out even when the hero is in a full body cast!)--just seem silly rather than evocative. The film has an unusual hero in Toby Stephens: while not very sympathetic, he's a superb actor, and his decided carnality and corporeality work startling effects on the character. Unfortunately, these same qualities makes it impossible to believe that Ben Kingsley (of all people), as a grieving country vicar, could ever get the better of Stephens so many times physically as he does in the film. Still, the ambition of the film, and its many evocative images, make you wish it were released on DVD with a director's or writer's commentary.
