 The most beautiful of all Miss Americas (with the POSSIBLE exception of only Lee Meriweather), Vanessa Wiliiams has an absolutely gorgeous voice made just for musical theatre: here, on this Encores! recording of the famous Harold Arlen musical, she gives what I would call the definitive performance of "Anywhere I Hang My Hat is Home," which is saying something given her competition over the decades. Why she never fully  turned her talents towards Broadway will mystify you after hearing her on this magnificent recording. The rest of the cast does beautifully with some of Arlen's most beautiful music: I notice here some criticisms of Helen Goldsby, and though her voice isn't al;ways as true here as it could be she is quite moving on "I Wonder What Became of Me" (she is a marvelous actress, as anyone ever fortunate enough to see her on Broadway in  "Master Class" could attest).
