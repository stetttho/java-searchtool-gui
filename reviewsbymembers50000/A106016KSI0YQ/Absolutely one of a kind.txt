 With BLACK NARCISSUS, Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger achieved what may be their masterpiece: it's every bit as visually stunning as their more beloved films THE RED SHOES and A MATTER OF LIFE AN DEATH, but with Rumer Godden's novel providing the story they have a much more sophisticated and challenging story to work with. Godden's novel of lust and memory bursting forth in the peculiar Himalayan atmosphere of a former harem, transformed into a new convent, is unlike almost anything ever written, and provides the cast with absolutely extraordinary roles to work with. With the exception of the Governess in THE INNOCENTS, Deborah Kerr never got another role up to the level of her singular talent as that of Sister Clodagh, the ambivalent sister superior in the convent of St. Faith's: her fierce determination and unearthly beauty is well-served by the billowing wimple that frames her face so severely. There are some very strange performances of Indian characters that almost sink the film, including May Hallett as a very unconvincing ayah (she bears an uncanny resemblance to Agnes Moorehead, and is just about as authentically Indian). However, the British roles are superbly acted, with a suitably Michael Farrar as a scornful local contact for the nuns, and Kathleen Byron as the most disturbed member of the convent. The final wordless sequence of the film is an absolute classic: a brilliantly suspenseful sequence that takes the odd rarefied air of hysteria permeating the film to its highest pitch.
