 The worst tragedy of Connie Francis's is that her lifetime's calamities have come to overshadow her fine music for many among the general public. Hers is a grand and powerful voice to be matched with Patsy Cline's: the sound is true, the self-harmonizing is beautiful, and the songs that made her famous (many of which were old Tin Pan Alley standards which were old-fashioned even in her heyday) hold up beautifully over the years. This is not an album for a Connie Francis aficionado but for someone more casually interested in becoming familiar with her work. The classics are all here, from such sentimental favorites as "Who's Sorry now?" and "Breakin' in a Brand New Broken Heart" to such rockers as "Stupid Cupid." Bravissima Connie!
