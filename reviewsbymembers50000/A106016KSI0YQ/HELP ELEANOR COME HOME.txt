 There are few really first rate ghost stories, and fewer still where the movie version is worthy of the story itself. This marvelous Robert Wise film really does full justice to Shirley Jackson's terrifying novel about the endurance of evil. Although the two male leads aren't much help (especially Russ Tamblyn, who is saddled with the terrible role of the wisecracking playboy), the female leads are outstanding. Claire Bloom is tense and surprising as the Greenwich Village telepath Theo, and Julie Harris gives a superlative performance as the terrified virginal chameleon Eleanor, whom the ghosts of Hill House focus upon (Harris is not afraid to let her character be deeply shrill and annoying when the script demands it, but she also can be radiant and deeply likeable at other moments too). The hideous Richardsonian manor itself where the ghosts of Huge Crane and his daughters seem to lurk is another of the film's stars, and Wise films it spectacularly--there is a great reverse angle fast crane shot that is breathtakingly frightening, and the film's use of sound effects are justly famous. This may be, with THE INNOCENTS, one the greatest ghost movies ever filmed.
