 This alien invasion film, the third in M. Night Shyamalan's run of supernatural films with horror overtones has inspired some of the most mixed of all his reviews, both with the press and the public. Shyamalan plays upon his Hitchcockian influences very much here, and on the plus side this allows for the film (like THE OTHERS, another superior horror film from the last few years) to play more on suggestion and long takes and suspense rather than on cheap thrills. The music and cinematography are superb, and some of the sequences are nothing short of magnificent: the sequence with the Brazilian children's birthday party is one of the scariest (and most beautifully paced) uses of mise en scene with a handhold camera ever done. And the performances from Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix are exceptional, even from both these actors. The film has several glaring weaknesses, to be sure. The largest are its plot holes: the ineptitude of the aliens is pretty remarkable, considering their sophisticated technology, and even a young child will laugh at the silliness of their One Big Weakness. The religious themes of the film also become heavyhanded, especially in the film's gratuitous and poorly faced final scene. Finally, the pointed homages to "The Birds" also become just a bit too much in the sequence towards the end in the cellar (you keep expecting Tippi hedren to show up down there with the family). This is an effective chiller , and stays with you, but next time we can only hope Shyamalan has some second thoughts about his more heavyhanded devices. Instead of a director's commentary for the DVD Shyamalan opted to make an extended multipart documentary with himself narrating: while in many ways this is very engaging (it's impossible not to like him as a personality), it seems a bit ego-serving as well, and doesn't tell you as much as a director's commentary would have (it seems too cheaply self- promotional).
