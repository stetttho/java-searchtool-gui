 By the second book in the Sally Lockhart series Phillip Pullman's characters seem a bit unbelievably contemporary in their attitudes and behavior, but this entry in the series is darker and deeper than "the Ruby in the Smoke." Drawing on Anthony Trollope's THE WAY WE LIVE NOW (which Pullman even mentions during the story), this novel shows Sally in the unlikely position for a young Victorian woman of being an independent  financial advisor, and she becomes quickly involved in a plot by an extremely wealthy and mysterious foreign financier. The tycoon's "weapon top end all weapons" is pretty fascinating: almost unbelievably crude by contemporary standards, the rhetoric surroundings its use and justification brings to mind more recent discussions of nuclear and biological weapons in a fascinating way. The characters remain rich and compelling, and Pullman is as wonderfully deft as ever at creating suspenseful situations and cliffhangers.
