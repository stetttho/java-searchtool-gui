 The adaptors of Trollope's WARDEN and BARCHESTER TOWERS for the BBC keyed in exactly to the keynote of the second of these works, the most famous of Trollope's novels, and gave this miniseries the kind of ferocious energy with which Trollope's Barsetshire clergymen and their wives and daughters fight their amazingly highpitched manic battles over trivialities. The most satisfying moments in this series recognize either the slapstick humor in the original or its divergences into sentimental reflections upon goodness and kindness (the fine casting of Donald Pleasance as the Rev. Mr. Harding, the pivot upon which the entirety revolves, allows for occasions for the latter). While the casting is for the most part first-rate (particularly Nigel Hawthorne as the splenetic Archdeacon Grantly, Peter Blythe as the silly wastrel Bertie Stanhope, and Alan Rickman as the unctuous Obadiah Slope), Geraldine McEwan plays the role of the domineering Mrs. Proudie on far too gigantic a scale. While Mrs. Proudie is certainly Trollope's most larger-than-life creation, McEwan delivers her lines with so much intensity that she disrupts the rhythms of almost every scene she's in. The costumes and sets are first-rate, and the lovely quiet title cards contrast the beauty and stillness of the Barchester Cathedral with the mania of the characters' lives.
