 One of the greatest tragedies of contemporary letters has been the way in which Tom Wolfe has lost his veneer of cool over the last thirty years, as he's become not only a member but a celebrant of the Establishment he once observed cynically from the sidelines. There's a glimpse of what made Wolfe the most important satirist of his generation in his splendidly funny profile of William Shawn, "Tiny Mummies!," but that was written over a generation ago.  Most of his more recent pieces in this collection show instead how deeply out of it he remains today. "In the Land of Rococo Marxists" is almost an embarrassment: Wolfe here fulminates against academic faddishness, but the fads he singles out for scorn were relevant twenty years ago. He seems oblivious to the fact that Derrida has been largely pass for years--it's like complaining about contemporary music and heaping particular vitriol on the Beatles or the Rolling Stones. The response to his critics (John Irving, John Updike, and Norman Mailer) seems similarly out to lunch: he attacks them for qualities they don;t even possess, and seems to negelect how similar they are to him in their fictional styles. It's sad to see someone who once made such a name for himself as being positioned on the cutting edge still attempt to claim that position, but wind up instead seeming blithely unhip.
