 This is one of the most exciting of all B scifi films of the 50s, and one that people remember most vividly, given the incredible vividness of the images: the sleek burnished metal of the Martians' probes, and the vivid electric reds and greens of their machine. George Pal went all out on the effects, and came up with a fascinating "triad"-based design for the Martians and their machines, and the sound effects (the distinctive sound of the ray guns is something that immediately evokes the films) are spectacular. The real triumph of the film, however, is in the prankish cruelty of the Martians: they seem to delight in attacking people at their most vulnerable (and also seem a bit sexually curious about the heroine). This cheerful maliciousness was a huge influence on Tim Burton's MARS ATTACKS! in the mid-90s.  The film is perhaps too ponderous and unsubtle really to reach the A-list of 50 scifi films: there's nothing so subtle here as in the original INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, for example. But you still get the pleasures of downtown Los Angeles being devastated, and of Cedric Hardwicke's awesomely portentous narration.
