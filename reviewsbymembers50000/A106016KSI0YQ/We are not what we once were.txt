 This little masterpiece of horror has been touted as one of the stars of the Persephone catalogue, and deservedly so. It bears comparison to THE YELLOW WALLPAPER but is more sophisticated than Charlotte Perkins Gilman's classic tale (which Laski was unlikely to have known about in 1953 anyway). Laski's story centers on frivolous, wealthy Melanie, who lies in recovery from tuberculosis in the months after giving birth. Her doctor allows her to move from her sickbed to an embroidered Victorian chaise-longue she purchased while shopping for her cradle. As she lies upon it, she becomes aware she is no longer in the 1950s but trapped instead in the body of someone else in the High Victorian period--someone oddly familiar... This little novella uses its fantasy framework to expose our relations to ourselves and to memory and to time, and also to analyze the change in conventions for women and behavior from the nineteenth to the twentieth centuries. It's a real forgotten classic, deserving of rediscovery both in the United Kingdom and the USA.
