 Victor Segalen had one of the most mysterious life stories of any writer in the last one hundred and fifty years, and would make the fine subject for a biography someday (especially considering his still unexplained death in the forest of Brittany). The novel for which he is best remembered, RENE LEYS, admirably anticipates the sophistication of such modernist novels as Ford's THE GOOD SOLDIER and such "nouvelles romans" as Robbe-Grillet's JEALOUSY in its narrative uncertainty and epistemological uncertainties. Unfortunately, its not a terribly interesting novel, especially given that the multiple forewords to this beuaitful NYRB edition give us so little background as top the history and gossip behind the events of the novel: I have even taken coursework in college on the final days of the Manchu Dynasty and barely could follow the novel's course of events. This is a work that requires much more detailed editorial apparatus in future editions if it is to be more fully enjoyed.
