 Sometimes French and Saunders are so dry you almost miss the joke, but at other times they're hilariously over-the-top. Most of the time, though, they're spot on, making you laugh at things you never knew would be funny. Though there are many superb movie parodies in this video, it's at its funniest when the two of them are just being themselves, having a (hilariously) intense conversation about Princess Di's superiority to Fergie. Even better, though, may be their genius parody of the life story of the Collins sisters, Jackie and Joan: Dawn, as Jackie, seems capable of moving only her lower lip, while Joan brings the same combination of glassiness and near-hysteria to everything from being offered the lead role in DYNASTY ("Aaron who?" she intones into the phone, blankly) to lusting after "that cheeky, clownish, Cockney fellow" Anthony Newley.
