 Of all the Powell/Pressburger collaborations, THE RED SHOES is by far the most famous, and the most beloved. Although it has often been ridiculed for its melodramatic storyline, it's almost impossible to forget it once you've seen it, and it's been an incredibly potent allegory for the conflict of life and art for many people over the decades. As the commentary on this DVD repeatedly points out, its best to understand the film as a fairy tale, like the Hans Christian Andersen ballet at its core and from whence it derives its title. Moreover, Powell and Pressberger treated this almost as an experimental film, and worked almost every trick on it available to them to heighten its effects. It becomes thus almost a textbook case for a film scholar to see the different kinds of effects a film at the time could have in terms of playing with camera speed, double exposure, use of color, etc., and many of the individual shots are not only deservedly famous but seem to derive from minds as creative and playful as Griffith's: the great shot of Vicky's feet racing down the spiral staircase, the whirling pans from her point of view at the Mercury Theatre performance of "Swan Lake," and so on. And then there are the fine performances from Moira Shearer, impossibly lovely as the heroine, and Anton Walbrook as her dashing but fearsome Svengali. It's a one-of-a-kind classic worthy of repetaed reviewings, and the Criterion folk give it all the supplemental material it deserves. The commentary is especially fine, with insightful comments from all manner of different people who either worked on the film (like Shearer, or the great cinematographer Jack Cardiff) or who have loved it over the years (like Martin Scorsese, who counts it as one of his most enormous influences). The restoration of the print is also spectacular, with the Disneyesque primary colors in its basic palette at their richest and most hypersaturated.
