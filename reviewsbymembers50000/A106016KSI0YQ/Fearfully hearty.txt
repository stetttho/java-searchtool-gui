 There have been many adaptations of Alexandre Dumas's most famous novel, and this 1948 adapation is one of the most most familiar, but it is terribly uneven, as is the central perfvormance of its star, Gene Kelly. Kelly was extraordinarily handsome (especially in profile), and his attractiveness coupled with his athleticism makes his d'Artagnan tremendous fun to watch, especially in his duels. He was never much of an actor, however, and his director George Sidney unfortunately encouraged him to indulge in such embarrassing antics as flipping on his back and wiggling his legs in the air to show sexual arousal when he spies on the fair Constance (the awesomely unlovely June Allyson) undressing. Except for Van Heflin as the melancholy Athos, acting, indeed, is not this production's strong suit: Robert Coote and Gig Young have practically nothing to say as Aramis and Porthos; Frank Morgan plays Louis XIII exactly like he played Professor Marvel in THE WIZARD OF OZ; and Angela Lansbury struts around looking gorgeous and inexpressive as Anne of Austria. And then there is Lana Turner as Milady. Ideally cast in physical terms, Turner works hard at her big scenes pretending to be dying in the Duke of Buckingham's castle; she is perhaps much more memorable inexpertly executing her little bits of stage business while other characters talk around her, such as attending to her makeup. She's pretty unintentionally hilarious, as are the production's odd uses for location footage: while the Musketeers gallop at frenetic space to England, they seem to move from Monument Valley to Big Sur in just one cut, and neither locale seems even passably convincing as Normandy. And at one point Sidney uses what seems to be a brookside Cape Cod as a seventeenth-century inn. But it is almost impossible to dislike the film given its high energy and spirits. Everything moves so lickety-split that the whole movie passes by quickly and painlessly.
