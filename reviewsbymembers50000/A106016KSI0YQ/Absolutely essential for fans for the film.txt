 "Nashville" may be the single most praised American film of the last fifty years, and a large part of that has to do with the film's songs. Altman's point in his enormous 1975 narrative of three days in the nation's  country-music capital is that popular culture can unify and move a people  at times when there is no other basis for a national collective identity;  his ingenious stroke in using country music--one of the most ridiculed and  yet "American" subgenres of cultural expression--for the basis of  that unification necessitated powerful and moving songs from his cast (who  were individually encouraged to come up with their own melodies and  lyrics). At times, Altman's cast members let him down somewhat: as many  below complain, "200 Years," for example, is a very unpleasant  song to listen to, and one wonders why someone didn't step in to tell Karen  Black to end the phrase "...help me keep from slidin' down some  more" in "Memphis" an octave higher, since she cannot reach  that final low note. Still, the treats on this album are incredible, from  Keith Carradine's charming solo on "I'm Easy" to the great  Broadway actress Barbara Harris's no-holds-barred rendition of "It  Don't Worry Me," which closes the film. But the real reason which  makes this album a must-have is the presence of Ronee Blakely, the most  gifted singer and songwriter in the film (and whose great character, the  fragile but much-loved Barbara Jean, is considered similarly talented by  the film's characters). Blakely's gorgeous songs remind us what popular  culture is capable of stirring within us, and from the infectious  "Tapedeck in His Tractor (The Cowboy Song)," with its catchy  beginning riffs, to the melancholy "Dues," to the sad soaring  duet "One, I Love You," every song she sings is almost  transcendently beautiful. Best of all is her great last song which ties the  whole film together, "My Idaho Home," her personal salute to the  American dream of an innocent past which seemed both to haunt and elude the  American people at the height of Watergate. This album is worth owning just  for that song alone.
