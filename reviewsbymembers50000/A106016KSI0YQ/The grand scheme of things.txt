 As with his most recent book on the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906, in KRAKATOA Simon Winchester takes a cataclysm from over a century ago and uses it to delve into not simply the history of the event itself but also of almost everything you could think of it related either directly or tangentially to it, from an account of the intellectual work of Alfred Russell Wallace and the "Wallace Line" imagined across Java to the history of Dutch colonization of Indonesia. Unlike the more recent book, however, Winchester ties the different strings together much more successfully and convincingly, and brings off the kind of complex fugal narrative effects he intends through the interweaving of these storylines. Although sometimes he makes claims for which he offers little support (such as his claims as to why the aftermath of Krakatoa led to the spread of fundamentalist islam in Indonesia, for which he offers all kinds of interesting speculations but very little convincing proof), the book is still edifying and intriguing, and shows off Winchester's unique polymathy at its very best.
