 Ann-Margret was in some ways the Ricky Martin of her day in that she was rocketed to national attention by her extremely sexy performance of a song on an awards show. The film adapters of the Broadway show BYE BYE BIRDIE, sensing her potential appeal, cast her as Kim, and decided to let her take over the whole shebang. As a result, Dick Van Dyke and Janet Leigh (in the part of Rosie played on Broadway by Chita Rivera) are relegated to the sidelines, as is much of the stage show's plot and everything else. The result is somewhat mixed. The show's plot becomes so altered that the ending makes very little sense, and Van Dyke and Leigh are so marginal to the film's interest that their characters become almost tiresome. The only number from the original show that seems to have been improved in the translation from stage to screen is the classic "Telephone Hour," which is every bit as much a showstopper as it should be: the most exciting song ever composed by Charles Strouse, its incessant rhythms make for a very lively edited film number that is the film's highpoint of excitement. Unfortunately, it occurs much too soon--everything else is largely downhill. The exception to this is Ann-Margret. She IS every bit the star the film's producers make her out to be, and she steals ever scene she's in. At times you can't help looking at her, even when Conrad Birdie, who is SUPPOSED to be the star, is onscreen (no wonder she was later cast--in VIVA LAS VEGAS!-- opposite the real Elvis Presley, whose lipbiting and hipwriggling antics she mirrors; she's almost his exact female equaivalent). The filmmakers asked for an original number for her to start the film (they knew what a find they had in her), and they came up with an almost hyperreal rendition of the title song the composers created, with Ann-Margret hyperactively racing around in front of an electric blue backdrop as the camera tries to keep up with her. The result is nothing short of hypnotic.
