 When it was announced that the SciFi Channel would be producing a miniseries in 2000 based on Frank Herbert's DUNE fans of the book were pretty excited: although David Lynch's 1984 film version was visually quite stunning, it had a great deal of difficulty rendering Herbert's epic story coherently or compellingly. But even given the extra time this miniseries does not do much of a better job. Moreover, aalthough the sets and costumes are terrific, the special effects seem almost wondrously shoddy and unconvincing: it's always clear the actor playing Baron Harkonnen is on some sort of moving cherrypicker (the filmmakers don't even attempt to make it look like he's really flying--they almost never shoot him below the waist), and the actors always look like they're against bluescreens superimposed with cheap CGI effects when they're outside. Things aren't helped out much either by the cinematographer's experimental use of high-contrast colored lighting, which end up making Herbert's Arrakis seem more horribly akin to Joshua Logan's Bali Ha'i than anything else. Finally, with the exception of Saskia Reeves as Lady Jessica, the cast is uniformly weak: Alec Newman is insistently unlikeable as Paul/Muad'dib, and William Hurt murmurs his way through the part of Duke Leto Atreides. About all this adaptation really has going for it is Herbert's unique transplantation of Islamic religion, Renaissance court intrigues, and 20th-c. ecological concerns into a space opera setting--but that's enough to still keep you watching, whatever the miniseries's other deficiencies.
