 A book like this has been depserately needed to counter those who have smugly stated that poverty no longer exists in America, or that the economic boom of the Nineties meant prosperity for all. Ehrenreich's muckraking work of going undercover in various lowpaying jobs (a waitress in Key West, a cleaning woman in Portland, Maine, and a Wal-Mart worker in Minneapolis) shows the misery of low paying work and how impossible it is to live decently at minimum wages. There's a breeziness to the book that is often very funny (her anger at the smug and wealthy houseowners she cleans for in maine is hilarious), but sometimes the breathless prose seems to go by so quickly that the book doesn't take enough time to stop and breathe and make its important points.
