 Carlos Ruiz Zafon's Barcelona-set SHADOW OF THE WIND has been repeatedly compared--quite inaccurately--to Borges, but it is really more akin to Sebastien Japrisot's A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT and Michael Ondaatje's THE ENGLISH PATIENT: it's basically a multi-threaded story of doomed love, set against historical upheaval and pieced together years after the fact. It has fine Gothic atmospherics that really make it compelling. There are, however, quite a number of narrative lapses throughout that may betray the author's comparative youth. (For example, Ruiz Zafon frequently has his main character read documents by other characters that are all told in the same basic style and that have information within them to which the characters writing the narrative could not possibly be privy.) It was an enjoyable read all told, however--whatever its errors, I could not wait to get back to it while reading it.
