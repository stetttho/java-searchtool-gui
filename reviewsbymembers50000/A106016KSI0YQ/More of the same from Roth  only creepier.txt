 The last few years have seen a sudden resurgence in Philip Roth's literary reputation as he has come forth with some markedly original work, especially his masterpiece THE HUMAN STAIN. But his newest novella, THE DYING ANIMAL,  seems a step back in the old direction, and seems a recycling of his old themes from his Seventies and Sixties fiction. Once again, an impossibly horny writer and academic living in the New York area uses women for sex with little regard to their feelings or to their existence outside of himself as human beings in their own right. Certainly the novella is concerned with understanding--and even critiquing--Kepesh's ethical positions, but isn't this just all more of the same from Roth? The sexagenarian Kepesh is so morally repulsive that it's hard to want to spend much time with him, and his situation (he not only attracts much, much, much younger women, but seems unable to beat them off with a stick) seems a bit fantastic. Roth has dipped too many times from the same well--and it's become more than a bit embarrassing.
