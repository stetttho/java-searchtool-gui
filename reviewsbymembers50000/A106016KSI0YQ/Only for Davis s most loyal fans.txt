 This independently-produced film, done just after ALL ABOUT EVE, exercises a kind of lurid fascination for Bette Davis's fans because even though the part of Margaret Elliot was written for Joan Crawford, and supposedly based on  Crawford, the feeling that Davis is in many ways playing herself as a washed-up star in the early 50s is pretty hard to shake. Davis is as nervily amazing as always, but the production is pretty dismal: it was all done pretty much on the cheap, and the other actors (particularly Sterling Hayden as her stolid love interest) are so pallid compared to her that she might as well be acting alone on the screen. It's not even much fun as camp--it's only of interest because you get to see Bette Davis.
