 Early in his memoir Arenas tells the story of reciting a story for a local library competition. Arenas writes of the judges, "They were impressed, not by my skill in telling the story but by the story itself." To some extent, that stands as a pretty fair assessment of my own reaction to BEFORE NIGHT FALLS. The story of Arenas's life is remarkably astonishing: born into abject poverty, he experienced the tremendous horrors of life in castro's Cuba as a dissident writer, was enslaved by the state in order to work in sugar plantations, jailed for his writings and sexual behavior, and then managed to escape to the USA as a Marielito where he remained in relative poverty and was ultimately struck down by AIDS.  While the story itself is absolutely spellbinding, the telling of it is not. Arenas's persona comes across at times as spectacularly grandiose, and the litany of the prizes he won for his writing (or of those he lost only because of the judges' political biases) gets a bit wearisome. So too does his recounting of his erotic adventures, which are often quite funny but become so prodigious and repetitive they eventually become tedious. And his insights into sexual mores and political realities seem very blinkered and Manichaean: there's very little nuance to be had in Arenas's vision of the world. Nevertheless, I would recommend this book just for the glimpse it offers of an operatically intense life experienced under tremendous hardships and injustices.
