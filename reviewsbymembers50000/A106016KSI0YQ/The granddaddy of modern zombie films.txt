 The great thing about zombie films is that you don't really need to spend any money on special effects if you don't want to: just the idea of the dead silently moving is horror enough. Many directors with low budgets and great imaginations have thus turned to the genre, producing such classic variations on the theme as I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, THE EVIL DEAD, and 28 DAYS LATER. But they all owe a debt back to this, probably the first "true" zombie film. Fortunately, this Haiti-set film holds up beautifully, with wonderfully evocative images. There's a completely wordless satanic mill, where the silence isn't even broken by the fall of one of the zombies into the great millstone; a haunted ruined castle by the sea like something out of Dor; a vulture that is used to wonderful effect  in the film's last moments; and a beautiful undead heroine stalking around in her filmy negligee. (Inevitably she's named "Madeleine," so her irritating boyfriend can call after her, in BBC tones, "Oh, Madeleine... Madeleine... oh, Madeleine...")  Bela Legosi, who was clearly not out for subtlety as the evil zombie master Legendre, is the perfect center figure for this expressionistic nightmare.
