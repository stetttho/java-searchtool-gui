 Manckiewicz's infamous folly CLEOPATRA is all about size: at the time of its release it was the most expensive movie ever made and paid its star, Elizabeth Taylor, the highest salary ever then recorded for a film actor. The sets are massive, and the Cinemascope takes full advantage of their terrifyingly huge scale: the characters are sometimes photographed to look especially diminutive within them so you can hardly distinguish them from one another. Naturally this does allow for amazing moments of spectacle, and the movie is worth seeing just for the jawdropping excess of such scenes as Cleopatra's spectacular entrance into Rome to visit the father of her child Caesarion. Yet everything in the film is so overscaled that it encourages the actors to do the same with their performances, and everyone is always shouting at one another across grand piazzas and up giant staircases. Rex Harrison (as Caesar) and Roddy MacDowell (as Octavian) fare the best, since their characters best alllow for such posturing, but both Taylor and Richard Burton (whose romance with one another made this film's production an international sensation) find their performances cheapened by the melodramatics. Burton was never at his best when delivering his lines at the top of his lungs, and Taylor started with this performance to give vent to her over-the-top tendencies in a way that only found an admirable outlet once afterwards, in WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF. Here she seems to be shrieking at everyone within range of her excruciatingly loud voice (moreover, this is the first film where she seems pudgy and out-of-shape).
