 There's trouble down at Malibu Beach in the early Sixties. Sensible Florence Forrester has begun to ignore her trueblue friend Burdene in favor of "that sleazy beach crowd," a group of young surfbums who have taught her to ride the waves and renamed her "Chicklet." Florence suffers from strange spells when she's not herself, and becomes a tough femme fatale named Ann Bowman, "dominatrix-empress of the planet Earth!," who likes nothing better than to enunciate her own name melodramatically and to shout orders at her male sex slaves. Florence's mother, a Joan Crawfordesque control freak, won't explain what's up with her troubled daughter. Meanwhile, some of the surfers in Florence's crowd can't seem to keep their hands off one another. And a strange killer is slaughtering people all over the place, striking largely at the physically imperfect...  Charles Busch's successful off-off-Broadway stage play gets the full treatment here and is largely very successful. Very wisely, Busch, who played Chicklet onstage, stepped aside in favor of young Lauren Ambrose, later to be the star of HBO's "Six Feet Under," and cast himself instead as the police detective, Monica Stark, investigating the murders. Monica is such an bercompetent butch detective (with strangely thoughtful facial expressions) that everything Busch does or says is funny. Ambrose tries a bit too hard as Chicklet, but she's quite hilarious when she becomes possessed by the Ann Bowman persona (don't be surprised if afterwards you start reciting some of Ann's better, and more arch, bon mots: "Bad boys need to be spanked... bad boys need to be TORtured!"). And there's a great frug-off at the beach in the inevitable luau (between the B-starlet Bettina Barnes and Florence's romantic rival Marvel Ann) that is alone worth the price of the video.
