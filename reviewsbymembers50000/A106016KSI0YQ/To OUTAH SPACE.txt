 The creepy yet memorable poster the studio released for DEAD RINGER of Bette Davis partially superimposed over a skull suggests its a horror film, but its really a kind of recap of 40s women's pictures with a few highly memorable Gothic elements in it. Davis was offered this role after the success of WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE?, but it's much tamer than either that film or Davis's other entry into the Grandes Dames Guignol sweepstakes, HUSH... HUSH, SWEET CHARLOTTE, and offers her more chances for more subtle acting moments. As in her 40s film for Warner's A STOLEN LIFE, Davis plays twin sisters, one of whom substitutes for the other when the richer twin is suddenly killed; in this instance, the down-at-heels Edie actually murders her wealthy sister Margaret so as to take her place.  The film is satisfyingly silly with wonderful camp elements: Edie intentionally grabbing a redhot poker so as not to be given away by her signature the next day at her lawyer's office; Edie wrestling with Margaret's corpse to take off her clothes and change her hairstyle; Edie loudly pretending to sing "Shuffle Off to Buffalo" with her dead sister when detective Karl malden is on her staircase; etc. These are the moments Charles Busch gets to celebrate hilariously in this DVD commentary (although he is disastrously paired with Bose Hadleigh who bores the audience blind with his incessant facts about every minor actor in the movie; Buschs hould have been allowed to do the commentary himself). One of the most interesting things about the film is that Margaret de Lorca moves in the circles of Los Angeles "Old California" moneyed society, a milieu rarely explored on film: thuis we get the pleasures of seeing Mildred Natwick (of all people) done up in a mantilla as "Dona Anna," the doyenne of this society. And Davis really does have some fine redemptive moments where she really gets the chance to show she's a fine actress, even when she's being manhandled by a elderly gigolo (Peter Lawford) or siccing her giant Great Dane on him.
