 Even aside from her once-perfect voice, Julie Andrews has an amazing dry comic gift that is maybe akin to genius, and it never got a better showcase than in THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE. If you don't get it, you don't get it, but there are indeed many, many people who cannot even think of her facial expressions when she turns to the camera in this Twenties spoof just before her thoughts are flashed onscreen in intertitles without becoming helpless with laughter, and I confess to be one of them. This is the fullest chance she ever got to strut her comic stuff (especially when she decides to become "positively FATAL!"). There are many problems in this George Roy Hill spoof: its overlength, its bizarre plot excursions ( Julie at one point announces she has to sing "Trinkt Le Chaim" at a Jewish wedding which she does for no possible reason other than no one previous ever possibly IMAGINED what this song would sound like sung by her), and Carol Channing does overdo it as Muzzy (when she gets shot out of a cannon, you want to duck). But, it has one of the world's alltime best running sight gags (an elevator that works only if you dance in it), Mary Tyler Moore's peerless attempt to do the dance known as "the Tapioca," which practically stops the entire show, and finally Beatrice Lillie's famously hilarious performance as Mrs. Meers. Casting Lillie, the absolute unquestioned master of dry British comedy, against Julie Andrews was nothing short of inspired, and when Lillie attempts to figure out which of many cups of tea has a sleeping drug hidden in it the movie somes close to comic genius.
