 This well-remembered Gothic thriller has been re-filmed three times--once for TV in 1961 with Elizabeth Montgomery, once in 1975 with Jacqueline Bisset, and once again for TV in 2000 with Nicolette Sheridan--but the originals never quite captured the qualities of the original, which features Doroithy McGuire's best performance as a terrorized mute serving girl in a 1906 New England mansion. The script itself isn't much, and relies on very hoary melodramatic conventions that even seemed old in its day, and the script has its share of howlers (the famous last line, in particular).  What makes it memorable is McGuire's very affecting performance, Robert Siodmak's remarkably chilling direction, and most of all the great Warren mansion itself--one of the most beautifully elaborate sets ever constructed for a Gothic. At times your eyes have trouble taking the entirety of the house's richly inhuman decorations in, and the killer's ability to move in and around the house with ease seems perfectly logical. (Keep a watch out for the great early sequence with Dorothy McGuire watching herself in the mirror on the landiung of the house's other, main staircase--as the killer watches her watching herself.)
