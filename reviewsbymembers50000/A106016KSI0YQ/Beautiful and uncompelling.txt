 The passel of Oscars won by Rob Marshall's MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA testifies to the film's extraordinary visual beauty, but Marshall film adaptation has almost none of the comelling narrative drive of the much-beloved Arthur Golden novel from which it is based. The main character's inner life is almost entirely missing from this film version, and although you can understand Marshall's reasons for keeping the voiceover narration to a minimum he needed to compensate by divulging in some other way why Chiyo thinks what she thinks and does what she does. With the exception of the extraordinarily gifted Chinese actress Li Gong as the heroine's spiteful nemesis Hatsumomo, most of the major roles seem singularly miscast: the lovely Maggie Cheung seems too old to play Mameha, and Ziyi Zhang is pretty much a beautiful blank as Chiyo.
