 After the success of SHOW BOAT in 1988, it looked as if John McGlinn was going to record several of Kern's other, less familiar works: alas, this beautiful little recording of SITTING PRETTY was the only Kern "Princess Theatre" musical that came of it. But what's here is such a treat: a terrific cast (O'Hara, Blazer, Gaines, and Graae--not to mention Roberta Peters on the lovely "Days Gone By"), and several masterful little songs, including "Is This Not a Lovely Spot?" and the remarkably witty "You Alone Would Do."
