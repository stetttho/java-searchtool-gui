 Don Thompson's and Dick Lupoff's' 1973 THE COMIC-BOOK BOOK is even finer than the book that precedes this, the 1970 ALL IN COLOR FOR A DIME. I used to love reading this when I was a child, wishing I could somehow get my hands on reprints of the 1940s comics stories so lovingly retold here (many of which were long out of print when I read this), especially in Maggie Thompson's fine essay on "The Spirit." Now that those old "Spirit" stories have been reproduced by DC, it's fun to go back and read these essays again, and the fascinating background information about the comics creators. the highlight of the whole book is Juanita Coulson's hilarious take on Golden Age superheroines, "Of (Super) Human Bondage": her detailing of the absurdities in an old Wonder Woman story (WW vs. Giganta the Gorilla Girl) are uproarious as well as very forward thinking.
