 One reason old DC fans love Mark Waid so much is because of his real attention and devoted care for the company's old Silver Age icons, like the Hal Jordan Green lantern and the Barry Allen Flash. Both characters were killed off by the company years ago in favor of hipper new versions, but Waid shows what a mistake this was by showing enormous depths behind this old pair of Justice Leaguers. The cocky, skirtchasing Hal Jordan and the staid, reliable Barry Allen always seemed like the most unlikeliest of pairings, but Waid gives a plausible account for how two such dissimilar men could actually become the best of friends. The best story, by far, is the last, which analyzes the differences between Barry's utter devotion to his dead wife Iris and Hal's neurotic ongoing longtime relationship with his troubled boss Carol Ferris; it builds beautifully off of years of characterization and plotting by former FLASH and GREEN LANTERN scripters (in particular Cary bates and Steve Engelhart), and offers the return of one of most greatly missed Silver Age DC villains, Star Sapphire.
