 TRICK concerns a young, sexually inexperienced Broadway composer who gets picked up on the subway by an incredibly hardbodied stripper; the two find it impossible to find a place to have sex, and, waylaid by drunken ex-boyfriends, insensitive roommates, vengeful drag queens, and Tori Spelling, they make their way around Manhattan and find their hope of a quick sexual encounter has blossmed into something else. This film isn't really very much: really just an extremely romantic fantasy about landing the go-go muscleboy with the heart of gold. Tori Spelling is pretty funny playing basically herself (if she hadn't been born into one of the richest families in Hollywood), but Christian Campbell is fairly negligible as the lead, and the whole thing is too contrived to work very well. JP Pitoc is asked to carry off the impossible role of the muscleboy who's both a player and looking for true love at the same time: somehow, incredibly, he more than pulls it off, and is very winning and sexy at the same time. It's been a great surprise he's not been seen much more since this film was released: he's as much a find for audiences as his character is for the composer.
