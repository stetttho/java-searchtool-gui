 While its potentially very interesting to see what the Paper of Record thought about the great films of the last seventy-five years, it's in reality often not very useful, since Bosley Crowther, the main Times reviewer for decades, was the most middlebrow of reviewers. He seemed baffled or unaffected by most of the films later scholars and even the better contemporary critics (like Sarris or Kael) have found important. His successor, Vincent Canby, was better, but again had very predictable enthusiasms (including his notorious fondness for Woody Allen, whom he seemed to believe could do no wrong). Only Canby's successor Janet Maslin seems a reviewer whose writings are worth collecting, and her takes on films of the Eighties and Nineties are what makes this collection in the end worth owning.
