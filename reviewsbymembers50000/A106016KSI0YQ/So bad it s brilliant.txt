 AIRPORT 75 must have the least believable premise of any major Hollywood release that wasn't straight science fiction: a small private plane crashes into the cockpit of a giant 747 en route to Salt Lake City, and all the flight crew members are either killed outright or incapacitated as a result. So a stewardess (Karen Black, as bewitchingly crosseyed as ever) has to come into the remains of the damaged cockpit (which, despite the fact that it has a giant gaping hole in it, still manages to retain Black within it and do little more to her then make her chilly) and steer the plane to Salt Lake until Charlton Heston can be dropped by helicopter into the hole in the cockpit. The premise was so outrageous even at the time that it quickly spawned two exceptionally memorable parodies: "Disaster 75" on THE CAROL BURNETT SHOW and AIRPLANE! (for which it was one of the primary sources of inspiration). But the original itself is so jawdroppingly strange it remains almsot beyond parody. The passengers are played by a series of Borscht Belt comedians like Sid Caesar and Jerry Stiller and Norman Fell, with the notable exceptions of a singing nun (Helen Reddy), a young girl with serious health problems (Linda Blair), and, most memorably, Gloria Swanson (as herself). The other stewardesses keep wandering in to the damaged cockpit to be comforted by Karen Black, who one would think has enough problems as it is. Even if you can get beyond these thing, you find yourself fascinated by the questions the film's astonishingly bizarre details propose, such as why the airline's logo is so ugly and why its color scheme (bright red with violet and fuchsia accents!) is so hideous.
