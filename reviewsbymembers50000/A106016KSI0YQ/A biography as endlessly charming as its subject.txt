 NYRB has done it again, in bringing forth a new edition of an early twentieth-century gem that needed to be reissued. Nancy Mitford's biography of Madame de Pompadour shimmers and sparkles with exquisite prose and a thorough handling of the facts; I couldn't put this down until I had read right through it from beginning to end. Mitford's style is very fluid and sophisticated: she can describe the endless diplomatic minutiae of the wrnagings during the Seven Years' War as impressively as she can detail the beautiful interiors of the Marquise's houses. Clearly she has mastered the style of Tacitean biography-as-history championed by Lytton Strachey decades earlier, although this fact seems lost on the writer of the edition's introduction, Amanda Foreman, who seems to be of the inaccurate conviction that Mitford was doing something entirely new. Indeed, the uninformedness of Foreman's preface and the edition's unfortunate lack of the illustrations that graced early versions of this biography are all that keep me from granting this a full five stars; it is nevertheless highly worth your while.
