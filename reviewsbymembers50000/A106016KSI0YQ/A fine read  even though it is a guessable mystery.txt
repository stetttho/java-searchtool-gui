 There are many writers as prolific as Ruth Rendell/Barbara Vine, but how many have such a superior record of pleasing their readers every time out of the gate? Once again, this is a superior psychological study by Vine--this time into the arcana of the House of Lords and the peerage. The narrator, who witnesses the dismanlting of the House of Lords for all effects and purposes in 1999, simultaneously conducts biographical research into the life of his great-grandfather, a personal physician to Queen Victoria who was knighted for his care of her son Leopold's ultimately deadly haemophilia, and who seems to have been surrounded throughout his lifetime by an exceptionally high mortality rate among his family members. Most readers will guess the answer to the mystery surrounding the first Lord Nanther, but the pleasure of the book is more in its unusual atmosphere, its intriguing structure (reminiscent of Ackerley's famous memoir MY FATHER AND MYSELF), and its intriguing narrator, who starts out somewhat blandly but by the end of the book emerges as a complex character: a kindhearted liberal who harbors some prejudices and neuroses of his own.
