 Jackson Pollock created astonishing beautiful paintings that made him world-renowned as America's foremost painter during his lifetime (a rare honor for a living artist). He was also something of a disaster of a human being: alcoholic, violent, verbally abusive, and explosive. Ed Harris's film does a superior job getting both sides of the artist down, particularly after one of his most horrendous displays of alcoholic temper during a Thanksgiving dinner party, when afterwards Harris pans slowly through Pollock's most magnificent paintings on display at that time in the Betty Parsons Gallery. Harris wanted to play Pollock for years, and he is ideally cast: he looks just like the artist (and his superfit sexiness helps explain why so many people were so attracted to Pollock), and he has the acting chops to pull off Pollock's temper tantrums convincingly. The film doesn't much to explain why Pollock was so crazed, and the scenes with his brother Sandy and his mother (Sada Thompson, utterly wasted) don't come off--you see only that Harris is trying to tell you that something about them was important to Pollock but not what that might be. And the script doesn;t shape the events of Pollock's life to any extent--it ends with his notorious death, when he drove himself, his mistress, and a young woman off the road in a drunken stupor. (Only his mistress survived.) The beautiful Marcia Gay Harden is cast wildly against type as (physically dowdy, but spiritually luminous) Lee Krasner, and deservedly won an oscar for her moving portrayal of a woman who was a superb artist in her own right but sacrificed everything to futher her husband's career
