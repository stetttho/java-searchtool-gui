 As beautiful as they are, even DIDO AND AENEAS and Britten's own BILLY BUDD are just not up to the level of this, Britten's first "major" opera. The theme of an individual hounded by the community is timeless, but the possibility of Grimes's homosexuality makes the opera especially timely for the twentieth century. And have there ever been such beautiful and appropriate interludes, or as sophisticated muscial characterization in ANY national operatic tradition? The great gossip scene in Act II is a case in point: ever striking Ellen, Grimes cries out the phrase, "And may God have mercy upon me" and exits, as his phrase is taken up in a round through the different sections of the orchestra, mirroring the way the gossip is about to spread. Then the other characters exit their houses to address Ellen and one another, each using the same musical phrase as Grimes's, but using it severally to express eloquently all manner of things. First we hear it as frightened chiding at Ellen's indulgent behavior towards Peter, then as a sarcastic commentary on the town's likely propensity to gossip, then (finally) as the gossip itself about the attack, which gathers greater and greater momentum until the townspeople are almost hysterical with indignation. On the only other major recording of this opera (with Jon Vickers in the title role), this stunning sequence is bizarrely interrupted between CDs; although this set is considerably more expensive, its more proper distribution among CDs makes it infinitely preferable. Also, although the other set has a superbly romantic Grimes in Vickers, the role nonetheless was specifically written for Peter Pears, who sings here with great purity of tone. This is a famous historic recording: no 20th-century opera buff's collection is complete without it.
