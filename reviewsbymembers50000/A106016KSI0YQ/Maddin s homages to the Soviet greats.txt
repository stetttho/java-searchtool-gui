 Almost all of Guy Maddin's films in some way or another are salutes to the great experimenters of the European silent and early sound cinema: these two films, the full-length ARCHANGEL and the six-minute short THE HEART OF THE WORLD, are Maddin's salute to the great Soviet filmmakers of the Twenties, and have been eagerly anticipated by Maddin's cultish following. ARCHANGEL takes place in the Russian city of the same name in 1919, where (according to Maddin's scenario) the Great War has been continuing even while it has been over elsewhere for years. Warding off not only "the Hun" but crazed Bolsheviks, the inhabitants of Archangel all must go to the front to protect their homeland. The plot involves obsessive love among a group of amnesiacs in the besieged city, and prominently features Maddin's handsome and very funny favorite feature actor, Kyle McCullogh. maddin is perhaps too enemored of narrative for his own good, in that there are plot strands like crazy weaving back and forth, but the film is still very funny, even if not up to the standards of his next full-length work CAREFUL. (His funniest running gag is that many of the inhabitants of Archangel are dressed exactly like the medieval nuns, metroploitans, and empresses in Eisenstein's IVAN THE TERRIBLE--even when they're fighting at the front.) This video gets the full five stars, though, for its inclusion of THE HEART OF THE WORLD, probably Maddin's masterpeice to date. This award-winning silent short, commissioned for the 25th anniversary of the Toronto Film Festival, directly parodies Soviet propagandistic experiemental film, and may be six of the funniest minutes ever captured on celluloid. The entire thing is so berserkly paced (in homage to Eisentstein's "lightning mixes") that you  have to go back to replay it because you laugh so hard you miss key moments as they shoot by you at an insane clip.
