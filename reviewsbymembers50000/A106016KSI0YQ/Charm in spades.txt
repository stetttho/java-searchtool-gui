 Was there ever a composer more perfectly suited for an opera? Massenet may be the most eager of all opera composers to charm, and if ever there were an opera about the pleasures (and pitfalls) of charm, it is MANON. Melody after melody tumbles out of this work without end--it is one of the most likeable and hummable operas in the repertoire, and deserves the wonderful job of conducting it is given here on this fine EMI recording. The opening scene is given all the shimmering color it deserves, while the more poignant scenes (the famous sequence at Saint-Sulpice and the closing act) are given their melancholy due. Georghiu is an impressive--and highly distinctive--Manon. The role is often associated with Beverly Sills because of the highly successful way Sills merged her earthy vivacity with Manon's (even her recording of the role--less successful than most of her stage performances--captures this bouncy coquetry). Here, Georghiu gives a very different take, making Manon much more delicate and gentle than is usual. She displays her incredibly exquisite pianissimo to fine effect both in "Adieu, notre petite table" (where it would be expected) and in her introductory arrival aria (where it is not). It is hard imagining this approach working well on stage, where Manon is required to be the prime mover of most of the opera's action (one would think Georghiu might seem lost in the shuffle), but it is a very effective and distinctive approach on CD, and allows her to compete well with Victoria de los Angeles as a top recorded Manon. Alagna is quite good as Des Grieux, though perhaps less memorable than his wife (albeit they are equally sweet on the lovely first-act duet "Nous vivrons a Paris"). A fine recording.
