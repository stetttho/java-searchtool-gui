 Massenet's Herodiade has been enjoying a comeback in recent years. The opera is a bit stagey, even for Massenet, in that its his first work which truly exploits his grand obsession with unrequited desire, and how it can be expressed either as secular passion or sublimated as voluptuous eroticism; in this work (unlike in his later "Thas," where he finally figured out how to work things out more successfully in terms of dramatics) most of the great love arias are sung to someone who is entirely absent offstage, which makes for a kind of strange opera. But the music is spectacular--as beautiful as anything he ever wrote. His great aria for Salom, "Il est bon, il est doux," has made a spectacular showcase for the talents of lyric sopranos such as Kiri Te Kanawa; although Rene Fleming was born to play the role of Salom, and generally acquits herself very well, her rendition of "Il est bon" doesn't quite have the vocal control one would have hoped from her. (Nonetheless, she brings it off.) Placido Domingo and Dolora Zajick are predictably perfect as Jean le Baptiste and Herodiade, even though their characters don't have the best music in the opera; the character who besides Salom does, Herod, is played adequately but not thrillingly by Juan Pons (he doesn't seem to bring much heat to the role). The recording is live from the San Francisco Opera, and does seem to suffer from this: some of the instrumental performances seem to waver a bit, and the sound of feet running is a big distraction during the Babylonian Dance and other scenes.
