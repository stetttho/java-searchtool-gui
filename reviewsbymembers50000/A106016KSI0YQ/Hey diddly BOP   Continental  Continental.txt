 John Waters purists may argue that HAIRSPRAY, his great crossover hit, is nowhere near as lowdown dirty and outrageously sidesplitting as his earlier guerilla films, but there's no denying that this is his smoothest piece of work, with by far the best performances. Everyone by this point knows that the film concerns the attempts of Tracy Turnblad, "an upper lower-class" overweight white girl from inner-city 1962 Baltimore, to get onto a popular local television dance show and then to integrate it successfully. The entire cast (even the supporting throwaway parts: catch the facial expressions of Amber's friends when she's dissing Tracy in class)  is just about perfect, and is led by three magnificent teenage performances: Ricki Lake as the supremely confident Tracy; Divine, as her charmingly pushing mother; and the scene-stealer Colleen Fitzpatrick as Tracy's rival, the abominable blonde Amber. One thing that really helps the film is the superb soundtrack from the early 60s, which keeps things hopping, and the marvelous dancing (particularly on the part of Lake and Fitzpatrick) to accompany it. The DVD version is really a treat, offering one of the finest and funniest director's commentators ever from John Waters: it's amazing to hear how much background was behind the film, which chronicles his real-life obsession with a similar Baltimore early 60's dance show. There are also some comments from Lake, who unsurprisingly reveals what a diva she really is (she's STILL upset with Waters for making her dye her hair for the film!). But the Waters's comments are laugh-out-loud funny, and there are far more of them than Lake's, which is a blessing.
