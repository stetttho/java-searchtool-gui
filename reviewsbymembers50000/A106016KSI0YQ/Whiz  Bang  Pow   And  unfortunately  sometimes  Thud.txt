 The idea behind KAVALIER AND CLAY is so irresistible that it's hard not to like the book even before you've opened: two young men in New York--one a native, the other a Czech emigr--set out to create the greatest superhero comics ever created against the backdrop of the so-called Golden Age of Comics during World War II. Michael Chabon has reaped his highest praise for this sprawling novel, which might fall under the category of what Henry James would call a "loose baggy monster": the action ranges from suburban Long Island to occupied Prague to Antacrtica, and the list of guest stars includes everyone from Salvador Dali to Eleanor Roosevelt. Chabon's recapturing of the optimism just before the Second World War begins is extremely winning, and the novel is well-researched in terms of its period detail. His decision to make the broadness and romanticism of the characters mirror that of comic characters was not made lightly, but unfortunately it doesn't work out very well: the heroine, Rosa Saks, remains something of an erotic enigma during the war years (she's all kind heart and great sex, but not much else), and the Czech protagonist, Joe Kavalier, is at times embarrassingly sentimentalized. Although Joe's childhood exploits in Prague are quite interesting, his refugee status is often manipulated to earn him special martyr status, and there's something about the Holocaust being used to give a hero a sympathetic backdrop that seems really misguided, to the point of being offensive. After a bizarre episode in Antarctica that seems to belong to another book, the novel mysteriously rights itself: the last sections, which detail the characters' exploits during the early Fifties, when the comics industry comes under attack by the US Congress and child psychologist Frederic Wertham, adds the characters levels of depth and humility they were missing earlier in the work: Rosa becomes fleshed out as a person, and Joe seems every bit as ridiculous as he is romantic.
