 That about sums up the basic plot to Seth's AN EQUAL MUSIC, and if it  sounds like the description of a Forties Ingrid Bergman movie, well, that's  right on the mark. Indeed, you might even follow that up with, "But  she was carrying... A SECRET!" The initial plotline of the novel is  almost hopelessly hokey, and unfortunately allows Seth to indulge in some  rather moony scenes of the hero wallowing in his disappointed love. You  should be warned that the hero and heroine eventually voyage (almost  inescapably) to romantic locales like Vienna and Venice where they can  swoon in the cities's glamor and romance while indulging in their guilty  relationship. But Seth is much too smart to let this hold him back too  seriously. The story is actually more interesting than the M-G-M hokum  might allow you to suppose: there's quite a great deal of interesting  information about what it is like to work in a string quartet, how  musicians prepare to perform, how a fugue is structured, etc. Best of all,  Seth veers from the expected by the end of the novel as the narrator's  despair sends him towards madness, allowing for some of the most  unexpectedly adventurous writing Seth has ever set to paper. (Clearly, this  looks to be a transitional novel for Seth as he moves away from his more  crowd-pleasing mode of A SUITABLE BOY.) Seth is a writer who is never  afraid to be charming, and he usually succeeds at this (although you should  be warned that he does fall into extreme preciousness at times,  particularly when disucssing the spell music casts upon him and his  characters--the concluding "Author's Note" is almost unreadable).  Although this novel isn't nearly as enjoyable or satisfying as A SUITABLE  BOY, it's evidence that Seth is at least trying new things, and perhaps  moving towards a more mature phase in his fiction writing.
