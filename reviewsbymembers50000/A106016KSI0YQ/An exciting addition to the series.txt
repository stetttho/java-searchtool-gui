 This is probably the most genuinely exciting addition to Pullman's series, with a thrilling knife fight in a tower and a great new addition to the cast of characters in the sorrowful young English boy Will. Pullman's canvas seems to get a bit too broad at times (you feel he has some difficulty keeping track of the many subplots he's set in motion--a deficiency which will haunt his thrid installment, THE AMBER SPYGLASS), but this is still a rousing read in the tradition of C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien and even Robert Louis Stevenson.
