 Made in a period when most horror films were of the slasher and blood-and-guts variety, THE CHANGELING dramatizes that the best scares come from unsettling understatement rather than from easy gory shocks. George C. Scott stars as a wealthy composer whose wife and daughter have died in a sudden horrifying incident; he moves from New York to a large abandoned historic mansion in Seattle to work and recuperate from his losses. As time passes, he becomes aware of a presence within the house that seems to settle in a hidden attic room. While not quite in the highest echelon of haunted house films (such as THE HAUNTING and THE INNOCENTS) due to a needless Watergate-inspired conspiracy subplot and the silly De Palmaesque sequence relating the deaths Scott's wife and daughter near the beginning of the film, THE CHANGELING is certainly close to that high level. There are several classically creepy sequences, including the playback sequence, the dripping water sequence, and the scene of the young girl and the vision under her bedroom, that showcase what magnificent film editing (and sound editing) can do. The very best of these is the famous seance, probably the best ever filmed: the quickening tempo of the editing, the medium's creepy lack of affect as she intones her questions to the dead child, and the eerie sounds of her automatic writing scratching against the page (punctuated by her husband's one-word readings of the messages the child leaves) leaves a very haunting effect after the film is over. An interesting sidenote: clearly Stephen King borrowed heavily for this film for his 2002 miniseries ROSE RED, which lifts many details (the aforementioned automatic writing sequence, the Seattle setting for the haunted house, and the visual imagery of the tower room and the staircase leading up to it) wholesale from THE CHANGELING.
