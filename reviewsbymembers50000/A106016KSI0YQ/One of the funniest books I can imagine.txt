 Here are Marlene Dietrich's thoughts.  All of them. And in no particular order other than alphabetical.  You won't wonder for one second whether or not she had a ghostwriter, because what ghostwriter could ever have dreamed up something as bizarre as this collection of non sequiturs? Her thoughts range not only from "Astaire, Fred" ("Elegant! Elegant! Elegant!") to "Zabaglione" (one of the many, MANY recipes she provides which consists--like most of her recipes--of sugar, egg yolks, and cream, in varying proportions) but also her thoughts on the Beatles, preparing meat, and other topics of mindboggling importance. After reading this book, you'll never again be able to look at eggs without thinking of La Dietrich's mysterious comment about them: "I love them! I eat them!"
