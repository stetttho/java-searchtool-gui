 I couldn't recommend anyone away from MAGNOLIA simply because it's worth seeing John C. Reilly's superb performance as a messed-up cop and William H. Macy's equally fine performance as a former child genius. There's other strong work from some other actors as well, but Anderson just isn't able to pull the whole thing off. It's too loose and disconnected: there are many things in it that might've seemed intelligent on paper or in discussion with his friends (the lipsynching of a song by several of the characters all at once, the inexplicable miracle at the film's close), but in practice they just lie there flat on the screen, seemingly unrelated to anything else. You keep awiting for a kind of magic to take over and animate the whole (as it does in Altman's NASHVILLE, Anderson's clear model, or even as it does in Anderson's previous movie, BOOGIE NIGHTS), but it just seems a mess at the end.
