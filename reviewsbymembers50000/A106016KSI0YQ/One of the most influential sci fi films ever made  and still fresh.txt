 It's astonishing to see this film and see how enormously it influenced the generation of major filmmakers of the 70s and 80s, such as Spielberg, Lucas, Ridley Scott, and Cameron; it's also amazing to see how despite its influence it still remains genuinely gripping and fresh. Many plot pieces are there that would be used again and again in later sci-fi films (and some, like the concentration of space during a deadly storm, are in turn borrowed from "old dark house" movies of decades past). There's the army involving themselves in the work of a group of scientists; the deadly menace uncovered that threatens to kill them all; the head scientist who coldly demands that the needs of "science" outweigh the threat to their lives; the annoying reporter who is desperate to get the scoop of the century; the head military commander who must disobey orders from his unseen superiors. But what a difference in this film! Here the military men are individuated rather than a homogenous mass, and they genuinely respect the head scientists (and, what is more, respect and like the fast-talking reporter!). The military commander is softspoken and thoughtful; his refusal to obey his superiors' orders is not done arrogantly but quietly, because he knows he is responsible for lives at the Arctic base. And the alien monster, though a genuinely terrifying threat, is seen (in the rare glimpses we see of it) either always in pain or enraged; despite its undoubted threat to all the humans' lives, you can't help feeling sorry for it, rather like with Frankenstein's monster. Even over fifty years after it was made this film remains absorbing, exciting, and honestly scary. It also has a superbly eerie Dimitri Tiomkin score that makes stunning use of the theramin.
