 Many of the classic campy films starring maneating divas are actually quite good, when you think about it: for all the excesses of THE WOMEN or ALL ABOUT EVE, the creators of those films knew exactly what they were doing. With VALLEY OF THE DOLLS, you just keep staring at the screen, wondering, "What were they thinking?" Was the makeup commercial montage showing Barbara Parkins's rise to fame as the Gillian Girl (at one point , she seems to be spraying her hair with a Brancusi sculpture) really supposed to seem arty and sophisticated? Did any of the movie exceutives really think Patty Duke was supposed to be electrifying during her song "It's Impossible," with its incomprehensible lyrics and loopy rhythms? Why didn't the director straighten out the necklace that hangs lopsided over her left breast during that number? And what the heck kind of Broadway show is Helen Lawson supposed to be starring in (before madly enthusiastic audiences!) where she sings "I'll Grow My Own Tree" ("It's my yard!/So I will try hard!") while a dangerously oversized Calderesque mobile spins over her head like a gigantic Sword of Damocles? As funny as these moments are (and I haven't yet even mentioned Patty Duke's splitscreen exercise routine), the movie does drag on and on, especially during poor Sharon Tate's scenes struggling with Huntington's chorea. Still, after you've seen it through once, fast-forward it and savor all the treats. And don't take dolls--even if you're expected to get up at five a.m. and SPARKLE, NEELY, SPARKLE!!!
