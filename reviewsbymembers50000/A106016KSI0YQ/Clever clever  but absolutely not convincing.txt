 In the notes for this extremely speculative biography of Shakespeare, Stephen Greenblatt lists as one of his primary inspirations the "Scylla and Charbydis" chapter of ULYSSES wherein the precocious Stephen Dedalus spins a dazzling theory of Shakespeare's plays reflecting the basic source material of his autobiography. But Greenblatt does not include the fact that when Stephen Dedalus is finally asked by an auditor whether he believes in his own theory, he responds, "No." Like Dedalus, Greenblatt weaves a tremendously clever web of suppositions about Shaeskeapre's life based on the author's work, but whereas Stephen Dedalus (and his creator Joyce) were intelligent and honest enough to admit such work in the end amounts ultimately only to a game of suppositions, Greenblatt seems to take his own speculations so seriously that they become treated via his own rhetorical force as factitious.   A classic example is Greenblatt's elaborate theory that Shakespeare's treatment of both Jews and anti-Semitism in THE MERCHANT OF VENICE stems from the ridicule Queen Elizabeth's personal physician, Dr. Lopez (a coverted Portuguese Jew), received from the crowd of Londoners when he was on the scaffold for treason. First Greenblatt frankly admits that whether Shakespeare was there on that day or not is mere speculation, but then he refers again and again to how the laughter Shakespeare heard at one moment before Lopez's execution must absolutely have been a seminal moment in the playwright's intellectual career--even though he has not established any evidence whatsoever that Shakespeare was present or that he even heard news of this laughter reported elsewhere! The biography becomes little more than a fancy series of suppositions that takes itself far too seriously; fortunately, the unconvicing biographical speculation is at least balanced by a thorough understanding of the era, by sensitive readings of the plays (though some plays such as CYMBELINE are not even mentioned), and by Greenblatt's extremely readable style.
