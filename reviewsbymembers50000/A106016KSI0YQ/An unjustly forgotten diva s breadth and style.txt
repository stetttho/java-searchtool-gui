 Bidu Sayao is probably best-known today for the famous recording of the Hector Villa-Lobos piece that opens this disc--which is a tragedy, since this piece (though exquisite) shows only one side of her vocal artistry. Although her performance on the Villa-Lobos is quite keening and melancholy, Bidu Sayao was best-known during the height of her career for her command of the French repertoire, which usually called for great charm and flirtatiousness . Indeed, on most of the beautiful arias from french operas she sings here she's asked to celebrate her beauty and her adorableness--and this was made all the easier because Sayao *was* beautiful and adorable. Moreover, she had exquisite phrasing and control, and was a superb interpreter of the coloratura repertoire. There may never have been a better Manon than Sayao, and she performs no less than four of the great arias massenet wrote for this role. In each one you can recognize the same character, and yet they display gorgeously the different moods Sayao could so subtly convey: from the silly giddiness of the arrival aria to the misplaced regret of "Voyons, Manon," to the touching pathos of "Adieu, notre petite table" and finally to the brilliant confidence of the famous Gavotte. Sayao had a relatively small voice, but it was often said of her that despite this one could easily hear her from the very back of the old Met, even during a chorus, so careful and unique was her phrasing and style. You can really hear this on this terrific cd.
