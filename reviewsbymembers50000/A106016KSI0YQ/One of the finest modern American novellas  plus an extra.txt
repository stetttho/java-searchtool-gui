 Elisabeth Sanxay Holding's THE BLANK WALL has twice been made into memorable movies: Max Ophuls' RECKLESS MOMENT, with Joan Bennett and James Mason in the post-War period, and THE DEEP END just a few years ago with Tilda Swinton. Expect a few more. This is one of the finest modern American novellas written, regardless of its pulp origins, and is thus simultaneously rich on any number of lveles while it remains breathlessly suspenseful. Lucia, a well-to-do mother raising her children by a lakeside in wartime while her husband fights overseas, finds herself (through her daughter's affair) covering up a manslaughter, then becomes entangled in blackmail and even murder. The novella is really an extended meditation on identity, gender, class , nationality and even race during the late modernist period, and brilliantly shifts back and forth within Lucia's consciousness from how she understands herself and how others see her. Her frantic attempt to keep the disparties in place is one of the most astonishing accomplishments of this narrative. THE BLANK WALL is so very fine that the added novella, THE INNOCENT MRS. DUFF, is just frosting on the cake. It isn't nearly at the level of Harding's masterpiece (the main character is too dislikable, and the plot he involves himself in is too farfetched), but it serves as a somewhat fascinating comparison point for other novels told from the point of view of a killer (such as THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY or MALICE AFORETHOUGHT).
