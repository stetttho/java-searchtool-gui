 We can only hope this is not Jan Morris's last book, as she has stated it will be; her intelligence and acumen make it too painful she has finished writing. Her study of Trieste--one of her most treasured--starts perhaps too slowly and cautiously: it gets a bit tedious hearing her repeat how seemingly unremarkable Trieste seems at first glance (it also might sway readers new to Trieste or to Morris's work away from them). but as she continues her evident love and fascination for this city on the Adriatic become more evident, and you begin to see why so many different writers besides Morris, including James Joyce, Italo Svevo, and John Berger, have found Trieste such a remarkable place. Morris recounts much of the city's intriuguing cultural history, and also gives a brief topographical sense of the place. You do miss accompanying photographs--greatly--but that's a small quibble.
