 This has been recommended by so many people who like the same sorts of ghost films I adore that my hopes for this were really high. It has a magnificent setting (most of it is set in an abandoned marshland mansion on the English coast, cut off from the mainland for most of the day by high tides), and the idea of the recurring ghostly figure of the woman in black--staring, hating, but never speaking--is pretty eerie. But the movie is very poorly done--you can tell it was filmed for television (the compositions seem underwhelming), and the scary quality of the mansion is never used to its full potential. In particular, the direction and screenplay adaptation are very poor: as many have noted below, we never find out fully many key details in the backstory, and the "rules" the film seems to establish about where and when the ghost may appear don't seem to be followed through to the end (yet even so, you can guess exactly what will happen). At other times information is doled out much too late: Adrian Rawlins, as Arthur, seems to be overdoing it quite early in the film when he sees the woman near the house, but later we find out that it wasn't overacting (as it seemed at the time), but rather that the apparition filmed him with an unreasonable and overwhelming sense of dread (which could have been conveyed more easily by a close-up or by a quick explanatory line before he goes to the house). I think this material could make a good film, but I also think this wasn't it.
