 Roland Emmerich should have been making movies with Irwin Allen in the Seventies, given his delight in providing different ways to visualize New York and LA getting it. Here Emmerich doesn't even try for the tongue-in-cheek levity that saved "Independence Day" and attempted to (but could not possibly redeem) "Godzilla"; everything is done with an absolutely straight face as the laws of physics and logic are broken repeatedly. The fact that he cast genuinely talented actors like Dennis Quaid, Sela Ward and jake Gyllenhaal to speak his wretched dialogue seems, paradoxically, actually to raise the camp factor considerably, as does the fact that this film is made with a genuine message. Global warming, we learn, is bad... spectacularly bad, of course. The resulting storms must naturally head for the world's two most important cities (according to Hollywood), New York and Los Angeles. We get to see various landmarks of these cities (like the Capitol Records building) obliterated, as if to prove that we are not in Kansas City or Milwaukee. The British royal family is also threatened, as if that were the only thing outside of the USA equivalent to the Hollywood sign or the Statue of Liberty. It's easy to scoff at Emmerich, but his films are not simply schlocky but also, fatally, incredibly visually unimaginative. Opportunities for at least some visual cleverness proliferate themselves throughout these films, and yet his expensive shots in this film of an oil tanker adrift along the flooded Fifth Avenue (for example) are not made to look to look beautiful or even remarkably absurd--just expensive.
