 Beverly Sills was perhaps one of the finest of all opera actress-singers: she continually evoked the memory of Mary Garden at her best, and had a truly amazing emotional range. This CD really shows at her best, before her voice was damaged in the early 70s, and also shows how much she could really do. No one could be quite so enchanting in the great soubrette roles (such as Baby Doe or Massenet's Manon) as Sills, and she gets to show off this charm to great effect in Philie's beautiful and triumphant aria from _Mignon_, a real showstopper. But at the same time Sills could break your heart if she wanted to, even in as florid a piece as the great mad scene aria from Thomas's _Hamlet_: though she displays dazzling coloratura effects, her increased intensity by the end shows that her Ophelie is poignantly aware she's really losing it. Sills was (and is) celebrated for her warm and generous personality, and that really shows here to gorgeous effect.
