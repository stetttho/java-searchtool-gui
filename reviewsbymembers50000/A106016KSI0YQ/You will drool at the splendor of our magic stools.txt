 The director/writer/actor Christopher Guest is entranced by the blessed state of cluelessness at the very margins of show business, and this film may be his masterpeice on the subject. WAITING FOR GUFFMAN, of course, is about the production of an original musical, "Red, White and Blaine," to celebrate the sesquicentennial of a tiny town in Missouri, "the stool capital of the world." The musical has been written and is being directed by a town outsider, Corky St. Clair (Guest in a favorite role he's played before under other circumstances), whom the townspeople just adore, and he has cast several of them in his little repertoire.  The great humor of the piece, of course, is in how self-deluded the Blaineites are about both Corky's and their own abilities, but the joke never seems either one-note nor cruel. Guest's genius is in allowing his characters to be silly without ever being truly pathetic: he allows them their dignity, even in the silly-great sequence where they audition for the musical. (Catherine O'Hara and Fred Willard, as "the Lunts of Blaine," are especially funny here in their characters' audition piece, a combination of a Taster's Choice commercial and "Midnight at the Oasis.") You wonder how Guest will top this sequence, but he does with the musical itself which is both hilarious goony and also somehow transcendent at the same time. You laugh at the completely blissed-out reaction of the Blaine city council members sitting in the audience (most memorably Michael Hitchcock), but you also identify with their joy at some level too. An added bonus on this DVD are several of the songs from "Red, White and Blaine" Guest felt compelled to cut, including the haunting and hysterically complicated "Nothing Ever Happens in Blaine" which had to be excised from the main version (so as not to condescend to the town) but which is wonderful to see nonetheless... if only for Catherine O'Hara's amazing way of dancing in high heels with her knees bend inwards.
