 The Maysles Brothers' famous 1975 documentary of a former society mother and her grown daughter (both former cousins of Jackie Onassis and both named Edie Beale) falling to pieces in their similarly-dilapidated East Hampton mansion has acquired a consider cult following over the years due to the Miss Havisham qualities of its subjects, who once both were great wealthy beauties and have fallen to bare subsistence living (and who both seem clearly mentally ill). The Maysles have been greatly criticized for showcasing these women as circus oddities, but as little Edie makes clear in a taperecorded interview included in this beautiful Criterion Collection edition, both women loved the chance to have the attention given to them (the film also made it possible for little Edie to follow her dream of moving to NYC to work, albeit briefly, as a cabaret star).  But it would also seem wrong simply to characterize the two women as free spirits doing their own thing and being fabulous, as many of the films' cultists are mistakenly wont to do: Grey Gardens at times seems a genuine hell for the women as well as for the viewer, who must endure the mother and daughter occasionally shrieking menacingly at one another over one another's words. And Little Edie seems like a lost fourth sister from Chekhov, bemoaning her lost charances at matrimony and escaping to the big city. But both women seem  intelligent despite their moments of mental confusion, and Little Edie's editorializing during a Dr. Norman Vincent Peale radio broadcast (one of the film's highlights) shows her sharpness as well as her wicked sense of humor. And it is precisely the discomfort that the film occasions--its refusal to sentimentalize these down-but-not-yet-out society survivors--that makes it seem so memroable, and such a comment on the American tendency to trash the past even while nostalgically clinging to its wreckage.
