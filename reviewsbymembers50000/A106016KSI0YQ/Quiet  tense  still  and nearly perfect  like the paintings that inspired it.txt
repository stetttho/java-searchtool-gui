 Rarely is a film adaptation  so vastly much better than the book that inspired it as is this one.  First-time director Peter Webber makes something of a visual feast out of Tracy Chevalier's extremely thin novel about the painting of one of the world's most beautiful Old Masters. Scarlett Johanssen is ideally cast as Griet, a young Protestant in seventeeth-century Delft who crosses to the Catholic side of the town (where women do not always cover their hair, as she must) to work as a maid in the house of Johannes Vermeer (Colin Firth). Within her workaday life Griet discovers the combustible tensions within the Vermeer household, ruled over by his vain and insecure spendthrift wife (Essie Davis) and her shrewd mother (the estimable Judy Parfitt), who must figure out how to market her son-in-law's painting so as to keep their burgeoning household going. Complicating matters even further is their spoiled daughter Cornelia (Alakina Mann, the otherworldly daughter from THE OTHERS), and the fact that both Vermeer and his patron (Tom Wilkinson) cannot  keep their eyes off of the gorgeous Griet. The film takes full advantage of its painterly subject, and each scene is staged and lit so exquisitely it seems to have been painted by Vermeer or his peers. Wisely, Webber and his screenwriter, Olivia Hetreed, keep the dialogue to an absolute minimum, allowing the actors to express what they cannot say to one another in the repressed Delft atnmosphere via looks and body language. Johanssen and Firth have never been better, although the real honors might go to Parfitt (in a marvelously complex performance). And Davis also acquits herself beautifully in her unsympathetic role of Catarina, and gets besides to deliver the film's most classic line when she finally unveils the title painting that has been kept hidden from her.
