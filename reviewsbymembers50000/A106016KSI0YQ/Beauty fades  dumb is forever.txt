 Thierry Pepin is a truly beautiful young man, with a great body and beautiful curly hair. This movie in which he stars is also beautifully shot and composed. Beauty, however, only takes you so far, and then you're faced with the utter stupidity of the screenplay of DANNY IN THE SKY. Danny is a young beauty, kept at arm's distance from his hunky repressed gay father and forever mourning his mother, a fabulous model and suicide. He suffers exquisitely, betrayed by his father, his girlfriend, and his handsome cousin, whose chances at winning a modelling competition away from Danny are scotched when Danny drugs his drink and puts him into a coma. Running away in horror at his own actions (this is the kind of movie where there are endless shots of the hero running away from something), Danny coveniently (and literally)  bumps into the stripper who is a former boyfriend of another love interest, and then... oh, who cares. You get to see lot of shots of Pepin shirtless (which is wonderful) and also even more stupidly unlikely coincidences before the movie is mercifully over almost before it began.
