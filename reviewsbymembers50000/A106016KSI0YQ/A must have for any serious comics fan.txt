 Miller's run on DAREDEVIL absolutely revolutionized the superhero comics medium: he initiated a whole series of darker, grittier stories that came eventually to dominate the medium in the late Eighties and early Nineties. But a look at his run on the series will tell you instantly why he was so influential: for a while, this was the most intelligent and sophisticated series being published by a major comics company. This first volume shows his initial work on the series, when he was pencilling (and then co-scripting) with Roger McKenzie as writer: this is not yet when the series hit its full height, with the series of stories involving the Kingpin and Elektra (that will be published in volume 2, presumably). This earlier stuff is absolutely fascinating for Miller's beginning ventures into what would become the hallmarks of his run on the title: the grim and violent storylines, the sophisticated depiction of a man's obsessions and his tortured emotional attachments to women (such as the Black Widow and Heather Glenn), and the absolutely beautiful expressionistic compositions. By the later stories in this volume--particularly the gorgeous pencisl for the Gladiator story--you'll see Miller at the peak of his pencilling maturity. This edition is printed on gorgeous paper stock, and is a great bargain. Highly, highly recommended.
