 There's something very comforting for some reason about watching pretty girls in lovely period costumes suffering in beautifully decorated English country houses, and here the girls are especially pretty and the costumes are especially lovely. The houses are also completely top of the line: Castle Howard in Yorkshire, the most dramatic house in England, is used for Longlands, the home of the Duke of Trevenick. But while visually this is a rare feast, dramatically "The Bucccaneers" is not quite all it should be. Edith Wharton started the unfinished novel on which it is based with an idea very much like her best social comedies: if wealthy nouveau riche American beauties could not make it into Old New York society, why not try to make it into the top of the British aristocracy by providing large dowries? Girls like Consuelo Vanderbilt and the wealthy Langhorne sisters of Virginia (on whom Wharton based her St. George sisters) did exactly that; but marrying into such position did not guarantee happiness. Nor in this miniseries, unfortunately, does it always provide much narrative excitement: the direction is not simply langurous but incredibly slowly-paced, and most of the acting is only passable, with a few striking exceptions (such as Jenny Agutter, who is very fine as the miserable mistress to Lord Seadown). But the miniseries also features at its end a terrific documentary on Edith Wharton, which raised my rating of it from three stars to four.
