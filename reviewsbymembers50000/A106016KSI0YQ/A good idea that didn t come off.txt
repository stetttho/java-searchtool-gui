 Charlie Kauffman decided to write a screenplay adaptation of Susan Orlean's THE ORCHID THIEF mostly about how impossible it was for him to write an adaptation of it, and while that sounds like it might have been a good idea it actually winds up not working out at all. It's all pretty much the sort of thing you expect from a college creative writing class when a student doesn't have any ideas for an assignment and instead writes about writer's block. Nicolas Cage works hard as Cage, but he's pretty unappealling in his sweatiness. All the movie really has going for it is Meryl Streep in a miraculous turn as Susan Orlean herself, a woman who yearns for transcendance in her daily professional life.
