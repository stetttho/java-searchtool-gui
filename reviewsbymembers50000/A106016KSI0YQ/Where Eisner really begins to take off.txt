 What's so astonishing about these stories is how variegated and simulatneously superb they were week after week after week--it's astonishing to think of Eisner generating not only such sophisticated and variegated material (almost no single story reads like any other--he changes the tone again and again and again, from sentimental to suspenseful to humorous to scary), but that he did so on a weekly basis. This collection shows him already at top form, and collects some of the most famous of all the SPIRIT stories, including "The Oldest Man in the World" (justly celebrated by Maggie Thompson in  ALL IN COLOR FOR A DIME) and "The Jewel of Death" (previously reprinted in Jules Feiffer's book on superhero comics). Anyone interested in comics at all should buy these just to study Eisner's incredible storytelling technique: in just a few pages every week he could shorehorn in an amazing amount of material. His stories often show astonishing sophistication in narrative compression, and his use of sophiticated layouts and angles seems not just to be informed by film noir but actually to predate its greatest advances. Look, too, at how deftly he delineates character: the Spirit, Ellen, Commissioner Dolan, Satin, and Ebony (who is really the star of the strip at this point) are shown to have complex and multilayered personalities, far ahead of anything done before Eisner (or, some would even say, since).
