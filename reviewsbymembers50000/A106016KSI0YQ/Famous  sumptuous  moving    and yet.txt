 For years and years and years there was no other recording of ROSENKAVALIER to compare with this one, and many people were introduced to the opera by dint of this recording (done originally in both mono and stereo). Indeed, it still it still makes many people's lists of the alltime greatest opera recordings period, and when you listen to the gorgeous conducting of von Karajan especially in the prelude you'll instantly hear why (there is still yet to be a better conductor for this opera than Karajan). Elizabeth Schwarzkopf's portrayal of the Marschallin is in and of itself equally praised, and yet here I think the kudos have been heaped over-high. Schwarzkopf is indeed very moving, and she's magnificent in the great Time aria and in the splendid closing trio, but her highly mannered responses to her lover often get on your nerves: there's a little too much cooing and gurgling going on. (Was perhaps her Marschallin influenced not a little by the public antics of the Gabor sisters at the time?) Christa Ludwig is in fine voice but never seemed the right choice to play Octavian (she's not nearly masculine enough). Teresa Stich-Randall is in glorious voice as Sophie: although she has often been faulted for lack of warmth here, her underplaying seems to counterbalance Schwarzkopf's coyness. The opera itself is almost irrresistible. Susan Sontag once infamously listed it as a defining work of camp, which should say more about Sontag's chilly aesthetic sense than it should about the opera itself, which is magnificent: ravishing melody piled upon ravishing melody. This is not the most challenging opera Richard Strauss wrote, nor even the most moving, but it certainly is the most beautiful. Idiosyncracies of performance notwithstanding, this is still a highly recommended recording--although prospective buyers might want to check out closely the Kiri Te Kanawa version as well before buying.
