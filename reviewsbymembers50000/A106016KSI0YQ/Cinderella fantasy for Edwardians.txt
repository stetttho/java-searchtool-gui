 No one understood the fantasies of late Victorian and early twentieth-century England better than Frances Hodgson Burnett. THE MAKING OF A MARCHIONESS (and its sequel collected in this volume, THE METHODS OF LADY WALDERHURST) spoke to the fantasies of many a schoolgirl in the very early twentieth century that anyone uncomplainingly slavish enough to the titled classes might be rewarded with a prince... or at least a marquis. What makes this novel so peculiarly perverse is that it is as if Burnett had just enough class consciousness to realize the inherent bizarrity of the class fantasies this book illuminates to exploit them for all their creepy masochistic potential. The heroine, Emily Fox-Seton, is distantly related to the aristocracy; though she can barely make ends meet, she is so delighted to be allowed to attend her social and economic betters in their fabulous garden estates that she doesn't mind being their devoted dogsbody. Ultimately she finds true happiness with the widowed Marquis of Waldenhurst, who is not handsome nor clever nor even terribly sensitive, but who is rich beyond the dreams of Croesus--which is apparently all that matters. What he and Emily will find to talk about after their marriage is given little thought, but apparently a ruby on an engagement ring "as big as a trouser-button" were all that Edwardian schoolgirls wanted in marriage, because this book was an enormous success in its day.
