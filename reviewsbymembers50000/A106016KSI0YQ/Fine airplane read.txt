 For what it is (basically an extremely erudite potboiler, somewhere between Umberto Eco and Carlus Ruiz de Zafon), Arturo Perez-Reverte's THE CLUB DUMAS is quite entertaining. It's a mystery involving a mercenary bookseller's attempts to find out the truth about a chapter of THE THREE MUSKETEERS written in Alexandre Dumas's original hand and also a legendary text of demonology in a series of European cities: Madrid, Sintra, Paris and Toledo. There are some truly cringeworthy "erotic" passages, and some highly florid similes that might have been penned by Mickey Spillane, and the narration by a secondary character seems pretty unconvincing and forced. But for the most part the mystery itself is a fun puzzle and many of its characters are fairly original. if anything, the book is best for pointing readers to the intelligent European potboilers of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries penned by Dumas, Hugo, Sabatini, and Christie, all of which are lovingly evoked (and which provide clues to the book's ending).
