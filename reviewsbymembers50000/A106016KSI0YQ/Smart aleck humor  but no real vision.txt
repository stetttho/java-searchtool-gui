 Even though he literally replaced Terrence rafferty as the film critic of THE NEW YORKER in the early 90s, Anthony Lane actually had much bigger shoes to fill: Pauline Kael's. The lesson learned from this collection of his writings: he's not Pauline Kael. Lane can be very funny when he's savaging a bad summer popcorn movie, but ripping things to shreds is about all he can do (and moreover he sets up his own jokes too easily--you can always see the punchline coming). And, unlike Kael, he doesn't really seem to stand for anything: you get no sense of his governing aesthetic in these reviews and pieces. When he likes a film (like "The English Patient") he goes too far overboard and his gushing seems embarrassing. Other transplanted Brits, I've noticed, tend to like Lane's snarky humor very much, and there's no question he can write well. But you just don't leave this collection feeling that movies (or for that matter, culture) deeply matter, as you do when you read the best film critics (like Kael or James Agee).
