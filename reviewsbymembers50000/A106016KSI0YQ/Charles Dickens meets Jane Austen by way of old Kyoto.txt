 Arthur Golden's MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA is that rarest of rare things: a genuinely intelligent and beautifully written novel that also managed to become for years a bestseller. His genius was to combine elements of Dickens's DAVID COPPERFIELD and Austen's MANSFIELD PARK and set his story in the fascinating world of geisha before and just after the Second World War. His heroine, Sayuri (Chiyo), is also neither like Dickens's David Copperfield or Austen's Fanny Price is that she is much more proactive and is at times even devious, but she shares their deprived upbringings and victimizations by childhood nemeses--and, like them, becomes recognized for her true worth as she matures. Golden also writes like a dream, and has done superb historical research for his work. Although it is true his heroine-narrator never seems to reflect long over her guilt in making other characters' lives miserable--or in the meanings for her nation of the wars it wages against China and other nations--, the novel is a beautiful and romantic read.
