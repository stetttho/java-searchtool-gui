 ATONEMENT isn't much like Ian McEwan's other works: less Gothic and panicked, the love tells in plush detailed prose of an incident in the mid-1930s at a British country house that forever changes the lives of young Briony, a daughter of the house, who witnesses the flirtings of her elder sister with a young schoolmate from a poor family. Briony misconstrues the flirting and lies about the young man's acftion--in doing so she effectively transforms the lives of herself, her sister and the young man forever. This might be the best book of McEwan's I've read: it seems in theme and atmosphere very similar to L. P. Hartley's THE GO-BETWEEN, but is actually much more effective than Hartley's famous study of hypocrisy and manipulation among the upper classes. It suffers a bit only in that we don't get to see the process of Briony sticking to her lie when the law becomes involved (we are rather simply told she does so). As a result, her crime doesn't seem quite as bad as it should. But this is a marvellously well-told, tight little narrative.
