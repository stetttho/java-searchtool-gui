 The actual abandoned Danvers State Hospital in Massachusetts is a fantastic Gothic revival pile of a building; it is mostrously oversized, larger than you'd think any such building would have a right to be, and makes an absolutely wonderful setting for this very sophisticated Gothic chiller. Four workers on a hazmat team have one week to remove the asbestos and other hazardous waste products from the abandoned state hospital, with its miles of ugly rotting corridors and empty rooms; by the end of the film there are fewer of the team than when we started. This is the standard set-up for a Gothic film (think THE SHINING, the orginal HAUNTING, the first ALIEN), but the unusualness of the hospital, the exceptionally fine performances, and the sophisticated script set this in nearly as high the same class as those aforementioned Gothic classics. The screenwriters give you so many fine red herrings that the ending works quite well. Peter Mullan gives a superb performance as the member of the hazmat team who most engages the audience's sympathies (though his Scots accent is at times a bit impenetrable). The cinematography is exceptionally and beautifully creepy.
