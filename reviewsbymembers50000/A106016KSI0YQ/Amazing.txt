 Even if you've just encountered her from the original soundtrack to "Flower Drum Song," you know that Pat Suzuki is something of a phenomenon: an enthusiastic and exciting singer with an incredibly powerful voice. But that's not all there is to Pat Suzuki. Richard Rodgers was notoriously extremely strict with his singers, and never wanted them to interpret his pieces for the Broadway performances other than as exactly he had written them. Suzuki, however, is an exceptional musical interpreter, and on this album (collected from her four albums released in the late Sixties) she does marvelous things with standards--even her signature song "I Enjoy Being a Girl," which here she interprets in ways Rodgers presumably would never have wanted her to do on the Broadway stage when she introduced it in his show. There's lots of marvelous stuff here, and one of the real delights is how Suzuki can take a song you know she could punch out through her Ethel Merman-sized voice (like "How High the Moon" or "Something's Gotta give") but instead takes it mellow and relaxed. Her way with a ballad is surprising, and the highlight of the whole album may be her lovely rendition of "Lazy Afternoon." Thank goodness this amazing woman has returned to singing in recent years!
