 Patrice Chereau decided to make a film of Alexandre Dumas's neglected LA REINE MARGOT, and decided to exploit the Eurotrash elementsof it to the hilt. There's sex, sex, sex; scheming royalty, employing such sinister weapons of assassination as poisoned lipcolor and a poisoned book; weakling kings; and Isabelle Adjani looking fabulous in the very latest in sixteenth-century designer gowns. No matter how much gore she gets on these dresses, her complexion still remains pretty much unsoiled--did the court poisoner give her come sort of miracle moisturizer to ward off blood stains? It's pretty ridiculous, what with the Massacre of the Huguenots staged largely for prime aesthetic appeal (dead bodies are obviously grouped together largely for compositional purposes), and Verna Lisi skulking around looking like a death's-head as Catherine de Medici. But it's nothing if not exciting, and, because Daniel Auteiul as Henri de Navarre isn't much of a love interest, Adjani is given a dashing Huguenot secret lover, played by none other than Vincent Perez, that Eurotrashiest of all actors. (He turns out to be framed for the poisoning of King Charles.) The embellishments of Chereau and Dumas have the added advantage of making the actual historical events seem every bit as unbelievable as the fictions. Much fun.
