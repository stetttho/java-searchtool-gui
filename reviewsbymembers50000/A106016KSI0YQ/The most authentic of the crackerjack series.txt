 Phillip Pullman is largely successful in this first homage to the sensation novels and gothics of the Victorian period in this gladly feminist novel for teenagers. All the elements you'd expect from Charlotte Bront, Wilkie Collins and Conan Doyle are there: a headstrong and independent young heroine, a cold and heartless guardian aunt, a mysterious jewel from India, East End skullduggery, and all manner of plots and counterplots. This is a good read, and Sally and her friends make for involving and even admirable characters. And thus I think the reviewer below who thinks this book inappropriate for teenagers is far off the mark .
