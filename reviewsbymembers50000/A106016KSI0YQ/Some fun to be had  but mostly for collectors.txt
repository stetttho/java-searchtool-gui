 If APPLAUSE hadn't starred Lauren Bacall, it's likely it would have sank without a trace. There's some wit in the lyrics, but all additions to the story are nothing to compete with the original Mankiewicz screenplay of ALL ABOUT EVE; the music isn't up to Charles Strouse's highest standards (as set by ANNIE and parts of BYE BYE BIRDIE), and he is not Broadway's first and foremost composer. Some of the songs are fairly derivative (the opening number sounds very much like the opening number for COMPANY, except less interesting) even downright awful: why do Len Carious and the others keep making that dreadful beeping sound during "Fasten Your Seatbelts"? Has anyone who has heard this soundtrack or seen the show ever found any pleasure in "She's No Longer a Gypsy"? Still, Bacall's performance is something to hear. She's a non-singer, but even so there's a kind of musical quality to her abilities that makes her renditions of the songs (particularly "But Alive")  very appealling and impressive. She's as memorable enough a Margo Channing to stand against Bette Davis, and that's saying quite a lot. Penny Fuller also acquits herself with great honor as Eve, although there seems to be little one can do about Len Carious's creepily bright tenor other than cringe (he was always much better cast in oddball parts, like Sweeney Todd or Buddy, than as a conventional romantic lead).
