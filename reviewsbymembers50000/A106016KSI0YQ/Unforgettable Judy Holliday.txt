 Supposedly Judy Holliday was terrified about performing in this (an enormous Broadway hit) because she believed she "couldn't sing"; yet, while her tone is not pure, she can put over a number with the best of them through her sheer joyful spirit and inestimable comic talent. Although the minor numbers performed by Eddie Foy, Jr. and Jean Stapleton are sometimes minor indeed, this show elicited several great Styne standards, including "Long Before I Met You," "Just in Time," and of course "The Party's Over", while the dazzling "Drop That Name" shows you just how good Comden and Green at their best can really be. But the show, in the end, is really Holliday's, and her great eleven-o'-clock number, "I'm Going Back," is certainly something to hear.
