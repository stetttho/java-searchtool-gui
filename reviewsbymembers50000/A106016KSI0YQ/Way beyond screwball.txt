 Pauline Kael thought this was the single funniest film comedy she had ever seen, and she may be right. The film's plot is so insane that it makes most screwball comedies of the period look tame by comparison: the country of Klopstockia (whose president is WC Fields, and whose citizenry is mostly descended from goats) decides to enter the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics, and sends its greatest athlete (Jack Oakie). The jokes are so insane and fast you can barely keep up--it's like getting a Marx brothers movie that's all Groucho with no tedious business from Harpo or Chico (and DUCK SOUP is the only film that seems indeed even remotely similar). Watch for the song jack Oakie is asked to sing--and what it's printed on!
