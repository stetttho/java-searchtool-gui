 Maxwell Anderson made a very successful, and highly acclaimed, little thriller for Broadway from William march's fictional study of hereditary evil. When Mervyn LeRoy adapted the stage play for Broadway, he obviously decided not to tamper with success, and did very little either to "open the play out" or to tone down the actors' stage performances for the screen (he used almost the exact same cast).  The result is a very very (unintentionally) hilarious film, where all the actors seem to have amped their performances up so high that all subtleties are lost. This is especially true of  Patty McCormack, who recreates her famous Broadway role as evil little Rhoda; as Rhoda, McCormack (who was too old for the role by the time they filmed it anyway) has only two modes--icky-sweet (for which she uses a gurgling "widdle" voice) and furious-evil (for which she drops her voice about four octaves). That it takes so long for people to see through her is almost beyond belief. Almost everyone else in the cast is equally outsized and equally dreadful: Henry Jones as the creepy handyman; Evelyn Varden as the irritatingly adoring neighbor; and  Eileen Heckart, the most memroably awful, as the drunken, griefstricken mother of one of Rhoda's little victims. The result is a highly enjoyable bad movie--it's quite a hoot. The one exception in the cast, though, is Nancy Kelly as Rhoda's mother (and the film's protagonist), Christine: although her eprformance is grandly outsized, like the others, Kelly is the only actor who seems to inhabit the role fully (she seems at times as if she's playing Greek tragedy). Perhaps the role of a mother who sums up her dilemma by crying, "She killed him, but she's my little girl and I love her," could only be well-served by such an extravagant performance. You may laugh when McCormack is onscreen with Jones or Heckart, but you don't when Kelly's onscreen--you feel instead some of the shock and the pathos the original novel evoked.
