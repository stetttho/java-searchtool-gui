 FIREFLY is one of the most fiercely loved cult television shows ever made, and it greatly deserves to be. In its abbreviated only season, it managed to produce such a memorably palpable universe and set of characters that it was eventually allowed to continue its story in a film version, SERENITY, that did not do as well as hoped in its theatrical release but that has enjoyed enough success on its DVD run that it has produced a whole new set of fans curious about the original show (myself included). Its central idea is elegantly simple: set in a future analogous to the Reconstruction after the American civil war, a group of renegades, led by a soldier on the rebellion's losing side, try to make ends meet by accepting dubious work smuggling goods (and even sometimes pulling heists) in a very corruptly run political system. The brooding romantic captain and his cohort form the nucleus of the band, with her jokester husband, a tough hired muscle, a sweet-tempered mechanic, a stiff doctor, his mysterious and emotionally disturbed younger sister, and an extremely ethical preacher forming the rest of the group. Oh, and of course in this homage to John Ford's STAGECOACH there is also a (state licensed) prostitute with a heart of gold, whose ongoing bantering love-hate relationship with the captain forms one of the highlights of the entire series (and seems surprisingly fresh).  The episodes are written more like miniature films than typical television hour-long shows, and there's usually a fine sense of atmosphere (moreover, the special effects are surprisingly sophisticated and convincing). The tone from episode to episode can shift dramatically, from very jokey episodes to very haunting or grim ones. The show's creator Joss Whedon is best known for his earlier series BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, but FIREFLY is surprisingly quite different in style and type from BUFFY, although it retains the very best things about that earlier (and more widely popular) series: the strong and original characters, the funny and unexpected banter, and most of all the emphasis on community and on heart.
