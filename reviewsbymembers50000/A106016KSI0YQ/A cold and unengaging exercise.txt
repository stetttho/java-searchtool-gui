 There are a surfeit of fine ideas behind Byatt's study of the problem of constructing biographical and historical narratives out of facts, and overall this novel makes intriguing points about what it means to tell a story basded on the truth, and the way this exposes the human need to impose order or sequence on that which might not adhere to any necessary shape. But this novel is about as cold-blooded and unexciting as can be imagined: the character Byatt pins the story upon, Phineas Nanson, remains largely an enigma until the end, and the novel's interest resides much more with academic halls-of-mirrors games than it does with fleshing out any of the other characters. (They all seem pretty stock: the earth-mother environmentalist, the pleasure-loving gay partners, the wise old professor, etc.) Nanson's task--writing a biography of an eminent biographer, Scholes Destry-Scholes--seems motivated for wholly unbelievable and vague reasons, and his views on literary criticism seem about twenty years out of date. Byatt seems to be playing chilly Borgesian games with this narrative: we can only hope she's worked this out of her system, and will return next time to a more engaging romance.
