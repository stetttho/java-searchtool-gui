 A movie that takes cheerleading seriously can't be all bad to begin with. Cheerleaders have become so abused in Hollywood teen films (despite their national popularity) that it takes you a while to realize how straight this film plays it. The best thing it has going for it is Kirsten Dunst, who is as always better than everyone else on screen. In the great beginning pep rally sequence (the film's high point, unfortunately, but worthy of repeat viewings), she's almost hypnotically expressive. She doesn't have much of a character to play (nor does anyone else in the film, for that matter), but she works it for all she's got. The film tries to be brave by confronting the idea of how wealthy white students from the suburbs steal the best routines from inner city schools; the racial politics are there, but they're tiptoed around pretty quietly, as is homosexuality (though it's nice to see for once a gay character in a high school film treated in a matter of fact fashion). The film really loses its way midway through in a sequence about a mean choreographer that could have been hilarious but falls completely flat. It only picks up again at the end, with the great final routines at the National finals (which are really something to see).It's rare to see a Hollywood movie that actually could have been better had it been extended and fleshed out, but this is it.
