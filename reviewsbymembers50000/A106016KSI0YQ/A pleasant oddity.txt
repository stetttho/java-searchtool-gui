 George Roy Hill's THE WORLD OF HENRY ORIENT is an absolutely one-of-a-kind work that almost defies categorization. It might be considered a kind of comic antecedent to HEAVENLY CREATURES: two well-to-do young teenagers from broken homes find solace in their mutual fantasies of a second-rate celebrity pianist, the libidinous and scheming Henry Orient (Peter Sellars). Innocently following him all over Manhattan, they unwittingly wreak utter havoc in his life, especially in his attempts to seduce a nervous suburban housewife (inspiringly played by Paula Prentiss). Mostly the film is a kind of paean to girlish infatuation, and allows Hill to show his great gift with younger actors (Merrie Spaeth and Tippy Walker as the teenagers are extremely winning). The latter part of the film--involving Walker's fraught homelife with her ineffectual welathy father (Tom Bosley) and his cuckolding and disagreeable wife (Angela Lansbury)--becomes a bit melodramatic, and yet it remains very memorable nonetheless. It evokes a kind of wealthy Eisenhower vision of Manhattan that doesn't exist anymore and may never have existed, the same Manhattan evoked in J. D. Salinger's novels where a teenage girl can safely wander Central Park at night unmolested and where two women who can afford to share a large two-story brownstone in Greenwich Village can be despised as "middle class." The film is more amusing and evocative rather than outright funny: still, it has one of the funniest "shaggy dog" sequences of all American films from this period--the great "Jayne Mansfield" sequence, which has an absolutely terrific payoff you'll remember for quite a while afterwards. (Prentiss was never funnier in her whole career than here.)
