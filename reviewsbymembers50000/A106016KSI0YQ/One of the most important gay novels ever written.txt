 Yes, I would go so far as to make that claim. At first AT SWIM, TWO BOYS reads, in its first fifty pages or so, too much like the earlier chapters of the "Odyssey" section of Joyce's ULYSSES: the stream-of-consciousness style, the detailed description of early 20th-century lower- middle-class Dublin, the Bloomian everyman character of Jim Mack's father. But as it continues you begin to see how orginal Jamie O'Neill really is in this novel even as he plays off Joyce's style and milieu with Oscar Wilde's and Lady Gregory's biographies. The world of detail that swims around young Jim Mack and his love interest, Doyler Doyle, is astonishing, and the sophistication of linguistic play every bit as remarkable as you'd expect in a major Irish author. And the balancing of the political demands of the nascent independent Irish nation with the private world of the two young gay lovers seems something O'Neill has done that is completely new and original. This is one of the best books I've read in years--stay with it, because it's worth it.
