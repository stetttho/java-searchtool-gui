 James Whale's masterpiece may be the very finest of all the great Universal horror films of the early 30s, despite the absence of any of its famous stable of monsters. The film is basically an extended meditation on rot and decay--physical, moral, and genetic--, but the screenplay is so fast and funny and scary that you have little time for metaphysical speculation until it's all over. Two groups of travellers find shelter from the Mother of All Rainstorms in a great wreck of an aristocratic manor house in the Welsh one horrible night, and meet the house's occupants: a giant mute butler (Boris Karloff), who becomes violent when he's been drinking, and his masters: a dessicated prissy aristocrat Horace Femm (the brilliant Ernest Thesiger) and his fanatical sister Rebecca (Eva Moore), who refuses the travellers beds for the night. But there are more Femms hidden away in the house, and the film does a superb job allowing the wayfarers (and the viewer) to go further and further in to see the horrors hidden away. The level of acting in this film is unusually high for its period and  largely holds up today: of particular note besides Karloff, Thesiger and Moore are Lilian Bond as a goodtime girl, Charles Laughton as the Yorkshire millionaire keeping her, and Gloria Stuart as an intelligent beauty.
