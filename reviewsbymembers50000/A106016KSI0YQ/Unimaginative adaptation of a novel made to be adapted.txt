 Despite the extremely literary playfulness of A.S. Byatt's ADAPTATION, the novel was basically begging for literary adaptation, given the extremely filmic quality of its exciting scenes. What could be more made for the cinema than the sceance sequence with Randoplh Henry Ash and his lover Christoibel LaMotte, or the final scene at Ash's exhumed gravesite? Yet Neil LaBute and David Henry hwang seem to have been utterly baffled by the material: their adaptation of Byatt's novel is pathetically pedestrian and unimaginative. Their first mistake was in casting the two modern-day lovers, Maud and Roland, with American actors: as Maud, Gwyneth Paltrow does her prissy unlikeable posh Brit schtick, and to accommodate LaBut's favorite actor, the awesomely miscast Aaron Eckhradt, Roland is made an American, which makes little sense for the character or for the screenplay. Jeremy Northam fares better as Ash (though he is too young yet for the role), and Jennifer Ehle (who looks nmore and more like Meryl Streep as she ages) is by far the best cast among the principals as LaMotte. The only thing the movie really has going for it is Ehle and two other superb actresses splendidly cast as LaMotte's furious and wrong lover, Blanche Glover, and Ash's pathetically trapped wife Ellen. Lena Headey and Holly Aird as (respectively) Blanche and Ellen demonstrate, with Ehle, what this adaptation might have been with a different director and screenplay writer.
