 Palliser has been described as "the best Victorian writer working today," but that wans't really true until the publication of THE UNBURIED. His previous major foray into Victorian fiction, THE QUINCUNX, was all virtuoso plot twists and sudden character reversals with no one to care about and an unbelievable Jamesian ending of renunciation.But, in the ten years intervening between that novel and THE UNBURIED, Palliser seems to have learned a great deal. His newest novel is much briefer and much more engaging. It does require from its readers a great deal of prior knowledge regarding the seventeenth-century English civil wars and the hierarchy of the Anglican church, but it's still a great read, with a terrific sense of physical atmosphere and interesting characters. Some of the plot twists are telegraphed a little too clearly ahead of time, but for the most part this adds to0 the book's enjoyment rather than detracts from it.
