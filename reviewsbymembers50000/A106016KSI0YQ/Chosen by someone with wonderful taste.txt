 Some of my alltime favorite songs from the pre-Beatles era found their way onto this cd, so I had to buy it: "The Name Game" by Shirley Ellis, "Easier Said than Done" by the Essex, "It Might as Well Rain Until September" by Carol King, "I Wish I Were a Princess" by Little Peggy March (how many song titles can you name use the subjunctive mood correctly?).... This is a fantastic selection, and the choices sound clear and sharp--well-done.
