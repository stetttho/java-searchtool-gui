 The genius of this film is its utter narrative originality: while it seems indisputably like Japanese fairy tales (in its particulars of spiritual machinery) and may even remind you of Northern European fairy tales (in its setting and the tribulations the heroine must go through), it also seems like nothing else you've ever seen. Best of all, while its exceptionally intelligent and offers a profound allegory about class (in its heroine's need to work to survive, and the greedy system she works under), it never seems moralistic or preachy in the least. And nothing is never what it seems to be: eschewing the easy good and evil dualities of American cartoons, the characters the heroine encounters are complex and ambiguous in their morality. No one is a clear villain or hero, and someone who can give her her greatest aid at one minute can suddenly become a threat to her life.  The young heroine, Chihiro, matures in the course of the film from a clingy and even irritatingly whining young girl to someone more mature and self-reliant, but her transformation is gradual and believable. When her parents are transformed into pigs by the magics of a mysterious recreational village for spirits that they stumble across, Chihiro must work from the literal bottom of a spooky and mysterious tower which functions as a bathing house for spirits and demons. The bathhouse tower is a kind of Gothic miracle, populated by all kinds of creatures that you've never seen before and remind you of nothing else (such as the enchanted furnace smudges required to carry inidivual coals). And the film is replete with great moments of beauty that the director, Miyazaki, is not afraid to linger on: a train gliding over a flooded empty landscape, or seagulls circling far below the heroine's feet (yet over a beautiful blue sea) as she climbs to the top of the mysterious tower. This isn't like anything else you've ever seen before.
