 There's something irresistibly endearing about seeing children perform publicly, given how vulnerable they seem (and are); and there is also something incredibly funny about seeing them exhibit overconfidence when they're in such vulnerable circumstances. This is the combination the creators of THE 25th ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE hit upon that has made the show such a success: the show's situation is almost a guaranteed winner, and given the comic talents of the ensemble (particularly Dan Fogler as the bizarre William Barfee and Sarah Strasman as the indomitable Schwartzy), the show is really a deserved hit. William Finn's music and lyrics are strong, but they are not the very strongest part of this show, unfortunately. It would have been great had this been a double-disc so we might have heard more of the comic interplay between the children and among them and the faculty members running the contest (I would have especially loved to have heard more of the wickedly funny sentences the spelling words are used in, whicvh is one of the comic highlights of the show). But, that being said, this CD does give you Fogler's showstopping "Magic Foot" shuffle number, Deborah S. Craig giving vent to Marcy Park's fearsome hypercompetence in "I Speak Six languages," and the beautiful repeated "Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye" motif running throughout the show.
