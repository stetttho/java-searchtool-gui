 This wasn't SCTV's best season: it didn't show the sheer genius of their syndicated episodes, nor it did reach the manic intensity of the nexts season when Martin Short stepped in and revved everyone's motors. But this, the first season of SCTV Network on NBC, is still about as hilarious as television comedy can get, and the first episode shows highlights from the syndicated show, including what is perhaps the funniest game show parody ever done on television, "High Q." One thing that made the cast so great was their universal ability to mimic famous performers, something that comes to a head in their hilarious spoof of "The Lion in Winter." Moreover, they were so good at realizing the best humor results from being true to character: just watch Rick Moranis as Teri Shields gently chiding his daughter during "The Brooke Shields Show," or Levy and O'Hara as Gene Shalit and Rona Barrett singing "We're a Couple of Swells".
