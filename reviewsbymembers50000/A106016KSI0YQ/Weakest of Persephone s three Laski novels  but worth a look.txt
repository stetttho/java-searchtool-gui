 Two of the strongest and most thrilling of the novels Persephone Books has reisuued include two by the critic and religious scholar Marghanita Laski: the chilling time-travel novella of confused identity THE VICTORIAN CHAISE-LONGUE and the absorbing postwar comedy of manners THE VILLAGE. Their third Laski re-issue, LITTLE BOY LOST, is not as strong as the other two. The protagonist, Hillary Wainwright, is so ambivalent and ineffectual he deserves his name; while part of the novel's suspense rests in the fact that, in trying to determine whether a war orphan is his own lost son, he may scotch the whole thing because of his egotism and moral weakness, these qualities make him a difficult character to spend an entire novel following. The best thing LITTLE BOY LOST has going for it is its sharp-etched portrait of the dismal quality of life in France after the Nazi Occupation, and here it excels.
