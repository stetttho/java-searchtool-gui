 The Mitfords, the six daughters of Baron Redesdale, were inescapable fixtures of England's cultural life in the Thirties; as their mother noted, she needed only pick up a newspaper to see invariably a headline about "Peer's daughter" and she'd know one of them was in trouble. Eccentric, funny, intelligent and lively, one became a one became a novelist (Nancy), one became a fascist (Diana), one became a countrywoman (Pamela), one became a Nazi (Unity), and one became a duchess (Deborah). The second to youngest, Deborah, became a communist and then a famous muckraking journalist, and wrote THE AMERICAN WAY OF DEATH as well as this very funny memoir of growing up Mitford. Given almost no education while being raised in Gloucestershire and London, she eloped with Churchill's nephew Esmond Romilly to Spain, and then found work with him in America as the war began across the Atlantic. The memoir gives a fascinating account of what it was like to live as what her sisters dismissingly term "a ballroom pink" in the Thirties, but is most memorable, of course, for its detailing of her sisters' hilarious observations about class, snobbery, sex and one another: when it is announced their King is going to marry an American with the unprepossesing name of Wallis Simpson, for example, the sisters refuse to believe it ("That cannot be her real Christian name!").
