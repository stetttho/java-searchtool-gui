 This is a very informative and enjoyable meoir by someone who worked on just about everything with just about everybody from the Forties to almost the present day. There's terrifically entertaining gossip and information  about working with Stephen Sondheim, Katherine Hepburn, Barbra Streisand,  Jerome Robbins, Angela Lansbury, and too may others to count. And the  book's sophisticated structure (avoiding a wholly linear chronology)  actually made it all the more intelligent. Laurents clearly has a number  of scores to settle, particularly with Robbins and with Streisand and with  Gore Vidal (who comes across as a particularly hateful, snobbish man), but  Laurents' basic decency and intelligence helps the book avoid any real  abiding bitterness of tone. Perhaps, however, someone might've suggested to  him to abridge the many, many strangely impersonal references to his  longtime companion Tom Hatcher's great beauty and Oklahoma  wholesomeness--at times, it sounds as if Laurents were a horsebreeder  congratulating himself on purchasing a particularly fine Thoroughbred. But,  this was only a minor irritant.
