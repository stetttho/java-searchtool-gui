 There have been few American films in the latter half of the twentieth century quite so influential as NASHVILLE, which attempts to sum up no less than the feelings of homelessness and betrayal in American life after the Sixties and Watergate, and the way popular culture acts to ameliorate these problems and to blind us to them as well. The film covers five days in the life of 24 characters in the summer of 1975, as a campaign manager assembles a series of country western stars for a benefit concert for a third-party candidate at the Nashville Parthenon in Centennial Park; along the way we get a kind of thin slice of each of their lives, and a look in particular at their relation to poltics, to sexual and racial mores, and to the country-music industry. Although the DVD does not have the kind of extras that a film of this stature deserves, it still has a very intriguing commentary by Robert Altman that shows you what a happy accident much of the film turned out to be: how some of the most famous and oft-quoted bits of dialogue (such as Barbara Baxley's heartfelt ode to the Kennedy brothers) were improvisations of the cast at the time. The film has a kind of texture and richness to it that almost no other film before it could macth, and it has been imitated (by Altman himself, among others) since it first appeared. What most of the imitations have missed, however, is the kind of linchpin that Ronee Blakeley's performance as Barbara Jean, the central character, provides. Lovely and special, Blakely makes evident why the public and the other country-western stars adores her character so much (there's a marvelous bit of business in the famous "Opry Belle" sequence that makes this clear when Barbara Jean first walks onstage to perform: she is gallantly escorted out by one of the dancers and waves to her fans from a doorway; only as the intro to the song swells does she step up close to them and to the camera to begin her first great number, "The Cowboy Song"). Although most of the film's other performers cannot sing very well and their numbers are mostly terrible (which is part of Altman's point: country music at the time was primarily a democratic folk art gaining enormous popularity), Blakely's Barbara Jean is an extraordinary singer. Her beautiful final song, "My Idaho Home," which is used at the film's great climax, provides a kind of summa for the entire movie in its fond memories of a unified Amnerican family life despite hardship and deprivation. This is Altman's greatest and most famous film, and deserves repeated viewings.
