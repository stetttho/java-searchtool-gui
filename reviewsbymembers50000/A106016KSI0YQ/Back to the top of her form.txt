 In the last twenty years or so, P. D. James's famed mystery novels have been less enjoyable than they were in previous decades: her characters seemed at times so misanthropic and snobbish as to be almost intolerable (as in A TASTE FOR DEATH), and her murderers often get away at the end scot-free (as in A CERTAIN JUSTICE and THE SKULL BENEATH THE SKIN), as if to endorse a somewhat dark--even Jacobean--vision of human existence. I'm happy to say that her latest effort, DEATH IN HOLY ORDERS, is a return to the top of her form. The setting, an isolated Anglican college on the East Anglian coast, seems very reminiscent of one of James's very best Dagliesh mysteries, THE BLACK TOWER, but otherwise the story is very much original, although it does dip (though not too indulgently) into some of the interests James has shown in almost all her novels, such as Victorian architecture, family hatreds, and art history. The community is an interesting one, the central murder is properly horrifying and dramatic, and best of all she allows her central detectives (Kate, Piers, and especially Dagliesh) more space to grow than they have in years. This Dagliesh mystery can stand with James's very best, including THE BLACK TOWER and A MIND TO MURDER.
