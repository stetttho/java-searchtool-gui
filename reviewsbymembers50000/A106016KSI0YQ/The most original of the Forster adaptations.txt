 Of all the film adaptations of E.M. Forster's novels that came out in the 1980s and 90s, A PASSAGE TO INDIA is probably the most interesting because it veers the most strongly away from the original novel: rather than remain faithfully scrupulous to what Forster wrote, Lean recognized the difference between the film and novel media and offered his own intriguing interpretation of Forster. Whereas Forster's novel is primarily concerned with Fielding and Aziz, the protagonist of Lean's film is Adela Quested, and the film's central concern (as it is for so many of Lean's works) is the main character's sexual hysteria. Although this does at times skew things very strangely, nonetheless the film is really a masterpiece, held together by Judy Davis's brilliant performance as Adela. She doesn't play Adela quite like you'd expect (its hard to believe that her strongwilled character could be so easily bullied by the British during the trial scenes), but she pulls it off magnificently. In two of her best scenes--the famous sequence of her at the ruined temple during the bicycle ride, when she's aroused by the erotic statuary, and her great final moment reading the letter--she doesn't even have to say a word to get the audience thoroughly into her character's mind. Apparently she and Lean did not get along at all during the shooting of the film, which is a shame--it's still her best performance, and it may be the best performance he ever got out of an actor (Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard in BRIEF ENCOUNTER excepted). There are some things in the film to regret: Alec Guinness's absurd racial caricature of Professor Godbole, and the silly sequence in the Himalayas with Fielding and Stella looking at mountain peaks that slows the whole movie down. yet, too, there are also lovely scenes that bear watching and re-watching many times: the entrance of the train into Chadrapore (with the difficulty shared by Ronnie and the viewer alike in placing Adela--proleptic of the caves sequence), the refusal of the marriage proposal on the maidan, and of course the haunting climb up to the Marabar Caves.
