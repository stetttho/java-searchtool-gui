 Mel Brooks comedies are never very good when he's in the leading role (he plays too broadly for the camera), but this take-off of Hitchcock movies (particularly VERTIGO and SPELLBOUND) does have a few good things going for it. There are some wonderful sight gags, Cloris Leachman has her most memorable role ever as the kinky Nurse Diesel, and though the great Madeline Kahn doesn't have nearly enough to do, she has one of her best bits ever when Brooks calls her on the phone just before being attacked by a strangler, and she thinks his gasps for help are a heavy breather ("I'm going to hang up right now... so... what are you wearing?"). Keep your finger on the fast-forward, but this is still worth a look.
