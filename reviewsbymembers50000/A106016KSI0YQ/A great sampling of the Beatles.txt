 There's been quite a great deal of dismay listed below from people who clearly Beatles devotees, who are dissatisfied with the limitations of this cd (so many fine songs which weren't number one hits have been left off), or with the cd's remastering of old mono classics. Given the enormous number of great songs the Beatles put out, however, it would be impossible to produce an affordable cd that covered their full career without leaving several hits off of it, and of course this album isn't really designed for hardcore Beatles devotees anyway (who presumably have all the albums already). Nor does this cd pretend to give us "the best" of the Beatles, which would send fans screaming in disagreement no matter what was chosen. Rather, it's an affordable collection of their #1 hits, which allows the buyer 27 of the greatest rock songs ever written, covering almost the full span of an astonishingly varied and sophisticated career. And for what it is, it's terrific. Many of us who love the Beatles greatly--but who didn't want to invest in all their cd's--are extraordinarily grateful for this collection.
