 Elizabeth Taylor is a real writer's writer, which can be a term of disparagement as well as one of high praise. Taylor's novels always show amazing intelligence and care and devotion to craft, and at their best they can be moving and obsorbing; at their worst, however, they can seem a bit inhuman and cold. PALLADIAN, her second novel, falls into the latter category. This is truly a metanarrative, as its clever-clever title  would indicate, suggesting not only the Palladian architecture of the estate on which most of the action takes place but also the realms of the intellectual, of Pallas Athena. The Austenian-named heroine Cassandra Dashwood goes to work at the estate as a governess, and dreams from the first of falling in love with her charge's widowed and mysterious father; Taylor acts immediately to deconstruct any such Brontsque narrative expectations by showing quickly that the true locus of interest should lie not with Cassandra and her employer but rather with her employer's dislikeable drunken cousin, who is sleeping with a pubkeeper in the nearby town. Characters are coldly sacrificed for the sake of narrative surprises and moral points; you end up admiring Taylor's skill and fine mind but not caring a bit for anyone in the novel at all.
