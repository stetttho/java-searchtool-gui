 Augusten Burroughs's second memoir just isn't anywhere near as enjoyable as his first. To have this account of a rehabilitation and recovery from aclcohol addiction really work you'd have to have an authorial persona whom you'd really feel a stake in wanting to succeed, but the "Augusten" voice who emerges from this book isn't someone whom you really care about one way or another. He's funny, but not especially so (certainly nowhere near the level of David Sedaris, to whom Burroughs is often compared), and he is (as he himself is the first to admit) consummately and spectacularly shallow. This may not come off as much of a surprise for a successful advertising executive, but it certainly does work against the interests of the book: there have probably been few books ever written where the other characters are so often valued and judged almost wholly on their relative physical attractiveness. In the end you just don't care that much whether or not the main character stays on or off the wagon. Burroughs's advertising background also probably explains how superfically engineered this memoir is, too: the characters might as well walk around with enormous signs that say "TRUE FRIEND," "BAD NEWS," and "COMIC RELIEF." I really wanted to enjoy this book, and in the end just couldn't.
