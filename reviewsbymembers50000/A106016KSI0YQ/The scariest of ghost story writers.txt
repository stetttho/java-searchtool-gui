 Algernon Blackwood really is the most frightening to me of all horror story writers: he has a way of capturing mood and setting that outdoes any of his many followers (among whom H. P. Lovecraft  was proudly one of the most preeminent). The three most famous stories in this book--the title story, "The Wendigo," and above all "The Willows"--emblematize his skill. The title story is set in an ancient French townn where the townspeople seem to have a peculair habit of transforming into something else, and authentically captures the creepiness of medieval towns at night. Even more frightening is "The Wendigo": set in the North Woods, it realizes whatever fears you've ever had walking alone in the snowy woods. "The Willows" was Lovecraft's nomination for the finest horror stopry ever written, and it clearly may have inspired THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT: two canoers traversing through the Middle European forests find themselves stranded on an island by unknown forces that won't let them leave. Part of the pleasure of Blackwood is that he never overdoes it: he has a marvelous light touch, and reads quite crisply at the level of the sentence.
