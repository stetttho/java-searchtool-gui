 If anything, this snappy little band from Portlasnd has become more musically proficient in the seven years since their debut album "Sympathique." The collaborations with the musicians who have inspired the band's gifted impresario, Thomas Lauderdale, pay off beautifully, and what was previously the band's weakest point--its vocals--have improved enormously: China Forbes, the lead chanteuse, has gained much greater control of her voice in the ensuring period between albums. The only drawback on this album is the prevalent sesnsibility, which comes through especially in the lyrics, and which can be at times too self-enchantedly fey (get a load of the title song, for instance) and self-consciously innocent. What seemed charming when the band members were in their late 20s now seems a little much now they're in their mid-30s. Still, this is highly pleasurable music that shows beautiful craftsmanship and musicality.
