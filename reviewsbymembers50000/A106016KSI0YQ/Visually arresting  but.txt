 The opening and closing sequences of this interesting 1993 spin on the vampire movie are quite stunning, and Guillermo del Toro's beautiful eye for production design (that served him so well in THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE and that even redeemed much of HELLBOY) are much in evidence here. But the tone of this film is wildly uneven, and shows del Toro's relative unsureness when he made CRONOS at age 28. Although comedy and horror often mesh splendidly together, the comic scenes in this film do not work at all, especially when Ron Perlman's poorly conceived character is onscreen. Deadliest of all, the film is just not very suspenseful. But any del Toro film is worth seeing just for the gorgeous cinematography and set design, and that, and Federico LUppi's superb performance as the elderly main character, do not disappoint.
