 is the basic operating principle for this Broadway show--but it's a better and more complex idea than it sounds. The very clever lyrics and infectious songs allow not only to show the disjunction between the kinds of simple moral lessons and idealistic worldview preached on "Sesame Street" and those more appropriate for the world of Generation Y Americans today ("Everyone's a Little Bit Racist," "You Can Be as Loud as the Hell You Hant (When You're Making Love), but also for tremendous romantic lyricism. For example, "The More You Ruv Someone," is a spoof of the great songs of yearning sung by tertiary characters in later Rodgers and Hammerstein shows (like THE KING AND I or FLOWER DRUM SONG) but is also one of the most beautifully lyrical songs composed for Broadway in a long time. "You Can Be as Loud as the Hell You Want," similarly, is a tribute to the kinds of funky songs from "the Wiz" but is terrific in its own right. And the show is saved from too much self-congratulatory cynicism by a very idealistic and gorgeous final song celebrating helping that would not be out of place on the real "Sesame Street." The cast is terrific, particularly the puppeteers: the adorable John Tartaglia doubling as the freshfaced hero Princeton and the uptight closeted Rod, Stephanie d'Abruzzo as the idealistic Kate Monster, and the vampish Lucy, and the hilarious Rick Lyon who uncannily channels Cookie Monster (as "Trekkie Monster") and Ernie (as "Nicky").
