 Technicolor was never put to better use than in this Forties melodrama with Gene Tierney as the obsesssively possessive Ellen, and she herself (probably the single most beautiful actress from Hollywood's Golden Age) was never more gorgeously photographed. The film has been regarded as something of a camp classic even from its original release--as James Agee noted, you just can't help but feel sympathetic with the murderous Ellen, who is expected to share her husband (Cornel Wilde) with his clingy relatives even on their honeymoon, and she is actually faulted for being resentful when they arrive at their honeymoon lodge expecting to sing campfire songs. And though there are some hilarious over-the-top sequences (most particularly, the shot of her tragically spreading her father's ashes on horseback over the New Mexico desert), no one who has seen it has ever forgotten the great chilling sequence in the rowboat, where she quietly watches her handicapped stepbrother drown.
