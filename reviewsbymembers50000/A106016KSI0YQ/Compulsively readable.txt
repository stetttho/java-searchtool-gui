 So many of the great Victorian fin-de-siecle romances have been rediscovered in the last few years, but this is the first new edition of one of the finest, H. Rider Haggard's SHE, in all that time. And SHE is really one of the best: compulsively readable, it lingers in the imagination long after you're done--you see why it has attracted critical commentary or adaptations from everyone to Jung to Freud to Elizabeth Bowen to C. S. Lewis. It seems to rework into all the most infamous fin-de-siecle obsessions (the New Woman, decadence, male bonding, imperialism) into something wholly new and original. Haggard was not the best writer in the world, but nonetheless somehow he managed to produce a novel as fascinating and rich as even such other fine fin-de-siecle works as DRACULA and THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU.
