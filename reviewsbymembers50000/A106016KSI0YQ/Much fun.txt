 These two works are some of the best work written for the American musical stage in the past thirty years, and absolutely are worth listening to again and again. Of the two, "March of the Falsettos" fares better overall than "Falsettoland": the latter has its moments, but is fairly sentimental (although understandably so given the subject matter), and the character of Trina vanishes somewhat from the foreground. But the whole thing is still a joy: the lyrics are almost painfully witty, and the whole thing is filled with tremendous zest and spark. The cast is terrific, and all the adult male actors have become almost forever associated with their superb performances here. The two Trinas, Alison Frasier and Faith Prince, are quite different, although both are absolutely wonderful in their own fashion: Prince is particularly hilarious in "Year of the Child," and Frasier almost steals "March" from the rest of the cast (which is no small feat). Just listen to the latter on the marvelous little intro to "Please Come to Our House" to see how remarkable this actress can be.
