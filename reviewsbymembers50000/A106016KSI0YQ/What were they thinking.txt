 In one of the few times she ever played a genuinely frightened person in her entire life, Katharine Hepburn stars in this silly but very expensive melodrama from MGM. The dowdy daughter of a New England university chemistry professor (who keeps his laboratory, which she also uses, adjoining the family dining room), she is wooed by millionaire manufacturer Robert Taylor, who whisks her off to his Georgetown mansion to introduce her to Washington high society and dress her according to his supposedly exquisite taste in women's clothing. (The outfits, by Irene, are so horribly unflattering on Hepburn they seem almost perversely chosen.) In DC, Hepburn learns never to mention Taylor's absent brother, whose very mention seems to produce fits of twitching and nostril-flaring in her new husband; this meassage becomes hammered home even further when they visit Taylor's childhood home, a plush estate in Virginia horse country. Then there are further steps along the way in San Francisco and the California countryside, with even one scene set in a Seattle board room, and a special guest appearance by Robert Mitchum before we're back to the ominous mansion in Virginia with NO TELEPHONES (as the characters repeatedly remind us) before Taylor really goes off his nut.   Why this film had to be so expansive and cover so many states is an even bigger mystery than what happened to Taylor's brother. So too is the reason why MGM chose Katharine Hepburn, of all people, to play the kind of role usually accorded Joan Fontaine: although Hepburn is quite charming in the final scenes where she's required to be terrified, she seems to be playing an entirely different person altogether than in the beginning when she does her usual schtick as a father-adoring Yankee tomboy. The film seems to go on forever because there are so many little loose ends that have to be drawn together at the very end; even so, the film's storyline gives the impression of having been made up as it goes along. The only real reasons to see this, other than for campiness, are the stunning interiors by Cedric Gibbons and the beautiful lighting and cinematography (the latter by Karl Freund) which seem wasted on all the melodramatic silliness.
