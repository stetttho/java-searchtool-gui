 Dirk Schaefer's independent film examining the circuit party life in southern Califronia has had a pretty bad critical reputation, but the DVD version of it with the director's cut on it certainly deserves a look. At the core of the film is a very fine performance by Andre Khabbazi as a hardboiled gay hustler secretly terrified to find himself less wanted as he ages, a performance so strong that it puts over just about every scene Khabbazi is in. The film suffers mightily from having too many characters with subplots that never become satsifactorily explored, and (worst of all) from a clichd happy ending that allows its hero, a former policeman seduced by the circuit life, to discover redemption via true love and community. Schaefer also seems as if he wanted to tell an old-fashioned sensationalistic expos of the decadence of circuit life, but was convinced somehow to show the positive aspects of circuit life as well (i.e. that for many gay men it offers an outlet for pleasure and a chance to find a sense of community with one another). While the latter are undoubtedly true, Schaefer shows these aspects in such a halfhearted way so as to make the film seem ultimately more confused than complex. The performances also vary tremednously. Some of the more experimental sequences in the film work very well (such as a fine bit with a tweaked-out Khabbazi before a mirror); others are ultimately unsuccessful.
