 The editors at persephone Books in London have done a tremendous service by reissuing these terrific and beautiful editions of neglected twentieth-century women's classics; it's a true shame these books aren't more available in the United States in affordable editions. EVERY EYE is one of the most beautifully written books in their series; Isobel English's gift for narrative description (particularly for landscape and for fabrics) is superb. The story initially seems to be out of Caroline Blackwood territory, with its heroine's repeating complaints about the maternal figures in her life (particularly her aunt); but as the novel unfolds it moves far beyond that, and its deft shuttlings back between the heroine's present (her honeymoon in Ibiza) and her past seem miraculous. Cinema is one of the places where we are best used to such shifts, but there's little filmic in English's technique--her talents are thoroughly those of the novelistic. The gorgeousness of the prose and narrative drive allow you to overlook the conventionality of the very guessable "surprise ending."
