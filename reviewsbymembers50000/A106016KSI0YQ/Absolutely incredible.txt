 From out of nowhere, seemingly, came this, one of the most absolutely original and astonishing films of the 1990s. Peter Jackson's film takes as its starting point the real-life murder committed by two teenage girls in Christchurch, New Zealand in the 1950s, but transforms it into a brilliant meditation on the role of escapism and fantasy in daily life and their sometimes devastating consequences. The film takes you into the bizarre Brontsque fantasy worlds of the two young women, Pauline Rieper and Juliet Hulme, as they come to turn to each other for support against the dreadful realities of adolescence and their parents' unhappy lives, and allows you to feel their mounting intensity of hysteria as their dreamworld spins out of control. Lynsket is remarkable as Pauline, but the real find in this film was Winslet, whose ripe beauty only enhances her complex portrayal of Julie, replete with all the paradoxical sensuality and innocence, charm and spitefulness, of a young woman on the verge of adulthood but avoiding the responsibilities it will entail. The ending of the film has haunted me for years. Don't miss it.
