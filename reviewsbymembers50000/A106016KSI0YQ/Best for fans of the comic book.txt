 As adaptations of comic books go, this is about as good as it gets: the effects are terrific, the tone is humorous at times and deadly serious at others (yet never campy), the acting is mostly solid (at times spectacular, in the cases of jackman, Stewart and McKellan), and it plays mostly like an adaptation of a great X-Men comic book that never existed. That being said, there is a certain silliness to it that non-comic book fans may have trouble getting past: Magneto's plan is needlessly complex, there are too many characters to keep track of, and Professor Xavier's Cerebro machine seems absurd. (Although the latter requires a mutant telepath to use it--with incredible danger involved--, in the film it tells you only the most obvious information imaginable: "She's trying to escape by going to the peculiarly large train station just miles from here even though we live in the middle of nowhere! We never would have figured that one out without Cerebro!") Nevertheless, it's hard to imagine a better Professor X, a better Wolverine, or a better film adaptation of the popular comic book.
