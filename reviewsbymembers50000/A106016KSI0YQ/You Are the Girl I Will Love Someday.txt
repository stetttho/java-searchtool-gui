 FLOWER DRUM SONG was a respectable hit on Broadway, running for six hundred performances, making a national star out of the gifted Pat Suzuki, and cementing the celebrity of Academy Award-winning actress Miyoshi Umeki. The two actresses just shine in their roles: Umeki was a noted Japanese singer before "discovered" in the United States for the film SAYONARA (for which she won the Oscar), and her rendition of "A Hundred Million Miracles" is so haunting and lovely that when FLOWER DRUM SONG was turned into a film she was allowed not only to sing the entire song the first time it is heard but also to reprise it several times.  The amazing Pat Suzuki, inexplicably, was not retained for the inferior film version of the musical, which is an incredible shame: her brassiness not only wins you over on the famous "I Enjoy Being a Girl," but transforms the musically mediocre "Grant Avenue" practically into a showstopper. Arabella Hong, as Helen Chao, sings a lovely operatic rendition of "Love, Look Away," an oft-neglected R&H song of tremendous beauty. Indeed, this is probably their most overlooked score, with two clear duds ("Chop Suey" and "The Other Generation") but with otherwise real winners, including the liltingly charming "Sunday" (which should have become a standard), and the hauntingly gorgeous "You Are Beautiful," sung by Ed Kenney here, which is among the finest love songs R&H ever wrote. This cast album has become something of a classic--and it deserves to be.
