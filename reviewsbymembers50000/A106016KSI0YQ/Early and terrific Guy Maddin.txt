 This is the Guy Maddin film that's his best-known because of its relative easiness to get ahold of, although it's also his earliest feature. GIMLI shows all of Maddin's obsessions with early expressionistic film and early twentieth-century Nordic culture in full flower. There's also some of his trademark black humor (though not as much as in his later films--this film never gets funnier than the framing sequence with Amma and the children at the very beginning). Maddin takes more time here to show scenes of great visual beauty, something he sadly rushes through somewhat in his later films. His favorite male actor, Kyle McCullogh, is at his handsomest here--it's a good film to watch to be introduced to Maddin.
