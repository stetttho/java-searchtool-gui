 Much like CASABLANCA or CITIZEN KANE, it is almost impossible to see THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN completely fresh because so much of our popular culture today always refers back to it already. Like those other two films even the first time you see James Whale's most celebrated film you know the lines and the situations almost before they happen because the film has had such a resonance for our culture. As the documentary that accompanies this DVD, "She's Alive!," points out, almost everything about the film was serendipitous, from the superb cast, the great make-up and art direction, the extremely witty script, and the oddly perverse spirit in which the director approached this sequel to 1931's FRANKENSTEIN. Boris Karloff greatly deepens his most celebrated role by emphasizing the creature's alienation and loneliness, but the film belongs in the end to Ernest Thesiger, unforgettable as the camp and decadent Dr. Pretorius, and of course most of all to Elsa Lanchester doing double duty as Mary Shelley and as the title role. She appears for less than five minutes in the entirety of the film, but yet she walks away with the film entirely: who can forget her uncannily pixillated movements as the Bride, suggesting she should never have been brought to life, or her great shriek of horror when she meets her groom? This is in the end more of a comedy than a horror film, but it more than meets the promise of its predecessor (and enlarges and deepens the first film's meanings).
