 Magic and Loss grabbed me in the 90's when I was relatively at peace with myself. It grabbed me again this year when I had experienced some turmoil and loss. Forgetting the "depressing" lyrics for a moment, it's got some catchy licks and a couple of excellent tunes (well, Lou doesn't actually sing, but whatever you call what he does is very effective here).  Do people really avoid depression by not thinking about something? I don't know, but I come out of listening to this album feeling better about life. Not because he holds out any false hope or turns to Greener Pastures at the end, but because hey, if this guy can deal with his grief and turn it into art, then by golly so can I.
