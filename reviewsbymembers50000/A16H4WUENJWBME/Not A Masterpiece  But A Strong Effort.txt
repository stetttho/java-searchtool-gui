 I hadn't heard Heavy Horses in 25 years and I remembered it as being a not-particularly-strong album, the beginning of Tull's decline to the depths of the mid-80's.  Then I listened again.  I think it's great the reissue includes "Broadford Bazaar." No, it doesn't fit in with the farm-animal concept, but hey, it's a good song, as opposed to drivel like "Weathercock." The other songs are keepers, though. The title song could have had 4 minutes surgically removed, but remember this was the 70's when time could be artificially extended or compacted at will. "Mouse Police" was the most fun Ian had had since Thick As A Brick. "Moths" still touches me, and "Acres Wild" out-sylvans Songs From the Wood. Plus, I learned from this album what a pibroch is. That alone is worth the sticker price.
