 When I first heard Grace I was blown away, thinking it the greatest debut album ever. But I had just been reading the biography of Buckley and his father, and I think I was so enthralled by the story that I thought more highly of the music than I should have.  Not all the songs herein are works of genius, although there are several: the title song; the glorious cover of Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah" (you'll never be able to listen to the Shrek soundtrack again); and a couple of flat-out rockers that make you scratch your head wondering why Buckley never got any airplay.  And that voice! It's been called a mix of Robert Plant and Dino Vinelli, and it is, but that doesn't do it justice.  On "Corpus Christi Carol" he sounds like a eunuch, yet he can get down and dirty on songs like "So Real" or "Eternal Life."  And the CD ends on a transcendent note with "Dream Brother," a tribute to his equally doomed father. Like Dad, Jeff could be a showboat with the voice, but if I had that voice I'd probably want to show it off too.
