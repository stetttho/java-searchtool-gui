 With all the talent assembled for this project, it's a wonder they didn't come up with something better.  The opening melody is a snooze, and "In Held 'Twas I," while chock-full of interesting moments, isn't nearly as fascinating if you already knew the original.  "Mystery Train" is the standout on this CD, but if you're looking for something a little meatier from these four fine musicians, try "Bridge Across Forever."
