 I love anything from Bruce, anytime, anywhere, but you could do better than start here.  The new cut, "My Beat," is a waste of bandwith, and I hate it when they add one song to get you to buy an album. No wonder everybody is downloading. This is a best-of from Stealing Fire on (ca. 1984). From that period you'd be better getting Nothing But A Burning Light (which contains the excellent "A Dream Like Mine"), The Charity of Night ("The Coming Rains") or Breakfast In New Orleans, Dinner in Timbuktu. Or better yet, go back to 1979's Dancing In The Dragon's Jaws or 1980's Humans.  Everybody has their beef about a pet song that's left off a compilation.  I've got about 20, but I'm keep them to myself.  Bottom line is: you owe it to yourself to stock up on this excellent songwriter's backlog.
