 When I was 15 years old I wished I was Jackson Browne so I could feel all that stuff and have a love affair with Joni Mitchell. She is a cool lady and a huge influence on modern folk-rock, and while I don't agree that this is her best album, it holds its own. The title track floored me the first time, and it sets the tone for the whole album: the balance of love and "freedom," as in the freedom of the road. In The Same Situation she sends out her prayer, wond'ring where it had to go/with Heaven full of astronauts and the Lord on Death Row." I always changed the girl of that song to a guy. Same for Raised on Robbery, which was made for the trick with its quotation mark lyrics. The weak points here are the Tom Scott-infected hookish radio candy like Help Me and People's Parties, but I'm grateful it got more people to hear the record.
