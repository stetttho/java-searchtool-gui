 If you're looking for music from David Wilcox (the sensitive singer/songwriter from North Carolina, not the gutbucket bloozman from Canada), you should pick up 2 of the best CD's of the 90's:  How Did You Find Me Here and Big Horizon. Wilcox reminds a lot of people of John Gorka but the more apt comparison is to James Taylor. The title track is about the only thing here that equals the best of those albums: an acoustic blues that showcases the singer's butterscotch vocals.  "With your tongue in your ear you say come and I come walking/a glide in my stride/what you whispered well it keeps me satisfied."  Them's lyrics!  On the other hand, David should stay away from overt comedy. When he's not trying to hard he can be very funny, but then there's a (rap?) song about Sex and Death which is way off the mark.  He's one of the few artists that I used to buy a new release from without even listening to it.  But that was then.
