 I don't like most songs that make the pop charts.  I don't like synthesizer-heavy arrangements.  I don't like "big" production. "So" has all of those, but boy do I love it!  The mid-80's were a dry period for rock, with acts like Madonna and Michael Jackson filling the airwaves. Then a "new" new wave came along with the likes of U2's "Joshua Tree," Paul Simon's "Graceland," Suzanne Vega's "Solitude Standing," and "So," and suddenly you could listen to the radio and not be ashamed.  "In Your Eyes" and "Sledgehammer" (and to a lesser extent "Big Time") made the most noise, but the fun doesn't stop there.  Also superb are "Red Rain," "Don't Give Up," and "Mercy Street."  And the two tracks I haven't mentioned (3 on the reissue) are pretty good too.  I'm not sure what the story is with putting "In Your Eyes" in the final spot on the CD.  It's certainly worthy of that position as a nice rounding out of the album. Whatever.  Just takes some getting used to I guess. And Daniel Lanois' production is an acquired taste. It worked for U2 and Dylan, not so much here - but it doesn't spoil it either. The songwriting is just too strong.  "So" is definitely one of the top 10 albums of the 80's, and though some disagree, I'd say it's Gabriel's best.
