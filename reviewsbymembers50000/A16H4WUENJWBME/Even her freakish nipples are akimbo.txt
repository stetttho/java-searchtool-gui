 The line above (from "Doubting Woman") might be the best lyric ever written, or the worst.  Or both. If you like it you might like Vic Chesnett, if not steer clear. I find a lot of great stuff on this CD:  "Gravity of the Situation" is a brilliant song, and "Thailand" is an example of one where he breaks through the folk singer-songwriter groove and tries a little more sonic noise. I wish that Chesnutt wouldn't write all his songs with the same langorous, downbeat rhythm. A little variation would make it a better CD. But there's no question that the guy knows how to write lyrics.
