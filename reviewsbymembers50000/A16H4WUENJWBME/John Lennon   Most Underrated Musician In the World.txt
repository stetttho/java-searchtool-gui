 When this came out, I was hurting at the breakup of the Beatles and PO'd that John was kicking butt and taking names. Paul was pretty and nice and I'd rather have been him.  Alas, I found out that John is who I really was.  I'm glad I picked this up a few years ago, and at 47 I'm finally able to hear it for what it is: a masterpiece. This was the height of John's creative output, and those who thought he might not be able to shoulder the burden of an entire album's worth of songs were wrong, wrong, wrong.  Okay, now I think I'm ready to go back and reevaluate "Goodnight Vienna."
