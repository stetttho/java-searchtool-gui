 After hearing the CD reissue of Revolver, is anybody as mad as I am about what Capitol records did to the Beatle's early albums? For those of you too young to remember, they gutted the English versions, deleting two or three songs and then reissuing these in lame compilations that did not do justice to the original albums. Nowhere did this affect an album worse than Revolver. It's why it's suddenly starting appearing at the top of people's list of great albums: some of us never heard it until ten years ago. The loser in this travesty, besides the consumer, was John Lennon. Lennon was at the nadir of his popularity because he told the truth and said the Beatles were bigger than God. (not greater - more popular) So they cut out some of the best music on the record, notably "I'm Only Sleeping," a masterpiece. John's acerbic pessimism would have been a perfect balance to Paul's chipper warblings ("Got to Get You Into My Life" is not a bad tune, but it's better when it's balanced by "Dr. Roberts".  Add to that some of the greatest songs in pop history (Eleanor Rigby, For No One, Here There and Everywhere, Good Day Sunshine), plus a strong effort from George (Taxman) and some experimental noodling that anticipated Sgt. Pepper (Tomorrow Never Knows), throw in Yellow Submarine for the kiddies and you've got yourself a true classic. I'm not one of those who think Revolver is the best Beatles album - I give the nod to Abbey Road for superior musicianship - but it's dang close. And that's good enough for just about anybody.
