 Despite a voice that sounds like a chainsaw through concrete, Tom Waits (like Dylan before him) is the best interpreter of Tom Waits. This collection comprises his Island years, the most fertile and iconoclastic of his career so far. Some might argue to just use Swordfishtrombones or Mule Variations as a starter, but this compilation gives a wider view of an already versatile artist.  Whether bopping along to "Hang On St. Christopher" or tuning in to the chilling wastescapes of "November," this CD is a manic-depressive's joyride through the mind of a twisted genius. And then, when you get to a song like "Downtown Train" which is perfectly suited to the pop market, your mind really blows open.
