 35 years on, I finally figured out what that strange concrete obelisk thingy on the cover is.  It's a beacon, a Lighthouse if you like, at the top of a hill, and on one side of it stands all the great promise of rock 'n' roll of the 60's, and on the other begins the downhill slide toward tedium and drivel that gave rise to punk. 1971: the year of Exile on Main Street, Fragile, Aqualung, and a dozen other classics - and this one stands head and shoulders above them all, looking out at the coming storm.
