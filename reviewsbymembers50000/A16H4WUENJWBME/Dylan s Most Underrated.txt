 I don't get why people don't like this more. Maybe it's because, even though he ditched the born-again attitude, there's still a very Old Testament vibe running through it. There is a lot of finger-pointing on this album, but unlike his early 60's work the finger is pointed the wrong way.  "Neighborhood Bully" and "Sundown on the Union" are CONSERVATIVE songs, and Dylan fans can't handle that. Now mind you, I'm a dyed-in-the-wool liberal.  But this album transcends politics. Those songs aren't great because they espouse a reactionary viewpoint - they're great because they ROCK. This is one of the rockinest of all Dylan records, and it sounds great, thanks to Mark Knopfler, Sly and Robbie, etc.  I also don't get those people who say that this album should be criticized for what it's NOT.  Yeah, sure, it would have sounded better with Blind Willie McTell, Foot of Pride, etc., but what album wouldn't? I have no earthly idea why Dylan chose to leave those great songs off (maybe he just wanted to stir up controversy, or secure his reputation as the most bootlegged artist in the world).  But that has nothing to do with what Infidels IS: another in a string of masterpieces.
