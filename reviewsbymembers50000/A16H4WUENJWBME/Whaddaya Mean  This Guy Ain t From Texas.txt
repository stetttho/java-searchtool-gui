 I once read a review by Robert Christgau which made fun of "Li'l Wallet Picture" from this CD. For one brief moment, I knew what it felt like to be the Unabomber. [Caution: Views expressed, etc.] What business has Rolling Stone of publishing such  claptrap? True, Buckner's voice is an acquired taste. When he tries to push out the emotion he kinda sounds like he's, uh--using the facility. But getting past that, here are some of the most heartfelt, achy-breaky songs to ever come out of ... well, I would have said Texas but then I learned he was from California. Texas is his spiritual home at least. These songs are about heartbreak, memory, leavin', and drivin'. Lots of drivin'. Drivin' down misty highways at  4 a.m., past dead-man's curves, drivin' thru the backroads of lost love. If that ain't Texas, it oughta be. And if you don't git it--then what the heck you readin' this for?
