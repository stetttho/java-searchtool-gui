 This is one of the rare CD's that get better every time you hear it. There's no catchy hooks like the ones in Graceland, but it's suffused with the same spirit. Simon has always been the master of couching dark lyrics in emotions in upbeat tunes (think Sound of Silence). Listening to Cool, Cool River, Can't Run But and The Obvious Child makes you realize that he's still that dark spirit yearning upward for spiritual redemption. Not all the tunes are as much fun as the title song or Born At the Right Time, but they all hold out hope for a lost generation.
