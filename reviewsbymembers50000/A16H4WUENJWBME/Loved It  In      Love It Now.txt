 I'm not one of those people who likes to compare Pearl Jam with Nirvana.  People love them both.  That's great. But I just don't resonate with Nirvana the way I do with early Pearl Jam. Eddie Vedder is be the best singer-songwriter to come out of Seattle. Just don't call him that to his face.  What's with the title, anyway?
