 I could count on the fingers of one hand the number of original, studio-made albums that wouldn't be improved by reducing them from 2 disks to one. Exile would not be on that list. The filler is stacked up in this one like styrofoam peanuts.  If you whittle it down to a single disk, you get this (not in any order, and your mileage may vary): Rip This Joint Tumbling Dice Sweet Virginia Stop Breaking Down Rocks Off Let It Loose Loving Cup All Down the Line Happy  Shine A Light  Well that's a respectable lineup, and it might even surpass Beggar's Banquet, but it only equals Sticky Fingers and it doesn't touch Let It Bleed.  As for those who say Exile isn't an album but a place, I'm not sure I'm into the mystical stuff, but I left that place about 1975 and I don't care to go back there again.  I guarantee you nobody has bothered to clean up the half-empty beer bottles, the bloody needles and the discarded condoms.
