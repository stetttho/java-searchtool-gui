 Joan Osborne has never come close to reaching the level of her first major-label record. But few people have.  She can rock, she can blooz, she can even go folkie. This album sizzles from start to finish. "St. Theresa" starts it off strongly--every time I hear the opening of this song I think of the Doors' "L.A. Woman", but this actually a superior song. After that most of the tunes are more of the gutbucket, early-Bonnie-Raitt variety.  "Let's Get Naked" is as hot as the title implies; "Right Hand Man" is an irresistable scorcher; "Crazy Baby" closes it out (other than the throwaway "Lumina") in grand fashion.  And yes, I agree with those people who say that "One of Us" is one of the weaker cuts on the album. Although I will say this: to all you folks who said the song was irreverent and irreligious, go read the New Testament. The subject of this song is basically the central message of the gospel.
