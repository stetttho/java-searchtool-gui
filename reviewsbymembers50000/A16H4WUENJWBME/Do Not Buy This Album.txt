 Dylan has at least 10 albums that are better than this. You've heard all these songs on the radio anyway, but what you hear on the radio is far from his best stuff.  Here, in no particular order, are the 10 I would buy before this, even if the songs here were not available elsewhere:  Bringing It All Back Home Highway 61 Revisited Blood On The Tracks Blonde On Blonde The Bootleg Series Vol. 1-3 Infidels Oh Mercy Time Out of Mind Love and Sleep The Genuine Basement Tapes (which you won't find on Amazon) Greatest Hits Vol. 2 (MUCH better compilation)  Okay, that's 11, but I couldn't help myself. This should get you started. Even better, go see him in concert.
