 Some random thoughts about an album that seems put together at random:  1) It's a great children's album. Rocky Raccoon, Blackbird, Bungalow Bill, the one about Paul's dog, the one about the slide. And really, "doing it in the road" could mean just about anything, right?  My 4-year-old loves this record.  2)  John is at his best here.  Warm Gun, I'm So Tired, and Julia are among his best songs. If they had included "Across the Universe" in this collection as they should have, we could have gotten a whole disk of John's songs, followed by another disk of Paul and George. That would have been a gutsy move, and more satisfying to me than the way it was done.  3)  Honey Pie? Wild Honey Pie?  C'mon Paul, finish your work!  4) This should have been made as a single LP and it should have contained the following 17 tracks (not necessarily in order):  Back in the U.S.S.R. While My Guitar Gently Weeps Happiness Is A Warm Gun I'm So Tired Blackbird Julia Mother Nature's Son Across the Universe (from Anthology) Revolution One (or even better, the single) Dear Prudence Martha My Dear Rocky Raccoon Why Don't We Do It In The Road I Will Yer Blues Everybody's Got Something To Hide Except Me and My Monkey Helter Skelter   That might have been the greatest Beatles' album ever.
