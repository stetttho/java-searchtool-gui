 The thing about the Indigo Girls is - I KNOW they're over the top, overly earnest and self-conscious. I KNOW their lyrics don't really stand up to scrutiny. But I just don't care. Their spirit soars so high, and when they harmonize they're like a couple of birds in flight, an eagle and a dove, sometimes in unison, sometimes verging apart and coming back together just at the right moment, rising up and then swooping down for the kill.  I think it might be those harmonies more than anything that beguile me, because this is my favorite of their albums (tied with Rites of Passage) and it's the one with the most intricate harmony. There are so many great moments on hear, you just have to let go of the embarrassment you feel when faced with their openness and yearning.  Ride it out.  You'll be glad you did.
