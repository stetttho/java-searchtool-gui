 I love this book. I go back to it time after time to compare notes on my favorite bands, discover new bands, or just pick up some quirky trivia tidbits. Compare it to the latest reissue of the Rolling Stone guide - or try to, because there's no comparison. While some of these guides try to please everybody by delicately balancing rock, blues, pop, rap, etc., Strong mostly sticks with the mainstream of rock and its various alternative and indie offshoots. My only objection is that it is a British creation, and as such I tend to rely less on the evaluations of British bands, which he tends to overrate. The Brits, after all, don't even know who Dave Matthews is! But it's fun to read, the ratings are valuable and realistic (it's not necessary that you agree with them), and the discographies are all-inclusive. I look forward to every new edition of this book, and it's already started to date itself, so I hope the new one comes out soon.
