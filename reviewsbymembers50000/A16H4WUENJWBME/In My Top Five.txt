 Just for fun, listen to "Trip Through Your Wire" before anything else on this CD.  Why? Because it's the WORST song on Joshua Tree. Most groups would be happy to have it as their best. Whether you like the more radio-friendly tunes that open it, or the somewhat experimental diversions like "Bullet the Blue Sky" or "Exit," there's something here for everybody. The Joshua Tree represents Bono and Company's songwriting zenith, but that's not all. They play magnificently well as a band, and here you see the great leap forward they took over their first couple of albums.  "War" has songs that rival those here, but they are crudely produced and performed in slapdash fashion. Yes, sometimes a live performance in the studio gives the best result, but sometimes you're better off fashioning your output.  They had a lot of help with the crafting, from Brian Eno, Steve Lillywhite and Daniel Lanois, and it shows.  Each song has a dynamic, a sense of build to a climax and then a resolution. And the album as a whole has its own dynamic.  It feels like the journey of a lost soul through the desert, stumbling onto mirage after mirage, never really finding the promised land but holding up hope till the end. Or am I just reading too much into that cover?  U2 never equalled this album, not before or since.  Never came close.  But then, not many have.
