 If I said Griffin was the best songwriter of the last decade, it would only be an injustice to her amazing voice, which swoops from raw, rugged rockers to achingly beautiful ballads at the drop of a hat.  Listen to "Tony," a story of high-school guilt as seen over the shoulder of that big, fat slob in the front row (some of these shlumps went on to found software companies and become billionaires--not this one).  Then try "Wiggly Fingers," which is as sexy as anything by Joan Osborne or Lucinda Williams.  But finish off with the lullabies that wind the disk down, and you realize that this is not so much a departure from "Living With Ghosts" as a fulfillment of its promise.  If this is not Griffin's best CD (the material may be a bit stronger on Ghosts or 2001 Kisses), it's certainly her most versatile.
