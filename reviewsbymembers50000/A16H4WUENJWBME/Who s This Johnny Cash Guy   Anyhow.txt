 I know he's a legend and all, but do you really think his Tennessee Stud is better than Doc Watson's or his Man Who Couldn't Cry is better than Loudon Wainwright's?  When he ties Delia to that chair, I have to suppress a giggle.  I'm like, no way this guy owns a sub-mo-chine.   That being said, this is a pretty decent record.  There's that voice, of course.  And there's the backstory.  He survived prison and got off the junk and then he married well and had great kids.  So the one about the blood running down is pretty chilling.  But this one ain't a classic.
