 The Roches is the best debut album ever made. And it all starts, and ends, with three voices and a couple of acoustic guitars. Loudon Wainwright or Robyn Hitchcock might be funnier; the Indigo Girls might be more passionate; but nobody blends humor and passion like these sisters from "deepest New Jersey." Listen to the swelling dynamics of the harmonies on Hammond Song, Damned Old Dog and Runs In the Family. Just when you think a song is a total lark, it turns a corner into bathos - that overused word "epiphany" strikes me as appropriate in several instances. "The Married Men" is typical of a Roches-crafted song. It's a song that has a definite point of view, whether it is the songwriter's own experience or that of a fictional character.  It combines the wistfulness of the "other woman's" situation with the wry self-awareness of her predicament. There are no bass and drums on this album, and very few instruments other than the guitars. Yet there's a whole orchestra of harmoney and emotion. I could go on and on about this album. Instead, just buy it.
