 Nebraska is my favorite Springsteen album.  This is my second. I never like his band, and as for their overproduction - don't get me started! This is what Nebraska would have been if he'd wanted to record a quiet album but actually gone into the studio to do it. It's full of haunting images of what America once was, what it could be and what it really is if you only had the eyes to see. It's full of characters, the Border Patrolman who falls blindly in love (blind - get it?), the Vietnamese refugee whose life is spared by the last-minute compassion of his working-class neighbor (Commie sympathiser, indeed!). Youngstown, which got a little radio play, actually has a little hook to it, but also some great lyrics: "When I die don't send me to Heaven/I would not do Heaven's work well/Just send me...to the fiery furnaces of Hell." The title song is a beautifully understated psalm to the hobo's universe, with Bruce outdoing Henry Fonda on the coda to Steinbeck's opus.    Unless "Pink Cadillac" is your favorite Springsteen song, you owe it to yourself to get this one.
