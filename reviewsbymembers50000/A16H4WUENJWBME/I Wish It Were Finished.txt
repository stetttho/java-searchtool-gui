 Griffin went into the studio, but didn't like the results (too poppy), so they released the demo tapes.  And you still have one of the best debuts of the 90's, with at least 5 of its greatest 100 songs: Let Him Fly, Mad Mission, Poor Man's House, Sweet Lorraine, You Are Not Alone--wait a minute, why am I only giving this 4 stars?  Oh right, because it's rough around the edges, leaving you wanting more: on Sweet Lorraine, for example, don't you find yourself supplying the drums and bass that come in on verse two, and then the electric guitar rippling over the top of verse 3? Don't get me wrong, I'm all for simplicity and solo acoustic guitar, but Griffin is too talented to have let this one slip away.  Maybe one day she'll finish it.
