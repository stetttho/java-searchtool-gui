 Fairport isn't Fairport without both Richard Thompson and Sandy Denny, which is why this is the best place for a beginner to tap into this amazing band.  Other compilations such as "Meet on the Ledge" include too much of their less-productive years (which by the standards of most other groups would be considered fertile). It's a coin toss as to whether their best album is "Unhalfbricking" or "Liege and Leif."  I prefer the latter because I'm a folkie, but if you're into rock you might like the former (or you just like it for its great title). But those two albums alone don't give you enough of an introduction to Fairport, because you miss many great tunes like "Just A Roll." You would think that, because what made them so special at the time was their unique blend of British folk and rock, that they wouldn't age well as that genre has been done to death. You would think wrong.
