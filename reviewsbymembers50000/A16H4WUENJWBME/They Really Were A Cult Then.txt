 After much turmoil and gnashing of teeth, I've settled on Secret Treaties as my favorite BOC album. There's plenty of argument in favor of the two that preceded it, and maybe some for the one that followed, but it's amazing how quickly they went downhill as soon as "Don't Fear the Reaper" made them superstars. This is the one record that proves that "intelligent metal music" is not an oxymoron. As I write this I'm listening to "Flaming Telepaths" and getting to the buildup to the big ending, that suddenly trips over a dark cliff into the ethereal "Astronomy." It's one of the great moments in rock. But there are a dozen on this album, just as good. The bonus tracks are fun, too.
