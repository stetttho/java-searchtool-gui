 In the early 80's the Indigo Girls used to play at The Dugout, a tiny burrito joint (boy, I still remember my first chimichanga!) hidden in the back of a drugstore across the street from Emory University in Atlanta.  Anybody who had ears knew they were bound for stardom. There wasn't anything else like them back then.  Now that they have spawned hundreds of imitators, I've wondered why I haven't liked their recent work as much. Is it because it's just so familiar to us, or is the quality really off? Well, go back and listened to the first 4 albums and you'll see that their earlier talent has faded - not gone, but certainly not as strong as it used to be.  There's nothing here with the passion of "Blood and Fire" or the humor of "Galileo." I've listened to this CD several times now and nothing in it sticks in my memory.  I know, you shouldn't compare an artist's current work to their former glory. It's not fair. But with all that I've been through with the Indigo Girls, how can I help it?
