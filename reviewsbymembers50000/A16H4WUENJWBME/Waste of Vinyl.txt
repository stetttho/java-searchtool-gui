 I confess to being at a disadvantage writing this review because I didn't finish listening to the record. I couldn't. It just made me so depressed. I thought, this is one of the great bands of the 70's, reduced to pablum? At that time I didn't realize that this was an "outtakes" album. That might be an excuse, but it doesn't make it any better.
