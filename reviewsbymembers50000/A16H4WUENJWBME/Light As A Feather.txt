 When Cat Stevens got out of hospital (as the Brits say) in 1970, he had a catalog of songs that would stretch over 2 years and 3 albums. So why, I wondered, didn't he put all the best stuff on the first record? After all, most people would say Tea For the Tillerman and Teaser and the Firecat contained most of the Stevens classics.  Then it occurred to me that a lot of this music had already appeared in the movie Harold and Maude, so there may have been an attempt to tie it in with the movie release. THEN it occurred to me that this isn't really inferior stuff, even though sometimes you don't notice its brilliance the way you should. The great songs here are Trouble, I Think I See The Light, Katmandu and maybe Pop Star. The others are very good. All the songs have a weightlessness to them that might cause you to overlook the worthiness of the album on the whole. So in a way, the whole is not as good as the sum of its parts. But it's definitely worth checking out.
