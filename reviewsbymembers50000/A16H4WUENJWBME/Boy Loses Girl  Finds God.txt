 "How Did You Find Me Here" is like a wind-up clock that runs down before it gets to the end. But boy, those first six or seven songs are as strong a lineup you're gonna get from a singer-songwriter. Wilcox is rightly compared to James Taylor and John Gorka, but he could also be compared to the early Bruce Cockburn, another Christian songwriter that an atheist could listen to without taking offense. The title song sounds like an encounter with a lover, but it's really about God. "Eye of the Hurricane" is on my top ten list of great songs of all time. "Language of the Heart," though mightily sentimental, is heartfelt and touching because it gives a male point of view often reserved for women (Will you still love me tomorrow?). "Rusty Old American Dream" is one of the few fun songs on the CD, and uses a common Wilcox device of running an extended metaphor or "conceit" throughout the length of the tune. "Jamies Secret" uses the tune of the folk classic "Lord Maxwell" to grieve for a lost friend.  "Saturday They'll All Be Back Again" is the best song about cruising in a small town you'll ever hear. Okay, that's enough - just thinking about these great songs makes me want to listen to them again.
