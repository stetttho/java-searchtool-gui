 This is possibly the best film from one of our most brilliant and iconoclastic directors. It just shows that you can make total annihilation flat-out funny. Peter Sellers is amazing, and George C. Scott deservedly made a name for himself here.  Unfortunately, the film is not outdated, as its message is all too relevant to the world today. But don't worry about. If we all have to go, let's go like Slim Pickens did, ridin' that baby into the face of oblivion. And let's have a good laugh while we do it.
