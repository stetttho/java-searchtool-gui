 If you're over 40, it's almost impossible to realize how good this album is. You can't hear "Like A Rolling Stone" for the first time. The way that song changed music forever is something that is imprinted in our brains. (There's even a whole book about the song, by Greil Marcus.) But try to imagine not knowing anything about Bob Dylan and then flipping this into your Discman. You might be put off by the raspy, howling voice at first. You might, like the audiences in England ca. 1966, think the arrangements crude or outdated. But stick with it and you'll hear some of the best rock and roll there is. Dylan runs the gamut from anger (LARS, Ballad of a Thin Man) to humor (Tombstone Blues) to yearning (It Takes A Lot To Laugh) to satire (Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues) to Desolation Row, which is sort of a combination of all of the above wrapped in a delicate psychedelic haze. It may be a wee overstatement to say this, but if I were putting out 3 volumes of Dylan's Greatest Hits, Volume One would come from the albums before this one, Volume Two would be this one, and Volume 3 would come from the albums after this. Okay, I wouldn't try to put out any Greatest Hits, but you get the picture.
