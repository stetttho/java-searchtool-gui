 It never got any better than this from my point of view.  This is a much more piano-based than synthesizer-based album. They had not yet developed their trademark style - and that's a good thing! They were a bit more experimental here, delving into classical music more, showing off their chops (especially Emerson, but also Palmer on the instrumental Tank).  Side one (of the original LP) is wonderful.  "Take A Pebble" and "Knife-edge" are one of my favorite back-to-back sequences in rock. Side two fizzles a bit. There are two okay instrumentals, followed by the tedious, overplayed "Lucky Man."  Still, add it to your collection and then go out and get Tarkus and Brain Salad Surgery, and you've got almost all you need from ELP.
