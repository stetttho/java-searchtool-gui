 By the way, we never called it "Prog Rock" back in the day.  It was "Classical Rock."  Guess we thought these guys all sat around listening to Mozart and Bartok.  Yes actually do owe something to Brahms and Stravinsky, but they also owe to the Beatles. And even more to their own wildly inventive minds and virtuosic playing.  I go back and forth about which is better, this one or Close to the Edge.  I like Fragile today because it's more versatile. The solo cuts, which were added to finish off an incomplete album, work very well to complement and undercut the mammoth, self-conscious monolithic statements. Not only that, but sometimes the lyrics even make sense. In concert, Anderson talks about how "Heart of the Sunrise" was about the first time he heard his voice played back to him in the studio.  Oh well, sometimes these things are better left unknown. But it's a great tune, as are "Long Distance Runaround" and of course "Roundabout," which sounds as good on the radio today as it did 35 years ago.  Rick Wakeman rounds out an already-superb lineup, which includes one of the great bassist-showmen ever in Chris Squire, and the unsung guitar hero Steve Howe.  The only thing Yes didn't have that the other supergroups had was sex, but they had something even better--smarts.
