 I don't why Robyn Hitchcock is relegated to the left end of the radio dial. I guess people are too busy paying attention to Michael Jackson to follow a weirdo. If I were introducing somebody to Hitchcock, I'd give them this and point them to Perspex Island. There's also a chilling new addition, "Legalized Murder".
