 For those of you who think Lucinda Williams is a dirty lowdown country slut but you like her anyway, you'll thrill to Mary Gauthier. My favorite of many excellent songs is The Ledge, a scary tune about being at the bottom and looking up at all the jerks above you. The reason Gauthier hasn't yet hit the big time may be that she doesn't write enough songs about BOYS.  I mean, it worked for the Rolling Stones, but hey, this is a funny country.
