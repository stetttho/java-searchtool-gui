 For somebody who's not even a Southerner, Gillian Welch sure has the Southern mentality down pat.  This one isn't as good as her previous three albums, but it's close. The strongest song is the opener, Miss Ohio, which I believe is not an original. That shows that the songwriting is flagging just a bit. So if you don't know Gillian Welch at all, listen to the other three first, and if that's not enough, get this one.
