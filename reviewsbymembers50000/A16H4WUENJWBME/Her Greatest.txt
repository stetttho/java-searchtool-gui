 I was gratified to see all the reviews here stating that this is Joni Mitchell's best album. Let me add my voice to the throng. As beautiful as her earlier works are, this is her first that really delves into the inner workings of the artist. And even though the instrumentation is stripped to the basics, she does this with a variety of moods:  jocular on "Coyote," coy on "Blue Motel Room," ecstatic on "Black Crow" flying, and wistfully melancholic on the album's three greatest achievements: "Amelia," the title track, and "Refuge of the Road." The only song I don't like much is "Song for Sharon," which is about 7 minutes too long.   I was at a concert once where she said that Hejira is the album she likes to play songs from most.  It's no surprise.
