 I picked up this CD on a whim. All I knew of Merle Travis was "Nine-Pound Hammer" and his excellent picking and pleasant voice.  I didn't realize until reading the reviews here that these songs were re-recorded later in his career. It makes me want to pick up the originals, but I think he sounds great here. I never knew what a sense of humor he had. It would be fun to see him in concert.
