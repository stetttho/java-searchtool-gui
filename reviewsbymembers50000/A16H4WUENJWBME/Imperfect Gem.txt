 It's a tough call giving this 5 stars. There's not a catchy pop tune anywhere, yet it's some of the most soulful music ever made. Much is made of the improvisational nature of the performances; actually I think that's not one of the bonuses of the album. The jazz backing is pretty perfunctory. I don't like the flute at all. But there are such strong pieces here - Madam George, Ballerina - that make all the imperfections add up to a masterpiece.
