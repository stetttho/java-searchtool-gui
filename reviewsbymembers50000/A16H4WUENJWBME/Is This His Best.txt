 If not the best, this is Elvis's best effort since Armed Forces. There's not a weak song on it. I thrilled to first 3 songs, thinking surely the energy would flag toward the end. Then I got to songs 4, 5 and 6, still as excited as at the beginning - and we still haven't gotten to Dust, one of his wittiest, or Tart, one of his most plaintive (and which looks forward to Delivery Man, the worthy follow-up).  I love the clever play-on-numbers of 45, the world-weary Eurotrash faux technopop of the title song.  I could go on and on. Stop reading reviews and just get the dang CD!
