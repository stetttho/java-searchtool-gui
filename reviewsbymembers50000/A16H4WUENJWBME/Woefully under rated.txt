 The critics savaged this record when it first came out. Why I'm not sure, since they seemed to like Thick As A Brick - so it wasn't the length of it that bothered them. In fact, an advance of it was released to radio stations that "cut up" the song into ten "edits." Fact is, those edits play very well as individual songs.  I don't think you have to know about the philosphical underpinnings and Danteesque plot to like APP. Just listen to the sound. It's eerie, as perfectly befits a trip to the nether world, but it's also beautiful and uplifting. I agree with those who say the fairy tale in the middle spoils the mood.  The first half of Side Two (of the original LP) contains simply some of the best rock music ever created.
