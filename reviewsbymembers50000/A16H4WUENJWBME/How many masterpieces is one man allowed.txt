 After listening to this CD for four years, I stick with my initial reaction: it ranks up there with "Bringing It All Back Home,""Highway 61 Revisited" and "Blood on the Tracks."  Which is to say it's one of the all-time great rock albums. If the songwriting is not quite as consistently strong as his earlier work, the performances and production values certainly are.  "Time Out of Mind" was a confessional album harking back to "Blood on the Tracks" (in mood if not in delivery), but "Love and Theft" both swings and thumps. It can be wryly humorous or weightily prophetic, more in keeping with the underrated "Infidels." Who besides Dylan could summon up the authority to deliver lines like "I'm gonna stand undefeated, I'm gonna speak to the crowd,/I'm gonna teach peace to the conquered, I'm gonna tame the proud" and not sound daft?  That's from "Lonesome Day Blues," one of the thumping highlights.  Another is "Honest With Me," with an irresistible guitar riff by the great Charlie Sexton. These rockers are interspersed with swingers like "Mississippi" and "Moonlight." Kicking off the album is one of the in-betweeners, "Tweedle-dum and Tweedle-Dee," which sets up the ferocious energy of the CD but also its knife-edge irony.  And to those people who say Dylan's voice sounds horrible? Just go back to your "American Idol" rehashes and have a ball. The man has never been in better voice. Sure he can't hit the high notes anymore, but he doesn't need to - that aging croak commands the full range of human emotion.  What we have here is an aging artist who's having a lot of fun, who answers to noone, and who knows how to help others make him sound good.  Feast on it!
