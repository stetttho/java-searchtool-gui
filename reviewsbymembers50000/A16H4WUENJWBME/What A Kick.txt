 What a cool idea - to take an album the Boss never finished and--well, finish it off. I know some people love the stark simplicity of the original, but let's face it--they were basement tapes, demos that never received a proper production because Bruce was skipping labels. However, the makers of Badlands decide not to finish the album as they think Springsteen might have (that album might have garnered 5 stars), but to offer their own interpretations.  There are some oddball choices here, like Chrissy Hynde and Dar Williams, but others, like Johnny Cash and Ben Harper, just flat out work.  And I get a kick out of Son Volt's "Open All Night." Even though you can't really explain lyrics like "Hey ho rock and roll deliver me from nowhere" when Jay Farrar's vocal sounds like a barbiturated lullabye.  But that's what's great about really good tribute albums: they help you look at a song from another angle, one you may not have looked at before.  Often the original angle was the one you really wanted, but seeing the subject from a new perspective can only increase its dimensions.
