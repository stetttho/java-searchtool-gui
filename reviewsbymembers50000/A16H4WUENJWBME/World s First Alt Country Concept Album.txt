 Actually, it's neither. Wilco has long outgrown the alt-country label, and the little spriggets (don't Googol that, it's a made-up word) of radio static and cool electronic stuff don't make for a concept. A lot of people think Heavy Metal Drummer is the best thing on the disk, and they're not just being mainstream. It's catchy and doesn't pretend to more than it is. But, despite 3 or 4 good songs (Reservations, Pot Kettle Black), what I take away from this CD is that British lady repeating those "enigmatic" call letters for about 15 minutes.  And I don't see how that makes for a concept album, or a classic.  The songs are better on "A Ghost Is Born," so pick that one up instead.
