 I was extremely disappointed when this album came out because Bruce was one of my favorite artists at the time, and he'd just put out what I considered (and still do) his two best works, Dancing In The Dragon's Jaws and Humans. The only songs I like on this are "You Pay Your Money And You Take Your Chance" and "The Loner," both of which can be found elsewhere. (I see they added "The Coldest Night Of The Year" to this reissue, so that's a plus.) I just hate the idea of somebody who didn't know Cockburn's output picking this up and thinking, what's the big deal?
