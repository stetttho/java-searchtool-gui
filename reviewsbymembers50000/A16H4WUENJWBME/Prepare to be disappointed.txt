 Nothing here stands out like the previous three CDs, except "Standing" which I'd already heard on the Silver Bell EP. "Kite" and "Rowing Song" are good, but only in comparison to the rest of the album. On her other albums they would be throwaways. Still, Patty is Patty - the incredible voice and sensibility make it worth more than a listen.
