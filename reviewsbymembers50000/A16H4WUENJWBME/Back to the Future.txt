 From the opening riffs of this CD, this forty-something ex-prog-rocker was transported back to the golden age of rock, when you were allowed to use more than three chords and didn't have to sing about what a pain life is. True, Spock's Beard is derivative--a single chord progression echoes Yes, King Crimson, Genesis, and Jethro Tull--but that's the whole idea.  They breathe fresh new life into a dying genre.  And such virtuosity! Rarely has a group of such talented musicians come together on such a complex project.  With new sound technology and the ability to expand tracks to CD-length, they are in some ways able to improve on the old prog gods.  Yes, I miss Jon Anderson's voice and Peter Gabriel's lyrics - but this is a pretty first step back to the future.
