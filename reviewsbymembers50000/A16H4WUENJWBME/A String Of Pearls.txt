 Solitude Standing is one of 4 albums from the late 80's (the others being The Joshua Tree, So, and Graceland) that redeemed a pretty worthless decade, musical-mainstream-wise. If "delicate" is not a compliment to you, click away from this screen. Vega's songs are textured like filigreed lace, self-consiously poetic confections that stand alone as perfectly polished gems, but fit together even better as an ensemble. If you came to this album through "Luka," note that it is the hardest thing on the album, in terms of both musical arrangement and the hard-bitten cynicism of its subject matter. Not exactly "Smells Like Teen Spirit," but everything is relative. From there Vega veers off into urban reverie, romantic mythmaking, and literary heartbreak. Hearing her songs, you feel she just put down her Virginia Woolf and picked up her guitar. Her craft works to magical perfection on the title song, "Gypsy," "Language," and to some degree on the #1 hit that made her famous. Other songs sometimes fall apart under the weight of their own pretensions. But Vega never improved the delicate balance of folk sentiment with rock irony, not even when she changed to a more "pop" sound in the 90's.
