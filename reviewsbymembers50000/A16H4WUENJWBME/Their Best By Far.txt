 Chicago made three decent albums and then went downhill fast after the death of their best songwriter. The "Make Me Smile" suite is a highlight, as are "Fancy Colours" and the other single, "25 or 6 to 4." (Hey, it only took me 15 years to get that this song is about a guy who's awake at 3:34 or 3:35 a.m.) I also liked the closer (of the original record), "Where Do We Go From Here?"  But in retrospect that songs sounds a little too much like their future singles, most of which are abominations on the face of the earth. Anyway, get this if you want a little meat to go with your cheese.
