 There are 3 classic songs on this album:  "Planet Claire," "Rock Lobster," and the Limburger Song--er, "Dance This Mess Around."  That's 3 more than most albums from people who are still learning to play their instruments. It sounds less revolutionary now than it did up in Athens in 1979, but it's still a lot of fun. The girl singers are so good, I wish Fred would just stick to dancing instead of "singing."  The B's would go on more sophisticated musical projects, but nothing they ever did was this fresh.
