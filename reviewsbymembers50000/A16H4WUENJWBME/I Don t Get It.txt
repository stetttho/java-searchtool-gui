 Take some stale puns and rehashed jokes that wouldn't have made the cut on Saturday Night Live, a guitarist who thinks playing fast is playing well, a second-rate band that can't decide if it's rock or jazz, and you've got Frank Zappa. He was a trailblazer for freedom of speech and I admire him for that.  But if you want funny, try Loudon Wainwright.
