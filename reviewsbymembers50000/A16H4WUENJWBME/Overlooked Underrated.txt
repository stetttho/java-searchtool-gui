 It's not as good as his phenomenal debut, but this one is a hidden gem. There aren't wall-to-wall beauties like the first one, but at least three strongs stand among Edwards' finest:  Hearts Overflowing (an ideal wedding song), White Line and the title song. The production is a little too lush, and lacks the acoustic immediacy of the debut.  So I keep comparing this album to "Jonathan Edwards" and coming up short. Still, if you've got that one and are looking for more, this may be the next place to go.
