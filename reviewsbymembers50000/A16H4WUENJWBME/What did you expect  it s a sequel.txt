 Of course it's not as good as the first. They took the best material they had and used it on Volume 1. Well, mostly. Somehow they left behind "Remember the Mountain Bed," a wistful song with a fairy-tale quality; "Joe Dimaggio's Done It Again," a rollicking period piece; and "Feed Of Man," which I'm still a little puzzled by, but in a good way. I just noticed that the three songs I've mentioned are all sung by Jeff Tweedy. That may be a coincidence, but he does seem to take the reins of this project over from Billy Bragg. Bragg fans needn't worry, though; it's all about the lyrics, and the legacy of the greatest folksinger ever.
