 I realize I'm alone here, but Steve Winwood's voice reminds me of a cat trapped in a burlap bag with a mouse stuck in its throat. This may have been a good album for the mid-80's, but it was this kind of drek that gave rise to the "alternative" scene a few years later.  There's one song I like here, "The Finer Things," but listen to it interpreted by someone who understands it, like Linda Thompson or Delores Keane, and you may see what I mean. If not, by all means enjoy!
