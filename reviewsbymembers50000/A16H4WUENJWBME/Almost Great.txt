 I love Sinead O'Connor.  I love that she doesn't care what people think of her. Or, even better, she does care, but she does what she needs to do anyway. I think that's the sign of a great artist. Heck, I even like her bald head.  Oh, and then there's the music. Don't let it be overshadowed by her public persona, because the music is what it's about. If I don't give 5 stars to this CD, it's because some of the choices are odd. "Don't Cry For Me, Argentina"?  How about "Rebel Song" or "Three Babies"? Still, I did hear some of my favorites here: "Mandinka," "The Emporer's New Clothes,""I Am Stretched On Your Grave," etc. etc. And for those of you who came to Sinead because of the Prince cover- well, that's in here too.
