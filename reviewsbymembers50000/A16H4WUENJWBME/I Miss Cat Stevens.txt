 I've been listening to old Cat Stevens records lately, trying to decide if they're as good now as they were when I was 15. They are. (Reminds me of the line in Sunset Boulevard: "I AM big. It's the PICTURES that got small.") This is the album where Stevens ran out of the songs he had written when he was incapacitated with TB for 2 years. I'm guessing the ballads like "The Wind" and "How Can I Tell You" were old stuff, since they sound more like Tea For The Tillerman, while the newer stuff had harsher, more ethnic rhythms ("Bitterblue," "Peace Train"). Hey, we didn't know it at the time, but Cat Stevens was really the forerunner of the World Music explosion 2 decades on! While there's really nothing on this album that doesn't work, the songs are too mainstream to make me want to play them over and over. "Morning Has Broken," the adaptation of a ditty by religious poetaster Eleanor Farjeon, is the prettiest of many pretty songs, but the lyrics are second-rate Cat. If you like the soft stuff on this album, go back and listen to Tea For the Tillerman or Mona Bone Jakon. If you like the more upbeat jangly rhythms, fast-forward to Catch Bull at Four or his last decent album, Numbers.  He IS good, it's the MUSIC industry that sucks.
