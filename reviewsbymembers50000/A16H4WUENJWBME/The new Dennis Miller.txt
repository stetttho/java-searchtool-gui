 This is the funniest book I've read in years. I never watched "Politically Incorrect" because I thought the idea of bowling over all the cliches in our society was something of a cliche in itself. And the panel format bored me. But Mahr is actually a great writer! For the people who think he is smug and condescending: yes, exactly that's the point. He also happens to be spot-on most of the time. George Carlin is too much of a curmudgeon to be taken seriously. Al Franken is too understated, and Dennis Miller - he's as passe as a Victorian snood, baby. The format is perfect for the attention-deficient TV generation: little snippets of wisdom, most shorter than one page, each with its own pithy point of view. And while Mahr is generally left of center (something else I didn't know), he has plenty of barbs for the Democrats or just the marshmallow-minded. I couldn't pick out a favorite; there are too many. And some of them are X-rated, so you wouldn't have heard them on TV. Get this book.  When I say LOL, I really mean LOL!
