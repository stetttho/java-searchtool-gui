 Hey Lord Chimp, as a reviewer you are one cool dude. I read your review and it made me go back and listen to this. I've changed my rating from 3 stars to 4. This is an album I've always admired a hell of a lot--just didn't really enjoy listening to it all that much. It's like Pink Floyd, King Crimson and Radiohead wrapped into one.  It's not as "neoprog" as Spock's Beard or The Flower Kings --too much influence from the 90's.  And the tunes don't exactly grab you, but they do sneak up.  It's loud, meaty, sometimes harsh, occasionally lyrical - a beautiful piece of work.
