 Steve Farrar is known for his books targeted to men. Writing with his wife, Mary, he addresses both men and women who do too much in this book. This small volume contains Biblical advice for combating the drive to do too much, and to cope when life's circumstances cause almost unbearable pressure. Farrar is one of the best writers in the Christian market - he communicates a warmth and sense of humor that make the material more understandable. Highly recommended.
