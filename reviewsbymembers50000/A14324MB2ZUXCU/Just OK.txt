 It's hard to argue with the rationale for this book, or with any of the doctrinal positions. So why not a five-star review? Because the book promotes a poor sense of proportion. A critique of "Wild at Heart," which I have not read, gets as much space as an analysis of an (unconvincing) diatribe against altar calls. It just didn't make much of an impact on me, except the chapters written MacArthur himself.
