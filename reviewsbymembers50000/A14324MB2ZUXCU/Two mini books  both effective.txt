 This book is Zell Miller's account of his awakenening to the moral bankruptcy of the Democratic party and his response, AND a summary of his opinions on the major issues facing the day. He does each memorably. But this book might have been even more effective if he had chosen one of these directions and stuck with it in more detail. I would have preferred more about his political awakening.
