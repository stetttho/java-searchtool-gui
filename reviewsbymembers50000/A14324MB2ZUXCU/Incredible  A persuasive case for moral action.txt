 Rod Parsley is most definitely NOT your typical conservative Christian preacher. In this book, he cuts through the clutter of conflicting extremes and makes a very persuasive case for people concerned with the moral decay of America to get out of the pews and take action. In chapters covering topics as diverse as judicial tyranny, race, poverty, Islam and life issues, Parsley shows both boldness and compassion. This book could well be the catalyst that starts a moral revolution in America.
