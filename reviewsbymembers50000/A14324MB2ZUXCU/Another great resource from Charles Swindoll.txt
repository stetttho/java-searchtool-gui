 I heartily recommend this book. It is an insightful biography, and the contemporary applications Swindoll gleans from Paul's life are helpful. Swindoll is one of the great expository writers of our time and this book certainly adds to that legacy. I appreciated this volume more than his biography of Moses and almost as much as his book about the life of David.
