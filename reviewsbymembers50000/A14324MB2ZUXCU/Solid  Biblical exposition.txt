 I love studying MacArthur's books. He doesn't write terribly well, but he is thorough and insighful. This is one of his better books. It's a study of the crucifixion  - written well before the movie The Passion of the Christ and so obviously not written to capitalize on the film, as other books on this topic seem to be. He focuses on how God displayed His sovereignty through the events of the crucifixion. Very, very well done.
