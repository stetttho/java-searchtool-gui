 Readers of Charles Swindoll know what they're in for - a well-written, scripturally sound treatment of the subject at hand. This is, to my knowledge, the first time Swindoll has tackled spiritual disciplines, and he's as insightful as ever. Excellent review for mature Christians, and a good beginning text for those new to the faith.
