 John MacArthur is the gold standard for Biblical exposition in the 21st century church. But this book is one of the weakest of his I've read. Two problems: it doesn't do much to live up to its subtitle - How to Understand, Study and Apply God's Word. There's very little of that here, just one chapter on study methods and none on application. Second, it may just seem like he plugs his study bible in every chapter. But he doesn't miss many. It's jarring to see someone you respect so much as a teacher selling another book in one of his books.  What is here is a solid and profound defense of the Bible as the Word of God. It would have been worth five stars if it had been titled properly and not fashioned into a sales tool for his study Bible.
