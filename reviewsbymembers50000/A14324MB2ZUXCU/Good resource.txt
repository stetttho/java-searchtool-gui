 If you've committed to reach through the Bible once a year, as I have, you'll probably benefit from MacArthur's approach here. He's arranged the New King James Version into 365 daily readings. Each day features a selection from the Old Testament, Psalms, Proverbs and the New Testament. There's also an expository note based on that day's reading - that's the most distinctive feature of this resource. MacArthur is the gold standard for expositors as far as I'm concerned, so it's good news. I've used other reading programs that I like better, but this works just fine.
