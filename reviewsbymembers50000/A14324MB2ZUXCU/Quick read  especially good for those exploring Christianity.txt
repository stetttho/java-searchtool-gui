 This book is a favorite of a member of my small group, a guy who is especially interested in workplace ministry. In that context, this is a great book - it's non-threatening and interesting while sticking to biblical truth. For the mature Christian, it's more of a pleasant diversion. I enjoyed it, but I think it would be more effective in the hands of someone who doesn't quite yet believe.
