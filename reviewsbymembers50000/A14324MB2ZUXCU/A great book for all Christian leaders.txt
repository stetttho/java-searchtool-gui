 If your church is interested in winning the lost to Christ, everyone in leadership should read this book and then decide together what they should do to build on the great ideas here. Warren has many critics who claim his methods aren't biblical. It's clear they haven't read this book. This is the most biblical book about how to "do church" that I have read. Full of good ideas, many of which I hope our church will implement or at least consider.
