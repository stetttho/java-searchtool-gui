 This is a great book for anyone who wants to understand what happens to people who experience great loss in their lives - whether through death, divorce, unemployment or illness. And it would be effective for anyone who is called to minister to people who have suffered or are suffering great loss. Sittser weaves his own experience and those of others into his discussion effectively. There is not the Biblical basis for his views I would have liked to have seen - odd for a professor of religion. But, it's well worth the time of anyone struggling with loss or ministering to those in that situation. And face it, sooner or later that's all of us.
