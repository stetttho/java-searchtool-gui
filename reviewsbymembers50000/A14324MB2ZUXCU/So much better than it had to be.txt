 I was one of many readers who felt the creative steam left the Left Behind Series three or four books before it limped to a conclusion. This is a return to form. Telling the stories of Nicolae Carpathia and Ray Steele as young men must have gotten Jerry Jenkins interested again. A pleasant diversion.
