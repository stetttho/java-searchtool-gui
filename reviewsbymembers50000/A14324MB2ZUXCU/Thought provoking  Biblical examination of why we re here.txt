 I liked this book a lot. I think it could be especially valuable for new Christians. Like The Prayer of Jabez, it's been incredibly hyped and it's not quite as good as advertised, but no book could be as good as PDL is purported to be.  I typically read a chapter a day during my devotional time and I could see myself going through the book many times that way. If you look hard enough you will find something that you will not agree with. Looking at some of the reviews I've read, lots of people have looked very hard and have gotten themselves all worked up over just these type of picayune details. But what you'll remember out of this book is the five purposes, and it's impossible to quarrel with those on doctrinal grounds.  The pastor of our Bible-believing church is encouraging all of us to read this book, and I'm glad he has. If Christians took the message of this book seriously we'd be a living demonstration of WWJD.
