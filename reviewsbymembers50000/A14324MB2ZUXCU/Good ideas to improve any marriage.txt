 This is a well-written book about the differences between the genders. The Rosbergs may have let their egos get the best of them when they allowed themselves to be labeled "America's Family Coaches," but that ego isn't otherwise much in display on these pages. They have a humility that is refreshing in Christian books. Insightful and full of real-life examples that will help most readers understand how they can better understand their spouses.
