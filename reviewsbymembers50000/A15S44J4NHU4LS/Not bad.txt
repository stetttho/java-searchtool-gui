 The title Analyst is kind of misleading.  When I picked up the book and saw the blurred outlines of a man and a train, I figured this would have something to do with a financial analyst, you know, the Wall Street type.  Even though this book is mainly set in New York City, it's about a psychoanalyst (a shrink).  (I didn't even know this type of professional exists.  I've heard of psychiatrists and psychologists, but never psychoanalysts.  It sounds like one of those bogus professions like tarot card reading.) So, Dr. Frederick Starks (Ricky) is a psychoanalyst that receives a threatening letter on his 53rd birthday telling him to find out the true identity of the letter writer (signed Rumpelstiltskin) within 15 days or risk losing his patients and relatives.  To show that Rumpelstiltskin means business, one of his patients commits an apparent suicide by jumping in front of a train.  At the same time, Ricky starts to understand how much control Rumpelstiltskin has over his life, his bank accounts, his relatives, his identity.  It's a race against time for Ricky as his every move is anticipated and thwarted.  It seems hopeless.  Ricky could end the game at any time by taking his own life. Without giving away the plot, let me just say this story is divided into two sections.  Let's call it the Old Ricky and the New Ricky.  In the Old Ricky, Dr. Starks lives a really dull, predictable and mundane life.  In the New Ricky, he turns into a character right out of a Robert Ludlum novel.  We're talking about Ricky displaying spy-type characteristics and instincts.  To be honest, it bothered me a little.  The author made no mention and gave no inkling what abilities, talents and hobbies the Old Ricky had to justify the stuff he did in New Ricky (hence my comment for the P rating below). This story is not as fast paced as I would like it to be, but the plot is original.  I hope my rating system below will help you decide whether or not this is a book you would like to read. LEAP rating (each out of 5): ============================ L (Language) - 3 (all the characters take on the tone of the psychoanalyst, each thought is clearly articulated, not much variation) E (Erotica) - 0.5 (one totally unnecessary flashing scene) A (Action) - 2 (two tame action sequences at the end, a lot of going around town searching for clues and meeting people) P (Plot) - 3.5 (interesting, but characters are not fully integrated into it)
