 The story is very simple.  It's about a champion ballroom dancer who has always wanted to dance his own unconventional steps.  Doing so, however, he might please the crowd, but not the judges.  Three weeks before the Pan Pacific competition, Scott Hastings (the protagonist) has a falling out with his partner for this reason.  Little does he know that by teaching a beginner to dance the way he wants to dance, his world would be turned upside down.  At the core, this is a lovestory between Scott and his "ugly-duckling" student Fran (short for Francesca). The choreography is nothing short of stunning.  The dancing is an integral part of the movie.  It tells part of the story.  The protagonist ends up learning a new style of dancing called Para Dos (Spanish for "for two") as he reaches a point in the story where he realizes that his life is not to be lived alone anymore; when he finds love. This film catapulted Baz Luhrmann's career.  He eventually followed up with films like Romeo and Juliet and Moulin Rouge, incorporating a similar style of audacious characters with love songs from the 80s.  Another reason why I like his films is for the humor.  You leave feeling cheerful.  I guess I'm still a kid at heart, and I like my stories to end "... and they lived happily ever after." LEAP rating (each out of 5): ============================ L (Language) - 4 (the dancing and music helped in telling the story as well) E (Erotica) - 0 (n/a - unfortunately) A (Action) - 0 (n/a - the dancing was amazing) P (Plot) - 3 (simple love story)
