 This is the first Jonathen Kellerman I've read.  I was really engrossed after reading the first few chapters, but my interest kind of waned somewhere mid-way through the book.  Perhaps my expectations were set up wrong.  The back page blurb did such a good job of exaggerating what I was going to find out about the underground world of sex and whoring that it was too good to pass up ;).  Instead what I did find was the dynamic duo of Alex and Milo going around town interrogating people (i.e. not much action).  I guess that's what a psychological thriller is all about, and the plot twist at the end was pretty clever.  Nonetheless, I was less impressed leaving the book as I was starting it.  Perhaps this book does merit a 3.5~4, but reviews are subjective and the more I write about it the more convinced I am that a 3 fits. All I'm saying is that you might enjoy this book more if you don't go in expecting to find insider information on illicit activities of the underground world, or a deep love story between two people.  I'd be interested in seeing what other adventures Alex Delaware has gone through.
