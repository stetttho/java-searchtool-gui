 It takes batteries or power from a wall outlet.  It comes with a tape adaptor and head phones.  It's light.  It has anti-skip.  I've seen complaints about it not having support for ID3 naming for the MP3 songs, but seriously once you put a disc in and start playing it in your car do you really need to read the title?   I would say that as a car unit it's great.  As a portable player I'd look for something else.
