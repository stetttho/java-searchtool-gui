 One of the very first novels I read was Coma by the same author.  And I loved it.  I even got my sister hooked on him.  However, I have to agree with many of the reviews on this list.  My biggest complaint about this book is how fake the dialogue is between the characters.  The action sequences (or lack thereof) slightly builds and never finishes.  The psychological aspects of what the characters had to go through don't have any realism.  Sad to say that although this book is very simply written and easy to understand and follow, it contains a rather predictable plot.  Moreover, cloning has such broad implications that to waste it by focusing on the Wingate clinic and its facilities and security system is shameful. I really hope the next novel I read by this author doesn't fall into the same pitfalls this one does.
