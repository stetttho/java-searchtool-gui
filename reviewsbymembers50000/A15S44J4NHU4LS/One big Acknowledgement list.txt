 I believe the other reviewers have done a great job in summarizing this book, so I won't reinvent the wheel.  Instead, I'd like to focus on my impressions of the book. * It felt like a long Acknowledgement list.  In it, Jack must have mentioned over 50 names who have in any way, shape or form have had contact with Jack.  He naturally puts all these names in the context of a story.  Perhaps this was his intention.  After all, "Straight from the Gut" could've been what he felt when he wrote a list entitled "My Heartfelt Thanks To".  But after a few chapters and dozens of names later, I was completely confused about the timeline and relevance of these names. * It most definitely is NOT a business book!  If it were meant to be a business book, I believe the reader will be sorely disappointed.  In this book, he spends a short chapter in the end recapping some of the principles he's stood by as chairman of GE that have made him successful.  I felt it was "too little and too late in the book" to have made any impact on the reader as a business book. * It's not exactly a groundbreaking autobiography either.  Although I wish he had kept his tone in the first few chapters (while describing his childhood) for the rest of the book.  Those first few chapters were precious.  In it, Jack described how vulnerable he felt as a child.  What his family situation was like.  His motivations.  His sources of inspiration.  After he started work for GE was when the book started a downhill descent and never recovered. * After reading the book, did I think Jack Welch was "King of the World" and "Mr. Perfect"?  No, he made mistakes along the way (professional as well as personal).  Did I learn anything from him?  Maybe (to surround myself with competent people).  Could this book have been better?  Yes (I wish he talked straight from the gut).
