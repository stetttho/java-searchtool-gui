 This is the first book I've read by Robert Ludlum.  And from the likes of it, I'd be encouraged to read more (there's always The Bourne Identity which comes out in theaters next summer to start with).  The author's technique of covering multiple story threads occuring at the same time was well used.  You could picture the scenes to a mental movie quite vividly.  He doesn't give the protagonist in the story unbelievable traits.  In fact, he makes the male protagonist (Ben Hartmann) downright sensitive with her interactions with the female protagonist (Anna Navarro).  There were lots of twists and turns in this story, until the last few chapters.  What seemed really suspenseful at the beginning, quickly degenerated into preachiness in the last few pages as the author explains the logical reasoning behind the sinister plot to preserve the world's leading industrial/political icons.  The story is mainly set in Europe around Switzerland.  I like the fact that the author describes his surroundings and interactions with people in these countries in their native vocabulary (usually in italics), then explains them again in English for the benefit of the reader.  I'd like to think I learned a thing or two about those countries he mentioned. All in all, it was a fascinating read.  Pick up a copy today!
