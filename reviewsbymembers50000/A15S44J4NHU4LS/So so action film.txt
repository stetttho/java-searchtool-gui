 I've never watched the original Shaft, so I have nothing to base this remake on.  It's not a very serious action film.  Jeffrey Wright and Busta Rhymes providing most of the comic relief.  It is interesting to note that Richard Rountree (the original shaft) and Gordon Parks (the original director) played parts in this film. After watching this film, I can say I don't mind it.  I've seen a lot worse, and I've seen better.  Atleast with this film, you have Samuel Jackson playing another cool, suave character.  It's too bad Venessa William didn't play a more integral part to the story.  I would've liked to see a better dynamism between the two.  But then again Shaft has always been a lone-ranger of sorts. This is not a plot-heavy story.  It's about a rich kid that murders an African American, but this crime is witnessed by a waitress who goes into hiding after being threatened.  Shaft is disheartened by the inadequacy of the system and decides to investigate on his own.  Like I said, not plot-heavy. LEAP rating (each out of 5): ============================ L (Language) - 3 (nothing special, except for Jeff Wright's almost incomprehensible speech) E (Erotica) - 1 (opening sequence and a good kiss scene) A (Action) - 3.5 (unapologetic killings) P (Plot) - 2 (simple plot)
