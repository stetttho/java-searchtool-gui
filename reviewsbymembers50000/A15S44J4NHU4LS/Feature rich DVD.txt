 This DVD is feature packed with: * behind the scene looks of how each of the major stunts were performed.  (And I was amazed to see how many of the actual scenes Tom Cruise performed himself.  The final mano-a-mano showdown with the leap and cartwheel kicks were actually performed by him as well.)   * a DVD-ROM section if your computer is hooked up to the internet * an MTV spoof by Ben Stiller with him as stuntman/double Tom Crooze.  It's hilarious.   * a Metallica music video "I Disappear" * commentaries from Ang Lee (explaining a lot of the motivations behind why he chose to film certain scenes the way he did), Robert Towne (the writer), Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner (producers), and the other actors/actresses in the film.  It was both educational and fun to watch. On top of that you get the two hour film in crystal clear quality.  What more could you ask for! I highly recommend adding this to the Action section of your DVD collection!
