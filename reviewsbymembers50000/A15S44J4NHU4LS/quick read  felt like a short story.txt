 I've never read any of Grisham's other novels.  However, it was due to Grisham's "bankable" name (as one reviewer pointed out) that I even noticed this book at all.  The story is very well written and the characters' ideosyncracies add a touch of realism.  The main character's frustrations about Christmas and the cost it involves ring a bell.  (I would love to "skip" a christmas.)  When I read this book, I somehow felt as if it were one of O Henry's short stories.  Maybe it's just me.  But if you want a quick escape for a few hours on some light reading, then this is a good book for you. On another level, I'm not sure if this novel tries to teach a lesson (if at all).  I'm Catholic, and to me, it's trying to say that if I were to pause and reflect a while I'd have realized that a lot of what we do in the name of tradition has no connection to the birth of Christ 2000 years ago.  Or maybe this novel has a motivational purpose.  It tells you to treat your neighbors (people all around you) right because you never know when you'll need their help.
