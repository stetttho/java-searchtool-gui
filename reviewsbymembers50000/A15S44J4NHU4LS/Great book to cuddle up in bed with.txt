 I don't believe I missed a chance to write a review for this book when it first came out (that's almost 5 months ago).  I would have urged the reader to pick up a copy. It's the first Sandra Brown book I've read, and I was impressed.  (It wasn't until later on that I realized she was a romance novel writer.)  I had wondered how she so adroitly manages the emotional aspect of the novel while still maintaining a rythmic plot.   I was skeptical to pick up the book at first.  Reading the back cover you know it's about a gifted writer who writes the first portion of a manuscript and sends it to a (married) publisher he has singled out.  The publisher soon suspects that the story being told might be truer to life than the author would have her believe (and a relationship forms).  And that's just the beginning. The plot has all the key elements I look for in a suspense novel: murder, revenge, sex and a twist at the end.  The author is able to give each of the characters depth in the book through Parker Evans' (male protagonist in the novel) manuscript.  (I felt this was a more clever device than just flat out narrating a history.)  The author makes it clear what each character is thinking and feeling.  It's not just a whodunnit book like the ones Mary Higgins Clark writes.  There's real character development in this book.  Chapter-by-chapter a past is laid out, motives are formed and the plot crystallizes.   The reader of this novel should realize that this novel doesn't have much physical action in it.  Most of the action is of the emotional sort. Lastly, it turns out by reading the forewards of the author's other novels, she has a predilection for happy endings (undoubtedly from her romance novel past).  I truly hope that she continues to write novels of this romance-suspense sort. FLAP rating: F:3.5 L:4 A:3 P:4.5 * For a more detailed explanation of how my FLAP rating system works.
