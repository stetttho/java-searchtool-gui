 This is the fourth book in the Ender series by Orson Scott card.  The series starts out with the fast-paced, action packed Ender's Game, then moves on to the relationship oriented Speaker for the Dead.  The next book in the series is the preachy Xenocide and finally ends with the long winded, highly incredulous Children of the Mind.  As a friend of mine said, Card milked it for all it's worth.  In fact, the author created another series devoted to a character in a parallel timeline to Ender's Game. What did I not like about this book?  The dialogue for the most part was horrible.  At any point in the story a character is bound to be giving a monologue on something.  Some characters speak and bicker like kids one moment and turn around and sound like psychologists with measured words the next.  This is really a story about Jane.  Ender's role as a provider, healer and source of strength ended with Speaker for the Dead.  It's too bad the author decided to leave the second and third books incomplete.  You really need to read this book to have closure on Ender's life.  But to read this book is to devote time and energy to a particulary limp and lame story. Don't you miss the days of the award-winning Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead? LEAP rating (each out of 5): ============================ L (Language) - 2 (did Orson Scott Card really write this drivel?) E (Erotica) - 0 (n/a) A (Action) - 0.5 (the launch of the MD device was probably as exciting as it got) P (Plot) - 3 (let's save jane, see jane save herself, see jane save the rest of humanity, ugh...)
