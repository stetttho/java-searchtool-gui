 I read this author's second book The First $20 Million is Always the Hardest first.  I really enjoyed that novel as it involves characters I can relate to in an industry I'm in (high tech start-ups).  Naturally, I was a little apprehensive about reading this novel as it centers on Wall Street and bond trading.  I'm not a business person, but this is my reaction after reading the book: A lot of the banking concepts such as bonds, savings and loans, securities I didn't fully understand.  But kudos to the author for structuring his prose in such a way that the specifics of bond trading is not important in moving the plot forward.  It's the characters and their personal ideosyncracies and relationships with one another that grip the reader.  The pace of the novel can only be described as frenetic, like a movie that incessantly cuts away to scene after scene every couple of minutes.  To have an author that is able to provide the reader with a 360-degree panoramic view into the heart and life of an industry while at the same time satirizing it is pure genius. As a quick summary of the story: Sidney Geeder is the king of mortgages.  He's the best bond salesman Atlantic Pacific (AP) has.  He's also a couple of months away from retiring rich with stock options.  Sid's hatred for the bonds he sells is what drives him to be the best.  At the same time a new kid named Mark Igino (aka Eggs Igino) joins the company.  Egg's is a natural salesman and also somewhat of a renegade for not having been exposed to the house rules of AP.  As expected, Eggs turns the place upside down.  Sid and Eggs quickly form a friendship (more like an alliance).  Naturally, AP wants to control its employees, and how it does it is the focus of this story along with a supporting cast that'll keep you grinning till the end.  Truly engaging! The author has an uncanny talent for humor in the subtleties of each character.  A statement as absurd as "he lost his job because of his need to floss" generates complete empathy on the part of the reader after reading through this novel.  I would recommend this book to any person with any background. LEAP rating (each out of 5): ============================ L (Language) - 4 (well-crafted dialogue keeps your mind off the technicalities of bond trading) E (Erotica) - 1 (let's just say, bond salesman have fun too) A (Action) - 0 (n/a) P (Plot) - 3 (fairly predictable ending, it's the characters that are important)
