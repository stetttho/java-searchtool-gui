 Although the title of my review sounds kind of negative, it doesn't fully reflect what I think about the book.  We know the Bourne story had to end eventually.  Ludlum makes the characters age in real time, i.e. while waiting for this story to be published, the characters have also aged.  David Webb is now about 50 years old, and he has two kids. It was kind of frustrating that the elusive Jackal was so... elusive.  Bourne had several encounters with his ulimate enemy throughout the book, yet he ends up getting injured with each encounter as if to reinforce what the Jackal has been saying all along that he is the ultimate killer and Bourne is second.  It was also kind of contradictory for the Jackal to have so much energy towards the end of the book considering how he was described at the beginning as being weak and frail.  Aparently, the characters take on bullets like immunization shots; they come out stronger for some reason. The plot(s) zigs and zags in this novel and eventually dovetails to coherency at the end.  It's just Ludlum's style to have several parallel paths throughout his stories that eventually fit together like puzzle pieces.   As I read through the trilogy, the most irritating character I've come across is Mo Panov, the psychiatrist.  He's a quack to me.  Maybe it's because I don't see Ludlum with a psychiatry degree.  Maybe the way he talks and the advice he gives sound fake.  It's definitely something about this guy that irks the heck out of me.  In the first novel, he was briefly introduced towards the end.  In the second novel, he doesn't say much even though he accompanies Alex Conklin to Hong Kong.  This last novel seems to be his coming out party.  He takes on a personality and in my opinion falls face flat with it. FLAP rating (see Bourne Supremacy review for the meaning of this rating system): F - 0 L - 4.5 A - 5 P - 5 Enjoy this novel... for closure.
