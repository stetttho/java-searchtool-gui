 This is one of those heartwarming animated features you get to see only every now and then.  With the voices of Harry Connick, Jr., Jennifer Anniston, Vin Diesel, Christopher McDonald and Jon Mahoney you're bound to get something that has appeal for all ages.  True, the story might be appear to be a children's tale, but it also takes place in a time when the US was suspicious of anything and everything that appears foreign.  The Giant is definitely foreign.  It's also clueless about how to behave on earth.  That is until he meets Hogarth (who saves him from being electrocuted to death).  Hogarth's next priority was to teach the Giant more about human life and find a place to hide it.  A government agent soon comes to town asking about any strange occurences that might have happened recently.  When he discovers the truth, he is hell bent on destroying this thing (even at the cost of all the lives in a small town in Maine).  Does the town side with Hogarth or this agent?  What happens to the giant?  That's for you to find out ;). This film is a touching story of friendship, protection and loyalty.  We're naturally scared when we see something unfamiliar to us, but Hogarth sets aside his fear and saves the Giant from death in their first encounter.  The Giant begins to understand that it can't just go around eating and destroying everything in its way and trusts the boy to do the right thing and keep it safe.  Later on, and perhaps in the most touching part of the story, the Giant learns that friendship means protecting the ones we love.  And it does just that. I wish the film could have been longer and the DVD more feature-laden.  This DVD only includes a 30-minute, TV-aired special about the making of the film, some actor filmographies, and a trailer. I highly recommend this as a family film.  I even think that in some ways, it's on par with other Disney classics. LEAP rating (each out of 5): ============================ L (Language) - 4 (heart-warming tale about friendship) E (Erotica) - 0 (n/a) A (Action) - 3 (the government tries to shoot the Giant down and almost destroys an entire town in doing so) P (Plot) - 3 (boy finds giant struggling for life in forest, saves it, and befriends it)
