 Christopher Guest stars as Corky St. Clair, the small-town drama director of Blaine, Missouri.  His credential of being a New Yorker and having that creative flair (gay) have made him a local legend.  For the 150th anniversary of Blaine, the city council has tapped him to do a show.  "Red, White and Blaine" is a musical that takes us through the history of Blaine's accidental finding, settling, and it's alien encounters.  The real fun of this story comes from how serious the whole town (including the actors) takes this show, which I can only compare to a kindergarten play.  This film is funny because it's so serious but the dialogue between the characters are so trivial that it borders on stupid.  I actually watched Best in Show first before watching this film.  Most of the actors remain the same.  The format of interviews before, during and after the "main event" is also the same.  There were lines in this film that were repeated in Best in Show and made me laugh, e.g. "How tall are you?" "Six foot 2."  "Really?"  Eugene Levy as the guy who tries to be funny perhaps steals the show. It's a nice, short film (84 minutes) to get your mind off things. LEAP rating (each out of 5): ============================ L (Language) - 3 (more improvisation from a bare-bones script, but if you listen carefully nothing they say matters) E (Erotica) - 0 (n/a) A (Action) - 0 (n/a) P (Plot) - 1 (the small town of Blaine, Missouri prepares of its 150th anniversary celebration with a musical hoping to make it to Broadway)
