 I thought the story seemed interesting.  It's about 4 guys who made a pact to amass millions of dollars until they hit a limit and split it when they retire.  It's just that one of them is more clever and brutal than the others.  Now back to what I was saying about the dialogue being a bit flaky to me.  What I meant was that the main protagonist, a Justice Department attorney who has an FBI agent as a best friend and whose wife died earlier from booze and neglect, was said to not know how to flirt.  But from the first few coherent lines that come out of him, he seems like a huge jerk with a huge ego.  I have no idea how the female protagonist, a small town girl who has above average IQ and becomes a surgeon, could have fallen in love with anything but a pretty face.  I really wish there was more of this book I can comment on, but as you can tell with my seemingly inane critique about the dialogue -- maybe there really isn't much to it at all.
