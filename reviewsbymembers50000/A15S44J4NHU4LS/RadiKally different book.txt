 In keeping with my personal philosophy of exposing myself to different literary genres, I picked up a copy of Snow Crash -- a cyber punk novel.  It's a different experience when you start out.  You're not sure whether you're missing some background information or a special dictionary to go through the book.  It starts off at a fast pace and uses words like Burbclaves, Franchulates, Kouriers, pooning, loglo, etc.  Our protagonist is called Hiro Protagonist, a pizza deliverer for the Mafia-controlled pizza chain Cosa Nostra, who also happens to be a hacker supreme in the Metaverse and greatest sword fighter in the world. Did you do a double take on what I just said?  If you did, welcome to the world of cyber punk.  If you didn't, welcome to the world of cyber punk.  The author has to lay down the groundrules of his "future world" while at the same time using that as a foundation to tell a story.  (Everyone's vision of the future is different.) This novel will be very different from the others you've read.  It is erratically paced.  The action scenes from riding a skateboard to sword fighting are exciting and fast.  The scenes in Hiro's office figuring out the mystery of Snow Crash with the Librarian is slow and sometime downright boring, preachy and dull.  The plot is really simple.  Once the dynamic duo of Y.T. and Hiro determine what Snow Crash is, the rest of the plot is predictable. The seemingly self-contradicting characters in this novel alone make it worth reading.  Y.T. has real spunk.  Her attitude is that of a typical carefree 15 year old rebel.  She delivers packages on her hi-tech skateboard while keeping it a secret from her mom (a government programmer).  Her dialogue is true to her character.  Hiro is at times a curt, savage and indifferent person, yet at other times a loquacious, compassionate and loyal friend.  His dialogue and actions display both extremes.  Raven is described as Asian, but in reality he's a giant thug.  There are many other characters that complete the book. Two weeks ago, if you asked me whether I'd pick up another cyber punk novel again I would have answered no.  But lo and behold, I'm finishing up The Diamond Age by the same author, and I thoroughly enjoy it so far.  Look for my review to come. All in all, I did enjoy this novel.  It was a great intro to the world of cyber punk.  LEAP rating (each out of 5): ============================ L (Language) - 3.5 (Hiro wavers, Y.T.'s a blast) E (Erotica) - 2 (one scene sticks out) A (Action) - 4 (pooning, katana-wielding, Reason) P (Plot) - 3 (simple, just complicated by cyber punk lingo and the "future")
