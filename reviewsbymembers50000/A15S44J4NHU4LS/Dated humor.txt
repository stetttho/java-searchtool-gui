 It doesn't help that I've been watching Christopher Guest's films in reverse chronological order starting with Best in Show, then Waiting for Guffman, and now This is Spinal Tap.  I would think this film broke new ground in the rockumentary/mockumentary genre *at* the time.  It takes the audience through daily life with the rock group called Spinal Tap.  The movie is shot like a featurette with a director interviewing the band members and following them around as they tour.  It also shows the ups and downs of being a rock group.  One minute they would be on top with stadiums packed with 5,000 audience members.  The next minute, they could be barely foist their albums despite signings and appearances.   This film employs very dry humor.  It's funny because it attempts to be serious.  The writers have made it a point to mock rockstars.  They're airheads.  David, the lead singer of the band, is constantly saying dumb things like every year countless people spontaneously combust.  Nigel is obssessive with his guitar collection.  The drummers seem to die and get replaced constantly.  Band members stuff cucumbers down their crotch.  It's entirely believable that these things happen with rockstars, but this film showcases a selection of stereotypes in one fell swoop. (I think this film was fun to watch.  I could not believe the number of well-known celebrities that played a minor role in this film including Dana Carvey, Paul Schafer, Billy Crystal and Fran Drescher (she looked so young).) LEAP rating (each out of 5): ============================ L (Language) - 3 (stereotypes well captured for each character) E (Erotica) - 0 (n/a) A (Action) - 0 (n/a) P (Plot) - 2 (the life of a rock group)
