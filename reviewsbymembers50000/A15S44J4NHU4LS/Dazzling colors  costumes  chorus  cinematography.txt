 I intended the title of this review to be a play on the 4 Cs of a diamond (cut, color, clarity, carat).  Indeed, this is a gem of a film.  I thought it was an ingenious way of reinventing the modern day musical.  I further appreciated the film after seeing the making of it in the Special Features section. This film is about a penniless writer, Christian, that falls in love with a courtesan named Satine.  But Satine has responsibilities to her boss Zidler and benefactor the Duke.  This is how the love triangle is set up.  Look past the fact that the plot is quite cliche and simple.  Once you see that Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGreggor do have on-screen chemistry and can actually sing, you'll be amazed. This DVD set comes with 2 discs.  The first disc contains the movie as well as a behind the scenes option that allows you to look behind the scenes for certain sequences in the film.  The second disc contains everything but the kitchen sink.  It has interviews with the cast, the making of the music, the making of the sets, still images by professional photographers of the making of the movie, a scrap book of the story, complete/extended/multi-cam featurettes of the major dance sequences in the film (like the can can, tango, coup d'etat, hindi, etc.), music videos of the Lady Marmalade song. It took me a full 8 hrs. to go through all the material and I never felt bored.  Baz terms this film as the conclusion of a trilogy of red curtain movies, after Strictly Ballroom and Romeo and Juliet.  I have yet to see Strictly Ballroom, but I have no doubt that Baz Luhrmann's talent for story telling will leave me mesmerized as well. LEAP rating (each out of 5): ============================ L (Language) - 4 (all the major dialogues are in the form of songs from the 80's) E (Erotica) - 2 (surprisingly it was sexy in a humorous, light way) A (Action) - 0 (n/a) P (Plot) - 3 (it is a cliche plot, but well told nonethless)
