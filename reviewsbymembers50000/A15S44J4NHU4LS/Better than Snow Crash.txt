 ... In my opinion, The Diamond Age provides characters that are richer, more human and that the readers can understand and relate to better.  Take Nell for example.  I felt bad for her when people treated her unfairly, and cheered her on along her quest to free her brother.  And Harv, Nell's brother, what brother wouldn't want to protect, teach and provide for a younger sister when all they've got is one another?  John Hackworth is touted as a nonotechnological genius, but I thought that for him being a good father was more important than inventing some grand device.  Lord Finkle-McGraw I can picture as the benevolent-yet-mischievous grandfather every person would love to have.  I could go on and describe each and every character in this book and someone they remind me of in my life, but I won't :). The Diamond Age envisions an extreme and futuristic world where all facets of life revolve around nanotechnology.  This future world isn't one happy world.  In fact, most of it is downright depressing.  People are differentiated depending on what phyle they belong to.  Beggars and thetes (people who don't belong to a phyle) line the streets.  There is no privacy out in the open.  Everything is watched.  Punishment in the form of caning exists.  Death by remote control is possible. It is, however, an incredible world as well.  Almost any object from clothing and food to entire floating cities can be created using a device called a Matter Compiler (MC for short) that obtains its source of materials (atoms) from Feeds (think of these as huge pipes that tunnel through major cities).   This is the world that Nell, the main character and a thete, grows up in.  Her life would've been inconsequential and she ignorant were it not for a book (entitled A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer) her brother gave to her.  This book, the Primer, is a wonder of nanotechnology and advanced enough to adapt itself to Nell's surroundings and circumstances in life.  It teaches her everything from reading to self-defense. The Primer is not merely a device though.  It also enables ractives (interactive movies) to be shown.  From interacting with the Primer... Exciting stuff! The many plot twists are sure to captivate readers from beginning to end.  Perhaps even make the reader want to reread portions of the book to see how brilliantly the plot comes together.  "Wow!" was what I said as I put down this book.  I'm sure you will too. LEAP rating (each out of 5): ============================ L (Language) - 4.5 (incredible descriptions of Stephenson's vision of the future) E (Erotica) - 2 (some abuse) A (Action) - 3 (nanotechnology plays a big role in the action) P (Plot) - 5 (so many sub-plots that dovetail to a cataclysmic ending)
