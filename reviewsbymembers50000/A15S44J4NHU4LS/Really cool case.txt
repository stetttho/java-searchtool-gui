 When I first got this case, I was wondering what I'd do with it since I don't own a pair of Oakley Thump sunglasses (the ones that have an MP3 player built in).  But I quickly saw how neat this case is.  First, it's made of ballistic nylon material and zips up (rather than using a spring loaded hinge which breaks with age).  Second (the cool part), there are TWO compartments inside, separated by a foam divider that velcros to the top half.  This is really cool because you can use the top compartment for something like a digital camera, keys, lipstick, mp3 player (upto the size of the iPod Shuffle).  AND, you can still use the bottom half for a full-sized pair of sunglasses like the Oakley e-Wire or a-Wire.  It's very strongly built and i've even accidentally dropped it in water and sat on it, with no visible signs of deformity.  Definitely get this as a way to organize your stuff and not just as a sunglass case!
