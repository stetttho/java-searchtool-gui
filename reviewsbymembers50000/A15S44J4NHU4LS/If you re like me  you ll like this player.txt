 What I meant by being like me is: * first time DVD owner * don't have a home theater system * planning to just plug into a TV and use its speakers * like intuitive remote control buttons * want to be able to play VCDs as well This is the perfect DVD player for you then. I found it especially easy to use. Right out of the box, just hook up the power and color coded video/audio cables to the back of your TV and it's ready to go. They even supply the batteries for the remote. I for one don't like to read manuals, but i really didn't have to. Power the player on, hit Open/Close, load your DVD disc, turn on your TV and it starts playing. If I want to access the menu, there's a clearly marked button called Menu and direction keys (Up/Down/Left/Right) and an Enter button at the center to make selections with. The price for this player makes it attractive as well. After canvassing around department store for basic DVD players and adding the tax to it, Amazon's selection and convenience just won me over.
