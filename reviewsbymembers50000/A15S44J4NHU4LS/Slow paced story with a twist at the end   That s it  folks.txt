 I was warned that this book would be a love story.  I don't mind love stories.  I just never expected the plot to develop so slowly and for so little action to be mixed in.  It's about a small town deputy whose wife's death has been eating away at him for 2 years.  It's also about a divorced woman trying to escape the embarrassment of not being able to have children.  They meet by virtue of the deputy's son's learning problem (the school just didn't want to force him to study thinking it would add to the stress of losing a mother). I really can't say any more that wouldn't give the story away.  It's a book that, at times, can make you feel like a schoolboy with a crush.  But that's about all I felt.  :(
