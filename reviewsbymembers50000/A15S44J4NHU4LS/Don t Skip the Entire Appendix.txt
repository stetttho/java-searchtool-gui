 The main story (i.e. the 3 books) is about 1000 pages long. The remainder of the book is a collection of appendices. It includes some maps, family trees, description of the language used, references to time and events of Middle Earth around the period The Lord of the Rings was written in. While I found most of them not very useful, there are some sections in the Appendices which are interesting. The most poignant part of the book I actually found in the appendix. It's the story between Aragorn and Erwyn. It talks about how they met and what their love for one another made them do. Don't miss that part. This is by far the best "unabridged" version of the books I've read. It also comes in one book, not a boxed set like most other versions of this book. I think the movie released by New Line Cinemas with the same title does the book justice. A little trivia about the movie: 1) The whole film was shot in a continuous 2 year period in New Zealand. 2) The Tolkien family does not support the cinematization of this book. 3) Vigo Mortenson does most of his own stunts in the film. Go watch it!
