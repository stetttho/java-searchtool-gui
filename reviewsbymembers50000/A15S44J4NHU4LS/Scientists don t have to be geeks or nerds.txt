 The funny thing about this book was that I bought my very first copy on a trip to China when I was about eleven.  I don't know how many times I've restarted the book since then, but I never finished it until now. This book is a semi-autobiography of a very famous physicist by the name of Richard P. Feynman (RPF).  I say it's a semi-autobiography because Ralph Leighton compiled and chronologically ordered several stories told to him by RPF.  And I say he's famous because he was a Nobel laureate and named one of Time Magazine's Most Influential People of the last century. Anyway, RPF is as interesting a character as you'll ever hear about in the scientific community.  He looked to science to explain things around him even from a very young age (you'll learn more about his father's influence on him in the second book).  His father always taught him to question things that don't make logical sense.  He was an analytical person.   Yet behind his intellectual prowess lies his desire to live life and have fun.  In this book, he recounts his fear of being called a sissy when he was young, his attempts at hitting on girls, cracking safes, doing magic tricks, learning how to draw and paint, playing in a samba band, etc.  Throughout the book, he talks about his motivation in doing such things.  He's not out to impress or tell a tall tale that's impossible.  In fact, he's quite down to earth and very frank.  He speaks what's on his mind. Richard P. Feynman has led a very colorful life. If ever there were a non-fiction book that's fun to read and even humorous at times, this would have to be it! (* NB: There is a follow up book called "What Do You Care What Other People Think".  Also a collection of short anecdotes told by RPF to Ralph Leighton.  This "sequel" is a looser set of stories that don't chronologically fit together (oh, and there are also some pictures in the middle of this book).
