 This film was meant to be a subjective piece on the relationship between Mozart and Salieri based on Peter Shaffer's play.  Casting was intentionally done to bring unknowns onboard.  F. Murray Abraham (who plays Salieri) and Tom Hulce (who plays Mozart) have never played on a piano before, let alone conduct an orchestra.  For their parts, though, they did train and eventually learn to play the piano and look the part of a composer.  After watching F. Murray Abraham's performance I utterly reviled Salieri.  I pitied Mozart.  Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the child prodigy who died in a pauper's grave.  It is such a tragedy.  How could one man have so much hatred for another that his goal in life is to ruin his enemy, and claim that this is god's fault?  Well, it is possible after you watch this film. This DVD is split onto 2 sides of one disc.  There's a Side 1 and Side 2.  It also contains a Special Features section which is entirely full of text (available from the Menu on either side).  I was disappointed by the lack of truly special features such as extra footage or director commentaries.  It's a long (160 minutes) film and to cap off this DVD with a lot of narrative text is anti-climactic. I would be interested in seeing another edition of this DVD come out which further draws the audience into this film.  But for now, this will have to do.  I highly recommend the story, though the medium needs improvement. LEAP rating (each out of 5): ============================ L (Language) - 4.5 (engaging dialogue) E (Erotica) - 0 (sadly, none) A (Action) - 0 (n/a) P (Plot) - 4 (a well-conceived opinionated retelling of a slice of history)
