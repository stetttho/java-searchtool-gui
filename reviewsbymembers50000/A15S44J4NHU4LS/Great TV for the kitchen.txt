 When I was out looking for small TV/VCR combo units, I stumbled upon this.   Here are my impressions of this machine: * light and portable enough to position on a kitchen counter or ironing board (so you can eat while you watch tv or a video) * easy to move around for cleaning or to move from room to room * mono (one speaker in the front, combo units like this usually are) * speaker volume doesn't increase much from 30 onwards (goes up to 50) * requires cable (doesn't come with antenna) * short power cord (about 3 feet) * neat glow in the dark remote control buttons (but not really useful) and it comes with 2 AA batteries * channel and volume control buttons are small and right below the power button (easy to confuse these) * vcr works great (you have the usual forward, rewind, pause, stop, play, timer, counter reset, zero return, 30-second skip search features, no slow motion play though) * has input ports (so you can hook up a gaming system) but no output port (so you won't be able to hook up another vcr and record to it) I would really recommend this for people who want a decent, reliable and portable TV in small areas like the kitchen, bathroom or even a dorm room.
