 This is the second Jonathan Kellerman book I've read. And I like it, but I don't love it; nothing to write home about. I do like how the two disparate cases presented at the beginning of the book dovetail into a coherent single case towards the end. I like how a perceived threat to the investigation (Sharavi) turns out to be a key player in Alex Delaware's survival.  It all starts with one clever cop who likes to kill. He knows a preference for murder isn't exactly your everyday motivation to kill, so he forms a smarter-than-the-rest-of-them group that buys into the whole concept of eugenics (racial cleansing). With that murders happen one after the other.  In the end, there's an undercover assignment involving Alex, a last minute delay tactic which involves explaining the sequence of events and motives for those murders and a heroic save by employs of the Israeli consulate. F - 2 (crotch grabbing, murder in the nude) L - 4 (good dialogue, succinct descriptions of the environment) A - 2 (lot of time spent driving around, interviewing people) P - 3 (explained above) * For a detailed explanation of what my rating system means, please visit my About You area and look up the review I wrote for The Bourne Supremacy by Robert Ludlum.
