 Well, the author did warn us in the preface of Speaker for the Dead that Xenocide was going to be more philosophical and slow than his first two books of the Ender series.  (Perhaps that's why this book didn't win the Hugo award that year.)  The book's ending is set up for the fourth and last book in the series - The Children of the Mind.  (The reviews I've read on it are less than positive.)  This book deals with a wide range of issues such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, faster-than-light travel, interspecies tolerance, martyrdom, separation, etc.  It's no wonder this book seemed long preachy. Here's what I really think about this book.  I hated the ending.  It's a ... ploy for the reader to buy the fourth book.  The rest of the book was so-so, a LOT of dialogue and positing.  And since all of the technology presented in this book is fiction, it's highly incredulous.   Plotwise, nothing really exciting happens in this book.  It picks off from where Speaker for the Dead left off.  (It's like that movie Contact with Jodie Foster.  Did she really travel to space or was she just [imagining it]?)  The sources of conflict in this book are the same: the descolada, Lusitania fleet, Novinha's family, Valentine.  I'll keep you posted on the last book.  But I'm not getting my hopes up. LEAP rating (each out of 5): ============================ L (Language) - 3 (blah blah blah) E (Erotica) - 0 (n/a - sigh) A (Action) - 0 (n/a - can you believe this?) P (Plot) - 2 ("we need to figure out what to do with the descolada" <- pretty much sums up the story)
