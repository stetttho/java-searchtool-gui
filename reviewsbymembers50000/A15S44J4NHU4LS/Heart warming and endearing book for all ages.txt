 I'm writing this review not because I just recently read the book.  I'm not even writing this review because I own it or reread it.  I'm simply writing this review because I cannot forget it. I first read this book when I was about 6 or 7 and I kept thinking "I wish I had my own giving tree".  A companion that will remain with me for all time.  I thought of it as a happy story. Now that I'm older and have seen more of life, I sometimes think "I have been that tree".  Then I realize what a sad and touching story it has become for me.   The nice thing about this book, is that it is timeless.  It will hold meaning no matter what your age.  A reader may interpret the story one way or the other depending on how they've lived their lives.  Have they been the tree or the boy? I would highly recommend reading and owning this book, for it captures the essence of living life, of giving and taking, of love.
