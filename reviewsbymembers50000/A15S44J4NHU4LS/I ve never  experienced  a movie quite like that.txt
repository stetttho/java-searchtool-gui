 My first impression when watching the film:  I started asking myself "What the heck?" one hour into the film, and there's still no conflict, no action, no sex, nothing?  What's going on?  Then when the movie ended, I screamed "Huh???"  "What???" The next phase of my epiphany came when I realized I wasn't the only one who "didn't get it".  So I went to therapy.  Just kidding.  But I did find some help. I really enjoyed this movie only after reading countless reviews online, and watching the last half hour of the movie again.  It makes perfect sense to me now.  The important things to keep in mind are the main components of the story and to understand the time line.  The whole movie movie can be categorized into: the fantasy (first 2 hours), the "real time" and "real life" story,  and flashbacks in real life (interspersed scenes in the last half hour).  The "real time" story of Diane Selwyn's life is only five minutes long.  This "real time" story comprises the scenes: when she is woken up by her neighbor's knocking, lets her grab her stuff and sees the blue key (whereupon she realizes she had done something really bad), to her being haunted by the old man and woman and the fateful ending.  Once these puzzles made sense to me, I realized how wonderfully made this movie really is.  It's clever and brilliant. I must admit that the movie is pretty convoluted.  Diane takes elements from her real life and constructs this incredible fantasy in her mind where she comes out on top; where she makes it in hollywood and even gets the girl ;) (<hint hint wink wink>).  Some characters in her fantasy I could find no purpose to except to further interest/entice/enrage certain characters within the fantasy.  The DVD version of the movie I watched contains a Clue Sheet with clues that'll help you unravel the mystery.  It's not very helpful unless you understand what I explained in the previous paragraph.  But once you "get it", the clues cause you to say "Wow!" On a different note, I enjoyed a song in the movie by Rebekah Del Rio called Lloranda (which means "crying" in Spanish).  The viewer will also notice that there is no scene selection on the DVD's menu.  This is intentional, along with the blurring of certain scenes and lack of other special features.  It's David Lynch's way of telling us that "This is my film, I can do what I want with it.  Respect that."  To me, the movie IS the special feature. LEAP rating (each out of 5): ============================ L (Language) - 4.5 (lots of hidden references and funny remarks to us the audience) E (Erotica) - 5 (i've never given such a high rating for a movie shown in theaters, so that tells you something) A (Action) - 1 (the hitman scene in the fantasy is hilarious) P (Plot) - 5 (confusing when unexplained, but very clever when understood) p.s. E-mail me if you would like to discuss more about this movie.  :)
