 The film started out so well.  It had the opening credits with screwed up bogus subtitles, hilarious horse-riding with no horse, smart-alec peasants arguing with a king.  What's not to like, right?  Boy, was I wrong.  The film just took a turn for the worse, when they tossed in the really horrible animation of God giving them the mission of finding the Holy Grail.  They also mixed the present (932 AD) with the future (1975 AD).  It didn't work for me.  The last 30 minutes just bored me.  I couldn't wait for it to just be over with. I remember liking other Monty Python features more than this.  Disappointing. LEAP rating (each out of 5): ============================ L (Language) - 4 (the exchanges were absurd to the point of being funny) E (Erotica) - 0 (n/a - though they could've done something with the nurses in the "convent") A (Action) - 2 (killer bunnies, fight with the black night) P (Plot) - 3 (king arthur looks for knights on his quest to find the holy grail)
