 This film is what a friend of mine calls a "mock documentary."  It "documents" the obsessive lives of dog-owners as they prepare for a national dog competition.  I put "documents" in quotes because what it really ends up doing is making fun of these people.  Each couple "interviewed" in the film has their own quirks, none more evident than the manic-depressive Weimaraner of Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock.  (You know how some dog owners end up resembling their pets (or the other way around)?  Parker Posey's look was dead on.)  Christopher Guest ends up being the handler of a bloodhound (and either he owns the dog or is really good with it, because they're awesome together).  Eugene Levy as the husband with two left feet (literally) also cracked me up. I'm not even sure whether the actors stuck to a script because it felt completely improvised as each actor fed on what their fellow actors said.  It's amazing. But, hands down, I thought the highlight of this comedy was Fred Willard as the commentator of the competition.  He is absolutely hilarious.  It's fairly obvious he knows nothing about dog competitions, or dogs for that matter.  It's not even clear how he got the job.  His fellow announcer, an English fellow, is forced to endure Willard's outrageous and dirty remarks while at the same time trying to provide a helpful commentary for the audience. In the same style as Waiting for Guffman, this film is divided into the pre-event, event, and post event interview segments. I recommend this film for people who likes to see things blown out of proportion (figuratively).  It's not a very fast paced film, and lacks any of the qualities that might garner it mass appeal.  But it is a funny look into the even funnier world of dog breeders.
