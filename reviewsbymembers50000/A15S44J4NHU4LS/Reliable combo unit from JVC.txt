 I was initially looking for a TV and a VCR separately because most combo units have mono sound (one-sided), but this combo wasn't.   What led me to buy this unit was: * the silver color of the unit makes it look cool (and clean when it's dusty) * good picture quality * stereo sound for the TV * the vcr works perfectly (you have the usual forward, rewind, pause, stop, play, timer, 30-second skip search, and slow motion play) * intuitive remote control with larger buttons for the Channel and Volume +/- right in the center * great tape loading mechanism (you don't need to push past the point of resistance for the tape to go in, unlike Sony and Toshiba), just push it lightly, and it will take care of the rest However, some of the things I don't like about this unit are: * the input ports are in front (instead of the back), so hooking up my DVD player makes the Audio/Video jacks stick out in front * the VCR only provides a mono audio input, so if you hook up a DVD player or a gaming system (like a PlayStation) you will only hear sounds coming out of one speaker instead of both * the Eject button cause the tape to rewind first before ejecting * doesn't come with an antenna (so you'll need to get your own or have cable hookup) I would recommend this to people who trust the JVC brand, aren't planning to hook it up to an entertainment system, and would like a single unit to save space.
