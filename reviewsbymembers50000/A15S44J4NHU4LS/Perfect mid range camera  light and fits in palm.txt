 The FinePix 2800 Zoom is Fujifilm's latest mid-range digital camera. Incorporating a powerful 6x optical zoom lens, the same zooming power as that used on the FinePix 6900 Zoom, the flagship of the FinePix line. The FinePix 2800 Zoom is a highly compact, point-and-shoot model that can make even beginning photographers feel like a pro. The 2-Megapixel CCD imager in concert with Fuji's Advanced Color Technology produces photo-quality 4x6, 5x7 and 8x10-inch prints. The camera's exposure and focusing systems are fully automatic. For those that like to have more control, the Manual mode allows overriding the metering system and using a specific white balance setting.  Audio notes up to 30 seconds in length can be attached to your pictures, you can record up to 60 seconds of motion video with sound, and the FinePix 2800 Zoom can operate as a PC-cam for computer-to-computer video conferencing. Images, movies and sound files transfer to your computer in a flash thanks to the built-in USB connectivity. Picture viewing is simple and fun with the included FinePixViewer software that launches automatically once the pictures are downloaded to the computer.
