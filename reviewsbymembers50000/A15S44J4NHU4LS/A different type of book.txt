 This book is a random collection of short stories by Haruki Murakami, translated by two people.  Most people who read stories that have a definite plot (with a beginning and an end) might find the stories in this book slightly unnerving.  The author does a great job of building up the plot to a climax and has an annoying tendency to just end it there or have the story eventually go nowhere.  Almost none of his stories have a resolution or denouement. A couple of the stories I liked are: * The Perfect Girl * Family Affair * A Slow Boat to China (particularly the third section about the second chinese in) * The Elephant Vanishes <random thought>I find it curious that of the millions of names the author could have chosen for some of his characters, Noboru Watanabe is used twice.</random thought> The other stories are just borderline fantasy and ramblings. The translations are crisp, clear and colorfully written.  I'm sure it does the author's original work justice.  The author writes in the first person voice for all the stories.  Sometimes, the protagonist is male, sometimes female.  Most of the stories have the protagonist as a married person.  Almost all of them come to a realization that their spouses aren't perfect and they hate them.  None of the wives ever have a name.  In the stories where the author writes in the voice of a bachelor, he always has a steady girlfriend and other acquaintances to have sex with.  Every protagonist drinks beer and smokes.  After a while all this repetition becomes boring and ultimately unpallatable. LEAP rating (each out of 5): ============================ L (Language) - 4.5 (crisp, clear and colorfully translated) E (Erotica) - 0.5 (first short story had the inklings of phone sex) A (Action) - 0 (n/a) P (Plot) - 1.5 (and that applies to about each short story)
