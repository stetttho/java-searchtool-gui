 I don't think I've ever written such a caustic review.  But after watching this video, I have to say John Carpenter's films are absolutely worthless.  I've sat through a couple of his other movies like Vampires and Ghosts of Mars, and didn't really see the point in all the gratuitous violence. Like most of his other films, this film takes place in the future where the world a public junkyard and rusted out drums used as furnaces line the streets.  The junkyard being Los Angeles (LA) in this film.  Snake Plissken (Russell) has been blackmailed (injected with a toxin that will kill him in 10 hours) to do the government's bidding to reobtain possession of a Electro-magnetic pulse (EMP) targetting unit (a sort of detonator) which has been stolen by the president's daughter (who met up in a virtual reality world with a dangerous terrorist). As far as movie special effects go, this was just plain unbelievably bad.  I've generated better computer generated imagery in school than what was used in the film.  Equally horrible was the dialogue and acting of the actors.  Russell just grunts most of the time.  About the only guy who provided some comic relief to this film was Steve Buscemi. Please do not waste your money or your time on this film.  I'm not kidding.
