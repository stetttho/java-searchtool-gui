 Ok, so I admit that was a pretty misleading Title for this review.  I guess the final action scene at the end of a female cop walking into a darkened room with the antagonist waiting to spring at her just brought back memories of the film.  It's been a few months since I read this book, but the plot elements still stand out (a good thing).  I liked the way this author adds detail to the forensics findings/pathology reports so that the lay reader (like me) can understand the significance of a procedure or medical test performed.  I don't know why I'm so forgiving about the hackneyed theme of a lone female detective who doesn't have a life but does her darndest to put up with harrassment and misclaimed credit for her work in order to show the world.  I guess it just works in this book.  There are several relationships and source of conflict in this book between Dr. Corday, Detective Moore; that of love and conflict of interest.  Between Moore and the tomboy cop (I forget her name); that of a crush and admiration.
