 I guess I was just being a typical guy when I came up with the title for the review.  Ok, back to business.  I thought the film was unique.  The story of the tragedy (that's what the original play is) is presented to the audience as a news report about two star-crossed lovers that took their own lives in Verona (Verona Beach, that is). I read Romeo and Juliet in high school (a long time ago).  (It was about time I refreshed my memory.)  This movie has all the essential plot elements of the play.  (How Romeo meets and falls in love with Juliet.  How they elope.  How Mercutio's death spurs Romeo into action by taking Tybalt's life.  How Romeo is exiled.  How Juliet is forced to marry Paris.  How the priest conceives of a plan to bring Romeo and Juliet together.  How that plan fails and they end up dying side-by-side.)   It's made to look "cool", sorta like an MTV video.  Each scene is brightly lit and colorful.  Instead of daggers and swords, everyone carries a gun.  (I mean everyone.  They even have to check their guns at the door at various places.)  All the characters seem to have been given a 20th century equivalent role to play.  The apothecary is now a drug dealer.  The priest, well, he's still a priest.  The narrator is at times the news reporter and at times the police chief.  The Montagues and Capulets are big time businessmen. To tell you the truth, most of the dialogue is spoken so fast that I didn't catch much of what they said.  DiCaprio and Danes play their parts well.  They even looked downright giddy when they first meet.  As for Romeo and Tybalt's gang, they were annoying.  I also couldn't get over the fact that Mercutio was in fact not played by Chris Rock!  It's some guy called Harol Perineau.  In one scene he dressed in drag and started singing.  I got a little weirded out. All in all, it was a refreshing retelling of the Romeo and Juliet story.  I would recommend picking up a CliffNotes for those who've never read the play.  Knowing the full story and the important lines beforehand will increase your enjoyment of the film. LEAP rating (each out of 5): ============================ L (Language) - 3 (mostly spoken too fast) E (Erotica) - 0.5 (don't expect anything like Shakespeare in Love) A (Action) - 1.5 (lots of pointless shooting) P (Plot) - 5 (it is Shakespeare's classic love story/tragedy after all)
