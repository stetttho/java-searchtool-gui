 When I mentioned to someone that I watched this film.  They said "Dude, it's a girl-film."  I told him "It was funny though, and I liked it."  I can see why people might think of this film that way though.  But that would be missing the point of the film I think. Thelma and Louise are supposed to be going off on a vacation, but a pit stop at a bar leads to a murder.  They decide to run as far and as fast away as possible.  Along the way, they make several mistakes that made it tougher and tougher for them to escape from the law.  But they sure as hell tried till the very end anyways. I liked it because I'm tired of seeing bad guys being just that -- bad "guys".  With Thelma and Louise, you're not sure whether to like them or pity them.  They're not evil "bad".  They're what I would even consider "naughty". LEAP rating (each out of 5): ============================ L (Language) - 3.5 (Thelma says some pretty hilarious things.) E (Erotica) - 2.5 (All this E comes from Geena Davis.  There's a rape scene, and a 5 second love scene with Brad Pit.) A (Action) - 3 (Pretty good car chase scene.) P (Plot) - 3 (Predictable till the surprise ending which is famous by now.)
