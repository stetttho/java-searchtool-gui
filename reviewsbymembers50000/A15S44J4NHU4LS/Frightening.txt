 I feel relatively uneasy about saying something negative for such a classic as 1984.  But, learning the book's lesson about what the world would be like if one's individuality were lost, I'll say what I truly feel.  I think this book is slow and depressing.  In fact, the only reason that I kept reading on was because of the introduction of Julia in the story.  I found her character intriguing.  Why was she put there?  Who is she?  Can her motives be trusted?  It was only after I read the story, that I realized she was created by the author for the sole purpose of being used as a barometer for Winston's (the protagonist in the story) individuality.  What Julia means to Winston is an indication of how much Winston has lost of himself.  His ability to think and remember the past.   In 1984, the world is divided into 3 superpowers.  Winston belongs to the Ingsoc Party (a contraction of [Eng]lish [Soc]ialism) where to have thoughts in opposition or in deviance with propaganda meant capture and subsequent brainwashing by the Thought Police.  Everyone in the Party is watched and monitored by telescreens (two-way TVs that broadcast as well as receive) and hidden microphones.  A new language called Newspeak is a rapidly decreasing subset of English created to make the expression of rebellious thought an impossiblity.  On top of this, all books and works of literature were being rewritten in Newspeak and their essential meaning contorted to serve the purposes of the Party. If George Orwell's vision of the future haunts you, then his objective was achieved.  His main goal in writing this book was to both set a mood and give a warning.  The mood he sets is for what an extreme Socialist state would look like twenty years from the time he wrote the story.  His warning is of what would happen if Socialism were perverted by the ruling class where power becomes an end and not just the means. The ideas presented in this book are powerful and well thought-out.  However, the story itself is dull and uneventful.  If you like a story that you can read and reflect on afterwards, this is your book.  If you like faster-paced stories, pass on this one. LEAP rating (each out of 5): ============================ L (Language) - 3 (humorless, basic English dialogue) E (Erotica) - 0.5 (go Julia go) A (Action) - 0 (n/a - goes hand in hand with the story being dull) P (Plot) - 3 (dull story, good vision)
