 I picked up this book when someone had mentioned they were required to read it in school as children.  This book is about the end of innocence and the heart of darkness.  Ok, before you get scared away by the two phrases I just mentioned, let me explain.  So without even reading the book, you probably know it's about a bunch of English schoolboys who get stranded on an island and are forced to survive without the supervision of adults.  This book is supposed to be full of symbolisms; each character and animal represent some idea or entity in society.  The end of innocence I mentioned begins with the slaughter of a pig for food.  The heart of darkness comes when the leader of the hunting tribe loses his mental stability and decides to hunt for more than just pig. It's actually a very short story (208 pages), and the dialogue is very simplistic.  I found the author's descriptions of the jungle, beach, lagoon, and mountain to be quite boring.  (You'll also notice that I said schoolboys in the last paragraph; there are no girls in this story.  There is no underlying love story.  There is no humor.  There is no excitement whatsoever.) To be honest, I don't like this book.  Even less so as required reading for school kids.  To not interpret the symbolisms would be to leave the book as a plotless story.  Yet to interpret it would mean exposing children to the horrors of savagery, abuse and survival. LEAP rating (each out of 5): ============================ L (Language) - 3 (You can put as much interpretation as you want in the "symbolisms" of this book, but I'm too lazy to let my mind wander in search of a deeper meaning.) E (Erotica) - 0 (n/a) A (Action) - 0.5 (You really can't get excited over a bunch of schoolboys and a few pigs.) P (Plot) - 2 (Boys get stranded, boys form a society, boys survive and wait for rescue.)
