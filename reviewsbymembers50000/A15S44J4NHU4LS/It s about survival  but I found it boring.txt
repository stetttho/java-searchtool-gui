 This is an old film starring Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds about a canooing trip gone wrong.  I suppose at the time this film was released, the plot must've been novel and interesting.  However, I found it boring.  The dialogue was choppy.  The acting was goofy.  The plot was actually decent up until about halfway through the film.  That's when things went downhill.  Jon Voight turns into Rambo, and Burt Reynolds into a crying baby. More seriously though, I do understand the underlying theme of survival that the story tries to tell.  Each of the 4 men on that trip represents a very different character.  How they choose to deal with a situation says a lot about themselves.  It's not a happy story. LEAP rating (each out of 5): ============================ L (Language) - 2 (choppy) E (Erotica) - 0 (n/a) A (Action) - 2 (a couple of murders) P (Plot) - 3 (half the film was ok)
