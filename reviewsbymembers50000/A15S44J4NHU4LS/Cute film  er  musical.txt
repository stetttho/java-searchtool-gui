 I'm guessing this is the typical style of movies back then in the 60s which propel music stars into showbiz.  I must say, for a film done during that period, this was particularly well made.  Elvis Presley actually wasn't too bad.  Ann Margaret is definitely talented (can sing, dance and act).  It's even more entertaining to see that this film is a blatant excuse to sing a few songs and dance a few sequences.  But I am a sucker for love stories, but it wasn't a bad use of an hour and twenty minutes of my time. The only thing I must confess to not liking what eventually happened to the Italian guy.  How much more unapologetic can you get? LEAP rating (each out of 5): ============================ L (Language) - 4 (everything's in verse or song - mostly.  pretty cleverly done) E (Erotica) - 0 (n/a) A (Action) - 2 (car race at the end was pretty interesting) P (Plot) - 3 (there's the requisite love triangle and a horrible ending for one suitor)
