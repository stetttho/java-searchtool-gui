 I'm probably one of a very few adults who haven't read or heard about this book.  I was warned that this book was meant to be a parody of Communism (whatever that means).  I'd like to think of it as a nice fable with a sad ending.  But I can't escape the fact that it is overtly a criticism meant to poke fun at the Communists in Russia. <random thought>I felt really bad for Boxer.  The horse that has a white stipe down his nose making him look stupid (these were the words the author used).  Here's someone with a steadfast character and a determination that if only he worked harder things would get better.</random thought> <aside>Only after reading this book did I come to understand how ignorance and illiteracy could lead to abuse and oppression.  I grew up in a country that was colonized by the Spaniards for over three centuries.  During this time, the Spaniards made sure none of the natives learned how to read or write.  They feared that once the natives learned what was going on around them, they would rebel.  And indeed they did.  That was the smartest thing they ever did.</aside>   The author remarks, in the original preface in the appendix section of the 50th Anniversary illustrated hardcover edition, how the USSR took a good political ideal such as Socialism, and twisted it to an abomination that's worth mockery.  Indeed, George Orwell has even fought in a Spanish war to defend Socialism.  This was when he took a bullet through the neck and lived to write about it later on. I can see why this book is a classic.  It's short, easy to read, carries a powerful idea and applies to more than just Communism.
