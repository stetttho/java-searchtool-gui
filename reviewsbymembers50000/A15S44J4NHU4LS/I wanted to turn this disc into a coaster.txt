 It may be a classic to many people, but only sheer will and determination allowed me to sit through it.  It was horrible.  It was long, boring, and pointless.  The director intended this film to showcase the different facets of war and the madness that it brings to some people.  I should've known the madness was intended for his audience. The story is about Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) on a mission to find and execute the highly decorated and brilliant renegade Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has turned mad (undoubtedly because of war). Please don't waste 3 hours of your life watching this movie. LEAP rating (each out of 5): ============================ L (Language) - 3 (writers get all philosophical and artsy with Brando's lines) E (Erotica) - 0 (n/a) A (Action) - 2 (doesn't force you to the edge of your seats, that's for sure) P (Plot) - 1 (Sheen is sent into Cambodia to hunt down Brando, plain and simple)
