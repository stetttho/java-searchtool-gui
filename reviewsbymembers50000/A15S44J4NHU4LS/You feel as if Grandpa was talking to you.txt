 Despite my hesitation at picking up an autobiography, I must say Made in America turned out to be quite a pleasant surprise.  In it, Sam intersperses story telling with quotes from his colleagues, family and the media.  After reading the story, you get a very clear picture of Sam's humble beginnings as a local boy who delivered papers, a boyscout who saved a person's life, a variety store franchise owner who was driven out of town because his lease expired and he didn't know that it was part of the contract he signed.  In it you also learn what the Walmart Way was about.  It's about hard work, passion for the job and thoughtful spending.   He completed it just before he died of cancer.  And a good thing he did because nobody can tell the story better than the person who's lived it.
