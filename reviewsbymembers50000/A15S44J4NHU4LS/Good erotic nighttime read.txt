 The first Sandra Brown book I read is the more recent Envy which I found to be a great book.  I only realize now after reading the description of the author on the last page of this book that she started out as a romance novel writer.  Was I in for a pleasant surprise!  I had been reading a string of action-suspense books from Jonathan Kellerman and Robert Ludlum the past few weeks. In many ways, this book accomplishes what it set out to do.  Plotwise it's very simple.  It's about two identical twins who couldn't be more different from one another that switch places for a few days.  All hell breaks loose when a friend comes to visit Ann's fiance.  This friend falls in love with the ersatz twin, Allison, who is a socially awkward researcher in a lab.  In the end, this friend (Spencer) makes a woman out of her and gives her the most precious gift a woman could ask for -- a child.  There are of course the requisite last minute conflicts that hint at a bad ending, but the reader should note that Sandra Brown likes happy endings.  (She hasn't strayed yet.) This is an easy read (200+ pages in nice 12pt. font).  I recommend this book as a nighttime read for those needing some stimulation. FLAP rating: F:4.5 L:4 A:0 P:1.5 * For an explanantion of my rating system, please visit my About You area (kerki) and look for my review on The Bourne Supremacy by Robert Ludlum.
