 Surprise,surprise. I must agree with the other reviewer, this movie has very positive message. My daughter wanted to see this but I didn't. The trailers did not do it any justice, Im so happy I saw It; It left me feeling inspired. This movie is truly about learning to love your self, dispite what the world says is beautiful or "normal". Simple yet powerful. A must see.
