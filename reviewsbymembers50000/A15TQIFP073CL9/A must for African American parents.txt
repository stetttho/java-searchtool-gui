 Jawanza Kunjufu is always sincere in his works, and this book is no diffrent. And while I can't see this book motivating our youth;It's still a great tool for parents and teachers alike. I could not give the book five stars because, brother Kunjufu stress employment instead of business ownership, which shows how old school he is, and also the age of this work. This genaration is about The Hustler mindset. The idea he has that "some work is better then none" is outdated. This book is like my computer it needs an upgrade. It the 2k's we get our hustle game on my brother!...
