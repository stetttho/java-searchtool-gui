And Zipper(THE MAKER) has never let me down.you dudes are acting like girls here, crying oh, it's too hard, grow some nuts kid...Anyway,this is a good look. The only game that can mess with this is kill zone. This game has got better! can you belive that? well, it's true. You boys need to stop crying about online play,and play single player, unless you need some other men to keep you company? Hmmmm. Big up! socom 3 is worth the wait..
