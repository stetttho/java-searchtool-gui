 This women was a teenager when she took on presidential candidate william j clinton,and guess what?she ripped his ass in half.I  think he assumed she was just some nigga he could push around and compare to david duke (boy was he wrong) Any how, this very CD is what set off that firestorm.If you are looking for a hot flow?you won't find that here. But what you will find is powerfull messages over erick sandler tracks(PUBLIC ENEMY).This CD is a part of hiphop history,or should be.This women had so much fire!what happen to her?what happen to cube?what happened to revolution.If you are in search of AFRICAN-AMERICAN history you should get this CD.This CD was cry that only comes from destitution..Up date LEVI don't know a damm thing.He don't like it cuse she was a thorn in the side of EURO-AMERICANS.I still rock this son.
