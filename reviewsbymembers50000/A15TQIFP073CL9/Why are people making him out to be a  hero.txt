 Yeah, i was born and bred in brooklyn so i knew of this dude even seen him a few times in downtown brooklyn,but so what!flicks like this you don't buy you rent or get it on bootleg.you would think 50 did something for people our people!50 was TERRORIST of sorts.But people on this so called "documentory" talk about how sweet and caring he was.You would think this dude was malcom x!!one fool said it should be a statue on fulton street for him. Ahh, why? the man was running around killing his own people.Why didn't he rob a bank in manhattan? instead of liquor stores in his on own hood not smart.
