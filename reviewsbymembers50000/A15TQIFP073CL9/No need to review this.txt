 Can you belive this CD is 15 years old! damm, son I can recall rocking this until the tape popped. If you were not around back then wow, you missed the feeling of hearing this live on the radio. Every brown man was saying "what up god" because of this cd. These brothers had a huge influence on my search for truth. This cd warms my soul the way Al Green use to warm my moms. Peace gods.
