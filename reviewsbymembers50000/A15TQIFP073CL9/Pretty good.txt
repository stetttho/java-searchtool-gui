 I had to admire the entrepreneurial sprit. Yes, they did cuse much havoc up in harlem, but if the energy they had was only channled in a more positive way, damm, they could have given billy gates a run for his money. These brothers were that smart. This documentery was told mostly by Rich Porters sister, she does a decent job in recalling the birth of her brothers drug empire.Worth a look. But i could not give it 5 stars becuse the sound was a bit shabby at times. Over all good work, interesting story.
