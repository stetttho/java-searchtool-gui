 You ppl are smoking!this movie is so wack and unrealistic. No man is going to pick up and jump on a plane, go to EUROPE and then climb up a big ass snow covered mountain for a women he don't even know. They never even had one date.Were these ppl watching the same movie?? This movie is a 1950's remake by J.B Prestley. Maybe in the 50's this was romantic but in the 2k's it can't fly. This flick did not even make a brother chuckle. You want a good laugh, check out the 40 year old virgin. Now that was funny. This is trash. Flicks like this is the reason the movie industry is in trouble. My advice, look for your local bootleg man, or wait for the DVD. Peace
