 When I was a kid at 19 years of age. I saw a man selling books near the train in NYC. The book I wanted, was  for me at the time, was a pricey 20 bucks, the brother told me something I would never forget, he said "young brother you can't put a price on this kind of information". Hey, maybe he was a good salesmen , but it changed my preception on the value of information... How can't you put a price on this information? that's crazy. This is GOLD!!. This is something I will leave in my will. Wonderfully done!! Bravo PBS.. Buy this for your childrens sake.
