 If you want to find the truth, I mean the the truth of who you are,you must be honest. Most people lie so much, and that's one reason they have a difficult time advancing on the spiritual path. Here is a thought this very book made me see. Humans live in the past or the future;we always ponder on the mistakes we made in life, when in all reality earth is a school, we are supposed to make mistakes and learn and grow. But we some spend so much time and mental energy with thoughts of regrets of the past, women say "I should have never had sex with that jerk".And the SEX took place ten years ago, move on!. men do the same thing but, only when we have a child with her and the child support man is at the door. my point. the book states every time we go back in the past we give the past new energy. We must try to live in the moment. Example: sunday morning comes instead of thinking about cooking or,the million things you have to do. Enjoy that moment. At dinner with your love ones, ENJOY that moment, try and stop thinking of the future when you will be so you will be so rich you won't care what the bill will cost.We all got it ruff. look at oprah with all her money and fame she still got the door slamed in her face! look at mike jordan his father got murdered!.So we never know.Enjoy the book it helped me to bring you these words hoped they helped. PS What I wrote is more difficult then it sounds but we must try, let's be honest, most of us will not win the lotto so let's try and count our blessings instead of our misery. You know how many folks don't have a computer to read these words.
