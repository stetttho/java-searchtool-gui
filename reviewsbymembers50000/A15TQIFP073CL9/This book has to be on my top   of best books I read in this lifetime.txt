 I say that simply becuse,most humans OD on fear.Some people still have not got their punk ass on a plane since 9-11!.This book as simple as it may appear brought me to a new level of overstanding,of how fear blocks our growth as humans. This book is a must have.Honestly, it will change your life.Thanks Susan..
