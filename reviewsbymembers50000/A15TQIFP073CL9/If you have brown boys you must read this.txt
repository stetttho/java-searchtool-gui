 Sad,yet true. it's a war being waged on our boys!it must be time for some type of "messiah type" to come fourth from our people.GET THE BOOK forget the cost.you can't put a price on this info.One thing i must say to you brother Kunjufu.You said in the book that "crime is based on greed and power,not need" page 117.Yes, somtimes that is the case.But sometimes it can be need as well.Let me quote the rapper common "we write songs about wrong cuse it's hard to see right."Greed is when you have something and want more.No,ive never seen the inside of any type of jail.But i OVERSTAND sometimes brothers feel they have no options but hustling on the block.Sad,yet true.Peace love goes out to you.Loved the book.
