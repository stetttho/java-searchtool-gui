 Smooth the hell out!only for the grown and sexy,only for the GROWN and sexy.I'm digging this big time can you tell?this is the type of CD you put in and lay back.Not lean back, you lay back!.I adore "when love calls".We need more music like this.Even though most rappers are 30+ they cater to teenagers.So it's exciting to see someone making music for a mature crowd.Keep it going my brother we got your back!!I still got some love for hiphop but let's be honest the ying-yang twins??
