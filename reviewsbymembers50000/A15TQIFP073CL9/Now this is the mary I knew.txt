 WOW!! she did it fam, in a major way. The cut with Mary and Raphael sadiq "I found my everything" Is so soulful. Mary sounds like Aretha Franklin on the real. "Father in you" is so deep! she put her hart on that track; damm that gave me chills. If you are a women who's father was not around for you, you will relate. Iam not sure if you can put it on and leave it, because Iam so stuck on certain songs, like "Be without you". Iam so happy the real Mary is back to teach the younger sisters how it should be done. Take notes girls..
