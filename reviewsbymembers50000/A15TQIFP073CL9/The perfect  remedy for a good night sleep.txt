 This was just boring,any person with a video recorder could have shot this. Where the hell is the dialogue? yes, i know,a picture is worth a blah,blah. But this is sillyness. Afican children with beautiful brown faces singing with HIV,was moving. That's the only reson for my three stars. This guy filmed the clouds on the plane for a good five minutes or more,we know what that look like!. AIDS in Africa is a very serious subject, this could have been much better. I don't care what Martin Scorsese says. OPRAH show have done far better shows on this subject then this. Rent don't buy..
