 A strong African-American women. Now for melaninated(brown)people, this story is nothing new.The  main character (Nanny) was the type of women,that helped us men to endure the horror of  slavery.  But ,seeing it come to life on DVD. Well, now that's a whole other matter. I saw this movie twice,the second time, it hit me over the head, that was my mother on the screen!! the same loving and powerfull women of AFRICAN decent. I fell in love with Nanny, in a respctfull way. with all due respct, the other actors did a wonderfull job, it's an allstar cast,in my view. But as you can tell by now, Nanny moved me deeply. A must see for your family.
