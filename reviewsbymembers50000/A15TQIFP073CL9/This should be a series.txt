 I saw this once by my self, then with my family. It was better with family. The teens and preteens loved it! so did the adults. It's rear you can sit down with your family and watch something this clean, no violence, no cussing,not even the N-word was said that shocked the hell out of me. They shot this on location in harlem. The series follows a trio of brothers though their hardships. A must see for your famiy. I think i will add this one to my DVD collection. After seeing 50 cents flick, this is a breath of wonderful fresh air.
