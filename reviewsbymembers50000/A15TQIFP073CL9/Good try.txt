 He's not nor will be one the rap gods but he's still better then 99% of these trash rappers out at the moment. but the skits are a foolish.overall kanye's production is what holds up the CD,becuse his flow is a bit stiff.I think his next cd will be better but you should get this one ain't nothing else is out..EXCEPT NASIR JONES
