 How can I express my self so that people overstand how I feel about this flick? It's trash! one of the worst African-American movies that I have ever seen. T.I. is stiff as a corpus on screen. In many ways this was sort of a "roll bounce" flick movie all over again. For now it's bootleg or blockbuster. Download it, get it on bootleg, what ever. Just don't pay over five dollars to see it.. Yeah, I put this flick on blast and I come from the gutter FYI. But one bright spot in this bootleg classic. LAUREN LONDON those dimples oh lord!!! the hell with clifford harris AKA T.I. she stole the movie.
