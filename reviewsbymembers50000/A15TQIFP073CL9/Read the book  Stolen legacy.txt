 Your saying what the hell that book has to do with this game?well my friend.Yes,I played the game.Beat it and all.But the more I played the more I wondered.Do the makers of this game care how any people are being brainwahed?.The greeks stole and plagirized nile valley concepts.These people were "black" Egyptians in Africa.Yes,egypt is in africa.But,any how.Games like this even as fun as it is; make greeks out to be so powerfull.Yet most greeks were known homos.Hey,look this stuff up cuse I could be a nut job with nothing better to do.In all reality KARTOS would have been getting it in his KARTOS.Greeks were right in one aspect, calling it mythology.Becuse the greeks being powerfull "GODS" is truly a MYTH!.PS I have nothing against homosexuals it's your life.Live it the way you choose.
