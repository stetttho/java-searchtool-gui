 Amazing, on the "paid in full" level. The tracks are fire, the rhymes, crazy!. Now this is truly a must. If you never heard this,well, your not really down with hiphop music, nor, do you really know much about our art form. In this day in time with all the trash on the air waves, and with hiphop at it's lowest creative point since it's inception, it's nothing short of a miracle this was even made. You can tell these brothers made this becuse of the love of hiphop, not cuse "it's a hustle".
