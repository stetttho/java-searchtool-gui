 Dame dash or dame dummy?.Movies like this is one of the many reasons for"blackmen" being looked upon as thugs,I forgot that's now a "good thing"(being called a thug).This, what ever the hell this is-is just sad.Their so many stories to be told about Afrian-American culture.What about Robert Smalls,Paul Robinson,John henrik Clarke,Isis and osirus,they were people of color.Movies like this prove "blacks" are not good at being "gangsta".It's not our nature,( atleast not most of us )that's one reason you end up in two places.EUROPEANS are the real gangsters they dominate earth with brute force and blood shead!!while you fools watch this bullcrap!!and try to live this out. All while feasting off of the crumbs from your masters table..What fools you mortals be!!Dame dash a gangsta?? what a joke.
