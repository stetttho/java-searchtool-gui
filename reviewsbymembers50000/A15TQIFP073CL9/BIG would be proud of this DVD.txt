 Put together very well. Lots of info on the murder of BIG. The shooting of TUPAC in NYC. Cez, just kept it real like most brooklyn catz do. You will find out how fast diddy got the hell out of LA after biggie was gun down. The real story on kim and the jr mafia split. See, the best thing about this DVD that stands out from all the others about big and pac,is this man (lil cez) was their when big was killed.! He was in the car so,that alone qualifies him to talk on the matter. Good job cez and the rest of the mafia. You dudes rep BROOKLYN the right way.
