 The people that are rating this 5 stars are most likely white teenagers. This is really a cartoon(CGI). I hate when white people try to make stuff about hiphop. Just look at 50 cent's movie. So many cornball lines. "Iam a gangsta grand pa and iam proud of it". This, junk exemplifies my feelings. If you dig this, come bid on this bridge I own in brooklyn. wake up kids this ain't hiphop. 50 should sue. It's that bad. Trust.*** These punk ass white boys didn't even get out of the car and shoot real hood footage***
