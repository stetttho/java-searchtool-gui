 It's very difficult for caucasians to review this book as you can see. That is the reason for the such low ratings of this great work. Don't let them fool you for one moment and turn you away from a book, that will open your mind up in such away, you will never, no , not ever see life the same. Most Euro-Americans swear to heaven they have a patent on anything "intellectual". Yet, if you get them in a conversation they will run you in circles, without admiting they risk melenoma, for the sake of looking "BRONZE" i.e. BROWN! which is truly what African-Americans are, not black,not blacksheep,not blackball,etc. This is the type of truth that's hard for most caucasians to swallow;because it's reality. This book pulls back the curtain on "The great wizard of oz" (THE SYSTEM OF RACISM IN AMERICA) and shows were it all stems from. That's why the EUROPEANS "white people" hate this book so much. Most Caucasians are so brainwashed they think they are really AMERICANS. Your ancestors came form EUROPE. Fleeing death and dis-ease. Looking for wealth. Ask your Grandparents were you really came from. You can't fool all of us, not nowadays..They say truth is more stranger then fiction.This book epitomise that saying. Peace
