 I don't know anything about Annde Geddes. All I know is that thiis calendar is up at my house and people love it. I can't believe all the rave reviews people give it when they see it. The product is simple enought. It's a 12-month calendar with a picture above the month. All of the pictures in this calendar contain a baby dressed in outfit paying tribute to the month. All of the pictures are well taken and I must admit the pictures are quite cute. Some don't do as much for me as others do, but it's not that bad of a calendar. I would never buy this calendar for myself. I would buy it for any woman in my life that loves children and babies and I have. It's a cute calendar that can be enjoyed by all.
