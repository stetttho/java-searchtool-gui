 I really didn't like John Mayer's new album. I do like the new song Bigger than my Body, but all his stuff sounds to much alike. He is to much like Dave Matthew's and the whole raspy voice thing gets annoying after a while. Most of the tunes are catchy and the songwritng is good, it just didn't have the variety that would make me want to buy it. If your a John Mayer fan, then it should be right up your alley, but from what my little sister has played of his new album, I just can't get into it.
