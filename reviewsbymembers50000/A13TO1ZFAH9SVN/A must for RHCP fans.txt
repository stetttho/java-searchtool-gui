 You know when a band has been around as long as the Red Hot Chili Peppers and put out as many albums as they have, your gonna get a greatest hits album. Well for all RHCP fans it's finally here. The Chili Peppers have had some big hits over the years. Songs like Under the Bridge, Californication, Give It Away, Suck My Kiss, Parrael Universe, Scar Tissue, and By The Way are some of the many hits the band has had. All of them are on this album and really does contain all their hit songs new and old. I don't see why people are so pissed over this album. It's exactly what it says it is a Greatest Hits album. All of these songs helped make the band big and got huge radio play. I'm glad to say I own this album and I hope the Red Hot Chili Peppers never stop making great music.
