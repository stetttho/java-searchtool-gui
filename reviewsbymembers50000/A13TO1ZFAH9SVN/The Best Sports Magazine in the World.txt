 Sports Illustrated is the only place to go in Weekly sports subscriptions. So many things make is simply spectacular and few have ever been able to match it. Sports Illustrated is pretty simple. It's a weekly magazine that covers the biggest events in sports. They recap highlights from the previous week and they preview things that are coming up. They really only do the big four sports in the U.S.A., but if something is drawing HEADLINES they will tell you. They have always been great about doing that. They don't mention a lot about smaller sports unless its during something like the Olympics. The pictures are great in Sports Ill. I'm not sure if all of there pictures come from there Photographers, but they have the best shots out there. You can be garunteed to get the best photos from the biggest events with Sports Ill. Sports Ill tends to play not to favortism a lot. They do commonly jump on bandwagons, but they have to sell issues and they do follow the headlines so it's understandable. I still wish they wouldn't talk about Tiger Woods so much and they do love the media favored teams. One of the best reasons to get Sports Ill is because of Rick Reily. His column is on the last page of every issue and is one of the best weekly columns in the world. His column is ever changing because he writes about everything. He writes with a lot of passion and emotion. He is simply fantastic as are almost all of the writers that write for Sports Ill. If you love sports and want to read about them weekly then you must pick this up. There has been a subscription for more than 15 years between me and my father and we absolutely love it. No other weekly magazine comes close to offering you what Sports Illustrated does. If your a big sports fan subscribe to this now, you will not regret it.
