 Van Helsing is a great action movie and like most big budget moives it gets a line of toys made based off of it. Anna Valerious who is played by the beautiful Kate Beckinsale is one of the best figures in the set. The toy does a remarable look to it and it does kind of look like Beckinsale. The outfit is just like the one she wore in the movie and the toy just look great. Her accesories are ok. She comes with a big old sword and pistol to slay those evil doers with. This is a fun toy for fans of the movie and is a nice addition to Beckinsale collectors.
