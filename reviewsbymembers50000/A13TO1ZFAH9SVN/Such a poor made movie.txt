 I didn't come to this movie with high expectations. I expected crazy fight scenes, a bad plot, no character development, and was expecting a lot of pretty woman. I was disappointed with almost everything. The fight scenes were ridiculous. At least make them a little believable. There is no way they can do Matrix like jumps and kicks. The fact they never reload and miss is also stupid. The plot is so lame anybody could follow it. Demi Moore plays a renegade angel who is out for payback. The only good thing about Demi was how incredible she looked to be 40+ years old. I was disappointed with Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu, and Drew Barrymore. All are pretty woman and none of them did anything for me in this movie. I usually like most of them but they were all horrible. What was up with switching Bernie Mac and Bill Murray. What ever producer made that move made a big mistake. He was the best thing in the first movie. This is a lame movie. I'm glad I rented it instead of buying it. The special features aren't all that great at all and I don't really see why this got an Unrated version. There is nothing that would have changed the PG-13 rating. Don't waste your money on this.
