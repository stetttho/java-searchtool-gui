 I must say I am LDS and I did love this movie. Any one that says it's a propaganda movie is full of it. It's a wonderful movie made by Disney with non LDS actors. It tells the story of Elder John Groberg and some of his experinces in the Tonga mission. It doesn't preach LDS ideals. I had a strong southern baptist member tell me the movie made them cry. It was seen in theaters and is a great movie. If you want to see a movie that shows enduring to the end and compassionate love, this is your movie. It's the simple story of a simple man doing what he belives is right and trying to help other people. If only more people in hollywood would make more movies like this. What a better place the world would be.
