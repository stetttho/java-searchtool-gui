 I loved Minority Report. The movie had me hooked early and took me on a fantastic ride. The story is complex but in one short paragrah I'll tell a little bit about it. John Anderton(Tom Cruise) is the chief of Pre-Crime in Washington D.C. and is accused of future murder. The movie then goes on a wild goose chase where he is trying to prove he didn't do it. Tom Cruise is outstanding in the movie. This is one of his greatest performances of all time. He plays the character well. You feel for John Anderton as you see the movie unwind. You feel for him because of the fine acting that Cruise does. Colin Farrel is good in the movie aswell. He plays Danny Whitmore a federal agent is trying to see if pre-crime works. He ends up chasing Anderton in the movie. He plays the character so well. Farrel does such a good job of making you hate him. I love that kind of stuff. The special effects in the movie are some of the best all time. They bring out some scary ideas in the movie that could be possible some time in the future. Roger Ebert said "Minority Report reminds us of why we go to the movies" and I couldn't agree any more. This is a cinematic masterpiece and a must own to any DVD collection.
