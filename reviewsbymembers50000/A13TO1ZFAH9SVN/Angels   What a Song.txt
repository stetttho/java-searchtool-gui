 I'm a pretty big Robbie Williams fan and this song is the reason why. Angels is one of the most best songs ever written. I can't believe this song didn't make this guy a house hold name in the U.S. His pop is so much better than the other male american artists. Like I said earlier Angels is a beautiful love song. The music is great and Williams vocals are fantastic. It's a moving song and the chorus on it is awesome. Those are some lyrics being sung there. I DJ on the side and I've played this song and seen people cry to it. This is an incredible song. Everybody should hear it at least once. Back for Good is an alright song. I hear you really have to know Robbie Williams to appreciate it, so I don't quite get all of it. I still like it however. Walk this Sleigh is I guess what you could call Williams attempt to do a christmas song. This is an ok song. It's nothing to get to excited about. The reason to get this single is for the song Angels. This is a fantastic song, and no music collection is complete without it in there somewhere.
