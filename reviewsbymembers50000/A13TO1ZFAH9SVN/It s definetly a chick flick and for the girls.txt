 I am a huge fan of movies. I do happen to like some musicals. My mom owns 40 something and has made me endure all 40 something of them. Chicago is a decent musical, but is more of a chick flick musical. Chicago tells the story of Velma and Roxie Hart. Both vixens have commited murder and are trying to be the biggest vixens in town. They both get defended by Richard Gere's character who is the smoothest working lawyer in town. Will Roxie and Velma go and stay in jail for murder or will they run the night life of Chicago. You will just have to watch the movie and find out. I liked Catherine Zeta Jones in Chicago. She is one of th most beautiful woman in the world. She is great as Velma. I dind't think she was as good as Nicole Kidman in Moulin Rouge, but Catherine does a worthy job singing and dancing. She has a great voice and dances well. It's funny towards the end of the movie as you can see she is staring to show her pregnancy. I didn't like Renee Zellweger that much. I don't think she is all that pretty of a woman. Catherine and Queen Latifah easily steal the show in my opinion. She sings and dances all right, but not as good as the others. Richard Gere is smooth in the movie. This guy was my hero when I was younger and he was married to Cindy Crawford. He does a good job being the lawyer. Girls and die hard musical fans will like Chicago. I don't think most guys will like it. I can see why it won best picture because it is a good film. It's just not a film I like that much.
