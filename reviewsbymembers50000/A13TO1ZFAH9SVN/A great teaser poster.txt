 The Terminal movie poster is a great moive poster. It teases you with the idea of whats in the movie and it does with such simplicty. Viktor Navorski(Tom Hanks) is standing there looking into the unknown. We have "Life is Waiting" underneath it. It says enough of the story in that the man is stranded at an airport. No fancy images, just the star of the movie and nothing else. I love simplicty like this. This is a  great movie. The poster is too. Check the movie, the movie out, you won't regret it. This is a fun poster but the price above is to much. If you can pick it up cheaper than this, you've got yourself a nice piece of work.
