 There isn't a better vocalist in the world than Clay Aiken right now. His second single the way has done great on the charts and the video has ben popular as well. This has also been a great single as well. It's just as good as his first single. The Way is the same version you hear on the album. Solitare however is unreleashed anywhere esle. If you want it you have to buy this single or hit itunes or some other service. I'm glad I own this single. Clays fans will definetly want to buy it, and fans of American Idol will also like it.
