 Risk is one of my all-time favorite games. I've been playing it for almost 15 years and can remember a lot of memorable Risk matches with my brothers and sisters. This game is a classic from one of the best gaming companies ever formed in Parker Brothers.  Risk is simple enough. Your goal is rule to the world. The game starts off randomly with your pieces being set all over the place. It's then up to you to make your stratedy from there and work on your goal towards global conquest. You should try to take continents so you can start off each turn with more base pieces than the rest of your opponents.  Your goal should be to get enough cards from taking contries to form a set. Sets give you a set amount of pieces that you start that one turn off with. The more sets that are turned in the higher the value they go. This is one of the easiest ways to win the game just because of the massive army you can put together.  We've added house rules in over the years. We've made peace treaties with each other and done tons of different things to mix the game up. Nothing though compares to a good old fashion game of Risk though.  The game does have some educational value for any parents out there who might be wondering on getting this for their child. Like so many other people I learned a lot of my early countries from watching people play or playing Risk myself. Your child also learns some basic stratedy which is essential to winning this game.  This one is a must own. It's been a classic for a long time. No home in the world should be without this game. It's fun and educatinal. So pick up a copy and sit down and play it. You won't regret it.
