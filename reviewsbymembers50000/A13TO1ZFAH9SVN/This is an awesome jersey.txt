 I have the pleasure of living in Winter Haven, Fl which is right next door to good old Auburndale. I almost went to Auburndale High School and I'm a huge Tracy McGrady fan. This is an awesome throwback jersey. It's one of the ultimate ways to show fanship for Tracy. It's a pretty pricey jersey, but not a lot of people have it. You'll really be showing your love for McGrady by wearing it. Tracyloves Auburndale High School. They recently named the schools gym after him and he's proud of his roots. He does charitable work for the school and can often be found playing on the city courts during the summer. Show your love for the best player in the NBA with this cool throwback jersey. You won't regret buying it, if you can afford it and you love McGrady.
