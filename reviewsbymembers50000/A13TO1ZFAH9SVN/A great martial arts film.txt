 I liked Mortal Kombat. I saw the movie when it came out in theaters and was impressed. I own the DVD and am proud to say so. Mortal Kombat tells the story of the Mortal Kombat tournament. The Mortal Kombat tournament is a tournament for all the marbles. If Shang Sun and his allies when they take control of the portals coming to earth. If the good guys Johhny Cage, Sonja Blade, and Lu Kang win they save earth. The humans are helped by the rain god Rayden(Lambert) in there effort to win the tournament. The movie has all your favorite characers from the first game. You get to see them all in action. The action scenes are great and are well done. They have real actors that know how to do the martial arts doing it. The character special moves look great, as Mortal Kombat has excellent special effects. It's a fun movie. There isn't to much redeeming social value out of it, but I like the movie. It's a great martial art action sci fi flick. Don't miss out on it.
