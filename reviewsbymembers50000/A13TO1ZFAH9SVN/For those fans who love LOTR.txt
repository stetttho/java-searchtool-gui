 Lord of the Rings Trivial Pursuit was gotten as a birthday present for my dad. He is a big fan of the books and movies. He's read the books all at least once for the last 20 years and he is a die-hard fan of the movies. I got the game with high hopes for him knowing he would destroy everybody else in the house. I was correct. He is man handeling us. However, us fans of the movie in the household do a good job of holding our own. We are haveing a lot of fun with it, and it's only making the anticipation of the third movie bigger.  If you love LOTR this game is for you. It's another way to enjoy middle earth. I think all fans would like it and I think fans of triva games would like it if they know anytihng about LOTR. I'm glad a copy of it is in my house.
