 Daredevil was an awesome movie and has the soundtrack to go with it. Not only being a kick butt soundtrack it can also be claimed as the laucnching pad of one of the most popular bands in the world right now with Evanesance. Daredevil has it all. It's got a great mixture of music from rock, metal, rap, techno, and a great piano song by Evanesance. The first few songs on the album alone make it worth the money. Fuel, The Calling, Saliva, and Seether make an amazing opening set. I like Seethers song the best. It's one of the hard rocking songs of the year that needs some more credit. Evanesance also has two songs on the album. They have the rocking Bring Me to Life with Paul McCoy of 12 Stones. This song was number 1 in america earlier this year and I can clearly see why. It's a great song. My Immortal is there other song. It's a beautiful piano song. Amy has such an amazing voice. She is a breath of fresh air for hard rock. Overall it's a great album. It's got songs from other bands you will recognize like Hoobastank, chevelle, and Moby. Don't miss out on the soundtrack. It's easily the best of the year so far.
