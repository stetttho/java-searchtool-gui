 Mortal Kombat Annihilation was a poor attempt at a sequel and is one of the worst ever made. MKA takes off immediatley where the first film ended. The bad guys are not honoring the humans victory at the tournament, and they are preparing to invade earth. Once again, it's up to our heros to save the day and prevent the emperor from invading. MKA storyline is bad. They don't leave characters origns to what they were in the game. They killed off the funniest character from the first movie in Johnny Cage. Once again to much is focused on Lu Kang and his quest to be the best. The special effects weren't as good as the first. When the characters do there animality's it's very bad looking. Don't waste your money on the flick. Even if your a hardcore MK fan I can't see you liking this. I got in a promo pack and would never have paid money to have seen it. Don't waste your cash. Trust Me.
