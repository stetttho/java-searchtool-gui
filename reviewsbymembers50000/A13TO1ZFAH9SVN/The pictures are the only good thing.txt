 I love Keith Jackson. He's one of the top play by play guys to ever do it if not the best. He should have looked around and done some more homework because he is wrong in a lot of places in this book. I couldn't believe Keith kept with the media favorite Big 10 and Pac 10. Over half of the people on their three all american teams are from this confrence. The favortism is ridiculos. There are also some guys on this team because they were popular with the media. It's a shame they put a lot of guys on this team because of it. This really is a hard book to try to right because of the favorites people have. It's also a hard book to write because of all the players and all the players from the different decades. There are no way guys from the 50's and 60's could stay with the young men who play in college football today. It's hard to make comparisons. The pictures in the book are fantastic. It's pretty easy to find this book cheap and pick it up for the pictures alone. There are some great shots and a lot of the quotes in the book are great. They are the only thing that made me able to stomach this. This book play favorites a lot. It's worth buying for the pictures. Don't buy it to read it. Buy it look at it.
