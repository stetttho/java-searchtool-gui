 Jimmy Fallon is the best cast member on Saturday Night Live, and him and his sister have callaborated for a great book. I Hate This Place is the perfect book for anybody, and especially pessimist's. The book is broken down into six chapters. The chapters include; If you were thinking of..., When People say..., Personlal Reflections of the Pessimist, My Story, Optimistic Advice you Shouldn't Follow, and Daily Affirmations for the Pessimist. The book will touch a funnybone in everybody. It's a great blend of humor that anybody can enjoy. I think my favorite passage in the book was "A Penny Saved is a Penny Earned....Pennies are Worthless." I hate this place is anything but that and would be a great addition to anybodies library.
