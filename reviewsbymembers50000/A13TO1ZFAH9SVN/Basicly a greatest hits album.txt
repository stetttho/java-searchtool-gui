 No Doubt isn't calling it a greatest hits album, but rather there singles from the last decade. It's definetly a must own for No Doubt fans. It contains all the hits they've put out. If you've heard No Doubt on the radio, then you'll hear this song on this album. I love Just a Girl, Don't Speak, and Spider Webs. They were from one of the greatest albums ever made with Tragic Kingdom. Tragic Kingdom was basicly Gwen Stefani's diary in a lyrical form. Those are my top three tracks off the album. This is a good album. No Doubt fans will like it, and fans that just like to hear them on the radio should really love it, because it's just those hits. Just hits and no filler tracks.
