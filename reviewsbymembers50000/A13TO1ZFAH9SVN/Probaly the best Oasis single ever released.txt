 It's a shame Oasis singles aren't released more in the U.S. It's also a shame "Whatever" hasn't been heard by the average american. It's truly one of the best songs they've ever written and this single is one of the only ways to get it. "Whatever" is a great song. It's such a powerful emotional acoutic ballad. Noel really shows his song writing abilities and he is truly one of the top songwriters penning songs today. He is very underrated and I just about garuntee you'll love him too if you hear "Whatever." "(It's Good)To be Free" is a great song. You can find it on The Masterplan album. I think it is truly an underrated Oasis song. It's penned by Noel and has a very catchy chorus. I like this song a lot. "Half the World Away" is another song off The Masterplan. It's a beautiful written song by Noel. It's another great acoustic song. I saw him play this one live and people where crying as he sang. It's a great song. "Slide Away" is another great Oasis song. It's off there debut album Definetly Maybe and it's one of there classics. It's a great love song and the version of it on this is song by Liam and is the same one on Definetly Maybe. The acoustic version song by Noel on MTV Unplugged is the best version you will ever hear, but this one is a close second. This is a great Single. All the songs are quality singles and I would reccomend this song to anybody. It's not just something for an Oasis fan. These are all deep emotional songs that anyone can enjoy. It's Definetly a must own for Oasis fans and you should check it out.
