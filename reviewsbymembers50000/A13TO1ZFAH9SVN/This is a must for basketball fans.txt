 NBA Street Vol.2 has quickly established itself as one of the greatest basketball games ever made.  The game is exactly as it describes itself. You play NBA ball on the streets with real NBA players. Street rules are in play, so there is no travel, carrying, fouls, goaltending, or double dribble. You can do also the latest moves from the street and the rosters are fairly updated. The thing that really sold me on the game was the create a baller option and taking him on the road. It's fun to develop him and beat the best street ballers in the world. Great option to the game. This is a fun multi player game. I hook it up and play with my bros all the time and we always have a good time. The game doesn't get old. Like I said earlier, this is a must for all video basketball game fans. You won't regret it.
