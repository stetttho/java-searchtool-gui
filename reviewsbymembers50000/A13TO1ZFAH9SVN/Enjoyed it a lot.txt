 Snatch was reccomended to me by a good friend. I must admit being a little skeptical about a Guy Ritchie film since the dud "Swept Away." I was suprised by Snatch, because it's an awesome film. Snatch is a bunch of stories within a big story. You've got a stolen diamond that no one can seem to hold on to, underground boxing, gangs, and what modern gangst tail wouldn't have the russian and some ex kgb. Snatch has it all and it's fun wathcing each story develop in the film. Guy Ritchie wrote and directed this one and he has made some excellent characters. You gotta love Brad Pitt's characther Micky the gypsy barefisted boxing champions. Jason Statham is great as Turkish the boxing promoter who things just go bad for. There are a lot of other fun characters in the movie and that's where the driving part of the movie comes from. Snatch is a great film. I liked it a lot and would reccomend it to just about everybody. Fans of British humor will really get a kick out of it, and so will Brad Pitt fans. He does a great job in the film. I own the film and I'm glad to say I do.
