 Everybody has this mental picture of the game golf. You think of rich guys, in nice clothes, who have nice cars, and live in country clubs. The last thing you think of his a punk wanna be hockey player. That's Happy Gilmore for you. Happy Gilmore(Sandler) is a man who was raised by her grandmother. She owes money to the IRS and can't pay it. They take her house from her and give them a limited amount of time to get it back. Happy joins the PGA pro tour and must get his grandmas house back. The way he plays golf is great. He's loud and obnoxious. He has a running into the drive. He's known for his long drive and horrible putting skills. He treats golf like hockey and is a crowd favorite. Only Adam Sandler could play this role. He is absolutely amazing. He had me laughing like crazy. The scene with him and Carl Weathers in the putt putt course with the clown almost made me puke from laughing so hard. It's a great Adam Sandler film. You can argue it as the best that he had done. Don't miss out on a garunteed laugh.
