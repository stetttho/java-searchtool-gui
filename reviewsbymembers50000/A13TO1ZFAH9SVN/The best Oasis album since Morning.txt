 I really have enjoyed owning Heathen Chemistry. It's a return back to the glory days of Oasis. The album has songs penned by every member of the band, but Noel is still the man with songs like Force of Nature, Stop Crying Your Heart Out, She is Love, and Little by Little. Force of Nature is an awesome song. The guitar is checky. Noel also sings this song. I think he has great vocals and I give him the edge over Liam. It's really one of Oasis's all time best songs. Stop Crying your Heart is a beautiful song. I love the Piano in it. The vocals are great and it has a nice mix to it. It's a great love song and I've seen many a girls cry to it. She is Love is another great song. It's a great acoustic set. Little by Little is another great song. It shows somewhat of a spirtual side to Oasis. It's catchy and a powerful ballad. Heathen Chemistry is a must for any Oasis fan. I'd reccommend it to any one trying to decide if they like Oasis. They are one of the top bands in the world and this album proves it.
