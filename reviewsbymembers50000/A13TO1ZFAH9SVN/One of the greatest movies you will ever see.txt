 America is such an awesome place to live. One of the great things about America is the American Dream. Hoosiers is a masterpiece tale of an American Dream. In 1954 the Hickory Hoosiers pulled off basketball history. They went all the way from that little home town to win the state championship in one of the greatest basketball states in the union. No small school had ever one before and the Hoosiers changed that. This is there awesome tail in one of the most powerful movies you will ever see. Gene Hackman is great as Coach Dale. Hackman is one of the greatest living actors. He just becomes his charcters. When one of his charcters gets mad and he gets that tone in his voice I get goosebumps and just say wow. He's a powerful presence on screen. This is one of the greatest roles he ever played and I really thought he should have been Oscar nominated for it. Dennis Hopper is great as the town drunk. He was one of my favorite characters in the movie. As the boys are doing the unthinkable on the court he does the unthinkable with his life. He stops drinking and starts acting like a man. All the guys who played boys on the team were great. I liked the guy who played Jimmy a lot. High expectations were put on him with the film. He's believable as the country boy sharpshooter and he helps make the movie. I like the guy who plays Ollie. I have the VHS of Hoosiers and on the cover you see him on the shoulders of his teammates with his hands in the air. That's a beautiful scene. I also like the kid who played Hoopers son in the film. He does a good job with his character. Hoosiers is a powerful film. It's a great cast and the basketball is great in the film. It's one of the best movies you will ever see and this is a film that everybody should see. It's one everybody should own, and I've never met a person who didn't like it. I cried in the movie. It's that good and I'm not afraid to admit that. You won't regret buying this one.
