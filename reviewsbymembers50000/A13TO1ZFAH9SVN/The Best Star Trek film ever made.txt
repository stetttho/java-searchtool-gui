 Star Trek films have been big blockbusters in hollywood for over 20 years now and this is the best one they've ever done. Star Trek VI was really a breath of fresh air for the movie franchise. V really stunk and was a bad made movie. The whole thing with god was bad and Spocks brother made a bad movie experience.  Star Trek VI reunited the franchise with director Nicholas Meyer who did Star Trek II which is the second best Trek film ever done. Once again the crew of the Enterprise has been asked to save the galaxy. The klingon empire is dying and they need help. The chancelor of the klingon empire however is murdered and Kirk is the accused. It's now up to the crew to save him and prevent interstellar war. The original cast is all awesome in this film. You see plent of the big three in Kirk, Spock, and McCoy. Shatner, Nimoy, and Kelly all had such great chemistry with each other and looked real close. The tribute to Kelly on this DVD is nice. All three have great performances as does the rest of the crew. It's sad to see a good thing like that end. It was such a humble start to a show that is now a multi billion dollar franchise. I don't think any of those guys thought when they started this show in the 60's that 10 movies and four spin offs would have come from it. Star Trek VI is a great film. You don't have to be a fan of Star Trek to like it, you just won't appreciate it as much. You can't be a trekkie and not have this film.
