 Polotics is one of those things you either disagree or you agree with. I found myself in the place of not liking with Michael Moore's book Dude, Where's My Country. I found him to be hypocritical just like the people he bashes. Polotics is something you have to take a side with and mine is not with Moore. I'm Libertarian and frankly can't stand him and other political critics. It's always about their opinion and their is no debate. Liberals will like this book. Republicans won't. It's as simple as that and I didn't like it.
