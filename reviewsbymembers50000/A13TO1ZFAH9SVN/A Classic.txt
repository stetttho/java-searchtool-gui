 The Adventures of Robing Hood is best Robin Hood movie ever made. Hands down with second place for away. Errol Flynn plays the classic hero in a tail that will leave you saying "Wow." I first saw this movie when I was three years old and was so excited to see it on DVD. The movie is the classic tail of the hero Robin Hood, steal from the rich and give to the poor. Stop Prince Richard and save Maid Marian. They play it to perfection and this is a must own for any DVD collection or Robin Hood fan. You haven't seen Robin Hood if you haven't seen The Adventures of Robin Hood.
