 I rented Biker Boyz with a lot of expectations. I'd just seen Antwon Fisher and saw a wonderful performance by Derek Luke. I was also looking forward to seeing Laurence Fishburne, one of the most underrated black actors in Hollywood. What I found was an unbelievabele mess of nothing. The movie to me wasn't believable at all. The race scenes where shot crazy and ridiculously fast. The stunts the guys pull on the bikes are impossible. There is no way they wouldn't lay those bikes out. At least make it a little believable. I couldn't believe Fishburne and Luke did a movie like this. They are both way to good for a movie of this caliber, Especially Fishburne. I can see Luke doing it because he's young, but it doesn't justify the mess the movie was. Kid Rock was actually one of the better performers in the movie. I just think it's a waste of money. I didn't really find it to be a Fast and Furious knock off. That movie far surpasses this one. I wouldn't waster my money or time on it. But if a ridiculous and totally unbelievable plot is your kind of film you should like this movie.
