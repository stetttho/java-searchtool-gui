 The rumble pack was one of the greatest inventions to come out in the video game era. Now with the more updated systems the rumble function is built into the controller. That is not so with the N64. The Rumble Pack was introduced along side Starfox 64. When you get shot, hit someone, get hit, explosions, and many other actions will cause your controller to shake. It makes game playing a lot more fun. It's great in a football game where your sizing a guy up for a hit, you do it and then you feel the rumble. The controller will shake more if it's a harder impact. Lots of fun. There are some cons. You have to use batteries and you have to take it out to put your memory pack in. To me the cons don't come close to the pros and fun of the controller. If you have an N64 you must own a Rumble Pack. You won't regret it.
