 It's about time we no longer have the 59 memory card. The 251 is the only place to go for memory. You can buy other brands now that offer a 251, but lets face it they are not Nintendo. You have to have a memory card to save your games and this is the best one out. I own a bunch of memory cards and they are all this one. I would't buy another one to save my games on. Well that is until they make a bigger one.
