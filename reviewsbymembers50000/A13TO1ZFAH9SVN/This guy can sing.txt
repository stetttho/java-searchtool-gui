 I do not watch American Idol. I feel way to much of it is staged and fake. I also find the judges to be very annoying. I am an avid radio listener and the other day I was listening when a song came on that I did not know. The song was "Invisible" by Clay Aiken. I couldn't believe the pipes on this young man. He has great range and a powerful clear voice. I then drove and bought the cd and all I can say is wow. If you love Clay Aiken you'll love the cd. He has some great other tracks beiseds the hit single "Invisible." "The Way" is another song I like a lot. "This is the Night" is another fantastic song. Most of his songs are love songs and that could come off as a turn off to some, but I don't see how.  We live in a world where music is dominated by sex and explicit lyrics. Clay Aiken is anything but that. He reminds me a lot of Barry Manilow except I honestly think he's better. His songs might not be as great as some of Barry's but he blows him away as far as potenial and abilities. I love Clay Aiken and I love this CD. It's definetly a must own for anyone. Sure like I said earlier most of the songs are love ballads, but they are all good songs. It's music you can play around anyone and anyone can like it. My parents and grandparents both enjoy it. This is a must own. It's the number 1 album in america two weeks and running and it's easy to see why. Don't miss out on this young star.
