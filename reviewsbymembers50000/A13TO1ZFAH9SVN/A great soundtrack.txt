 Blues Brothers was an excellent movie and one of the things that made it so awesome was the spectacular music. Fans that loved the music must pick this up. What other soundtracks have artists like Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Cab Calloway, and James Brown on it. That alone should be a selling point to fans of oldies and blues music. You also get to hear Jon Belushi and Dan Akroyd singing as Jake and Elwood. Almost all the songs from the movie are on the soundtrack. It's got the theme from "Rawhide" which was the only song they put on it that the band sang in the bar. I wish they would have put "Stand By Your Man" on it, but that's the only knock I have against this classic soundtrack. Pick this one up, you'll like it.
