 Oasis is simply one of the best bands in the world and this single is another statement to that. Some Might Say is a fantastic song. I wish it would have gotten more radio play in the U.S., but nevertheless it's still an awesome song. The guitar rifts and Liam's amazing vocals are awesome. It's a great written song by Noel Gallagher who shows again he's in the top of the world in song writing. Talk Tonight is such an awesome song. It's sung by Noel who also wrote it, and it's one of the songs that gets played at every Oasis concert in Noel's acoustic set. It's a great acoustic song with an awesome melody. Noel sings it with such passion and he's admitted it's one of his favorite songs. You can also get a hold of this song on the album version of The Masterplan. Acquiesce is another awesome song. It's one of their harder rocking song and the chorus is a great duet with Noel and Liam singing it. It's another song where you can tell the guys are feeling the song as they sing it. Oasis is passionate about there songs and Acquiesce is a great example of it. You can also find this single on The Masterplan. Headshrinker is an ok Oasis song. I'll listen to it but I'm not real big on it. There is nothing that stands out to me about the song. Normally Oasis songs have catchy guitar rifts and awesom choruses. Headshrinker doesn't really have any of it. You can also find it on The Masterplan. You've Got to Hide Your Love Away is an awesome cover. Oasis has strong roots to the Beatles and the band isn't shy about telling us about it. Liam worships John Lennon and the ground he walks on. This is an awesome song with a great chorus and this single is the only place to get it. This is one of the best Oasis singles ever released. Unless You've Got To Hide Your Love Away is a must you can pick all these songs up on The Masterplan. This single is a must for all Oasis collectors.
