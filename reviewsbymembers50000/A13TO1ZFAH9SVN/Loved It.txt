 Colin Hanks has the charm that made his dad a star and I can't wait to see him acheive it. Colin plays a teen who has a dream of becoming a writer and going to Stanford. He is a shoe in for Stanford, but when the wrong transcripts are sent he goes on a wild goose chase to try to get in. Like I said earlier Hanks is great. He plays his character to perfection. You have to laugh at his family. Thats a messed up situation that left me laughing so hard. Jack Black is great. The lead man of Tenacious D is a funny actor. He plays raunchy characters most of the time, but who cares. He's great at it. He plays the older stoner brother to perfection and will leave anybody laughing. I liked Harold Ramis in the movie. Harold is a great director and actor. He plays the Dean of Admissions well. Seeing act stoned was funny. He's no Igon like he is in ghostbusters in Orange County, but he'll leave you laughing. I loved Orange County. It's not a movie for younger audiences, but teenagers and older will love it. This is a great blend of comedey and with a cast full of veterans and newcomers, Orange County will leave you laughing.
