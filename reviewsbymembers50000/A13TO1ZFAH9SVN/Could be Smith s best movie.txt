 Aww Will Smith at his best. That's what he is in Men in Black with his character J. This movie was a huge bright spot in the summer of 97 and is one of the best sci fi comedies ever made.  James Edwards(Smith) works for the NYPD. He's a good cop despite what his peers say. After a chase with a criminal he meets a stranger Kay(Jones) who tells him to meet him. Edwards goes to the meeting at the strange building to find that it is a recruitment meeting.  Kay gives James a proposition. Join the Men in Black and help them control the aliens on earth. James is skeptical about it, but in the end he joins. In the meantime an illegal alien has come to America. It's an oversized coachroach who is killing some princes looking for the galaxy. Now it's up to the Men in Black to kill the roach before the Princes family destroys planet earth.  You have to love the two stars in this movie. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are amazing. The two are a great duo on screen. Their timing with each other is awesome and you can tell the two enjoyed working with each other. Smith plays the normal character we've come to see him play, but he plays that role so well and we love it. Jones is great as well and he plays Kay like only he could.  The special effects are great in this movie. The team at ILM did a great job with all the space and bug stuff. Lots of credit has to go to Barry Sonnefeld for doing a great job.  There isn't anything to not like about this movie. It's funny and the action is good. If you like Will Smith then you have to see this. If you want a good sci-fi comedy then strap in. Here come the Men in Black.
