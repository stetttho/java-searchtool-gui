 13 Going on 30 was a fantastic movie. One of the big reasons it was so good is because of the music in the movie. The soundtrack is decent, but a few key songs from the movie are missing. Where is Thriller at. Thriller is one of the most important songs in the movie and should have been a must on this soundtrack. Thriller is a great song and one of the best music videos ever made, but it should have made the cut for the soundtrack. It plays such an important role in the movie. The rest of the soundtrack is 80's galore. I loved Pat Benatar's Love is a Battlefield. I hadn't heard this song in over a decade and what a joy it was to hear it again. It's a funny scene in the movie and which this song is played and I'm glad it's on the soundtrack. Some of the other big 80's songs on here are I wanna Dance With Somebody by Whitney Houston, Tainted Love by Soft Cell, Jesse's Girl by Rick Springfield, Head Over Heels, by the Go-Go's and Crazy For You by Madonna. There are some other 80's songs but those are the big hits. Throw in Vanilla Ice's Ice Ice Baby and you basicly have the soundtrack. It is a very good soundtrack and I am glad to say I own it. This brought back a lot of memories and is fun to listen to. If you loved the movie you might want to consider picking it up. It's missing two songs from the movie which stopped it from being a five star review. Despite that go pick this soundtrack up.
