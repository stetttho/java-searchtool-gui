 Broken is an awesome song. It's a collaboration between Seether and Amy Lee from Evanasance. It's a well written, played, and sung song. This also happens to be the only other way of getting it if you don't buy the Punisher soundtrack.  Amy Lee has the best vocals in Rock right now. I love hearing this woman sing. It's a shame that Moody left there band and that they are on hold right now. Despite that she made herself another hit with this song. I love it when her and the lead guy from Seether are singing the chorus together. Duets aren't something we see enough of anymore in Rock.  The song is just awesome. It's hard and soft in all the right places. It's gotten a ton of Radio play and Video play. Rightfully so because this song should of.  If you like Seether or Evanasance you won't regret picking this one up. It's a great song.
