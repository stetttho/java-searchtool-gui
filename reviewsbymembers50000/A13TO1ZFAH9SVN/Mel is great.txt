 I liked M. Night Shamalyan "Signs." This is a very young and bright director. He's know Steven Spielberg, but he's making better movies than most directors out there. Signs tells the story of a former revrend played by Mel Gibson who has crop circles start appearing at his home. He thinks it's mischief and tells his family not to worry about it. It ends up becoming worse and an alien invansion in obviously going to happen. Signs has great acting. Mel Gibson plays his character to perfection. All of the characters in the movie are played well. You feel diffrently for each person in the movie and they do a great developing themselves. M. Night Shamalyan even has a cameo in the movie and he is believable. What "Signs" does so well is suspense. You are on the edge of your seat the entire movie. Diffrent things will make you jump in the movie that you never would have expected. Signs is a great movie. It's one the family can watch together. I'd reccommend to everyone, and especially suspense or Mel Gibson fans.
