 Super Smash Brothers is back. The hit from the N64 was one of the first games released on the Gamecube with Melee and like very few games, it's better than the first. Smash Brothers is such a fun game with a great idea. You get to pit your favorite Nintendo characters against each other. You start off with 14 in this game and can unlock another 11. Single player mode isn't all that exciting and gets old pretty fast. You can change the difficulty setting for harder gameplay. Adventure mode gets old as well, buts fun the first couple of times you play it. Where the game really gets fun is in the multiplayer stuff. I could fight my friends all day. This is one of the best multiplayer games ever made. The different scenarios you guys can battle in are fun, and you can customize. Multiplayer is the reason to get this game, and now that is a collectors choice you can pick it up for $20. You can't have a complete Gamecube collection without this game. It's one of the best all-time sellers on the system and it's easy to see why. Don't miss out on this one.
