 Sunday Morning Call once again shows that Oasis can make great singles. More of the songs have a spiritual theme to them and all the songs on this single are song by Noel. Sunday Morning Call is a decent song. It is a little long and seems to drag at times. I agree with the guy who said they overproduced it with the sounds. This is a song that would have been better off song by Liam. It's still a decent song though. Carry Us All to me is the reason to pick this jewel up. It's such an amazing song. I love the ending line in the chorus "have faith in what you got and it will Carry Us All, Carry Us All." Thats a beautiful line in a beautiful song. Noel sings about some of the hyprocrites you find in religion and he plainly states his beliefs. This song is vintage Oasis with a catchy chorus and great guitar rifts. Full On is another song where Noel tells you how it's going to be. I have respect for someone who tells you whats on his mind. The distortion in this song bothers me sometimes. It reminds me to much of the Swamp Song. It's cool to hear Noels song through the distortion. I love the beat to this song though and the chorus is cathcy. This song is pretty rare and this is the only place to get it.  Sunday Morning Call is a great Oasis single. It's the only place to pick these three songs up and is a must for any Oasis collector and collection.
