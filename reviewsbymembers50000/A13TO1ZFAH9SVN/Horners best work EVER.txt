 James Horner has established himself as the second best composer in Hollywood behind the living legend John Williams. Horner is most known for the excellent score he wrote for Titanic, but the music he wrote for Willow is his best work ever. The music on this soundtrack is wonderful. The horn arrangements are terrific. The brass work is incredible. Words can't give this song the justice is deserves. Willows Theme is amazing. The trumpets are fantastic in the song. It's very upbeat and fast. The melody is so awesome. It's a powerful song and is one of the best themes ever written. This song has stuck with me so many years. I commonly find myself whistling this song. You have to hear this song. Elora Dann is a beautiful song. It's slow and very moving. The melody is a great one and this another song you will find yourself humming or whistling after you hear it in the movie or on this cd. This is a fantasic soundtrack. It is James Horners best work that he's ever done. This is a must for movie score fans. You won't regret buying this one if you loved the movie or love music scores. It ranks up with the best ever done.
