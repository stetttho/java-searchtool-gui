 I love this Movie. It's one of my all-time favorite movies and so is the soundtrack. The score is written by Hollywood super star composer James Horner. His Oscar work includes Titanic along with a lot of other great films. He's one of the best in the business and is second only to John Williams. There are a lot of good songs on this soundtrack. It's heavy on the brass and trumpets. There's a great mix of slow and upbeat songs. I love the Ride. It's such a great song. The Trumpets are awesome. I had the oppurtunity to play this song back in school. It's got a great beat to it and has lots of runs in it. Zorro's theme is the best song on the album. It's one of the best scores ever written for a movie. The melody is catchy and is a pretty melody. Once again it sounds so good on the trumpet. The Marc Antony song "Spend My Life Time Loving You" is also pretty good. Him and the girl both display good vocals. I really think the song would have been better just instrumental though. Parts of the insrumental are played throughout the movie, and it's a pretty song. I think the lyrics hurt it. "Diego's Goodbye" is another reason to pick this one up. It's a well done emotional song. It was great in the movie. I love this soundtrack. It is easily one of the best ones done in the last 10 years. The trumpets are great. I can't say enough about them. If your an instrumental fan, you won't be disappointed by picking this one up.
