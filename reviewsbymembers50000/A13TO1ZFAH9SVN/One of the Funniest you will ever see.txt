 I loved Jackass but there is no way I am giving it five stars. This is one of the funniest movies you will ever see. It's tacky, raunchy, disgusting, crude, and a lot more. The critics will tell you all that, but they don't tell you how you will laugh your butt off. The stuff these guys do is insance. They paper cut the webbing of there hands and feet, eat yellow snow cones, shot bottle rockets out there rectums, get shot with riot control gear, beat up by a female kickboxer, and so much more. It's definetly not for the week stomached or people young in age. I  gaurentee you will like it and you will talk about it. It makes fun of our saftey based society and is one of the ultimate worse signs for attention an inflecting self pain on yourself. I love it though. Don't miss out on it.
