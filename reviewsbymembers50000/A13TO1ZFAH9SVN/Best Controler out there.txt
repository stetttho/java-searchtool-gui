 I'm a huge video game fan. I can sit all day and play them and be in my own little world. I've enjoyed my Gamecube world and one of the reasons I have is because of one of the best controllers ever made. The design for the gamecube controler is comparable to the N64. All the buttons from it are back are a more compact controller. Instead of a C buttons you have the C-stick. The directional pad is the smallest it's ever been and Nintendo has kep it's sacred A and B buttons. The built in rumble is great and the option to ditch it has been on every game I've seen and played. The only knock I have against this controller is the Z button. The button is to close to the R button. I have big hands and it's hard to press it quickly sometimes. It really doesn't matter all the time and isn't that much of a problem but thats the slighest flaw this controller has. Nintendo has made this controller small and sweet. It's comfortable to hold and it doesn't have buttons you won't ever use like other controllers systems.
