 I buy all kind of music. From Metal to Rock form Country to Rap. I'll listen to all of it and I like Kimberley Locke. Her cover of Somewher over the Rainbow is decent. It's not as good as Garlands or my all-time favorite the Me First Cover of it. Kim sings it well. The reason to get this single is for 8th World Woner. It's got a catchy beat and a catchy chorus. I can see it as a theme to some chick flick movie in the future. If you like pop you might want to consider picking this up, or you could always go buy her album.
