 K-19 The Widowmaker was kind of a disappointing movie to me. I set high expectations for it knowing I was going in to see a movie with Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson two of the better actors of this modern generation. It's not that they disappoint, it's just a depressing story that really doesn't have a happy ending. K-19 The Widowmaker tells the story of a nuclear Soviet Submarine K-19. The sub is suppose to be the next great thing for the Union and they send one of there top naval officers(Ford) to lead the charge. He's in to replace the former captian(Neeson)who had been leading the seem what cursed ship from drydock. On there first mission out there is a problem with the reactor. It's overheating and they can't stop it. The race is then on to see if they can be saved before it's to late. The movie really shows the grusome reality that was the Soviet Union. They didn't care about any of the men on that boat. They just didn't want the incident leaked out. Harrison Ford's chatacter is the hard nose who wants to do the right thing but is afraid of what could happen to him. Liam Neeson just wants the right thing done and that is to let the Americans help them. He cares about the men and not to much about himself. I'm sorry I don't remember names, I do not own the movie. It is a decent movie and it should be seen by all, I just would never buy it. It's got some great acting, it just isn't a positive story. Like I said earlier, I'd watch again just would never buy it.
