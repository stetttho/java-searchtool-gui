 I love James Bond. I own 13 of the twenty movies. If you make a spy film you have to look at Bond as the mark to match. I just feel like XXX tried to match it to much. XXX follows the Bond storyline to closely for my taste. You have a wanna be Q and M. You have a wanna be James Bond and villian. They do however provide a James Bond like Bond girl. Asia Argento is hot. If you like James Bond and want to see him more high paced adrenaline movie then you will like XXX. I didn't hate the movie, and I do own it. I just like Bond better.
