 I have to admit I love Top Gun. I'm a young man that is considering the military and I was a military kid growing up. This isn't the best or most realistic military movie ever made, but it' one of the funniest. Maverick(Tom Cruise) and his navigator Goose(Anthony Edwards) get the Navy pilots dream, a chance to go to Top Gun. It's at Top Gun that Maverick falls for one of his instructors Charly.(Kelly McGillis)Also at Top Gun Maverick is battling for the honor of top pilot against IceMan(Val Kilmer) Will Maverick stop being so cocky and fly like to his potential. Will he keep the girl? You'll just have to watch the movie. Tom Cruise is fantastic. He does an awesome job playing Maverick. I've had the chance to spend a lot of time around pilots, and so many are like his character. This movie reminds me a lot of being with my dad on the base. Pilots are full of so much b.s. and are such hot shots. Cruise displays it on screen perfectly. Anthony Edwards is great also. Goose is one of my all-time favorite movie characters. He's so loveable and goofy. A lot of pilots and navigators are like him too. I hate what happens to him in the movie, and I must admit it is hard to fight the tears. Kelly McGillis is hot. She is beautiful in the movie. Her carear would have been so much better if she had kept herself looking the way she did in this movie. I like'd her charcter Charly. She does a good job. I liked Val Kilmer. He plays the nemisis pilot great. He plays the macho b.s. pilot hotshot well. His charcter is a little more believable than Cruise's, but not nearly as fun. It's one of Val's better movies. Top Gun is a fantastic movie. I've never met anyone that didn't like it. It's got an all-star cast, great comedey, great one liners, a fantastic soundtrack, action, romance, and much more. A great family film. A great guy film. Some people have even called it a chick flick before. You'll have fun with Top Gun.
