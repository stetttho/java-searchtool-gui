 I have to admit I was very intrigued by the idea of this movie. Cuba Gooding Jr. and Haratio Sanz going on a gay cruise. They had me sold from that point and I got robbed. Boat Trip has a very simple plot. Cuba Gooding Jr. gets turned down by the woman he proposed to Viva A. Fox. She tells him she is going out with her car detailer and she's cheating on him. He lives in self pity for six months until his buddy Haratio gets him to go on a cruise. They tick off the cruise agent man and he gets back at them by signing them up for a gay cruise. While on the Cruise Cuba falls in love with a woman who is the dancer instructor played by Roselyn Sanchez. Horatio is falling for a Swedeish bikini tan model who gets on the cruise because he shoots there helicopter down with a flare gun. Will they both keep the woman they love or turn gay. It's all up to you to watch it. Cuba Gooding Jr. displayed a lot of energy in the movie. It's sad to see a guy who was so great in movies like Boyz in the Hood, Men of Honor, Jerry Maguire, and Radio do a movie like this. You have to wonder what he's doing with his carear. He's one of the best minority actors in the world. A tacky raunchy comedy doesn't show that talent and this is something only his diehard fans could love. They aren't really offensive to gay people in the movie. I thought Haratio would have a field day with it, but he doesn't. He does some bashing, but the movie has a feel good about homosexuality theme to it I didn't like. This is a bad movie. It's suppose to be one of those raunchy comedies and it really isn't. If you want to go see a good tacky raunchy comedy, go pick up Animal House, American Pie, or Porky's. Don't waste you money on trash like this.
