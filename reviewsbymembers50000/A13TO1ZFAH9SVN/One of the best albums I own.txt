 I love Me First and The Gimme Gimmes. The whole idea behind a cover band is great and this is the best album the guys have put out to date. The Gimme Gimmes usually go with a theme on each album and this one is show tunes. The classic show tunes your mom and grandmother will know. I love "Somewhere Over the Rainbow." Everybody has Judy Garland burned into thier mind with this song and there cover changes that real quick. It's loud and powerful and has the same catchy chorus that's made it a legendary song. I liked "Tommorrow" a lot. Once again you hear this song and think Annie. It's a fantastic song and the guitar rifts are fast and heavy in this one. "The Phantom of the Opera" is my favorite on the album. Spike really does display his vocals on this track. He won't leave you disappointed. The rest of the covers are all great. I think those are the best three. This is the best album no one has ever heard of. To often do these guys get confused with New Found Glory. Glory isn't worthy of Me Firsts' drum sticks and guitar picks. This is the only way I'd ever sing show tunes. I think my mom almost flipped out when I walked down the hall singing opera. I've owned this album for almost four years and it's one of the best I own. If you like punk rock you won't regret this one.
