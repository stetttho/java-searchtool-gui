 I love The Beatles 1. It's a great album. I'm 19 years old and have had the opportunity a lot in my life to hear The Beatles. I was excited the day I bought this a couple of years ago and am proud to own it. The Beatles 1 is exactly what it says. It's all the songs that number one for them over the years. The songs are taken off the English and United Kingdom charts. A lot of the latter songs are songs that went number one in the U.K. Hardcore Fab Four fans will recognize every song though. I like the early tracks better than a lof of the latter tracks. The early ones are there bigger hits that more people will recognize from the early 60's. A lot of fans will argue that the bands best work isn't on the cd and I agree with them to a point. If you want there greatest works get the greatest hit albums. The Beatles 1 is just straight number one hits. This album has sold over 22 million copies worldwide. That statement alone enough shows the kind of album this is. EMI is making a ton of money off it. All Beatles fans should be happy to have this in thier collection. I'm sure glad it's in mine.
