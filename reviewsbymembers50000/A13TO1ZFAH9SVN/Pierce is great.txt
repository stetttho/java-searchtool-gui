 Die Another Day is a great Bond movie. It's Brosnan's best behind Goldeneye. The story is almost a remake of Diamond are Forever but is much better. Halle Berry is in it and is great. She is so hot and played her character Jinx so well she is going to get a spin off.  My favorite part of the movie was Bonds' car. His Aston Martin Vanquish is spectacular. The car fight between it and the Jaguar was so cool and really the first of it's kind. For all Bond fans this is a must own. For causal Bond fans you still should get it. It's easily one of the top 10 bond movies made. I liked it and I think you will too.
