 The James Bond video game franchise is quickly becoming one of the best franchises in the business. Nightfire is a quality game that won't let fans down. In Nightfire you are 007 and you must stop the evil Drake and his Nightfire plan. There are 12 action packed levels combining combat, stealth, and gadgets. You meet up with beautiful villians and heros along your way to stop Drake. One player mode is pretty good in this game. The levels are pretty challenging. Some are harder than others, but it makes for good single player gameplay. The driving levels are really cool. Bonds Aston Martin Vanquish is an awesome car and they are some of the coolest levels. The single player levls are better than the ones EA made for "The World is Not Enough" and "Agent Under Fire," but they still aren't as good as "Goldeneyes" were. Multiplayer is where this game really exceeds. It's not as good as "Goldeneye" but it's really why I love the game. There are different kinds of Multiplayer levels to choose from. Theres arena and team arena. King of the Hill and Team King of the Hill are also playable. There is Capture the Flags for the guys who love it.  There are 6 AI Bots you can add to the game for a total of up to 10 players in the matches. This is a great game. I don't know if it's as good as the new one because I haven't played it yet. It is however a great first person shooter game and is the second best game to Goldeneye in the Bond franchise.
