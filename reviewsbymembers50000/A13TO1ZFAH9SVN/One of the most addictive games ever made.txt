 I'm a pretty big video game fan. I usually get the hit games kind of late because I won't pay full price for them, but Starcraft is worth every penny I've spent. This game is the most addictive game I've ever played. There are so many things that make this game great and there are really no serious knocks that can be thrown at it. The story line to Starcraft is pretty simple. You can pick from three different races Terran, Zerg, and Protoss. In the stroyline they all have different goals they want to achieve. The terrans are the humans in the game. They have there pros and cons. They have medium range units that are pretty cheap to build and are all around pretty effective. The Zerg are the buglike species. They have cheap and quick units. The protoss are the alien species of the group. They have expensive but very powerful units. Single player mode is pretty fun. The missions aren't really all that bad. The story is decent and I enjoyed playing it all the way through. The gem to this game is the multiplayer options. If you get this game you definetly want to get on the internet and play on Battlenet. Thats what makes the game so addictive. It's a great game, but it gets even better when you can sign on and play against millions of other players. You can also get a hold of crazy maps on battlenet which add new and fun life to the game. We have a 20 port hub at home and this is are favorite multiplayer game to play. Like the guy in the review before me said, you really need to watch the clock when you get on battlenet because you will lose track of time. I will get so into this game, I'll stop for food and the bathroom. The rest of the time you are so engrossed in this awesome game. This is one of the best games I've ever played. I have no real flaws with the game that are even worth bringing up. If you want a fun game to play then pick this one up and enjoy.
