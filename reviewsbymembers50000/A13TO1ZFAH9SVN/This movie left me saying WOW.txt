 Wild Things is one of the most draw dropping movies I've ever seen. It had so many twists and turns I had to see it again to believe what I had seen earlier and had just seen again. Matt Dillon plays a high school counsler at a high school in South Florida. He is well respected and loved by the students. He is really loved by his student played by Denise Richards. She likes to him to a very dangerous point. She later accuses of him of rape to the local cop played by Kevin Bacon along with another student played by Neve Campbell. Matt's character is hated by the community and he hires a lawyer played by Bill Murray to defend him. However, the movie turns into a story of sex, murder, and betrayl that like I said earlier will leave you saying "WOW" and have you watching it again. Denise Richards is absolutely crazy in this movie. I couldn't believe this was the sweet innocent girl I had seen in Starship Troopers. Denise, Matt, and Neve shoot a soft porn in the movie when they do a three some. I couldn't believe it. I think this is the best acting Denise has done in her young carear. She is a beautiful woman and I love her to death. Most guys become a fan of her from watching this. Kevin Bacon has a nice role in the film. It's one of the better performances of his carear. I hate his character in the movie. He plays a huge role in the film though, and Bacon liked this movie so much he helped produce it. This is a different kind of role for Matt Dillon in the beginning of the movie. However, by the end he won't disappoint his loyal fans as he returns to the kind of character he typically plays. I liked Wild Things. It's an insane sexual thriller. If nudity is not your thing I would not get this movie. Nevertheless if you want to see a movie with a ton and twists and turns this is it. Men will really like Denise in the movie. But like I said this movie will leave you saying "WOW" and will have you watching at again.
