 I loved Willow. It was one of my all time favorite 80's movies. It was one of the first we got with our VCR and I'm so glad it's on DVD. Willow is a magical movie made by two of the all time greats in George Lucas and Ron Howard. Willow tells the story of the the midget Willow who must help save the world. He has a princess baby that is being hunted and must die according to the evil queen. Willow gets help along the way from Mad Mardigan(Val Kilmer) as they must keep the baby alive and stop the evil queen. That's the basis of the story in short and sweet detail. It was written by George Lucas, and is basicly Lord of the Rings meets Star Wars. It's fun for the whole family. Lucas is yet to do a movie the whole family can enjoy. Warwick Davis is amazing in the movie. He plays the lead character Willow. He is a great actor. He has depth and isn't one sided. It's hard to believe after seeing him in this that he later became the Leprachaun in that series of horror movies. Val Kilmer has one of his all time best performances as Mad Mardigan. He's basicly a fantasy Han Solo. He is the greatest sword fighter to ever live and probaly the greatest womanizer. Val portrays all the great qualties a hero needs. He's charming, helps the weak, funny, sarcastic and he just delivers. It's a must see for Val Kilmer fans. The action is great in Willow. It's not the blown up special effects you see in Lord of the Rings, but it is great for it's time. The castle sieges are done well and it's great seeing all those guys in armor and on horses. The choeragraphy on the sword play is fantastic and is underrated in Hollywood history. Willow is a must see for all fantasy movie fans. It's a charming well made movie that is fun for the whole family.
