 X-2 is a rarity for hollywood. It's a movie that is actually better than the first. I must admit I was disappointed with X-men. It didn't follow the comic books to well and I thought the storyline around Wolverine was to great. I felt that X-2 didn't make that mistake and did a better job of developing characters. X-2 tells the story of a mad man trying to control mutants to do his own will. Jean is starting to become Phoneix and you the Brotherhood of Mutants start to come back together. You learn more of Wolverine's past. It's a well written story. The special effects in X2 are remarkable. They do an awesome job with Nightcrawler. His teleporting is remarkable. Iceman and Pyro go nuts with there respective powers and some impressive effects are shown there. The fight between Lady Deathstrike and Wolverine is cool. It's one of the best fights i've ever seen. The way they slash, hack, and stab is cool. The special effects are one of the many reasons to see the movie. Overall I'd have to say X2 is best comic book moive made in a while. It follows comic book storyline well and is a must own for an X-men fan.
