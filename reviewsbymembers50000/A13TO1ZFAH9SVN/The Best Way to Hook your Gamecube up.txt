 Why suffer with RCA video cables anymore? There is a better way to hook your game system up and it's with S-Video. I don't know all the techno babble and why S-Video is better. All I can tell you though is it is. The picture looks a lot better throught S-video than it does through a coax link or RCA cables. There are a couple of different brands of the cables you can get out there, but I'm impressed with these. The long 10 feet cables are great and sturdy. It has gold connectors which are suppose to help give a better picture. This is the best way to view your video game system. It's clear and crisper and provides a slightly better gaming experience. This brand of cables is kind of pricey, but is suppose to be one of the best. Just hook up on S-Video and enjoy.
