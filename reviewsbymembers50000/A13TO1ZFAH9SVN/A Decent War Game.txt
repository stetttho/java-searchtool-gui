 Having never seen Medal of Honor played on anything other than a PC I was skeptical about picking this game up. I did however and now I'm glad that I did. In Medal of Honor Frontline you are Private Jimmy Patterson. It is your job to go through 20 missions on 6 levels to help stop the Nazi war machine. The game is made by Electronic Arts and looks to be built on the same engine as there other first person shooter games. The company is known for making the James Bond games and this really is James Bond meets Saving Private Ryan. The gameplay is pretty clear and crisp. The controls are different from any other first person shooter I've played on this system and that took some getting use to. I've got it down pat now and I like the challenge that it offers to you.  Unlike the Bond games the auto-aim function isn't here on Medal of Honor. You have to do all of the aiming yourself on those Nazi soldiers. It makes the game a little frusterating at first with the different control set up, but once you get use to it I think you'll like it. I was a little saddened with the Multi Player features on the game. All you can do is hook up and play against three other human opponents. There are no options to add any AI Bots which I found to be a little disappointing. I love to hook up with by brothers and fight them and 5-6 AI Bots. That would have been great to do with WWII weapons and maps but they didn't put that option on this game. I love this game. It's a decent game. I like it better on this system than the PS2 or Xbox. If you really want to experience Medal of Honor though, I'd pick it up for PC.
