 Al Franken's book is just slightly hypocritical. Polotics as a whole is hypocritical. He calls out a lot of conservatives and bashes them and calls them out on issues, but you don't see him doing it to liberals. All poloticans are liars and it's kind of funny to watch one guy call others liars and not bash others.
