 This a pretty good burner. I have no real problems with it. It was easy to install and I liked the compact size. It does as it states and I've never had any problems burning a CD. The instructions are good you get the garuntees that Sony normally gives. The one problem I had with the burner is the software they sent with the burner. The software is B's Recorder gold and it's not even the full version of the software. It gives you the basic stuff you need to burn a music cd and to copy one and it's about it. There is nothing special about it.  This is a decent burner. It's been very easy to work with and the system requirements were easy to fill. I love burning cds on it and I love Sony burners. This is the second one I've owned. Just get some better software and I really think you can enjoy this piece of equipment.
