 Jerry Goldsmith is one of the best in the business. He's an Oscar caliber composer. He doesn't disappoint with Star Trek First Contact. Like most Star Trek films the music is the same. You have the theme from The Next Generation. You then have the theme to the movie. The theme to the movie is then used throughout the whole film except it's played a little diffrently in the situations throughout the film.  The theme for First Contact is fantastic. It is absolutely one of the best songs I've ever heard. I think it's as good as the Godfather, Star Wars, Indiana Jones and Superman. As a Trumpet player I dream of playing a meolody like tho one on the theme of this movie. It's so crisp, clean, and pure. Everytime I hear it I just want to whistle and hum along with it. It's such an amazing song. Jerry Goldsmith has outdone himself here and I think it's the greatest song he's ever done. I liked Steppin Wulf on the CD. There most famous song Magic Carpet Ride is included. It was funny when they used it in the movie and it's a great song. It's one of the catchiest songs ever written and it's got some great guitar work. Obey Dobey by Roy Orbison is also on here. Roy has a fantastic voice that he could four octaves with. It's not one of his more well known songs, but I enjoy it a lot. Again it was well used in the movie and it's a nice additon to the soundtrack. This soundtrack is a must for Star Trek fans, Jerry Goldsmith admirers, and fans of classical music. It's a well made album and would be a nice addition to anybodies home.
