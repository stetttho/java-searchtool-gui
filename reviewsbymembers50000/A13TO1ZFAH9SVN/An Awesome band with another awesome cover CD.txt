 Everybody loves to hear a cover song. It's just human instinct to want to see if somebody can out do an original. Me First and the Gimmie Gimmes is all about covers and there the best in the world at it. Take a Break is there fourth hit album. In this album the Gimmie Gimmes give props to there favorite black artists and songs. They do a good job paying homage to them and tracks that will leave you laughing and singing. I loved "Mona Lisa." I bet Nat King Cole is a bumping his head and singing along in the upbeat and good cover. The hawaiian theme to "I Believe I Can Fly" is great. The ukulele is an underrated instrument and leave it to Me First to bust out with it. "Save The Best For Last" is probaly my favorite track. Fat Mike has some awesome vocals on it and they make a good song even better. This is a great album. I put this one in and I listen to every single track. All of them are awesome songs. You won't regret putting out the money to buy this one.
