 You have to give Kelly Clarkson some props. Here is a woman that grew as a performer in the eyes of america on tv. Her debut album doesn't disappoint me. It's a bunch of cheesy lovey dubey pop songs. Nevertheless she performs them all well. I love the fact that Kelly Clarkson is a singer. She isn't all about stupid dancing like Britney and Christina. She lets her voice do the work instead of her body. She doesn't lip synch either. This girl has got some pipes. I liked Miss Independent. It went number one for a reason. It's a good album. A must for Kelly fans and I think most American Idol watchers will like it as well.
