 You can call Weezer whatever you want to. What they are is a great rock n roll band.  This album has a lot of good songs on it. THe best song on the album is Buddy Holly. It's got some great and catchy guitar rifts. Rivers won't blow you away with his vocals on this track, but you will find yourself singing along with him or whistling. It's a great written song and one of the best songs of the 90's. You have to check out the music video for it also. Simply awesome. I love In the Garage. The band really does tell a lot about themselves in this song. These guys don't care if you call them dorks. In the song they talk about how they love D&D and there favorite band is Kiss. They don't care what people think of them. They just want to stay in the garage and play there songs. It's a beautiful song where the guys really embrace who they are. The sweater song is one of the more famous songs off the album. It's kind of a creepy song, but is very catchy. You will find yourself singing along and it's a song that sticks with you. All of the songs on the album are great. This is one of the few albums made anymore where you will put it on and listen to every song. Weezer is the best geek rock band since REM. They are an amazing band with the talent to back it up. No rock collection is complete without this album. It's one of the 10 best made in the 90's and is a must own.
