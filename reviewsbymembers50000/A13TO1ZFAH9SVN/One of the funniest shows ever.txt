 I loved the Tick. I loved the animated show and I loved the comics. When Fox put it on televison I was so happy. Then they crushed me by taking it off. The Tick is one of the stupidest things you will ever watch, but it's also one of the funniest things you will ever see. The Tick uses all aspects of humor. There is sarcasm, slapstick, inuendo, jokes, and the characters play it all well. Patrick Warburton was perfect. If the show had stayed on, I really think he could have won an emmy. He is that good. If you want garunteed laughs, the Tick is the show for you. Enjoy it and be prepared to laugh.
