 I'm a Lord of The Rings fan. I've loved all the movies and books. I was in ... the other day and saw this game. It was on sale so I picked it up.  Lord of The Rings Monopoly is exactly what you get. You get the classic game of Monopoly Lord of the Ring style. It's the dame objective as Monopoly in that you want to control as many monopoly's as you can and you want to put all the other players in the game bankrupt. You can be different characters from the movie to play with. All the main characters are there. The real estate is different places from Middle Earth. The railroads are horses. I thought that one was clever. Lord of the Ring fans will like it. If you like Monopoly and want to play it without the stupid looking guy and his hat pick it up. I'm glad I bought this game.
