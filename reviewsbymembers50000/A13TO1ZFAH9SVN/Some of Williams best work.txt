 I must admit I have not read a Harry Potter book to this date. I have seen both movies and enjoyed both of them a ton. The movies however would not be nearly as good if not for the score written by John Williams. "Hedwigs Theme" is a great song and will be the song you will remember most from the movie. It's a beautiful song. I love how it starts off on the bells. It adds a feeling of unknown awe when it's played. It's also great when it's not played on the bells and is done by the orchestra. It's probaly Williams best song of this new century. Fans of his will be well pleased and I think this one alone makes it worth getting the soundtrack. I liked "Hogwart Theme." The christmas song was also good. It's just a good mix and blend of music. Williams score accents the movie so well. It brings the world of Harry Potter to life so well. This soundtrack is a must own. It's some of Williams best work he's ever done. It's right up there with Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Superman, and Jurrasic Park. His fans will love this album. Fans of Harry Potter will really like it. People that like classical music will also enjoy this one a lot.
