 Don't Look Back in Anger can be called the best Oasis single ever done. You can argue other ones as well, but this is a great single.   "Don't Look Back in Anger" is one of the best songs Oasis has ever done. It's one of the more popular songs they've had an America. It has a catchy chorus and guitar rifts. However, it's a fantastic written song by Noel Gallagher who is  the best living songwriter not name Paul McCartney. The song has some deep meaning and I love how Noel isn't afraid to speak his mind. Step Out is an ok song. It's nothing to get to excited about it. It's definetly one of there b-songs but I still like it. Undearneath the Sky is a great song. Everybody can realte to what is being sung about in the song. This single was good enough to be included on the Oasis album "The Masterplan." It's Noels' favorite song he's ever written and thats a statement saying the guy has wrote so many good songs. Cum on Feel the Noize is a great cover. I like it a lot better than the cover that Quiet Riot did back in the early 1980's. It's the closest to the original. Liam's vocals sound really great on the song. Once again this single is the only place to find this song.
