 It's kind of a shame when a great song hits the radio. It's because the radio and music industry in general shove it down your face and won't let up on it. One Sweet Day is a fantastic example of this.  This song is amazing. The lyrics are great if you actually sit and listen to them. The vocals are fantastic. Mariah Carey can be argued as the greatest pop singer of all time. Her vocals and ranger are amazing and she displays them to perfection on the single.  Boyz II Men have always been great. There vocals are some of the best in the business and all the boy bands of the late 90's wish they could sing like these guys. If you want to hear a good quartet than Boyz II Men is right up your alley.  The remixes of One Sweet Day are all pretty good. I like the acapella one a lot. The song gets kind of redundant listening to all of them in a row. The Fantasy remix is alright as well.  This is a great song. If you loved this song back in 1995 then pick this single up. You won't regret it.
