 John Williams is the man in Hollywood when it comes to composing movie scores. If you want some evidence to back that statement up then purchase this soundtrack. The theme for Superman:The Movie could possibly be the greatest score ever for a film. It's an absolutely amazing song. The brass work in the song is incredible. The melody in the song is amazing. John Williams is known for his heavy brass parts and the trumpets are incredible in this song. When they hit that climax of that short run in the melody I smile everytime. It's such am amazing song and makes this soundtrack worth the price. The rest of the cd isn't bad, but nothing can compare to the theme. A lot of the songs on the soundtrack contain parts from it. This really is an easy listening peace that you will listen to every song. If you love John Williams then buy this. If you love Superman buy this. If you love classical music then buy this. You won't regret it.
