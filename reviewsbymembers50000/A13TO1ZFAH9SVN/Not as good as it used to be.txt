 I was a fan of Rolling Stone for a long time. The magazine has detoriated and has become the things that it always bashes. The magazine has become way to liberal for me. I buy the magazine to read about music. I expect to see articles about music and maybe some article about musicians in polotics. You don't see that though. It's a Bush bashing magazine and it disgusts me. They don't tell you anything that the man has down right, just all of his flaws. It's a total turn off to a conservative. If your liberal and want to read there one sided opinion then subscribe to rolling stone. Rolling Stone only really covers whats hot. I realize they have to do that to sell magazines but they continually bash Bush and capitalizim so I find this to be a little hypocritical. They tend to write about whats hot on MTV which is sickening. They do some specialty issues every couple of weeks which aren't bad, but they are usually to predictable.  Rolling Stone does do weekly reviews of CDs, Movies, and DVDs. Those to have become polotical outlets. They are very hard in there reviews and tend to not like a lot of movies. It's a shame to blast a movie because the lead guy might be a conservative. You can read the reviews off there website so I wouldn't subscribe to the magazine to just read those. I just can't stand to read the magazine anymore. If it weren't for the pictures that are normally pretty good I would have given this 1 star. The magazine has become way to liberal for a conservative to want to read. If your liberal you might like it some, but you will get tired of all its MTV artists. It's no where what it used to be.
