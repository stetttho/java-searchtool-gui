 This DVD is a must own for Lord of the Ring fans. Im not going to go to any of the storyline of Fellowship. The movie part of this DVD has 30 more minutes added to it. It shows some deleted scenes, and scenes that will help you understand some parts of the next movie. The appendices to the movie are cool. They show the making of the movie, go into character breakdown, and basicly tell the epic of making the movie. Like I said earlier, this is a must for all Lord of the Ring fans. Don't miss out on it.
