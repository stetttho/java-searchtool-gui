 In 1957 the Soviet Union launched Sputnik into space and inspired a boy and a nation. Homer Hickman(Gyllenhaal) was a humble kid who dreamed of getting out of his coal mine hometown. His father(Cooper)has different views for his son and wants him to get his head out of the stars. Homer takes the ridicule from his father and then puts out one of the greatest acts of persevarance ever told. Jake Gyllenhaal is great. This is superb acting from this young man. He is one of the fastest rising stars in Hollywood and this is his humble beginnig. He plays Homer well. He plays off the other actors around him well. It's an emotional performance in an emotional tale. Chirs Cooper is quickly becoming one of the best actors alive. His performance as Homer's dad is as good as his performance in American Beauty. Cooper truly becomes the character he plays and thats why he's one of the best actors living. I really think him and Gyllenhaal got snubbed by Oscars for not getting any recognition for there roles. I love October Sky. It's a great movie about hard work and perseverance. Everyone should see this movie. It shows the american dream and what can happen if you have a goal and do everything you can to acheive it. This is a great family film and is one of the best movies ever made.
