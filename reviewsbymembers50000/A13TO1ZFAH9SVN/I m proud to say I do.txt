 I've been shopping on Ebay for almost 5 years and I must say I've enjoyed it.  Ebay is the best online auction set on the net. You can find anything your heart desires on this website. Cars, Homes, Goods, or anything else you can think of. Even a town was sold on it.  If you like to sell things Ebay can be a great outlet. I've made almost a grand just selling loose old things on it.  So be a proud Ebay shopper and tell everybody "I Shop on Ebay."
