 The Indiana Jones movies are three of the greatest of all time. They were made by two of the greatest movie story tellers of all time with George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. They tell the adventures of Indiana Jones, an archealogist and adventurer. The movies are perfect movies. They have storyline, humor, action, and romance. All the movies have perfect casting and acting. All characters are developed well and aren't pointless. The movie also has one of the greatest musical scores to it. You have to tip your hat to John Williams. Harrison Ford is perfect. He should have some academy consideration for his role as Dr. Jones. Between Indiana and Han Solo, Harrison has made himself one of the greatest action heros of all time. He just does everything well in the movie. Words don't give Ford enough credit. You just have to sit back and admire. The movie has some of the greatest chase scenes in movie history. You got to love the car chase in Raiders in which Indiana takes out a whole truck load of Nazi troopers and gets the truck and makes the getaway. In Temple of Doom theres the mine chase. You will never look at mine carts again. You also got to love in Crusade the boat chase, plane fight, and motorcycle chase. Sean Connery is awesome in Crusade.He plays Indiana Jones's dad well. He really shows a comedic side to himself. This movie made me a Connery fan when I saw it in theater at age 4. I promise you will like this movie. We have all three and have worn all three VHS tapes out because of the amount of times they have been viewed. If your going to own one set of movies, make it the Indiana Jones trilogy. You won't regret it.
