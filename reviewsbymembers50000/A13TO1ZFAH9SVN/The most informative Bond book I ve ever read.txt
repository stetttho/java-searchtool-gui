 David Giammarco says he's a Bond fan. Lot's of people say they are something, but David Giammarco is what he says. This guy loves Bond and he lets it all hang out in this book.  For Your Eyes Only:Behind The Scenes of the James Bond Films is exactly what it sayd it is. It's full of behind the scenes information for all 20 movies from Dr.No to Die Another Day. There are interviews with people who worked on the films. David talks to directors, producers, writers, actors, and anybody and everybody who worked on the films.   There is an overview of each film and then the interviews. The interviews are your basic Q&A format. David interviews anybody and everybody that had to do anything with the films.  I love the interviews with the guys who played Bond. They all talk about the love they had for the films and the fun they had making them. They give you their perspectives on the movies and the things done in the movies.  The interviews with the Bond girls are fantastic. Some of the most beautiful woman to ever live have been Bond girls. From Ursulla Andress to Halle Berry you have interviews with most of them. They are all awesome ladies who enjoyed the pictures and love the place they have in pop culture because of it.  If your a Bond fan you have to pick this one. I doubt you'll have a question that this book can't answer. I've been a Bond fan for over 15 years and this is the most informative Bond book I've ever seen. You won't regret buying this one.
