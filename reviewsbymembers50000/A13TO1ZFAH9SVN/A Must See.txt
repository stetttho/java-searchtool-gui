 I'm a huge fan of Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi. My first expierecne with the two was with the show  Hercules: The Legendary Journey's. I've seen since a lot of Sam Raimi's work including his blockbuster hit Spiderman. But this movie is so great because it shows us a young Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell just haveing fun. The Evil Dead tells the story of five college age kids who go to a cabin in Tennesse to do what college kids on breaks do. They end up staying in this weird cabin. They find in the basement of it a tape recorder and a book. The book is the book of the dead. There is a tape recorder and it is played. On the recorder is a chant that releases terrible evil on our 5 college breakers and the rest is history. Bruce Campbell is great. The story, effects, acting, and plot are so cheesy. Not everyone can play that kind of role and Bruce plays cult hero Ash to perfection. He's funny as anything. You don't know what he's going to expect next from the zombies and it had me laughing so hard seeing some of his reactions. He is even better in Army of Darkness. The special effects in Evil Dead are great. They are so cheesy and lame it's fantastic. There is so much blood and gore it's funny. Does a zombie really have that much blood. The contacts the people where when they are zombies are great too. The slapstck with the fighting of the zombies is great too. Evil Dead is a fantastic movie. All the members of the cast helped the crew build sets, do effects and set up shots. It's a great movie made by some great people just wanting to have fun making fun of b-rated horror movies. Watch The Evil Dead and I'm pretty sure you will like it too.
