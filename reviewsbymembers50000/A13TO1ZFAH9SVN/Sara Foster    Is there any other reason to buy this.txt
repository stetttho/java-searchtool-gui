 I liked The Big Bounce. I thought it was a pretty good movie despite what any critics said. The poster for the movie I think is a pretty good poster.   We have all the stars from the movie. Owen Wilson, Morgan Freeman, Sara Foster, Charlie Sheen, Vinnie Jones, and Gary Sinise. You have to laugh though at Sara Foster. The woman is gorgeous and they have her looking great in that yellow bikini in the dead center of the poster. If your a guy you have to love it.  The poster has some nice eye candy. If you liked the movie you wont regret picking it up.
