 I love Smallville and have loved most of the things that have come out representing the awesome franchise. The Clark Kent action figure really isn't one of those things I do love.  Kids can play with it and enjoy it, they'll just have to use there imagination. The toy doesn't really do anything, so that's why the imagination is a must. They can have fun with it however, because he is Superman and only Kryptonite can stop him. If your child likes Smallville they should enjoy it. If they don't, the toy isn't for them. If your a Smallville collector, you'll like the toy.
