 I've one of the lucky american Oasis fans that has had the chance to see the greatest band in the world perform. They are great live and when I found out they had a live album I had to get it. Familiar to Millions is that live album and man what a gem the boys from Manchester have made. Live albums are always something that can hurt band. Like an acoustic album there usually isn't normal stuff and it can sound band. Familiar to Millions doesn't sounds great because you can hear the band clearly and you can hear the crowd clearly. You also get some great conversation and it's nice to actually here the band talk. Some Oasis biggest hits are on the album. There is a kicking rocked up version of "Wonderwall." It's a nice version of the song, but I still perfer the acoustic version of What's the Story and I like the slow acoustic version even better that Noel often does live. "Don't Look Back in Anger" is fantastic. You hear 70,000 plus people singing the chorus out sometimes with Noel and sometimes without. It's full of energy and this track alone is worth the price of the CD. There is a kicking version of "Go Let it Out." It's a fantastic song to hear live. It's a song that really brings out Liam's voice and is one of the best ones he does. It's a lot better than the SOTSOG version. There is a Neil Young cover of "Hey Hey My My" that is great. Noel sings the song with such passion. Neil Young is one of Noel's idols and he pays tribute to him well. Other songs of worthy note are the Helter Skelter. It's a great Beatles cover. Live Forever, Champagne Supernova, Stand By Me, and Supersonic are also great tracks. I love Oasis and I love this CD. It is easily the best live album I have ever purchased and ever listened to. It is definetly a must for any Oasis fan. Don't miss out on it.
