 I must admit I'm not the biggest SNL fan in the world and I don't watch it every week. I do remeber seeing Will Ferrell on there a lot when I did watch and I love the movies he's doing now. This DVD is missing some stuff like the 2000 Election skits but there are pletny of notable skits here. The Blue Oyster Cult skit with Christopher Walken is excellent. I was rolling over in pain he was so funny. All the guys on the set were laughing and they couldn't even look him in the face. Craig the Cheerleader is great. He was great as the cheerleader and it's one of the funnier skits on the best of. Will and Cheri Oteri are great together. The skit they do as the singing teachers is great also. Great parodies. I was disappointed their wasn't a whole lot of Bush stuff. He was great as George and there is only a brief moment he is on there doing him. I was disappointed they didn't do the whole dress down patriotic skit with Sean William Scott. Will is great in that g-string panty thing he is wearing. That was one of the funniest skits I've ever seen and I wish there would have been more of it. There is a Jeopardy skit on there. It's not the funniest one they ever did, but it did have Sean Connery and Burt Reynolds in it, so you know it's going to be good. This isn't as good as I hoped it would have been, but I love it a lot. It's a must for Will's SNL fans and I think his newer fans will like it a lot as well.
