 I've read the J.R.R. Tolkien books. I've seen the two movies. I've enjoyed all of them greatly so far. Peter Jackson had made another hit to add to his resume, in one of the best movies of this new century. The Two Towers continues the journey to destroy the ring that was started in the Fellowship of the Ring. The movie is basicly three stories happening in one. You have Mary and Pippin who were captured by Orcs in Fellowship. They are now traveling across middle earth with the Ents(Giant Walking Trees). You have Aragon, Leoglas, and Gimley who go to Helms Deep to help the people of Rohan fight off the army of Isengard. Then you have Frodo and Sam making there journey to Mordor where they pick up another traveler Gollum. Thats a basic overview of the movie made in three short sentences.  The action scenes are my favorite part of the movie. The fight at Helms Deep is fantastic. Peter Jackson and his special affects team WETA are outstanding. The fight is so realistic looking between the 10000 orcs and 300 men and elves. It's hard to believe half of that was all digitally made. Gollum is another highlight of the movie. His split-personality will leave you in laughter. It's superb acting. The music is great in the movie. Howard Shore has made a beautiful soundtrack for this movie. It's good enough that you'd think it was done by John Williams. I can't really say more except I love this movie. I'm looking forward to Return of the King. Don't miss out on owning this movie. It would be a great addition to your movie collection
