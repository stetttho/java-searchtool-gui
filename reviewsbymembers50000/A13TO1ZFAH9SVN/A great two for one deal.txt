 I love the Conan movies. Conan was the movie that put Arnold on the map as a Hollywood action actor. Conan-The Complete Quest is a great way to get both of these movies real cheap.  This DVD will cost you as much as either one will by itself. You basicly get just the movies. They are in widescreen format and everything is great.  Conan the Barbarian does have some specials. They talk about the making of the movie and there is commentary for the movie. The interviews on the making are great. The director, writers, producers, and Arnold are all there as they talk about it. I loved seeing Oliver Stone talk about it.  To see Conan the Destroyer you just flip the disk over. This contains just the movie and no extras. This one isn't as good as the first movie, but hey who cares it's Arnold and he's Conan.  If you want the Conan movies on DVD this is your best buy. The specials for the first one are good, but they aren't as good as the Special Edition versions of the other DVD's. Like I said this is a great deal because you get to great movies for the price of one. Don't miss out on a deal like that.
