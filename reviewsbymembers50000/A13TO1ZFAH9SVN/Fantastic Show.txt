 Hercules the Legendary Journeys was one of the most popular syndicated shows ever. It was originally part of the action pack with other shows such as Kung Fu, Tekwar, Babylon 5, and Highlander. Hercules was the crown jewel of the action pack and is finally out on DVD. Hercules is executive produced and founded by Sam Raimi(Evil Dead Series and Spiderman). The lead character is played by Kevin Sorbo and he established himself as the best Hercules ever. He was outstanding and could act unlike some of the previous people to play the strongest man alive. Hercules The Legendary Journeys contains the five original made for TV movies and all 13 episodes that were put out in season 1. The movies are about an hour and 45 minutes long and are great. I've enjoyed reliving the experience of watching them, and enjoy them all a lot except for the Maze of the Minotaur which lacks the originality of the first four. The 13 episodes tell the tales of Hercules, as he goes off and helps people that are in need. It's a great show with a great cast. Tawny Kitaen plays Hercules wife in the movies. She it totally hot and it's a shame she's gone of the deep end. Anthony Quinn plays the king of the gods Zues. Michael Hurst plays Hercules best friend Iolas and there is also Lucy Lawless and Xena in a couple of episodes. There are a couple of other actors that are in the show that look familiar and can be seen in a lot of Sam Raimi's stuff. This is a great show. It's awesome being able to just pop a DVD in and watch a great episode from a great tv show. Any fan of mythology has to get this. Any fan of the tv show should get it. You won't regret buying it. Don't miss out on it.
