 Van Wilder is the kind of movie you either love or hate. It's definetly a movie thats geared toward older teenage and 20's men. Its that dirty disgusting gross out humor, so if you don't like that kind of stuff get off this page.  Van Wilder(Reynolds) has been in college for 7 years. He's loved his years at Coolidge and the students love him. Wilder is so popular he has a personal assistant Taj(Penn) an Indian exchange student that Wilders promises to get some action. Thats all Wilder really does. He doesn't go to classes, but parties. It's at one of these parties where his dad finds him at tells him he's cutting his money supply.  With no money Wilder can't pay his tutition. So he starts throwing parties for cash to stay in school. In the meantime Gwen(Reid) has been given the assignment to write a paper on Van. Gwen wants nothing to do with Van and thinks he a loser. She has to do the story and quickly finds herself falling for him. She wants him to graduate and he's not so sure on it. He likes Gwen but he's not sure if he can change for her.  I love Ryan Reynolds. This guy is one of the funniest underrated guys in Hollywood. His comedic timing is awesome and he's so sarcastic. He pulls it off like very few can. This guy is going to be huge one day.  This is also Tara Reid's best movie. She is so hot in it. She has good chemistry with Reynolds, and it's not the typcial character we always see her playing. It's really ironic to see her play this kind of character to who she is as a person.  This movie is labeled as Animal House but it isn't. It's not as good as Old School either. It is however a very funny movie. It's a fun gross out comedey. If you like those kind of movies, then pick this one up. If you don't, like I said earlier why are you here.
