 Remakes a movies tend to get mixed reactions from moviegoers, Oceans 11 is one of the greatest remakes ever. I'm a  fan of the old one with the rat pack, but it's got nothing on this one. Oceans 11 is a fun story. Danny Ocean(Clooney) has just gotten out of jail. He wants to steal $150 million dollars from Terry Benidickt(Garcia). In the process he wants to also get his ex-wife back and he gets an all star gang to help him pull this caper off. George Clooney was great in the film. I've always had mixed reactions for Clooney on the big screen, because he does a hit movie and then goes and does a bunch of duds. I don't get why he does it. He's great in this one and his fans will be well pleased. Brad Pitt was the best in this film. He was cocky, arrogant, and so dang cool all at the same time. Him, Garcia, and Damon really drove the film for me. It's such a slick film, and Pitt has the slickest character. Awesome performance. I didn't like Julia Roberts in the movie. You don't see a whole lot of her, but they advertised her name like crazy for it. SHe doesn't do all that bad, I just don't care for her to much. Matt Damon was great in the movie. This guy really is a great actor. He doesn't get the kind of attention he deserves. He's signed on to do the sequel to this alond with Pitt and Clooney. Damons fans will be pleased with his job in this. This is a great film. It's so slick and was very well made. The DVD could have had some more extras, but oh well. Look at the movies that are already copying it. The Italian Job was done the same way as this one, except it was gold and not as big of a cast. It's a great film and I have to reccomend it to everyone.
