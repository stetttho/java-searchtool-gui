 I'm a huge Orlando Tragic I mean Magic fan. I was quite disapointed in the season we had this year, but at least the Magic looked good in there new uniforms. The 2003-2004 season unveiled new uniforms for the Magic. There are no longer stars all over the uniform and the star is gone from the name. It's a simpler look and I like it a lot better than the old ones. This is the third uniform change that I recall the Magic have done. It's my second favorite behind the pinstripes they use to wear during the Shaq and Penny glory days. It's a clean looking uniform. It's simplicity is what makes it so cool. Look your best and get the Magics new uniform. Hopefully we can get Okafor and look forward to a better season in 2204-2005. I just hope the uniform stays the same for a while so I don't have to purchase a new jersey.
