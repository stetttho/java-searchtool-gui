 John Williams is the greatest movie score writer in the business. There are some other good ones out there, but they can't draw comparisons with Williams. Once again he has done the music for Star Wars. Like all the previous Star Wars films most of the music is the same. Just about all of it is the same, except for the fact it might be arranged a little differently. Williams holds true to his patterns of Star Wars film in the way that he has written a beautiful new song for the Star Wars series. The Love theme is a wonderful piece of music. George Lucas asked John to write a song that could reflect the budding relationship between Anakin and Padme. Williams doesn't disappoint. It has a familiar feel to the Leia theme but it is original. The melodoy in the song is great. It is catchy and is something that is great to whistle or hum along with. This one is definetly a must for Star Wars fans. Fans of classical music will like it as well. It was performed by the London Symphony Orchestra who are some of the best in the world so if you like them you might want to check it out as well. I love this album and I'm glad I own. I think you'll feel the same way too.
