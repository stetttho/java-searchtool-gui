 I have mixed feeling on the movie Scarface. I love it and I hate it all at the same time. I think some of that can be put on Brian De Palma who directed it, but Al Pacino is amazing in the film. The first time I saw the movie I couldn't wait to see this scene. I'd always heard people quote this line, but I'd never seen Al do it.  This is such a great scene. The Colombians have killed everybody else in the house. You know Tony is next. He's not having a good day. His wife is gone. He just killed his best friend. His sister just tried to murder him, and on top of that he has the cartells men shooting up his men and his house. He has his door barricaded, but that isn't Scarface. He's going to go down in a fight, not hiding out in his room.   "You wanna play rough, lets play rough." We get that pause and then one of the greatest lines ever thrown out in a movie "Say Hello to My Little Friend." You gotta love it.  Despite your feeling on this movie, this picture and line deserve there places in pop culture history.
