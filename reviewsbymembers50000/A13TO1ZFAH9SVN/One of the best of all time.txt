 I saw this movie for the first time at the age of 9. It was July 4 weekend and instead of a classic war movie my dad pulled out Yankee Doddle Dandy. I was shocked by his actions and was kind of mad. I sat down reluctantly to watch the movie and was hooked. I was so excited to see it out on DVD. The movie tells the story of George Cohan. It does it in a flashback of his life. It starts on the day of his birth and tells his life story. James Cagney plays George Cohan, and gives one of the greatest performances in the history of cinema. He won the Oscar that year for best actor. He sings and dances to classic tunes such as "Give my Regards to Broadway," "Yankee Doodle Dandy," and "Your a Grand Old Flag." The movie is what patriotism is all about. In a post 9/11 era this is a movie that everyone should see. This is the tale of a man who loved his country and loved the opportunity America brought. Add this to your movie collection, I know you will enjoy it.
