 I love sports. I played most of them in high school and still do a lot of them for recreation. I love movies and The Replacements is the funniest football movie I've ever seen. The Replacements is the story about the Washington Sentinels. A fictional football team in a fictional league. The league has had a players strike and the teams are told to replace them. Washington hires Jimmy McGinty(Hackman) a former coach to lead them. The lead player is QB Shane Falco(Reeves) a QB that never got a chance. McGinty puts a team of misfits and former players around Falco and expects him to lead them to victory. Gene Hackman is great in the film. He is one of the best actors of all-time. Few can play a charcter like him. I like the way he plays Jimmy McGinty. McGinty has the fire of Mike Ditka and the wisdom and heart of Vince Lombardi. Hackman does a great job playing him. Keanu Reeves is also great in the film. This is one of the better charcters he's ever played. So often does Keanu work in films with so many other great actors and he always holds his own. He's with Hackman and he holds true to the statement I just said. I'd put Shane behine Neo and Bill as his best charcter he's ever done. This film has a ton of other guys you will recognize. It's a great cast in a great film. I love the Pat Summeral and John Madden cameo's. They are some of the better cameo's ever done. This is a great sports comedy. It will leave you cheering and laughing for more.
