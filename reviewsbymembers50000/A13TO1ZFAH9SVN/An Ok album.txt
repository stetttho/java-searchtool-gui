 This is Lil Kim's third album. The once prodigy of The Notorious B.I.G. tries to prove she's the queen bee and the best female gangsta rapper in the business. In my opinon she fails. Lil Kim has to many callaborations on La Bella Mafia. There are only like 4 solo tracks on the album while the rest are full of other hip hop stars. I would have liked to have seen more of Lil Kim by herself because she really doesn shine when she is solo. A lot of her tracks tend to slow down when the callaborator starts rapping. I did like the Jump Off and Magic Stick. Both songs have a catchy beat and have gotten plenty of air time on radio and MTV.  I just wish Lil Kim would depend on her talents more. I think she tries to use her sex appeal way to much by wearing some of the stuff she does. I also wish she'd do more solo stuff because a lot of the guys she runs with do hold her down. She can rap and rhyme and it's a shame she depends on so much else to help her out.
