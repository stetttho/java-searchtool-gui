 Tracy McGrady had quickly established himself as one of the best all around players in the NBA. In the McFarland NBA Action Figure Series 5 they have made a good model of T-Mac. T-Mac can dunk. If you know anything about NBA basketball you have see his highlight reel dunks before. This model has him in the air while he is performing a big wind mill dunk. You also have Tracy in the new Magic uniforms that were unveiled during the 2003-2004 season. This guy plays basketball so slick and this is a slick figure. T-Mac fans go pick up one of the best action figure models of hime made to date. I'm a big T-Mac and Magic fan and I'm glad this is part of my collection.
