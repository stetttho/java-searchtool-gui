 I love Bill O'Reilly. He is fastly becoming one of the most influential political guys in the world. Why, you might ask, because he calls it down the line. While other authors like Al Franken, Michael Moore, and Rush Limbaugh give there one sided opinions O'Reilly tells it how it is. No matter political party he will bash you. This book is basicly a continuation of his show hence the name The O'Reilly Factor. If you like his show you should love the book. If your a liberal you probaly won't like it as much as a conservative. Nevertheless it's an interesting book with an interesting and opionion and I enjoyed it. Keep up the good work Bill.
