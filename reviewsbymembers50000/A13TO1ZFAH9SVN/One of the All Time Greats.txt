 If you ever wondered how Arnold Schwarzenegger became the man he is today, it's this movie that did it. In 1982 Arnold would play Conan the Barbarian, the popular Robert Howard novel character and would make himself a movie star. Conan the Barbarian tells the story of Conan of Cimmeria. His parents are Killed By Thulsa Doom(James Earl Jones)when he is just a child. His goal is vengance and he will get it. Conan does get some companions along the way. He gets the warriores Valeria, a mongol companion and a wizard. They aid him in his quest for vengance. Arnold is great in the movie. If any one was ever born for a role this was his role. He is in probaly the best shape that you see him in since he started acting. He kills plenty of guys and is very barbaric. A must see for Arnold fans. There is plenty of blood and gore in the film. There is a lot of great sword play. There is nothing better than watching well choreoraphed sword fights. They are spectacular in Conan. The movie is rated R for bloody violence and some nudity. I also like the music score to Conan. It's one of the better movie scores ever written and I think ranks up there with Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and The Godfather in that department. I love Conan the Barbarian. It's the movie that helped launch the sword and fantasy movies of the 1980's and it's probaly the best. This DVD is a must to any collection. Don't miss out on this movie. I promise you won't regret watching it.
