 The Two Towers was an excellent movie. The game is pretty decent seeing the expectations that is put on something like it. The Two Towers is almost exactly like the movie. You replay some of the scenarios from the first movie "The Fellowship of the Ring." You have three choices of characters for the game. You can be Gimli, Aragorn, and Legolas. You build experience points up in the game which let you upgrade combo moves and weapons. After you've beaten the game with the characters you can unlock some cool secrets. Aragorn is easily the best of the three characters with Gimli second and the elf in third. The graphics are pretty good considering the scale they made the game on. The Helms Deep levels look kind of cheesy, but it's hard to make something look that realistic. Everything moves pretty crisp and the music and sound effects are great. There are some other specials with the game. You can unlock interviews with the cast of the game and watch scenes from the second movie. They are pretty decent and are only entertaing like the first time you watch it. I give the game four stars. It would have gotten five if they could have made some kind of two player gameplay. It's still a pretty good game despite that flaw and fans of LOTR should pick this one up.
