 The Return of the King was a fantastic movie. Peter Jackson made a modern masterpiece with it. The other two movies are just as good as the first. One thing Peter Jackson does is when he makes a Special Edition DVD he goes all out and that's what has me so excited about this movie.  50 minutes of footage will be added to the movie. I can tell you from my experience with the first two special editions is that the footage will be great. It always adds more to the movie and explains a little more of Tolkiens books. It will make the movie four hours long, but who cares. It will be some of the best four hours of your cinematic life everytime you watch it.  The Howard Shore score also has me excited. This guy is an excellent composer. He is no John Williams or James Horner, but he is quickly apporaching there status.  I love the extras that Jackson puts with these Special Editions. The first two had over four hours of extras talking about the movies and there makings and it's incredible how these were put together. I look forward to watching all the Appendices on Return of the King and seeing how one of the greatest special effect movies ever made was made.  The interviews with all the actors are always great on these DVDs. These guys became these characters and like family to each other. It's great hearing there stories and the love that they had for each other and for the project. If all movies had the commitment from their actors like the Lord of the Rings did, we'd see a lot more better movies.  I'm so excited to see this coming out. This is one of the greatest movies ever made and the DVD will be too.
