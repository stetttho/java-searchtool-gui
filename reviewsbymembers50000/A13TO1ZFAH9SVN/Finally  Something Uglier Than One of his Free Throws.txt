 Shaq is easily the most dominating player in the NBA right now. He does things other people can't do. He should stay to playing ball and leave the movies to someone else. Kazaam is simple enough story. Shaq is a stupid genie who ends up becoming some kids servant. He ends up becoming friends with the kid and they have to avoid getting in trouble and a bunch of other stupid stuff. The movie wasn't all that funny. The funniest scenes are watching Shaq. He is so huge. His pure size becomes funny. Watching him act is the second funniest part of the film. He is so horrible. He can't use emotion at all and he can't flat out act. Kazaam was best described in Scary Movie. In the beginning of the movie Carmen Electras character is asked whats her favorite scary movie. She answers with Kazaam. The guy says back that Kazaam isn't a scary movie. Carmen says, you haven't seen Shaq act. This movie really is that bad. I wouldn't waste my money buying or renting it. I just lost brain cells by watching it on TV one night.
