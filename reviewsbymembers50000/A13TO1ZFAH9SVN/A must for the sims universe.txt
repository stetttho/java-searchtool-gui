 I love playing the Sims. This is such an addictive and awesome game and this expansion is one of the essential ones that you have to have if you own the sims. If you've played the Sims then you know how tough dating can be in the game. It's not the easiest to get someone to fall in love with you and Hot Date excels in that area. There are a ton of new options that you can do with your sims. Before you could just kiss your sim. Now you can decide how you what kind of kiss you want that to be. There is the new downtown area that offers a ton of new options to the game and new stores. There are new items like chairs, hot tubs, counters, and tons of other stuff. There are some new clothes and you can do things like buy your date lingerie. You can go to Downtown and meet new people that you don't have to create like a jock or a blonde bombshell. It just adds to a fun and new experience to the game. If you have the Sims and don't have this expansion pack then you are missing out. This was is a must so go get it so you can enjoy the Sims a lot more.
