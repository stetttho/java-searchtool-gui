 I'm not afraid to admit I like Jennifer Lopez. I'm not to fond of her music, but I am very fond of her in her video's.  Jennifer Lopez-The Reel Me is a collection of all J-Lo's music videos. It has all of them no matter if they are old or new. It's got all her duets from LL Cool J to Ja Rule. The video's however are still edited for nudity and other adult content. This is a must for Jennifer Lopez fans. If you like her videos you'll definetly like. If you just want to stare at J-Lo you should like it. Like I said this is a must for J-Lo fans.
