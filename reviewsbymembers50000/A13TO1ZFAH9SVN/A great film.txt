 I'm 19 years old and at the time this movie was I was nine. Of course I loved it because it was my favorite tv show next to power rangers. My love for the film has not changed in the last 10 years. Batman:Mask of the Phantasm goes into detail about a specific time of Batman's life. It tells his origin. It shows us a love that he had. A woman that he loved. A woman he wanted to marry. It shows the origin of the Joker. Batmans most evil nemisis and what he did before the chemical bath. It shows all those origins and brings them up to date in the cape crusaders life. Can him and Andrea love again? Can he stop the Joker? All those questions are more are answered in Batman:Mask of the Phantasm. It's a great film and it's really great in the fact that it's an animated film. This was such a good tv show and they didn't disappoint with the movie. This is the original animated Batman from the early 90's. It's the best animated Batman ever done. This movie has a great score and great action. It's fun to see how people started especially comic book heros and villians. This one is a must for all Batman fans and I think it's something the whole family can enjoy.
