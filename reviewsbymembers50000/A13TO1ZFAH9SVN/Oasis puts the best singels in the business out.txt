 D'You Know What I Mean is the first single off the Oasis album Be Here Now. It's a great single with some great and rare Oasis songs. D'You know what I mean is a decent song. It's one of the songs you can tell Noel was definetly thinking about the Beatles when he wrote it. I like the beat to the song and the guitars are great in it. Stay Young is a great rebelion song. I was glad they put it on The Masterplan album because this song is a gem. " Hey Stay Young Invincible." I played this song over and over the first time I heard it. Teenagers really can relate to this song. Angel Demo is an ok song. I can see why the band has never done anything with it, but it's still some great songwriting from Noel. This is the only place to find this song at. Finally we have a cover of Heros. Nobody does a cover quite like Oasis does. They always sound great and they never insult the original. All the guys are big fans of Bowie and this song is a nice tribute to him. It's an awesome song already and Oasis does a great cover. This is the only place to get this song from. This is a grea Oasis single. It has two songs that are only available on it, so harcore fans really should pick this one up.
