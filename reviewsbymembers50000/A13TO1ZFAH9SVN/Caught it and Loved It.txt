 Steven Spielberg has shown once again why he's the best director in hollywood. Catch Me If You Can tells the story of a conman named Frank Abagnale Jr.(DiCaprio) Frank fakes being a pilot and starts writing fraud checks and all before the age of 18. He is pursued by a federal agent Carl Hanratty(Tom Hanks). Hanks figures out that he's doing it and the chase is on. You see Frank impersonate so many different people in the movie. Leo plays perfectly. I liked him a lot in this and it's his best performance since Titanic. Tom Hanks is awesome. What else would you expect from him. The only problem is that they don't develop his character as much as I'd like. Overall it's a great movie. I own it and I love it. It shows an interesting story and I'd recommend it to anybody.
