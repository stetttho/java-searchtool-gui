 The movie that proved he is the great one. This is one of the funniest movie that has ever been made. Jim Carrey stars as Ace Ventura:Pet Detective. The Miami Dolphins mascot Snowflake has been kidnapped. It's up to him to save her before Super Bowl Sunday. Dan Marino has also been kidnapped and it's up to Ace to save him. Teamed up with Mellisa(Courtney Cox) it's up to them to save the day. Filmed onsite in Florida you won't want to miss out on it. This is one of the greatest Slap stick performances of all time. Nobody in any movie in the history of cinema displays the kind of energy Jim Carrey puts out in this movie. He does it all. The dialogue is funny. The slapstick is great. The one liners are great. Everything is perfect. There is nothing you can knock him about in his performance. If the Academy ever were to recognize comedians in movies then Jim Carrey would have won an Oscar for this role. They don't though and it's sad to see performances like this go without a reward.  Jim Carrey is the reason to watch this movie. This is the one that made him the biggest comedian in Hollywood. This is the reason he was the first $20 million guy a picture. This is the movie that started it all. I liked Courtney Cox in the movie. This is just about the best she has ever looked. She is so hot in this movie. The movie is right before friends so she was basicly not known to a lot of people when she did this picture. The extras on the DVD aren't all that great. There is some audio commentary and the trailer. It's not one of the big reasons to purchase the DVD. The movie is. If you want to sit down and watch a funny movie this one is it. It's a perfect comedy and is one of the most selling videos of all time. You can't have a serious comedy collection without this one.
