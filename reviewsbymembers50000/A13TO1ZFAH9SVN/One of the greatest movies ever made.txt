 The Blues Brothers is one of those movies everyone should see at one time or another in their lives. Blues Brothers is a simple story. Jake(Belushi) has just gotten out of jail and re-united himself with brother and bandmate Elwood.(Akroyd) The Blues Brothers have just found out the orphanage they grew up is going to be sold and they have to stop that from happening. They have a couple of days notice to get $5,000 or it'll be gone. But how can they fail, They're on a mission from God. This movie has some of the greatest chemistry between actors that you will ever see. Jim Belushi and Dan Akroyd are great. Words don't give these guys the credit they deserve though. They stared, wrote, and actually played and sung the music in this. There characters are some of the most memorable in film history and both are pop cultre icons. Their easily the greatest SNL skit to ever go to the big screen and this is a must for anyone who considers themself a fan of either actor. The music is awesome in this movie. You have to love a movie that has Aretha Franklin, Cab Calloway, James Brown, and Ray Charles in it. The Blues Brothers and their band are awesome as well. This movie could be considered a musical and it has some of the best ever. This one is also one of the first movies to have hit stars in short cameos in it. Carrie Fisher, Steven Spielberg, Frank Oz, Aretha Franklin, Cab Calloway, James Brown, John Candy, and Ray Charles all have good ones and there are pleanty of other guys you'll recognize. I don't think I've ever seen more crashes in one movie either. If you love high speed crashes and chases you'll like Blue's Brothers just for it. Blues Brothers is one of the all time greats. Director John Landis(Three Amigos, Trading Places, Animal House) called this the greatest action musical chase explosion movie you will ever see. He's totally right and I garuntee you will love this one.
