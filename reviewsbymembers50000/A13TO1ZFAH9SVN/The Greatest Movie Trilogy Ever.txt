 The Star Wars Trilogy is a movie set classic. All of the movies are classics and are spectacular films. It's about time the movies are be released on DVD and we only have to wait until September 21. The only flaw in the trilogy will be the simple fact that we are getting the special editions instead of the originals. If you love the movies though that really shouldn't matter to you. When Lucas made these movies he was broke. He had a vision for the movie but wasn't able to do some of the things he wanted to do because  he simple couldn't afford to do so. The technology wasn't available for some of the things either so he had to wait until he could get the technology to do it. This was his vision for the film. Most of the special edition stuff isn't all tha bad. I though all the special editions were great except for the singing in Jabba's palace and the dumb song that was played at the end of Return of the Jedi. The films are going to look briliant. They looked good when they were restored on the VHS over a decade ago. If you saw the Indiana Jones trilogy on DVD then you know that Lucas doesn't play around. The extras I hope are fantastic. Many specials have been done over the years talking about the making of the moives and these should be just as good. The specials on Episode 1 and 2 are both fantastic and there is no reason to worry that these won't be as well.  It's to bad we can't get the originals and I'm looking past that flaw. These DVDs are going to be spectacular and they will be here to test the tale of time. This is the greateset trilogy ever made and yes it's better than Lord of the Rings. This is an essential to any one that calls themselves movie fans or Star Wars fans. You have to get this when it comes out and it's only a couple of months more wait. So hold on just a little bit longer.
