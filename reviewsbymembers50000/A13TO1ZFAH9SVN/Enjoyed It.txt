 I'm not at Anne Rice fan and I've never read any of her books. I am however of fan of this movie and enjoyed it a lot. Interview with the Vampire is not a horror movie. It is anything but it. The movie tells us the story of Louis.(Brad Pitt) He's over 200 years old and he's telling his life story to a reporter played by Christian Slater. He's tells us how he became a Vampire from the bite of Lestat(Cruise) and how he hates being what he is. You see the child they have played by Kirsten Dunst. He tells about his good times and his low times. It's a tragic story. Brad Pitt is great as Louis. You can argue this as the best performance that he as ever made. He holds his own with Tom Cruise. It's a believable performance. You actually think he is the Vampire and he plays the emotions well. Tom Cruise is simply fantastic. Lestat is a very arrogant character and Tom plays it to perfection. He shows lots of energy and the role is very well acted. Like Pitt he becomes the character and he's no longer Tom Cruise. It's a shame to see "Queen of the Damned" and watch Stuart Townsend play a horrible Lestat. Kirsten Dunst is great. She's so creepy and scary in the movie. I heard an interview with her a couple of months ago, in which she was mad that she hated the scene in the movie where she gets to kiss Pitt. It's a memorable performance and it's her humble beginning. I liked Interview with the Vampire. It and "Bram Stokers" are in my opinion the two best vampire movies ever made.
