 What's the Story(Morning Glory) is a musical masterpiece. Oasis has put out a rarity where you will actually want to listen to each song. It contains some powerhouse hits like Wonderwall, Don't Look Back in Anger, and Champagne SuperNova.  All songs were written by Noel Gallagher. He shows talent and diversity in his writing. He shows a little bit of his insides in Cast No Shadow. It's a wonderful song. I just can't say enough about this album. This is a must own for any rock fan. Sample the songs and buy this CD. I garuntee you won't regret it.
