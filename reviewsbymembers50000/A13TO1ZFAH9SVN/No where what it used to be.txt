 I'm a pretty big TV fan. I'm a member of a family thats gotten TV guide for almost 20 years until this last year. It just isn't what it used to be. Why does TV guide cover movies in the theater. If the movie isn't going to be on TV for over a year why are they covering it. Don't sell out. That bugs me a lot. You are suppose to be informative about TV not movies. None of the columns are no where what they used to be. Cheers and Jeers used to be good, but it has lost it's flavor. I don't know whats happended to the writer, but he's become pretty harsh and hard to please. Him bashing those teenage kids for abstinence was one of the straws that broke my back to this magazine. TV Guide does do a pretty good job of letting you know whats on TV. If a TV show is hot they let you know about it. They've always done a good job in this area. As far as letting you know whats on tv TV guide does a good job. It's a pretty easy to read format with the times, dates, and channels listed. They lay the primetime schedule out everyday in a nice grid thats really easy to read. One of the things I've always liked that TV guide did was in the back of the magazine. They would list all of the movies on the premium channels in ABC order. If your a big movie fan you could do a little bit of reading and then maybe plan on watching a movie. They still do this and I enjoy that. TV Guide needs to stop selling out. It is going to kill there subscription list one day. We don't get TV guide in our house anymore because of Direct TV. The channel guide gives us everything TV Guide does and it's pointless to get the magazine. It's not bad if your a big TV fan and it's a one of a kind. I have no use for it anymore though.
