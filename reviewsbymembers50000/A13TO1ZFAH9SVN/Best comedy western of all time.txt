 I love Rustler's Rhapsody. It's easily one of Tome Berrenger's best flicks ever. While most people view Blazing Saddles as the best western comic spoof, Rustler's to me blows it away. It's not nearly as raunchy and not quite as stupid. Every time I watch this movie it leaves my stomach hurting because of all the times I'll laugh. There's a great cast to this movie. Tom Berrenger, Andy Griffith, Sela Ward, and many more people you'll recognize. That's another reason I can't beleive people haven't seen this. The story is a western spoof. The hero comes to the western town being used and abused by the evil cattle baron. The hero must stop them and overcome some of his own problems. The story also reveals why the bad guys always lose and why the good guys always win. The movie is great. I guarentee it will make you laugh and laugh hard. If you don't like spoofs then you probaly won't like Rustler's Rhapsody. If you like Blazing Saddles you will definetly love Rhapsody. This is a must own. It's one of the greatest and funniest movies nobody has ever heard of.
