 I'm a pretty big SNL fan. I don't get to watch as much as I'd like to anymore, but it's the most consistent funny show on tv. The SNL Christmas special is a great DVD. It does have some notable skits. I love the skit with Alec Baldwin and the NPR ladies. It's so funny because all of them play being so serious so well. I laugh so hard every time I see this skit. I liked the Martha Stewart topless christmas. She is such an easy target to make fun of and they do it great in this skit. Martha Stewart is annoying because of the way she talks and the way she presents herself. They spoof it so well in topless christmas. It's one of the better skits on the dvd. All the skits with old SNL members are great. Dan Akroyd is one of the funniest guys to live and his skits as the toliet paper saleman and the toymaker are great. Are two favorite SNL drunks Farley and Belushi both have some good stuff there fans should like. Adam Sandler does the Hannakuh song. It's not the best version of the song, but it is the original and what a funny song it is. I love this DVD. It's one of the better best of's they've made and I'm glad it's part of my collection.
