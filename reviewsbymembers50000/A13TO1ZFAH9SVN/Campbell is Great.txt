 If Chins Could Kill, is a great biography. I loved Bruce Campbell and I loved the book. He shares his past pasionatlly with you as he talks about his carear. There is a great part about the Evil Dead, which he co-produced with Sam Raimi. He talks about other details of his life and you get to know him a little better. Bruce is one of my all time favorite actors. He uses sarcasm well which I love, and he's believabe. He's not the greatest actor in the world and will never win an oscar, but he's one of the few actors that is like me and you. If you love Bruce Campbell you will love this book. If you have no idea who he is, you still probaly will. Don't miss out on it.
