 I loved The Mask. Jim Carrey was fantastic in it. I loved the music in the movie. All the songs from the movie and more are on this hit soundtrack. I like hearing Jim Carrey sing. He does Cuban Pete in it. He did Cuban Pete in the movie with that funny dance scene. Carrey actually has a decent voice and as one of his fans I enjoyed hearing him sing. This soundtrack has a mix of famous groups and people. Vannesa Williams, Harry Connick Jr., Brian Setzer Orchestra to name just a few. Fans of swing will really get a kick out of this. You'll like Hey Pacuco and Cuban Pete. It's got some great horn work on the soundtrack. I love this cd. If you liked The Mask, you'll like this soundtrack. It's a fun mix of music that makes me want to watch the movie every time I hear it.
