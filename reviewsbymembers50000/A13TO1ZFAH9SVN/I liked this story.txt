 Death of Superman was a great comic series. I was glad the day I found all the comics combined in one book. It sure did save me a lot of money. It was split into like 6 different comics. Death of Superman puts Superman up against a killing machine called Doomsday. Not much is known about the killer except for his love of destruction. He is destroying everything in his way and he's heading towards Metropolis. The Justice League of America goes into action to stop Doomsday. They fail in the process. He beats the mess out of most them. Some hold there own better than others, but Superman comes to the rescue of some of them. Once Superman starts fighting Doomsday it really picks up. It's some great drawing. Most of the shots are done in  bigger squares and sometimes full pages of the comic. Mad props to all the artists and drawers who worked on this project. The final showdown in Metropolis is great. I love it when there punching each other so hard the shock is shattering all the windows. It's sad to see the big guy go down when he finally takes Doomsday out, but it was kind of nice to see him get beat. However, his death is short lived which is a great thing because Superman is the best ever. This book is definetly a must for all Superman fans.
