 Army of Darkness is a remarkable movie. It comes from one of the best directors and producers in the business in Sam Raimi, and it has one of the most underrated actors of all time in Bruce Campbell. Army tells the continuing story of Ash and his attempts to end the world of the evil the book of the dead has brought. He gets transported into the past, and must get home. To get home he must retreave the book of the dead. He accidentally releases a great evil and the war is on. I love the special effects in Army of Darkness. The zombies hold to the silly tradition started in The Evil Dead. The skeletons reming me of the skeleton in the lipton ice commercials. I also love the brownie Ash's and seeing Ash seperate into Evil Ash. Bruce Campbell once again steals the show as Ash. The poor S-Mart employee is better equipped in this movie with his shot gun and chain saw. Once he starts leading the natives against the skeletons, it's like a yankee in king arthurs court. It's great and predictable, but thats whats fun about it. Army of Darkness is a great movie. It's funny and is a great horror spuff. It will leave you laughing crazy.
