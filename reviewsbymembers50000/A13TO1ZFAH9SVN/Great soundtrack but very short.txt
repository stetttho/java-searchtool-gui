 I love Basil Poledouris. He has written some terrific movie scores and this another one. The Hymn to Red October is the reason to buy this soundtrack. The russian chorus like somebody said earlier is awe inspiring. They sound absolutely terrific. You'd think they were the mormon tabernacle choir singing in Russian. It's fantastic. The rest of the soundtrack is ok. No other songs really jump to you and they are very short. Some of the songs are under minute long which is very disappointing. The music was so good in the movie. I was disappointed the song the russians sing on the sub was left off the soundtrack. I don't know the name of it, but I love the song. It sounded terrific in the movie and it would have been nice to hear it here. Like I said earlier Basil has written another fantastic movie score. His fans will definetly want to pick this one up. Fans of the movie might want to consider it to. Fans of movie scores should also pick it up, just be expected to be disapointed by the short length.
