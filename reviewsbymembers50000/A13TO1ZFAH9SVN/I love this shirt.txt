 I do own this shirt. I bought it and the official tour date shirt when I saw them in concert. There is no better way of supporting your favorite band than by buying there T-Shirts. The more stuff they can sell the more likely to stay in business they will be. This is a fun noticeable shirt with the Ringers and the Band and Album title on it.  Jet is quickly rising in popularity with hit songs like "Are You Gonna be my Girl, Cold Hard Bi***, Rollover Dj, and now "Look What You've Done." So go out and support this Aussie band any way you can so we can keep them comingto America and on American radio.
