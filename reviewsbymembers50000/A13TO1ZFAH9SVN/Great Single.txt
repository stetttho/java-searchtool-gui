 Heathan Chemistry was a great album by Oasis. This third single of the album is another great Oasis song. Little by Little is a fantastic song. It's one of the top 5 songs off the Heathan Chemistry album and I'd put it their top 20 songs they've ever done. Noel once again puts a lot of emotion and feeling into the song. This is also one of the songs that Noel sings. She is Love is another good song. I believe Noel wrote this one for his girlfriend, but I'm not 100% sure. If you'd listen to the lyrics it sure does sound like it. Noel also sings this one. My Generation is a great cover. It's equal to the version sung by The Who. Oasis played this one a lot on their last tour and this is the only place to get it. This single isn't a required one to get. I have it because I'm obsessed with this band and I think they are the greatest. Unless you collect Oasis like I do there really isn't a reason to pick this album up unless you want My Generation that bad. Go get Heathan Chemistry and enjoy all the songs off it.
