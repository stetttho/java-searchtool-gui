 Diablo was a fun game. I enjoyed beating it, but the game had it's flaws. I picked Diablo II up a couple of months ago, because I finally found the Battlechest for a price I felt I could pay. I wish I wouldn't have been so cheap. This game is awesome. It blows the first one away and they hard to even compare.  Diablo II is kind of like an RPG. You don't fight in the normal RPG way, but your goal is to complete missions and work your character up to a high enough level so you can slay the Dark Lord. In the original game there were only three character classes to chose from. That has changed in this one. You can now select from an Amazon, Necromancer, Sorceress, Paladin, Barbarian, and with the Expansion Set a Druid and Assasin.  All the characters have special abilites that none of the others do. The abilities hold true to the idea behind the character. They had a new fun element to the game play. Magic is done a lot more realistic in this game than it was in the first one.   The gameplay is pretty fun. I've beat Diablo, but haven't finished beating the Expansion set. I'm almost to Baal and I'm loving every second of it. Some of the quests I found to be quite fun. The guys did a good job writing the storyline. Some of them did get a little old and I was very happy once I completed them.  The real thing that makes this game shine though is Battle.Net. You have to give Blizzard there props. Battle.Net should be prescribed with a warning label. Every Blizzard game I've ever owned has always been better on Battle.Net fighting with other people and this one holds true to that. It isn't as fun as Starcraft on the Net, but it's not to far from it.  This game is addictive. You will lose all sense of time and place when you play it. You will want to beat it. You will want to beat it again. So don't be a cheap skate like I was and go pick this one up. You won't regret it.
