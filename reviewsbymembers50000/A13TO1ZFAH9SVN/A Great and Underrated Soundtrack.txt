 The Untouchables was a spectacular film. It cleaned house at the box office and won Sean Connery his Oscar. It helped establish Kevin Costner as one of the best in Hollywood and the soundtrack is equal to all of those achievements. When people think of Hollywood composers only few come to mind. Obviously John Williams is the best to ever do it and has written some of the most amazing scores ever. There's other popular guys such as Jerry Goldsmith, James Horner, and Danny Elfman. Ennio Morricone score for The Untouchables is as equal or better to some of the names mentioned above. The Untouchables soundtrack does what a soundtrack should do. It compliments the movie very well. Music is an important and often underrated part of cinema. Music makes situations more tense, scarier, funnier, ligtens mood, and brings out action. Ennio Morricones' score does just that. It helps bring the shoot outs better, adds emotions to love scenes with Ness his wife and child, and helps make Al Capone more cocky. It really does the movie well. I play the Trumpet and I love the trumpets in the soundtrack. There is a good mix of music and everything is blended well. Morricone brings an Italian flair to his score and it can be heard in some songs. I love the soundtrack. It is hard to find and I was glad to see that Amazon had it. For any classical music fan or soundtrack fan this is a must. Don't miss out on it.
