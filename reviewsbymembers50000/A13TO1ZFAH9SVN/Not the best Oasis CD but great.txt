 I like Stading on the Shoulder of Giants. It's the first CD with the new Oasis bandmates. It's probaly the worst of the albums that Oasis has put out. If your new to Oasis this wouldn't be the album I got first. I'd go get What's the story(Morning Glory). My favorite song on the cd is "Go Let it Out." It's a catchy tune and will get stuck in your head. I saw them do this one in concert and Liam's vocals on it are fantastic. I like Gas Panic and did like F***in the Bushes. This CD is a must for Oasis fans, but for somebody new go get Morning Glory.
