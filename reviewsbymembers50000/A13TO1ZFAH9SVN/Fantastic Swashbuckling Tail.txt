 This is definetly not Dumas Count of Monte Cristo. It doesn't follow the book close at times and is far fetched from it at others. It is however a great movie and a great way to introduce this young generation to Dumas. The Count of Monte Cristo tells the tale of Edmund Dantes. A man that is imprisoned for a crime by his best friend Fernand Mondego that he did not commit. He spends 13 years in jail at the Chateau'If.(thats not how you spell it but it's close enough for me) It's there that Edmund meets a fellow prisonman that trains him in literature, economics, and swordplay. Dantes gets out of jail then goes a spree for revenge to get the men who put him jail. This is a great story of revenge. Jim Cavaziel is perfects as Dantes. He does a great job. He has a swagger and plays Edmund great when he poor and when he's rich. He shows his abilities as a good actor because of the different levels to the character. I'm really impressed with him and hope to see him more in the future. Guy Pearce is good as Fernadn Mondego. I was first impressed with Pearce in L.A. Confidential. It's good to see him finally showing his acting abilities again. He plays a great bad guy. You can't stand his character and that's because Pearce plays him so good. This is an awesome tail of revenge. If your a diehard Dumas fan you won't like this. I'd reccommend the Richard Chamberlin version for you. However if you like a fast paced tail of revenge full of swashbuckling this is the film for you. It's a great action film that reminds us why we go to the movies: To Be Entertained. You'll like this one.
