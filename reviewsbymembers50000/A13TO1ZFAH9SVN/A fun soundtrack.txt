 I picked up this soundtrack almost immediately after I saw this movie in theater. It's one of the best soundtracks I've ever purchased. This one has a lot of great oldies on it from a lot of big artists. You've got "Aint No Mountain High Enough" from Marvin Gaye which is a great song. There's "Up Around the Bend by CCR. You also have "Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress by The Hollies. "Spirit of the Sky" is also here by Norman Greenbaum. To top it off you also have "Na Na Hey Hey Kiss him Goodbye" by Steam to top off all the hits. It's a hit powered soundtrack that can please a big age gap. I was a little disappointed with the Titans Score. I like the song in the movie but they didn't get right on the soundtrack. Thats the only knock I can put down on this soundtrack. Other than that it's perfect. I love this soundtrack. My parents love this one a lot. It's one of the better ones I own and if you loved the movie you have to pick this up.
