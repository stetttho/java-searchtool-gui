 Oasis has made an awesome debut. I love this CD. It isn't the best that Oasis has made, but it's not the worse. It contains hit like Rock N' Roll Star, Live Forever, Up in the Sky, Supersonic, Digsy Diner, Slide Away, Married with Children, and on some cds the single Sad Song. Supersonic is probaly my favorite song on the CD. It's guitar is catchy and will have the melody stuck in your head. Married with Children is another one of my favorites off of it. I love the acoustic guitar in the set. It's beautifully written and sung. Live Forever is another great song. It's a ballad that will last forever. Noel Gallagher is an awesome songwriter. I'd say he is the best in the music business. I wish Oasis spent more time in the U.S. I honestly believe these guys could be a modern day Beatles, if they did like the rest of the music world and sold out to MTV. I'm glad they haven't. Come listen to the roots of Oasis. They are a lot more than Wonderwall, Champagne Supernova, and Don't Go Away. Go and buy Definetly Maybe. If your an Oasis fan, you'll Definetly like it.
