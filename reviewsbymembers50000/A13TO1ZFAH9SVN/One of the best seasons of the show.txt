 I love this show. Finally after almost a two month wait it's here. Hercules Season 3 was a great year for the show. Some of the most popular episodes they made were on it. Kevin Sorbo aka Hercules favortie episode is included in this season. "Mercenary" is that episode. It's a great episoe where Hercules and a mercenary must defend themselves from Tremor like Worms and a bunch of pirates. It's a great episode and I can see why it's Kevins favorite. There are two episodes with the goddess of love Aprhodite. "Love Takes a Holiday" and "Reign of Terror" both have her in it played by the lovely Alexandra Tydings. She is so hot in all her episodes. All her episodes are real good and are full of laughs. Sam Rami(Ex Pro) always made sure all the episodes with Aphrodite were great. "Love Takes a Holiday" is great in a way in that Kevin Sorbo isn't in it. Iolaus(Michael Hurst) stars as the lone hero in this one. He teams up with Aprhrodite to save a town from Aphestus the god of fire. There are a ton of good episodes in this season. The christmas tribute one is here in "A Star to Guide Them." Hercules fights a mystic mummy in "Mummy Dearest." Hercules also gets sent back to 18 century France in "Les Contemptibles." He finds a new wife, battles his brother Ares and does much more in this legendary season. Season 3 is awesome. It's better than 2 and I'd say equal to 1. The extras on this one are the best yet, and the DVDs just keep getting better. Fans of the show won't want to miss out on this one.
