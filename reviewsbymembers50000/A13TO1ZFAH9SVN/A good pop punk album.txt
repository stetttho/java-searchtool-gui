 I have to admit I like Simple Plan. I bought the album because I did like "Addicted" and "I'd Do Anything." I'm glad I bought it. No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls is a great catchy album. Most of the songs are fueled by a catchy chorus and guitar rifts. Most of the tracks don't sound the same which really does enhance the cd. Simple Plan doesn't follow the hypocrisy of Good Charlotte either in saying there punk. "Addicted" is a good song. It's gotten tons of radio play. "I'd Do Anything" is another song thats gotten radio play. "Perfect"  is there latest song to be on the radio. I think it's one of the better songs on the album. It's a song most teenagers can relate to. "I'm Just a Kid" is another song teens can relate too. I liked "My Alien" a lot. It's a catchy song with some funny lyrics. I know Simple Plan is one of those punky pop trend bands. They will most likely not be around in 10 years. This is a great album. I can put it on and listen to the whole thing and not be disgusted with half the songs. It's easy to see why there popular and think most teenagers will like this one.
