 Pirates of the Caribbean is the best movie to come out this year. I had to admit I was skeptic about a movie based off a ride, but I was so wrong. I'm not going to tell you much about the story line. I'm going to say a little bit about it and then what I liked. I don't like to tell much of the story, because I think it takes away from the experience of seeing the movie. Pirates is a pirate movie. The good guys most stop the pirates, save the girl, and the end the curse. Johnny Depp is outstanding. There is nothing he did wrong with the movie. He brought great charm to it, and was so sarcastic. He really does steal the show, and has made himself into what will be one of the most beloved characters in movie history. He really is that great. Orlando Bloom was good as well. A lot of people have knocked him for what he did in the movie and have accused him of being a bad actor. While Bloom was brought in to bring the ladies to the theatar, he plays a great action hero. I thought he played the role as Will Turner to perfection, and I just can't see what people had against him. Keira Knightly was awesome. I think she is incredibly hot and will be a big hollywood star one day. She plays Elizabeth well for what they gave her to work with. The special effects are the other reason to go. They were done by Industrial Light & Magic. The pirates look great when you see the curse in action on them. It's some of the best of the year, and will probaly draw Oscar nominations. Like I said, Pirates is the best movie of the year so far. Depp should find some kind of academy consideration for his role as should the movie for best picture. It's fun for the whole the family, and is a must for any movie fan.
