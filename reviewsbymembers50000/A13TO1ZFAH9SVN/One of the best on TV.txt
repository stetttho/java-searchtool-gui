 Smallville is the best shows on TV. It tells the story of a young Clark Kent before he makes his way to Metropolis and becomes superman.       Clark(Tom Welling)has the same problems that other teenagers do and is also trying to deal with his developing powers. He is desperatly trying to win the heart of Lana Lang(Kristin Kruek..who is the most gorgeous girl in the world).       He also befriends a young Lex Luthor(Michael Rosenbaum) before he goes evil and wants to dominate the world. The two's developing friendship is great and so ironic.      The first season of Smallville is outstanding. It's a great addition to the superman story. It's clean, family oriented, and is fun for the whole family. I'm 19 years old, and it's not to often that my 3 brothers, 2 sisters, and mom and dad can agree on one show. Smallville is one of the shows and I'm sure you'll enjoy it too, if you'll watch it. Don't miss out on the DVD.
