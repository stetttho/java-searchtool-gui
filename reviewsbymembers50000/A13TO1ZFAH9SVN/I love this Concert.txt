 I've owned this DVD for a couple of years now and I absolutely love this band. This is the greatest band in the world and this is them in there early years. This is a great show. It was recorded live at Southend Cliffs Pavillion on April 17 1995. It's in front of a good crowd and is a great concert. Just about everything from "Definetly Maybe" is included in the concert. You have some of the singles like "Sad Song" and "Good To Be Free" on it. You also get "Some Might Say" in it's early days. The energy is really there on the song. I love Noel's acoustic set on the DVD. He does it in all of there concerts. I got to see him in a show in Miami where Liam lost his voice. This set isn't as good as it, but it's still worthy. It's not a huge set and he actually messes up on one of the songs. While he is playing "D'Yer Wanna Be A Spaceman? he messes up. He says the wrongs word to a totally different song. It's so awesome. I love this DVD. It has so many great early Oasis songs. There is a lot of energy displayed from both the crowd and the band. I don't think it's as good as "Familiar to Millions," but it's better than "There and Then." This one is a must for hardcore Oasis fans.
