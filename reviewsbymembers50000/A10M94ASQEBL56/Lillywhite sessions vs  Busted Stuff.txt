 Just got a copy of Busted Stuff.  Comparing it to the Lillywhite Sessions, my opinions follow. Busted Stuff - Much better on Lillywhite Grey Street - very slightly better on Lillywhite Where Are You Going? - great song only on Busted Stuff You Never Know - good song only on Busted Stuff Captain - better on Busted Stuff Raven - better on Busted Stuff Grace Is Gone - better on Busted Stuff Kit Kat Jam - bad song on both Digging a Ditch - much better on Lillywhite Big Eyed Fish - much better on Lillywhite Bartender - better on Busted Stuff Sweet Up And Down - great song only on Lillywhite JTR - great song only on Lillywhite Monkey Man - unimpressive song only on Lillywhite Bottom line.  You need both CDs to get a great collection of songs.
