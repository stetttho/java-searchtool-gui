 I loved the narrator's "talking style" as someone else here referred to it.  I was amazed that a book written in that common language style of the 40s would fit in very well with the language many teens use today.  Almost undated at all.  Only in his outward respect to elders which today's cynical kids don't display. My problem with the novel is the humor and freshness wears thin after about 80-90 pages.  I think this novel could have been half the length and would have been much more effective.
