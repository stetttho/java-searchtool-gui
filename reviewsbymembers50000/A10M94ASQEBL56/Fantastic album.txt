 They keep getting better.  First album was good.  Second album was better.  This one is awesome. Calling All Angels - Good formula pop hit.  Catchy. All American Girl - Another good pop hit.  Different than Angels but still kind of formulaic. When I Look To The Sky - This is where you realize this album is something special.  Reminds me how I felt on DMB's Under the Table and Dreaming, when you hit Satellite.  Softer, deeper, stiring song.  Makes you realize there is something more than pop to this band. Save The Day - Now you know you picked up something special.  4 songs.  4 different sounds.  All good. My Private Nation - They change gears again and go to a driving rock song. Get To Me - On first listen you think.  Ah, I've finally found the weak spot on this album.  Not so.  About the third time you listen to this one, you don't even think about hitting the skip forward button. Counting Airplaines - Another that didn't grab me on first listen, but I like the more I hear it. Following Rita - Great hit and you know it on first listen.  This one makes you hit repeat. Your Every Color - Possibly the best Train song yet.  Once you get through repeating Rita, you'll want to repeat this one for a while. Lincoln Avenue - Softer song.  Not as attention grabbing as the rest, but a good solid song. I'm About To Come Alive - When this one ends you say, "Oh man! is it over already" and then hit start all over again.
