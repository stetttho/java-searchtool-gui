 I loved the Bio of a Space Tyrant series.  Refugee was one of the most affecting/haunting books I've ever read.  It is not for the weak stomached.  There is much violence in this book, but it's not about the violence it's about the human will to survive. The first four books in this series, Refugee, Mercenary, Politican and Executive are excellent page turners.  The fifth Statesman is good but not quite the same level, a little anticlimatic.  But don't miss out by not reading at least the first four!
