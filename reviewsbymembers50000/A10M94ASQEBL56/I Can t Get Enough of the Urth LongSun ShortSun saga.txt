 Many have compared this to Homer's Odyssey.  On retrospect I would agree.  This book continues Horn's story and adventures on the planet Blue.  What I like about Wolfe is that from any point in time you not only go forward but  backward.  As he reveals Horn's future we continue to learn more and more  about his past.  What we thought we already read and understood in the Long  Sun books is further explained, questioned and explored.  Like peeling the  layers of an onion Wolfe keeps us hooked looking towards the future and the  past. I am currently reading In Green's Jungles and can't wait for Return  to the Whorl.  Once finished I'll probably go all the way back to the Book  of the New Sun and reread all three series in order.  You can never reread  Wolfe enough.  You will always find more nuggets.
