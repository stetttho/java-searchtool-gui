 I had not heard XTC since English Settlement, when I first bought this CD.  I wondered if they would still be good as many bands lose their focus.  This is a perfect CD.  Still exploring new ground and at the same time keep  the same great sounds.  The Ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead is a hard tune to get out of your head. My Bird Performs is a beautiful tune. That Wave is haunting and experimental. Then She Appeared is my favorite tune on the CD. Lots of good songs.  Lots of different styles.
