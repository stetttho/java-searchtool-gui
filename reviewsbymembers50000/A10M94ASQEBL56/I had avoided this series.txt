 Although I love vampire series, because the cover art made me think it was very slanted towards being a romance novel with just a little vampiric story thrown in.  A friend recommended the series to me, recently, and described it and it sounded much more exciting.  She was right.  Many stories of this type have some exciting vampiric action and then some long lulls of description or more dull events thrown in the middle before getting back to more action.  This story is more similar to the first Indiana Jones movie.  Where the story never lulls.  The action never lulls.  And the tension is kept up from the first page til the last.  Good read.  Look forward to reading the rest of the series.
