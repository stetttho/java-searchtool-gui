 Any longtime XTC fan knows that you have to listen to the full track to or you miss something.  With Mummer I found some tracks where I wasn't impressed but as I continued listening a *sweet jewel* was hidden and  became revealed.  If you love XTC you want this in your collection.  I  liked it better than Skylarking, but I'm also going to give that one  another try.  Beating of Hearts has beautiful lyrics. Wonderland is captivating. Love on a Farmboy's Wages is my favorite tune on the CD. Deliver Us From The Elements is frantically good. Procession Towards Learning Land is hauntingly good.
