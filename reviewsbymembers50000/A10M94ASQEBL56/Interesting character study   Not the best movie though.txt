 Just watched The Time of Your Life on DVD.  I give it ** out of five stars. Things I'd never seen before: -The opening credits as a dramatis personae, listing a description of the character each actor plays. -Pinball called the marble game. What I liked about it: -Jeanne Cagney - Did Jimmy force them to give her a contract? I had her in the not like column, but she grew on me as the film went on. -The tap dancer - Loved the political speech dance -Kit Carson - Especially when he called Blick totally unreliable -The marble player - loved the way you forget all about him until he wins the game. Cool marble game -The ritsy couple -William Bendix - perfect as the bar owner -Tough guy Blick.  Very intimidating. What I didn't like about it: -At times it drug and made me think of a slow episode of Cheers or a tv movie of Billy Joel's "Piano Man."  Some good scenes, but not a very good movie. -Jimmy Cagney - Not at his best in a slow moving film. He's better in fast talking, action sequences.
