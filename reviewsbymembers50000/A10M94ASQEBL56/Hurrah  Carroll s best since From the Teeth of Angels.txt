 This book had me captivated from the first page.  Great mystery.  Great characters.  Good story!  One of the few authors that can leave the genre I discovered him in (fantasy/scifi) and still captivate me.  The only other I can think of off the top of my head is Graham Joyce.  Carroll is great at keeping the reader off balance.
