 When I picked up this book to read, I would have guessed that I would end up rating it 2 stars. At most 3.   The surprise for me was that Tricia McFarland would not be the average spoiled brat that most child stories center around but a very interesting person who I would come to deeply care about. That's the mark of a great writer in my book.   I had always thought this was SK's attempt at how he would do The Blair Witch Project. This story couldn't be further from that other one though. It's a story about strength, and determination, about perservering, and how brave the human spirit can be.   If you get a chance, don't miss this one like I almost did. I took me what, 5 years to give it a chance.   I listened to the CD-Audio version read by Anne Heicht. I've never been an Ann fan. I thought she tried to get by on gimics more than acting ability. Watching her on Boston Public began to change my opinion. Hearing her read this has at least convinced me that "Ann, you can read me a story anytime!" Excellent capture of Tricia and the voices in her head.
