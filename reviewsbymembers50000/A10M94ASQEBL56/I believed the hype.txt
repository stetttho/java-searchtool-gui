 Hearing the book of the year and Harry Potter for adults tags, I grabbed this book with a lot of expectations.  I've seen other glowing reviews here so I assume this is a case of YMMV (your mileage may vary).  The old style of writing didn't put me off.  But I think this could have been a good (but not great) 200-300 page story.  The book set up an interesting premise and contained some interesting sequence.  But inbetween is a lot of rambling.  The footnotes remind of of Book of Leaves where the first 50 pages or so they come off as an interesting unique devise but by the 400-700 pages I began to find them very tiresome.  If you have a two page footnote, maybe that story should be part of the main storyline.  As someone else said, don't expect Harry Potter for adults.  It is definitely not that.
