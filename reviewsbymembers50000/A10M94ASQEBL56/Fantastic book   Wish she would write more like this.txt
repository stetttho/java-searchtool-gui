 I was actually hoping the movie Stargate would be based on this book, and although I enjoyed the movie and series, would have enjoyed it much more if it *had* been based on this great book. I read this back in the 80s when I received it as a selection of the Science Fiction Book Club.  Very engaging story.  It draws you into the characters and they stay with you many, many years afterwards. Good story of just what is good, what is evil and how do we go about living our lives with what we learn about good and evil. Would love to reread this one, if I could find it.
