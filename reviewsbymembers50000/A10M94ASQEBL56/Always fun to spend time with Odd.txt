 As others have said, this one was't quite as good as the first, but it is still enjoyable spending time with Odd, his ghosts, and his friends.  I think the weakness in this book is all the time in the tunnels.  Odd is at his best interacting with ghosts and people.  In this book too much time was spent just discribing the scenery.  But it is still a good read!
