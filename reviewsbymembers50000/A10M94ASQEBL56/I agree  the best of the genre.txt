 When I first attempted to read this trilogy I got about 30 pages into it and put it down.  The brother and sister argueing down on the farm just didn't draw me in.  But luckily for me, I decided to give it another chance a few days later.  I have never read anything like it.  After the first 30-40 pages the first book is like being on a ride of "wonder."  Everything you see is fascinating and although you want to know the "secrets" you really don't want to get to the end.  The change of perspective in the second book is the most creative technique I've seen in fantasy writing.  Once again at first I was almost put off, but loved the first book so much that I pressed right on and quickly became enamored of the second story teller.  The third book and payoff sometimes can be a let down after a great buildup.  Not in this story.  It builds to a great cresendo and delivers a mighty payoff that in no way disappoints.  Great writing Ms. McKillip!  Thanks for a wonderful journey that I've enjoyed several times over the years and probably will reread again soon.
