 The most original movie I've seen in a few years.  I love the subtlety that Polanski uses.  Far superior to Eyes Wide Shut and Stigmata.  This is one of those films that you can watch over and over and catch something new each time you rewatch it. This one will stay with you after you watch it for a few days.  As others have said, beautiful cinematography.  Great characters.  Great settings and mood.  Just enough quirkyness, but not too much.  Like a journey through a darker looking glass.
