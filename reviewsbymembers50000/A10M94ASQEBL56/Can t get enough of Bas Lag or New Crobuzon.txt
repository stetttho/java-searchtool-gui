 Just finished this.  I give it **** out of five stars.  Although I rated it the same as The Scar, I consider it just slightly less interesting. BTW, does anyone know of a website that contains a map of Bas-Lag?  I know only New Crobuzon has been included in the first book.  Would love to see anyone's attempt at showing more of Bas-Lag.  This book continues the pattern set forth in the first two Bas-Lag books.  The settings and world is a more likeable and interesting character than any of the people in the book.  Mieville is the first author I've read that can get me interested in his stories even though I don't like any of the characters and can't really get into rooting for any of them to overcome their crisis.  The idea of Golem magic. The idea of society following a train and laying tracks as they go The idea of the Cacotopic stain area The city of New Crobuzon and all its different, unique areas and societies. The idea of the monks of the Moments  These are what hold my interest.
