 I read this right after Slaughterhouse Five.  What amazed me was how I was putty in Vonnegut's hands.  I hated Campbell in Slaughterhouse Five, really didn't want to read a book about him, but loved Vonnegut so tried it.  He  made me totally sypmpathic to Campbell, which I thought impossible.  The  man is a grand master!
