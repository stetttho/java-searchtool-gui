 I'm looking forward to the next two books in the trilogy.  Great read.  Hooked me from the first page.  If you liked the story in the movie Skeleton Key, you'll like this story.  Eden is a great main character, and I always love characters who interact with ghosts.  The use of a variation of the "hand of glory" was very effective horror.
