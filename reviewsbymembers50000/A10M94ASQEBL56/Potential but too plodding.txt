 I found sections of this story riveting, but everytime I thought momentum was building it would return to a plodding pace. Great idea.  Good characters and creatures.  But way too many plodding sections for my tastes.  Reminds me of the Soldier in the Mists/Arete books.  If you enjoyed that style you will probably enjoy this one. For me, not as tightly written as the New Sun/Long Sun/Short Sun books.  Those always had me on the edge of my seat.
