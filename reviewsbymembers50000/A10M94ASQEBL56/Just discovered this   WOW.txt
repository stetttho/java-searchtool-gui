 I like to say that in 1971 I become musically aware.  I was into hard driving rock mainly, although I did like some of the softer C,S,N & Y stuff.  I only knew Van Morrison by Tupelo Honey and Brown Eyed Girl.  I put him in the Neil Diamond category. Ok to listen to at times, but I'd be embarrassed to tell my friends I liked him.  Too pop.  Then recently I began to hear a song I had never heard.  And It Stoned Me.  I loved it and began to wonder if there was more to Van Morrison than I had been led to believe.  Saw this album in Borders under the "Classic Albums" category and picked it up.  Wow!  What a great album!  Besides Stoned Me, I love Into the Mystic, Crazy Love and many others.  Glad its not to late for me to catch up on what made Van Morrison a great artist.
