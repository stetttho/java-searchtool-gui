 I picked this up after reading about it in the bios after Brando's death.  Great flick. Malden vs. Brando scenes are fantastic.  Malden makes such a great complex villian and Brando ranks right up there with James Dean as the ultimate rebel. Several stories in one flick. The friendship of Brando and the Mexican he excapes with. The revenge story. The pyschoanalysis of Malden's character and what happens to someone who betrays, not just a one dimensional character. The Slim Pickens vs. Brando subplot. The whole Ben Johnson bank robbery aspect. The love story.  Unlike other reviews I read here, I thought Brando's love interest gave an excellent performance.  I'm glad the film resisted the cliches of Malden's final shot ..... killing one of the main characters at the end.
