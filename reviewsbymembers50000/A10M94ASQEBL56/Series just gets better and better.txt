 In this book Lemony Snicket seems to really hit his stride.  The mystery of VFD for the last several books continues to build anticipation here.  Even though Count Olaf gets little page time, his page time here is my favorite so far.  I loved the "cool" theme.  I like seeing the children grow up and not stay locked at a single age forever.  The entire setting of the village kept me engrossed.  I wanted to know more and more about this strange "guardian", where as normally after the introduction of the guardian you know everything about them.  Great story telling!
