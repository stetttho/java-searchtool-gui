 This book addicted me to searching for Jonathan Carroll's books forever.  After Silence and Sleeping in Flames cemented the addiction :)  I had a hard time stopping reading, wanting to get to the end and understand the mystery.  Definitely a gripping book.  Hard to talk about it without giving too much away.  Read the cover blurb.  Read the book and enjoy the adventure for yourself.
