 If you've never heard Warren Zevon's Mutineer you're in for a real treat.  Beautiful song. Much better than the good cover by Bob Dylan on the Enjoy Every Sandwich tribute album.  Great collection.  Zevon shows his genius by making the music match the lyrics.  In Mutineer listen closely to the percussion to see how he makes it simulate the pitch and yaw of a boat on the ocean.  Also the seagull squaks are perfectly placed.  At the end of Roland The Headless Thompson Gunner, listen for the simulation of a machine gun burst at the end.  The man was greatly talented!  And this collection displays it.
