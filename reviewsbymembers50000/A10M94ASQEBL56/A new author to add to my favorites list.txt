 I've just discovered China Mieville and after reading so many rave reviews of The Scar and Perdido Street Station decided to go out and pick up those books.  I noticed King Rat and although I had not heard anything about it, I recently read Neverwhere and enjoyed it.  Since this book seemed to have a similar theme and setting I took a chance on it. Great read! The story was drawing me in, anyway, but once it revealed that it was a dark retelling of a myth, I knew I was hooked.  I've always enjoyed stories that either purport to tell you the *real* story behind the myth, or attempt to bring characters from a myth into modern times. Great characters.  The three kings were very well done.  The Piper was one of the best villians I've read.  Saul seemed to avoid feeling cliche-ish as he "comes of age". Can't wait to check out more Mieville.
