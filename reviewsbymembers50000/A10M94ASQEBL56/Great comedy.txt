 Goldblum, Graff, Scott-Thomas all have excellent chemistry. This one will delight! I've been trying to find the soundtrack to this or at least the artist and title of the music with the tingle-ing bells.  On my recorded copy the credits are so small and blurry haven't had much luck.  And no soundtrack seems available.
