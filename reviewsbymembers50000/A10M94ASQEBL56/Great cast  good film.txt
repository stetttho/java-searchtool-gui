 Just watched Runaway Jury on DVD.  I give it **** out of five stars.  What I liked about it: Great cast - One of Cusack's better roles.  Weisz reminded me of Maryann Mastrantonio in Color of Money.  Quite a change from her roles in The Mummy series.  Jeremy Piven always shines when given the chance. Good storyline  What I didn't like about it:  SPOILER WARNING****  4/5th of the way through I felt like I was watching a plot that was very innovative.  The ending seemed cliche.  Expected the unexpected, not former victims wanting justice type of ending (almost a Disney, the good guys win in the end, type ending).  Not a bad ending, just not up to the level of writing displayed up to that point.
