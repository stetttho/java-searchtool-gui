 That seems to be the byline on this one.  I even bought a book of Arthurian legend but it didn't help much.  Yet even without understanding exactly what happened this book kept me on the edge of my seat.  A very  good ride, even if you don't know where you are going.  This book, more than any other, taught me to enjoy the journey with Wolfe and quit rushing to find out what happens in the end.
