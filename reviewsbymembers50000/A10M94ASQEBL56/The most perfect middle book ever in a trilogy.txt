 In most trilogy's when you read the second book, all you can think about is getting to the third and final book to find out what is going on.  In this book, you enjoy the journey so much you don't care that it doesn't  have all the answers.  The Keep in the desert, the Elowhim, the One Tree,  awesome story!!!
