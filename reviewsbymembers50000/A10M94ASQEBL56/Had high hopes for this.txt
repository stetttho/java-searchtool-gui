 I hated it. 150 pages into, he is still setting up the characters, with no action.  I usually only give a book 70-80 pages to grab me, but because of Mr Campbell's reputation pressed on.  By the 150th page of mundane book store politics and everyday life stuff I didn't care anymore (shrug).  Perhaps the last half of the book is excellent.  I'll never know.
