 Just finished watching The Hitcher II on DVD. I give it *** out of five stars. Good homage to the original. What I liked about it: Kari Wuhrer - always solid. She almost made me like Sliders. Almost. Jake Busey - I was afraid he would give the same over-the-top performance as in The Frighteners. Instead he was very subdued. He's no Rutger Hauer but he came close to some of his daddy's more subdued roles. It didn't try to be more than it was. Just a homage, not really a sequel to the great original film. Didn't over reach itself. What I didn't like about it: C. Thomas Howell - had a really poorly written role. I didn't mind them turning the story over to Kari, but expected more maturety and self confidence out of Howell's role after the way he had grown in the first film. To have him scarred was fine but to have him afraid was out of character.
