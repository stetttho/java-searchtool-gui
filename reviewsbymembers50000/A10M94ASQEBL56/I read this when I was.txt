 and as far as I remember, this was the first book I read that made me laugh out loud.  Prior to this I had only seen Groucho on reruns of his game show and really didn't see the big deal.  This book made me start watching his movies and truely appreciating the man.  Later I rewatched the gameshow (can't remember the name of it now, just remember that duck with the word of the day hanging from above) and caught more of Groucho's subtle ribbing of guests.  I enjoyed the jokes in this book, as well as, the true affection for his brothers that can be read in between the lines.
