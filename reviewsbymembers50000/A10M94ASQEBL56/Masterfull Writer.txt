 It's always nice to find another reliable scifi author.  I enjoyed King Rat very much so dove right into Perdido Street Station after finishing it.  Great read! As others have said, the city is the star of the book.  New Crobuzon is a fascinating place with fascinating "species" (although all the species are really humans). When I see a book about a new "world" with a very complex map at the beginning, I prepare myself to be overwhelmed with learning the different peoples and places of that world.  But Mieville never made me feel uncomfortable.  He writes so fluidly and is so easy and enjoyable to read, that I was able to relax and let him slowly introduce me to the peoples and places.  I never felt like info dump overload. Another mark I give to Mieville is that usually I need to like at least one character in a book strongly, and be able to identify with them and want them to "win".  But in this book I would find myself filled with a great desire for the "good guys" to win, but then would think, "Wait.  Who are the good guys?"  I didn't particularly like any of the characters.  Didn't dislike them, just didn't identify with them.  It was the city of Crobuzon that I found myself rooting for.  And whether it was a man, a garuda, a vodynoia, a weaver, rebels, militia, handlings, etc.  I found I was rooting for "the city" to survive and win. On the one hand I would like to know more about: deamons weavers vodynoa society including undines the forrest the southlands On the other hand I admire an author that can write a great work without turning it into endless sequels that lose more and more of the wonder as they go on.  So not sure if I want China to write a sequel or not. True scifi fans will definitely enjoy this one.  Reminds me of when I discovered Hyperion by Dan Simmons in 1990.  Something unique and wonderful.
