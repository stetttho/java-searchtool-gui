 I struggled with what to rate this book.  All of the first 2 series I rated either 4 or 5 stars.  By rating this 3 stars I feared that I would be sending the message that this book is a dissapointment and it is nothing of the kind.  I think I am struggling with the loss of wonder in the land due to The Masters and Kevin's Dirt.  I felt the same way when I first read The Wounded Land, but on rereading later, raised its rating so perhaps I'll end up doing the same for this book after the series is complete.  What I liked about it: More indepth treatments of creatures that weren't covered as deeply in the first two series. -The Ramen -The Ranyhan -The urViles -even more indepth treatment of the Haruchai  And new interesting new characters like -Anele -Esmer  I thought I would really miss Thomas Covenant himself, but Linden Avery is a very worthy successor.  I resisted her in the Wounded Land but by The One Tree she had already won my heart.  I've always felt like Thomas C. was the most approachable hero I've ever read.  Very easy to identify him.  A great creation by Donaldson.  Look forward to the next three books!
