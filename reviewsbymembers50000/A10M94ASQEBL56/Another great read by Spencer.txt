 Wish he would write more books.  I discovered him in the pages of Fantasy & Science Fiction magazine and ran right out and got Resume With Monsters and Zod Wallop.  Loved them both then read Irrational Fears, my favorite of his.  Picked up his short story collection The Return of Count Electric and throughly enjoyed it also.  I waited several years for this one, hoping to find it on a bookstore shelf.  Finally ordered it from Amazon.  You can see a lot of the elements here that he reused and refined in later novels.  Very captivating characters and storyline.  One personal judgement:  I identify with the main characters in a book while reading and if I don't like any of them, usually do not enjoy the book or stop reading it.  For me the mark of an excellent writer is when I don't personally like any of the characters and still want to know what happens to them.  Mr. Spencer.  Please don't stop writing or resume if you have stopped!
