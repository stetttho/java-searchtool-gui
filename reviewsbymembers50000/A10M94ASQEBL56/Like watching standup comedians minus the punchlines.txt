 I really wanted to like this film.  I almost always enjoy the actors that were assembled, some of them great humorists.  But in this film there is lots of buildup with no punchlines.  I don't think I can remember one really funny scene or line. Hackman, Paltrow and Huston chew up the scenary and are always a joy to watch.  Ben Stiller and Bill Murray were totally wasted.  Luke Wilson was the only one that was given a role in which he could cut loose, yet he doesn't  have the comedic ability that Stiller does and could not do much with it.  I think the funniest moments were given by Kumar Pallana.  Who would have thought that Hackman/Stiller would yield so much fewer laughs than Deniro/Stiller.  Not me.
