 This is Stephen at his best.  For me it even tops the first Mansasas album. Creative.  Great song writing.  Great story telling.  Beautiful music. It's a shame that Stephen is mostly unknown amoung today's music fans as his music has dropped off the radar screens of just about all radio stations out there.  And he never made videos.
