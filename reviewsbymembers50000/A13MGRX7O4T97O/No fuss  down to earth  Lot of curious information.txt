 I'd say, if you want to kill yourself some time soon, that book will help you to pick the most efficient method. If you plan to "make a gesture" it'll prevent you from going overboard and actually killing yourself instead of simply striking a posture as intended.  Otoh, if you don't intend anything as dramatic, then still one can pick a lot of amazing information and stats from it, plus it's very easy to read, contains no hifalutin touchy-feely sermonizing whatsoever, could be somewhat helpful in discerning if anyone around you has set his mind on a premarure departure (though it's by no means a main focus of the book), so all in all, I'd say it's a curious book and at the very least is bound to gratify every man's natural curiosity about this somewhat macabre topic. The book looks thicker than it is because of the bibliography and notes. There's a lot of notes in it, just as interesting as the text itself. The author expresses himself with a kind of dry humor that makes the book even more readable. Not a must-read, but the appropriately curious will not be disappointed.
