 A good book, but to my taste, too brief. Too expensive for what it is as well. However, the title is very appropriate, so I can't complain -- it is exactly what a brief is; the only thing I can say is, do not mistake this book for an introduction. But well written though: concise yet understandable, a very good, even pleasant read. I only wish it were more extensive; I'll check if there's perchance a normal vector calculus book by the same author; if there is, I'll get it.  Do I recommend it? To those who truly need a brief, yes. Everyone else should carefully check it out before buying.
