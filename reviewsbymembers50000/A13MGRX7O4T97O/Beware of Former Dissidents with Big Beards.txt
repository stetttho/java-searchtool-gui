 This small book consists of two-three lectures bound together, a quick and easy read. The topic is that access to power and influence frequently changes people in unpleasant ways, and that the Russian chattering classes (a.k.a. 'intelligentsia') known for their perpetual jabbering about truth and justice are far from immune to that problem. This fundamental observation is entirely correct, even if banal.  Sinyavsky's treatment of the topic is, however, superficial, fragmented, and at times unobjective: for example, when lambasting Yeltsin for sending tanks against his opposition in '93 he completely ignores the fact that it was the opposition who started the mayhem by sending roving bands of armed goons into the streets, and that any government, as long as it could help it, would respond to such a challenge forcefully. If Sinyavsky doesn't know this, he should do his research; if he does know this, then he's twisting matters.  I don't think this booklet will be majorly instructive to the Western reader (who won't be able to put it all in the right context), although it may be of some interest to pre-perestroika Soviet emigr?s -- people whose background enables them to relate to, but who hadn't personally lived through the social upheavals of the 90s in Russia.
