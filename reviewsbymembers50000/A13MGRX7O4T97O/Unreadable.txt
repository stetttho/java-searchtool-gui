 The author seems knowledgeable in the area he covers, but, unfortunately, can't write: there isn't one clear paragraph in the whole book, not one coherent chapter -- this book reads like a transcript of a mental patient's ranting: disjointed and random, ungrammatical, having no logical structure, no direction; with concepts used w/o being defined before (or after!); wrong words used all the time (or, alternatively, missing a word now and then) -- all in all, a sizeable load of jibberish that's torture to parse and impossible to understand.  Even vector math itself is not defined!  The author, if he must write at all, should team up with a competent technical writer, maybe as a coauthor, especially since the publisher (Wordware) doesn't seem keen on providing an adequate editorial contribution. Until this happens, this author is to be avoided. The same goes for the publisher: they surfaced only a few years ago and since that time I've checked out quite a few of their books; haven't seen any good ones so far.  PS. Btw, I suspect that the review below is the author's promo blurb posted by a friend; the reason I think so is that it repeats, practically verbatim, a fairly baseless claim that is also made on the author's own website (as of April 21, 2006), in his resume. I quote, " It [the book] ... contained real life code samples that one could use within their applications, not made up nonsense code you usually find." If you look at the Amazon page for another Leiterman book -- "32/64-bit 80x86 Assembly Language Architecture" (as unreadable as this one, btw) -- you'll notice that the very first reviewer there makes pretty much the same claim: must be yet another flunkey willing to re-post someone else's advertising copy as a genuine review.  (The idea itself is patently false of course; I own many assembly books and it hasn't been my impression that samples there routinely consist of "made up nonsense code". Quite the opposite, actually.)
