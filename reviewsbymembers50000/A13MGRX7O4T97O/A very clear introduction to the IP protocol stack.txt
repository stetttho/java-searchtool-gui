 Here's what one needs to know when considering purchasing this book:  1. It is introductory (absolutely so; if you've worked with IP for, say, a year, you'll have nothing to learn from it). This book is a quintessential IP-networking 101 _textbook_.  2. It is written with exceptional clarity.   3. It is comprehensive (within its scope).  4. It is very well made: large print; clear and clean, appropriate illustrations; good binding.  At the same time:  1. Although it is frequently mentioned alongside Stevens' books, it is nowhere near as indepth or insightful as they are.  2. It is not programming oriented. At all.  3. It is slightly mistitled: it is not about internetworking (meaning dealing with networks), it is about the IP and IP-based protocols. There's an awful lot more to the topic of networking than just knowing the IP protocol stack.  4. For what it is, the price is unconscionable (therefore four, rather than five, stars). A half of that would be about right.  The bottom line: this is a good book, a discounted copy of which any beginner would do well to acquire.
