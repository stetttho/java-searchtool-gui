 If you've been programming Windows for about a year, that's a good book, especially if you're about to dabble in sockets programming. But if you've been working with Windows for years, this book is of no use whatsoever--most of the stuff you probably already know, while those few truly new items that it touches upon, it covers inadequately. A couple of examples: IP helper library and RAS client. All you have on these very mysterious API areas is a lame rehash of what's available (for free) on MSDN. The MSDN docs are confusing and inconsistent, yet this book doesn't make it any better. So what use is it? So, I have to say it's one of those orange-cover series super-superficial books that cover everything and nothing at the same time. If interested, peruse it in a bookstore first. I bet you'll put it back on the shelf.
