 Total failure that's worse than bad: it's poisonous, it'll infest your brain with a zillion musical cliches of the worst kind. There's not one listenable track on this album, everything is grossly derivative (and what they derive from! Gee... some pieces sound like Michael Bolton or, at best, Rod Stewart), insipid, artificial... orchestration is invariably vapid -- yet pretentious; gone are the days of the lovely, squirming B3 -- now it's massive synths (yeech!!!! very opera!) plus massive guitar onanism by Mr Vai, who, when his days on this earth are over, I hope will be buried with a whammy bar up his a$$. And maybe the H300 harmonizer  -- and whatever else he uses to make his guitar pour forth this kind of totally inhumane whistle/dry-fart Czerny scale progressions that he obviously thinks is THE acme of guitar music. You'd think Coverdale at least would've known better... Well, tastes differ, but "a rock and roll band with a mean and dirty blues guitar" it ain't. Very, very poor... a clear failure; stay away.  If you're new to WS, get "Come and Get It" and "Saints and Sinners" -- and stop there, don't listen to anything else. David Coverdale is a *very* talented singer, but as a songwriter he doesn't cut the mustard, sorry;in all these years after splitting from Deep Purple, he's produced two good records -- and, apparently, got exhausted. If memory serves, Geffen records dropped him after this clunker (no wonder, I say.)
