 The only thing I've learned from this book is that in his letters Hemingway made a lot of spelling errors and ignored punctuation. As to the subject matter itself, if what's gathered up in this little collection is all he had to say about writing, I'm not sure why someone bothered to produce this book: there's absolutely nothing interesting in it. I'm not a fan of Hemingway's, but so what -- I've read interesting books on writing from other authors whose works I don't care for (e.g., Henry Miller, or Stephen King); this book's a total bore though.
