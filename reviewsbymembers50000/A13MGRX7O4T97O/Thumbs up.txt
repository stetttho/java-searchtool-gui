 Friendly, encyclopedic, talkative; a great book. Mr Hamming comes across not only as a knowledgeable, experienced, and generous specialist but also as a good writer and a very likeable individual in general; I'm going to read more of his books now. If I were to nitpick, it'd say that the book could slightly benefit from extra editing -- there are a few places where the phrasing is awkward and unclear at first. But that's nitpicking, overall it's very well done.  I can't add anything terribly original to what the others here said other than to add one more voice in praise of this book. At Dover prices, get five copies and give to your buddies -- they'll thank you.  Absolutely without reservations - recommended
