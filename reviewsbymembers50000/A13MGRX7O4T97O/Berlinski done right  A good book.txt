 This is an intelligent popular-math book with the stress on the popularizing side; well written, insightful, enlightening. Probably too wordy for the reader with a decent math background (I'm not speaking of PhD in math, only someone like, say, a motivated college freshman), but great for a curious dabbler at the high-school level. I was tempted to skip a few times, but overall found it interesting -- for one, at last I've found an understandable justification of why a negative number times negative number results in a positive number, a problem that has always caused me mental discomfort.  All in all, it's a curious book to read when you have time: not a must, but decent and worthy. Recommended.
