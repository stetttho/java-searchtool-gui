 One thing you probably want to know about this book is that it is actually a compendium of excerpts from his other pieces (mostly), so to a Miller junkie there's very little new in it. An essay on writing that is not cut out of anything else is available in another book of his (The Wisdom of the Heart?) so you might want to go for that one instead of the "On Writing" book. Overall, as always, Miller is passionate, opinionated, and if you've never read his whole oeuvre -- or have an interest specifically in his thoughts about writing squeezed out and presented separately -- this may prove an interesting collection.
