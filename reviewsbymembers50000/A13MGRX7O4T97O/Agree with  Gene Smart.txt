 Gene's right on the money; nothing to add to his review. I think it's better to skip this book, for if you don't, it'll create a lot of unnecessary confusion in your mind that would never appear otherwise. This is especially so if you're a beginner and thus are unlikely to simply dismiss the stuff as muddled nonsense, as a more seasoned reader would be confident enough to do.   I have to say that in general, the latest crop of C++ books isn't any good; although quite a few have been published within the last two-three years, after the Vandevoorde templates book I haven't seen anything worthwhile -- the impression I have is that a growing number of people want to "make a name" for themselves in the C++ area, but, unfortunately, don't have much to say: they either belabour dull minutiae, or simply manufacture nonsense. BS and a couple of guys around him are Gods worthy, as ever, of our Worship -- but this "also-run" crowd... Trotsky would call them "epigones" :-)  ... c'mon guys, quit scribbling, take a break. Remember what we ought to do when we have nothing good to say... Of course, publishers need to publish something to make money, but we don't have to buy, and most importantly, read everything that's out there. Be selective, for life is short.
