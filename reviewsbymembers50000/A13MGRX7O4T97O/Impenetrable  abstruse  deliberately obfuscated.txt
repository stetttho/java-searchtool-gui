 Having read Beger's "Invitation to Sociology" I felt sufficiently enthused and bought his "Construction of Reality". Oh boy. Was that an error on my part! Here, Berger is nearly impenetrable from the very beginning and throughout, the text structure is mind boggling (it's never quite clear what the author is talking about, and *why* he addresses what he addresses, and why here and not some other place; a profusion of very slippery expressions (Something or other "is not empirically available" for example; seems like this "empirically available" is one of his favourite expressions, and it *is* sort of glibly striking, but what exactly does it mean? Many occurrences of such stuff... a lot of ponderous latinizing -- "ipso facto", "sui generis", "mutatis mutandis", someone "qua" something, etc. -- annoying and uncalled for; it is highly reminiscent of the logorrheaic prolixity typical of psychoanalytic writing of the same time (60s) or perhaps an imitation of translated philosophical German.  All Berger's writing here (as everywhere else) is purely expository, there is no shade of argument present anywhere; if something is less than self-evident to you, that's your problem, I suppose. While "The Invitation..." itself (first five chapters, that is) was not bad, "The Construction of Reality..." is just plain gobbledegook, purposely (I suspect) rendered incomprehensible in order to make it look profound. And even when you do -- at the cost of a huge mental effort, highlighting, paraphrazing, and drawing lines and circles on the pages -- uncover some vague semblance of a possible meaning, it invariably turns out either trivial or highly questionable. What's interesting is that, following Berger's bibliography, I moved on to Weber, and turns out, sociology CAN be written logically, concisely, and clearly. What a pleasing surprise.
