 One good track ("Hungry for Love") and a couple of tasty passages in other songs; the rest, a bunch of annoying musical cliches + _excrutiatingly_ silly lyrics. The title track is unbearable, so unoriginal musically and goofy overall it is; I wish I could understand how some on this page actually found it the best piece. This album is a clear failure; WS in general has never been a very creative band; I think they've only produced two good records: "Come and Get It" and "Saints and Sinners" -- to which I recommend you limit your Whitesnake exposure. Don't spoil the impression by exposing yourself to very derivative and adulterated variations on the same theme -- of which this album is one. Not recommended.
