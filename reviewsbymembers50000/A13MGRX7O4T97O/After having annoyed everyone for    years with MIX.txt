 the Good Professor updates his joke: MMIX, MIX's supposedly "risky" evolutionary progeny -- every bit as useless as its parent -- is upon us, ladies and gentlemen.  Btw, Dear Reader, while we're here: check the reviews page of the below two reviewers ("W.Boudville" and "Erik Kent"). Do you think these people actually read what they review? Notice the number of reviews they do per day, every day, since the beginning of time, and whether the reviews tend to be all five-star ones. Both look like they're hired by someone to post fake reviews here, all very positive and looking like commercial promos. What a shame.
