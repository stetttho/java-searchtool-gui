 I could never understand why this book is considered a masterpiece and why it seems to retain this, thoroughly undeserved in my view, status after more than a century after having been written. It's truly, TRULY boring and very artificial; not a single protagonist appears to be a live, real person; the whole things feels like one overlong, unbearably sanctimonious sermon. Moreover, if you've read other books by this preachifying idiot (I have), you'll notice that they all share these qualities: contrived and sermonizing.  This is one of those "gotta have read" books that I should have given a pass. Oh well, who knew...
