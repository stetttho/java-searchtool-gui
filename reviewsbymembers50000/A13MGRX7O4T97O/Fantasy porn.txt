 The best illustration is on the cover; insides are mostly one-color pencil drawings; laughably pretentious text; the stuff's mostly well-drawn, but as they used to say, very bourgeois -- and overall nothing special. Definitely not art; as pr0n, eh... babes and monsters's always good, OK, three erections out of five. Oh yeah, sprinkled throughout the book are smallish pictures by some other Royo -- these are unrelated to the theme and style; I didn't like them, I didn't hate them: I don't know why they're there.
