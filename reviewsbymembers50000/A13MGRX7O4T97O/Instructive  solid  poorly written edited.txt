 I'll add more a bit later, but for now I can say that the book deals with all the right stuff, explains exactly what I happen to need at the moment (I bought it a while ago, but got to it only now). A good book overall, and a rare one at that (I don't know of anything equivalent; maybe Messmer's PC hardware book is somewhat similar but not as indepth on that particular topic).   There's, however, one thing that irritates me: the text is extremely poorly written. The quantity of typos, grammatical and useage errors is mind boggling; writing (to nitpick) is awkward at times, redundant and too wordy. The author seems to be trying to really lay it all out (which I appreciate) but he does it ineptly, and frequently makes it actually worse : his repetitive descriptions begin to contradict one another, at least they seem to to me. I would recommend to peruse the interrupts-related sections in the Messmer book first -- if you're comfortable with the basics, McGivern's book will go way more easily.   I would also like to commend the author of the previous review, it is right on the money -- I bet he's an engineer: he is specific, he knows what he's talking about, and he can't speak English -- must be an engineer! :-))) OK, back to the book: it's fundamentally good and I can wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who deals with -- or maybe only wants to learn out of general curiosity -- interrupt handling with 8259.
