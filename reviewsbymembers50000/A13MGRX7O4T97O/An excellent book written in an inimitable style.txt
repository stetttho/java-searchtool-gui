 An amazing combination of clarity and undergrad-level simplicity; not too quick, not too slow; not too terse, not too wordy -- just exactly right, and a pleasure to read in addition (and I'm not into math, I just needed to study up on the subject). The sense of intellectual comfort I derive from this book is incredible and very unusual; Tolstov is clearly a wonderful teacher and Silverman did us all a great service picking this book for his series; the translation is very good too, very smooth).  If you need anything Fourier and know calculus, do yourself a favor and start from this book. (I mean self-study; how it may fit into this or that particular formal curriculum I don't know.)   Recommended w/o reservations.
