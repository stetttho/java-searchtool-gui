 A motherlode of factual material; objective, well justified exposition; very well written: consistently logical, precise, coherent -- a perfect book for an unhurried, attentive read (not difficult though). It's definitely more enlightening that Tarkovsky's own disjointed ramblings in Sculpting in Time. Critical? I wouldn't say that it's overly so... otoh, it's definitely not a piece of hagiography. I've enjoyed every single page in this very good book. Recommended.
