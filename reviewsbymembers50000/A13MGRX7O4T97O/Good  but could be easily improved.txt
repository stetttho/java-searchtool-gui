 Overall this is a good read: an unhurried, talkative introduction into statistics for total laymen with no more than some school math under their belts. However, I feel that the quality of writing goes down markedly beginning with the section on sampling distribution: from there the book becomes sloppy and hasty; crippled phrases and typos appear, days are constantly mistaken for samples, motivation is frequently unclear, and so on -- reading becomes guessing/deciphering/reverse engineering.   I think that with a very little additional editing effort the book can be made much better. Though it's not bad as is, especially the first half: it really makes you understand what's what in statistics; I'm glad I've read it and hope for a cleaned-up second edition.
