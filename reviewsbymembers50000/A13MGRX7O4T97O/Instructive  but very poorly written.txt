 What saves this book is that it comes with source code. The text itself is completely helpless, confusing in the extreme -- make one fleeting pass over it and move on to the source: from that you'll learn without mental torment. The author's a knowledgeable guy, but not a writer at all; and of course, being published by a shoddy outfit R&D (now CMP), he obviously didn't get any editorial assistance.   Recommended though (for beginners ; not necessarily embedded or real-time neophytes -- anyone dabbling into OS construction will find the simple but functional code here instructive).
