 Whatever positive qualities this book might have are totally lost behind a thick wall of pretentious and spurious verbiage that Mr Berlinsi probably thinks is sublime and intellectual, but in reality is laughable drivel. The book is less idiotic than his Tour of Calculus, but still unbearable. Someone please persuade this graphomaniacal pretentious moron to quit scribbling and take an honest job.
