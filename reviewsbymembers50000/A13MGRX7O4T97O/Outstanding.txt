 Don't get distracted by the "operating manual for toothbrush" review below: it's a very useful little book. Yes, some information can be gathered online, and even on Google itself--but not all. I'm a fairly knowledgeable Internet user yet I've found a number of options in this book that I didn't know of before (even though I *have* read Google's online Help.) Moreover, a lot of people actually *are* "rubes" as far as the Internet, and there's nothing wrong with that, or with giving them a pocket-size guide where everything they need to know is gathered up in one place and described clearly and in a readable, systematic format. But the book is more than just that though--like I've said, I'm no rube here, yet I've found this little guide rather illuminating. Good book, good price: what else? Recommended for any Google user (is there still anyone who's not?) Get it.
