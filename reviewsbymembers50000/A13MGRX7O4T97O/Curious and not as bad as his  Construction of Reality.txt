 Still the book is recondite and frequently bewildering: highlighters, sticky notes, and drawing shapes on the pages await the reader determined to get to the bottom of it; be prepared to belabour this book.  The topic is interesting, and so the book does possess a certain value, in my opinion. It would be much better were it not for Berger's highly convoluted and artificially obscured writing style. To attempt to be more specific about this: "Canopy" not as bad as his "Construction of Reality" (which is impenetrable), but still more abstruse than the best chapters of his "Invitation to Sociology". Check it out yourself before buying; I thought it's worthy, though flawed.
