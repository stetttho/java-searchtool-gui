 I've used it for reviewing the calculus and it's simply excellent. All I can say is I wish I had learned the calculus from this textbook when I learned it the first time (which was long ago).   The order of topics is very natural, all topics are first introduced intuitively (slow, so it comfortably settles in your brain), with a following transition to a rigorous restatement of the same problem; small but adequate historical/biographical notes; unhurried pace overall; detailed solutions to a number of practical examples right inside the chapters, inline so to say; a good number of graduated-difficulty problems after the chapters (some with answers at the end of the book); appendixes with compact reviews of extraneous but needed material (like trigonometry and complex numbers, for example); the book is very well produced -- pretty, clear, lots of good pictures, with special sections for computer algebra systems (optional, not necessary for understanding the material, but awfully helpful if you have access to Derive, Maple, or Mathematica) -- all, all is just wonderful. You truly won't need another book for the basic (single-variable) calculus: work through this one and you'll be well equipped to move on to a "second-year calculus" texbook (multivariate).  I see that some reviewers here complained that the book isn't really helpful for self-study: well, honestly, I can't be categorical here because I'd studied calculus in the past, however! It's been quite some time ago and I have since forgotten all but the very basics, and even those were rather vague. And coming to this book with this, although not totally lacking, but very, very shaky foundation I've found reading this book easy. So, if I had to take a guess, I would respectfully disagree with the below critique and venture to say that the book actually *is* good for the first-time learner and suitable for self-study. I wholeheartedly recommend it, at least give it a try -- I bet you'll like it.
