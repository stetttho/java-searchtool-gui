 Well, it is The Standard in printed form. You'll probably want to have it. There's nothing to say about the contents itself as you probably know what it is (the $18 version you can buy online is NOT the standard; it's one of the preliminary documents rather [although it's probably good for most of what you'll need]; the real standard IS offered online as well, but you'll pay through the nose for it; I don't remember what it is, but it ain't $18.) And so this book is OK if you need a printed copy (which, even if you're not a compiler writer but still work with C++ a lot, you do.)  Now, about the complaints below about the outrageously inferiour quality of the binding -- I whole-heartedly second them. My copy has already fallen apart, thank you very much (and again, I'm not into compilers.) This is yet another proof of the fact that Wiley is an obnoxious publisher; to me, seeing their imprint on the first page has been a turnoff for a very long time now. Overpriced and mediocre are the two words that immediately pop in mind; quite the opposite from Addison-Wesley, Morgan Kaufmann, or O'Reilly, who in most cases are perfect; even the uneven and frequently disappointing Prentice Hall beats Wiley by a huge margin. Just think of it: how difficult is it to publish a goddamn standard? No writing, no editing, no illustration, no bibliography -- it's a printing job, nothing more; how do you manage to screw *this* up? I pray to god they go out of business.  Still, you probably want it, even though it *will* fall apart. Maybe, have it rebound by someone, I don't know.
