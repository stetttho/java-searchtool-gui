 A clearly written book on programming in assembly for Windows. What I meant by 'misdirected' is that the main focus here is how to write Windows programs in assembly (using the Windows API -- like Petzold, only in ASM), whereas a book on assembly programming _in the Windows environment_ (but w/o the stress on the API) would have been better. After all, who needs assembly to read a file or create a window or open a socket. When you need to search a sizeable buffer with unpredictable contents for a pattern hundred times a second -- that's where you may need assembly. It's not related to the GUI infrastructure, but it'll run in the specific OS environment: that's what I'd like to read about.  Other than that, no complaints though: the book is good. Probably not a must, but good.  (It's true that downloadable source for this book is nowhere to be found, but the code is so simple there that I don't feel it's a noticeable flaw.)  PS. At the same time, I disagree with "a reader" from Florida (review above): a programming book should certainly come with the digital version of the code used in the book -- especially these days when it costs nothing, all it takes is to post it on the net somewhere.
