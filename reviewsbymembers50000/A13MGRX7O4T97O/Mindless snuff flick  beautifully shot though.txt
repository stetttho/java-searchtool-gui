 For two hours a man is being beaten, whipped, and abused in other ways. Anyone would expire half way through the proceedings. Not one religious thought during all this time: instead, it's a macabre comics book of a movie. It's not really gruesome, btw, contrary to what is frequently said: it is so over the top with the splashing blood that the portrayal of brutality loses any effect very soon.   Like I've said, the movie is beautifully shot. The idea to make them speak dead languages with subtitles is actually good, though I can't quite put my finder on exactly why. But I liked it. Although many people mention this, I have not noticed anything antisemitic in the film.   Acting is melodramatic, over the top, and in general lacking -- as is the story (at least as we know it). If you show this movie to someone who hasn't read the Bible, he won't understand what it's about. Overall, one nagging question: why was it made? What did the author want to say?
