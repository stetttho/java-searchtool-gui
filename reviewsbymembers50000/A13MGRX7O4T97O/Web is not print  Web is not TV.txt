 Whoever manages to persuade the bushy tailed graphics designer crowd of the above will have fully deserved a Nobel Prize. The book consists of very pretty screen shots, and as such makes a great coffee table piece. Seriously. Very pretty, most of it.  However, it's supposedly about the web. OK, so it goes as usual: Most of the sites in the book use Flash (with a vengeance), and all are very heavily graphical. Very, very pretty... in print. And let me share a terrible secret: whenever I run into stuff like that in the real life -- via modem, on computer display, tick-tock, tick-tock, 25 images left, download time 5 mins... -- I use the "Skip Intro..." button as soon as it can be discerned on screen ('course that only kills the Flash stuff.) 'nuf said -- for any web-related purposes this graphics design show-off book is useless.
