 Very interesting, but takes enourmous effort to understand; not an easy read to say the least. If you're sufficiently motivated, the book will be rewarding; if you have no more than a casual interest, skip it. Plus it's a translation, not a bad one, but still the fact of being converted from one language to another adds to the overall difficulty, I feel.   Recommended to the right reader (but, one more time: be prepared to struggle with mind-bogglingly incoherent writing).  PS. The binding is shoddy -- some pages fell out even before I got to them.
