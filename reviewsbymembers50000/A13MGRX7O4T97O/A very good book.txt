 To the author of the negative review below: next time pay attention to the title -- which happens to be "Numerical Computation", not "Numerical Analysis" -- and don't blame others vor your own ignorance -- the book is totally as advertized, slanted toward computation, not math. The book is very good, btw, friendly, detailed, extensive, covers all bases; it's perfect for self-study. Not badly translated, either. Just ignore the first review here; it's totally off the wall.
