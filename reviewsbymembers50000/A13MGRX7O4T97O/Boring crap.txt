 The only thing I like about this album is the cover. The music itself is artificial, a collection of mechanically connected uninspired cliches + Coverdale's trademark moaning and grunting that comes out rather forced on this record. Whitesnake had produced only two decent albums, Come and Get It, and Saints and Sinners -- confirmed once more. Oh well...
