 The record presents the oboe very well. Price can't be beat too. Oboe music is always enjoyable (well, that's somewhat subjective, of course, but if you like oboe, you'll like this collection).  Just a small caution: this is a study aid sort of thing. I find listening to chunks of music -- frequently very familiar ones -- somewhat dissatisfying. In other words, this is a perfect CD for teaching kids the orchestra, but if you simply want some oboe music for pleasure, then I'd recommend to pick something else; for example "The Handel Collection" (a pretty old record), by The City of London Sinfonia (cond. John Rutter), 1990 American Gramaphone Records -- it is a collection too, but not excerpts, pieces are played fully, and the performance is sometimes better. It's just one example; I have it handy so I've mentioned it, that's all. I don't like listening to excerpts, that's what I'm trying to say. But I'm not saying this CD's bad, it's very good for orchestra studies.
