 Having returned to Miller after a long hiatus, I've found him significantly less impressive than in my youth; especially that concerns his essays. Nevertheless, he still is kind of grabbing; even though he very frequently irritates; somewhat paradoxically, I keep reading.  "The Books in My Life" I've found fairly good, interesting -- especially the first half of the book. The second becomes rambling and disconnected; also, the size of essays there grows markedly: in fact, I couldn't stomach it and simply thumbed through, reading a couple of pages here and there. But the first part (almost exactly a half) I did find interesting, partly because of the insight it gives into his own psyche and biographical material, partly due to his coverage of writers I simply didn't know before (Blaise Cendrars, for example; I will probably read something by him and others Miller mentions.)  To Miller fans with a taste for his essays, recommended.
