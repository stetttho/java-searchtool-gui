 The book is thoroughly trivial in what it treats upon and impractical in how it does it and advice it gives. In fact, I'm not sure it does give any advice: it seems mostly descriptive, systematising, defining, theoretical. How do you apply all this in reality? This is not addressed (and with good reason: you can't).  The only reason I'm giving it two stars rather than one is the brief (and clearly written, I admit) review of sets, graphs, and Petri nets at the beginning. This I find useful not because these preliminaries were then put to any profitable use afterwards -- they were not -- but because these methods enable clearer and more specific thinking and communications in any area (not only testing). That's the reason being of set theory in math to begin with.  Other than that, the book endlessly drones on and on about trivial stuff in an inflated language, nothing more. There's nothing practical, only theories, concepts, and numerous ponderous diagrams making simple things look complicated.  The problem with testing is not that it's done unscientifically (and the only thing scientific in this book is pretense, btw), but that it is frequently not done. 90% of testing success consists in simply deciding to do it -- testing methods are nothing esoteric, anyone with half a brain will figure out what and how to test once he decides to do it. Also, systematicity proposed by many formal books on testing is an illusion: no real testing can be forced into the neat hierarchies touted by the gurus -- they're only moderately useful as general concepts, a mental framework of sorts. What then happens in practice is usually some sort of combination of some or all of them and more -- according to circumstances.  Anyway, as far as this particular book, my opinion is -- not worth the time, forget the price.
