 I barely finished it: the author invented a very doubtful theory and then avoided defending it. Unusual, hmmmm... I don't know. The book's unimpressive, to say the least. And then, having put it down, I thought, who's the author? Is he an authority to begin with? What else has he written? Is he a mathematician? Well, the book lists a couple of papers (? reviewed? published?) as his other writings... OK, you will judge for yourself, but to me, the book looks too much like a self-published vanity piece, sort of thing.   The topic is interesting, but the author's position remains without foundation -- his opinions there rest entirely on his postulating his opinions. I hesitate to be very negative, but neither can I recommend this piece.
