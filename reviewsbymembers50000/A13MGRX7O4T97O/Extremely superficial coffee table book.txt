 A one-page "biography" per person, many of whom truly don't qualify as "late bloomers" at all, unless we take a "late bloomer" to signify a person who didn't die young. But that's beside the point, the point is, the book is way too superficial, it's truly useless, it communicates no interesting information whatsoever. And at such a degree of, so to say, chronological compression, it's no wonder.  A piece of junk, really.
