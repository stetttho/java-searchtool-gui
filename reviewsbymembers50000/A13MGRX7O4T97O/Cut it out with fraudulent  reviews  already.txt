 How sad this is. Check out the below five-star reviews, go to the posters' reviews page and notice that nearly all of them write reviews only for books from Warton Publishing, they invariably like the books on the five-star level, and they tend to post them all on the same day (jeez, gotta be more subtle). This is very disheartening. Buyer beware.  The book is mildly curious, nothing more than that. Very mildly.
