 My first review of this book hung here for a while and then silently disappeared; another attempt did not succeed at all. Perhaps it was due to links to Intel, or who knows why... I'll abstain from linkage this time and see how far it goes.   OK, so in short: this book starts with the 386 and unhurriedly proceeds from there. No wonder it's nearly 2000 pages long (as a side effect, it is utmostly unwieldy, physically impossible to read in bed -- unless ripped apart, -- which you might as well do, since with use, the binding will disintegrate by itself anyway).   My problem with this "genealogical" approach is that I couldn't care less about "genealogy" of processors: practically, you can no longer buy a machine with less than a P4 in it; perhaps (not sure) it makes sense to write s/w considering PII/IIIs (probably not, but there still are some out there). So, why would I care to waste time on completely outdated "genealogies"? I get my pleasure reading elsewhere + ars longa, vita brevis = I see no reason.   Now, Intel offers a set of processor manuals (quite nicely written) for free download on their site. All in all, it's several thousand pages as well, but it's all about P4; there's no fluff there, just a lot of detail. I suspect that Mindshare's "genealogical" slant is simply a legitimacy-seeking gimmick that they used to justify reselling a truckload of old material, of which they, of course, have plenty. Yet I can't imagine wasting time on it; if you need Intel info, download their manuals. I will not post the link, but just go to Intel and search for 'P4 processor manuals', they're easy to find. Or google for them. It's a lot of stuff to read, but at least it's up-to-date and relevant.
