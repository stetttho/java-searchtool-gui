 I was quite prepared to accept that the movie was going to be, as it were, void dramatically -- it's a musical after all, one can always fast forward over drivel to the dancing and music. Unfortunately, there's nothing to fast forward to here: the dancing is very inauthentic, lame; the music even more so (in fact, it isn't even latin by the most part; and as to The Song that started it all, well, a couple of fragments of a bland rip-off of the real thing is all you're going to hear).   Guilherme Pimentel of Rio de Janeiro ("Give me a break" review below) is exactly right -- this flick is very, very lame; don't waste your time.
