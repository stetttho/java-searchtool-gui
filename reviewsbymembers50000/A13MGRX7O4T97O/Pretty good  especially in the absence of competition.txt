 To put it short, the book is worthy. Not perfect--terminology is strange at times (the author calls event-driven programming "asynchronous" which is, first, a strange choice, and, second, confusing--especially in a book on communications, where the term "asynchronous" is an accepted term used to signify something very different; the author calls states "state machines" which, the two being distinct entities, is, again, confusing a bit.) The editor should have caught these few cases of failed diction. Some of the proposed designs are questionable at times (new'ing state objects all the time? Not a good idea...) BUT: these are lateral things. What matters most is that this book is unique in what it covers and it does a pretty adequate job showing (practically, in code) how this kind of programs are written. I know of no other book of the same kind, and therefore highly recommend it to any programmer dabbling into communications area.
