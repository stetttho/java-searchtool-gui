 A speedy, high-level overview of the topic. A bit overpriced perhaps (but then it's not a mass-market book); a few typos, somewhat disconnected -- in other words, not a literary masterpiece, but does the job though. Overall, I've found it very easy to read and useful and, therefore, deserving four stars.
