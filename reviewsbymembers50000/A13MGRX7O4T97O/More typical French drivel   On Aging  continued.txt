 Nietzsche's ascerbic and derisory "Das schreibt und schreibt sein unausstehlich weises Larifari, Als glt es primum scribere, Deinde philosophari" could serve as a fitting epigraph to this abstruse and boring compendium of vague theorisings, whose laboured gravitas and prolixity fail to obscure the fact that the author has nothing to say; he's trivial when right, and wrong everywhere else. Well, actually, it's not that much that he's wrong but rather vacuous, uninteresting; one wonders why this book was written at all. In the introduction, the author claims that "On Suicide" is a sequel to his earlier "On Aging": this, I think, is a reasonable statement--at least in so far as both  books offer little more than prodigious amounts of verbiage swinging freely from trite to unnecessary to unintelligible. I have now read both these books (well, tried to.) I haven't finished either, but this one I quit even sooner than the "On Aging" opus: I already knew what to expect, and, unfortunately, was not in the least mistaken.
