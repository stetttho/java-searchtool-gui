 A bit outdated (no mention of the internet); and I do somewhat agree with the reviewer below -- there's more than a touch of snobbery in this work. Or maybe it's simply a time-related aberration: this book is old. Now, as far as art's not being on trial, I can't but respectfully disagree -- art is always on trial; insisting on art's a-priori imperviousness to critique doesn't seem reasonable and indeed looks like something only a guard or concierge would propose; we meantime should not mistake pride in uniform for good jugdement in the matters of art.  One can't go wrong with this book, but, these days, a quick search in your favorite local bookstore will reveal better alternatives (the Turabian book -- less "literary" but more practical and up to date comes to mind; it is of course is not the only alternative).
