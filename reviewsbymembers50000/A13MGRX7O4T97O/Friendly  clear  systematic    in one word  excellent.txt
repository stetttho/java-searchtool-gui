 This is a survey sort of book, very systematic and logical, darn well written; concise, yet clear. Every chapter ends with a commented bibliography for those who want to wade into a particular kind of PDEs in greater depth. I personally couldn't put this book down, it's just exactly what I needed, and exactly the kind of book that I like -- presenting a sensible overview of the area yet not skipping on details. Did I mention it's well written?   Thumbs up; recommended.
