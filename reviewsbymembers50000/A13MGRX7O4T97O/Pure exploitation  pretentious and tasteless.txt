 A lot of spurious cinematographic tricks (reversed narrative line, constantly spinning camera, etc., serving no purpose whatsoever other than temporary mystification of the rapidly losing interest viewer) and showy violence trying to hide an utmost absence of any idea. To me this film looked like a silly film-school-graduation effort where the bushy-tailed maker tried real, real hard to use every trick (already used and overused by others, and therefore already a cliche, but considered "kewl" by damn wannabies) to shock the viewer into acquiescing into how great and different this kid with a camera is: yet it's all too obvious that the kid is dumb and got nothing to say: the graphic gore and pseudo-intellectual pretense -- le temps detruit tout and so on, blah blah -- all this notwithstanding, you forget this thoroughly empty, unreal, and pandering [...] story the moment the film ends.   Mercifully, the flick is short, but still, there are better ways to waste an hour. To avoid, for sure.
