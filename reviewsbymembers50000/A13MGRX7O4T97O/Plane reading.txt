 A few pieces there are well written, but that's about the only positive quality of this book. Oh, yes, and the cover is funny, yes. The book is neither especially "avant" (in the sense of breaking through some hitherto unperceived barriers), nor is it really "porn" (inasmuch as porn involves enticing and titillation).   Actually, it's not any different from many literary anthologies you see gathering dust in bookstores or floating around the web, i.e., a bunch of artfully written drivel about nothing. For some unfathomable reason, a lot of people want to write -- even can write -- but unfortunately have nothing to say. At this point, I prefer maybe even ineptly written books that offer that ever-elusive "redeemable value". None of such here.  The book's OK to kill time, but not a must-read by any means.
