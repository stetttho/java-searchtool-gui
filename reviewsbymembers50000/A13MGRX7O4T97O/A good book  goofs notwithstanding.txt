 I've recently read this book and found it rather illuminating; every chapter had something I've learned from. As to CompierGuy's review, yes, with great surprise I did see this silly statement he's quoting; and indeed the idea that optimization can eliminate most programming bugs is preposterous. However, it is an isolated incident -- even the chapter it's in is very enlightening overall (for example, if you ever wondered, but couldn't figure out, why VC's TRACE macro resolves to what it resolves to, after reading this chapter you will understand). And so I think the silly "optimization" phrase can be ascribed to the substandard translation/editing: the publisher, A-list, seems to be a cheesy russian outfit trying to capitalize on the rapidly passing computing fad by printing a lot of padded junk with the word "Hacking" in the titles. That said, I think Kaspersky's books are an exception to the rule, although I wish they were better translated/edited.  At the same time, I feel that "CompilerGuy" is unfair in his criticism: he says the list of egregious errors is too long to quote and comes up with a single example -- the one and only silly phrase. Having read this book, I think that CompilerGuy's review is groundless, but perhaps I'm wrong, and being always keen to learn more, I'd be interested to see a few more examples off of this mentioned but unsubstantiated, supposedly too-long-to-quote list of "painfully wrong statements, outright speculation, and serious lack of insight".   The bottom line: if you can get past unidiomatic writing and obvious snafus like the one quoted by CompilerGuy, you'll find the book useful; it has a lot of good information and thought of a rather uncommon for what's currently in print kind.
