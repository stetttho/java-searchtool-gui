 This is a very well written, code-rich book. It is 16-bit based, but most of it (if not all) is directly useable under the 32-bit environment, I have it and use it all the time even though it's rather old now. In fact, it's good it's old, because there's none of the ActiveX/OLE/MFC etc., junk in there, it's all about good old C-API-based development.  OK, that said: what's that Booklist review up there doing on this page? Obviously it's not about this book; it's, I suspect, about a very nice Hammond organs book, which I happen to have as well -- and it's, no doubt, very good -- but why on this page?
