 If there were any alternative books on the topic, I'd give this one 1 star, rather than 3. But for some reason there aren't any, so one has to be extra charitable. The book is EXTREMELY superficial, badly structured, fragmentary, it truly looks like a few unrelated white papers written by a younger colleague/research assistant bound together and published under the head honcho's name, a hasty, half-hearted affair. Since this is the only thing in print covering the topic, you can't go wrong reading it, but don't expect to gain much. Perhaps working through the gdb's source code is better. Well, there's no question, of course, it's better because it's a real thing, but you might want to read this book as well, it does contain randomly located bits and pieces of relevant information. It would be really great if it were reworked: cleaned up, meaningfully structured, and given more depth (as well as source code.) Not sure why that's not done--such a book would definitely be commercially successful.
