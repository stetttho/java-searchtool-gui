 This brochure looks like a raw transcript of a few lectures of Arrow's that should have been edited for publication as a book but hadn't been; the stuff is completely unreadable. There are perhaps a couple of stimulating ideas there, but one can't tell for sure, because there isn't a single clearly written paragraph in this whole book -- it's a pouring forth of unpolished, disjointed drivel by a man with a penchant for convoluted bureaucratic expression.   Not recommended.
