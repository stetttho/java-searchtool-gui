 A truly stupefying combination of dull, passive-tense-happy bureaucratic prose with a deluge of spurious metaphors and overflowing vocabulary (straight from the thesaurus). Every page takes an hour to decipher, and then you realize it has not only been unreadable but incoherent as well (see the Intro). I read one chapter, thumbed through the rest -- and tossed this book into the dumpster.
