 Nearly a half of this book consists of a rather detailed (almost on the programming level) exposition of the Windows NT/2000 operating system. Please reread the previous phrase and make sure it registered: I didn't say MS SQL Server, I said the *operating system*. Imagine the two latest Richter books (for Win2K) with most code excised, plus the Solomon/Russinovich one combined: that will be the first half of Henderson's book. I'm not sure I understand the reason for all this information to be in there.   The rest is good, no questions (although there's some overlap with his other (very good) TSQL books).  I find such a structure extremely unusual, unnecessary, and, due to an absolutely exorbitant amount of redundancy in the general OS area--unsuitable for anyone with even a moderate exposure to Windows programming. It looks suspiciously like padding to me, and again, the amount of it is simply mind boggling; I've never seen anything like that before. Four-five hundred pages of padding? C'mon.  Now, one man's padding is another's bible, OK, I suppose this may be a feature rather than flaw to some. But please be aware of this and choose accordingly. I won't pretend to be an ultimate judge here (as for myself, I didn't buy this book).  Just to be fair in general, I'll add that Henderson is a knowledgeable guy and a good writer, which is a rare combination. So I'm not saying the book is bad: I would probably buy the second half of it (for half the price). And I'd easily give this second part four stars, maybe five.  YMMV.
