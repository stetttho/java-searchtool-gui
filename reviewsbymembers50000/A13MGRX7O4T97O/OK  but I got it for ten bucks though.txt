 I have all previous editions and can compare: it's not very different from the third. But there is something new, so if you can get it for cheap, I'd say, get it (I did). I would not pay the full price though.  I'm not knocking this book down: speaking in general (whatever edition), it's a good book; if you haven't read an earlier version, it's a must.
