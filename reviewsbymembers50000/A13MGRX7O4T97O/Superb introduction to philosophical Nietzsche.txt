 A great book to start with Nietzshe. It's very short and those who say it's "not the real thing" are correct, but, this is so by design. I would like to say that the translator/editor of this book, RJ Hollingdale, did a magnificent job, and in his introduction to the "Reader" he mentions precisely that: the goal of this book is not to house all Nietzsche's works but to "entice" the reader to continue--and that goal the editor has achieved flawlessly. The selection of excerpts is very intelligent and helpful in both what is presented and how it is presented. The editor is a Nietzsche specialist and yet he holds himself back--the clear and logical intro is but three pages (rather than half the book of academic showing off), it's directed to the reader and gives a lucid overview of the priciples that guided the editor in compiling the book in this and not in some other way, as well as the best way to approach it. I am so impressed by the role of the editor here that I'm purchasing his own monograph on Nietzsche, I really liked Mr Hollingsdale's writing style and scientific demeanor--concise, lapidary, yet accessible and careful. This book, imo, is a better one for a beginner than a similar book by Kaufmann (not that Kaufmann is bad, in fact it contains more Nietasche, but it is, imo, less targeted, not as sharp as Hollingsdale's take on it.)
