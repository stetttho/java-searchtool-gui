 ...not terribly well written.   I think the method is overblown. It can be useful in a group setup since it delineates and formalizes the roles and different aspects of mental attack, so to say. However, all of them are rather obvious and you'd do precisely this thing on your own even if you didn't know about "the six thinking hats" trick or didn't think of the process this way. And why six? I think, one could express the same idea with ten (or three). It is somewhat arbitrary I think. Also, the transition, borders so to say, between different mental postures is blurred and, again, somewhat arbitrary, I think. Anyway, no harm in skimming this book when you got nothing else to do, just don't expect any breakthroughs coming out if it.
