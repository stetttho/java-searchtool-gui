 And poorly written, "C" for topic coherence and concision. All the usual faults of the self-help/"advice" genre -- pretentiousness, laboured exaltation, triviality. And, let's be honest, a bit of fraud: for example, the author, while waxing philosophical about sublimest matters of Creativity and Courage, frequently skips more mundane but very important steps, w/o which the rest becomes useless. Suppose you're a truck driver and -- Live Your Dream blah-blah -- decide to become a movie director; of course it'd make a lot of sense to talk to some of them. Well, the biggest problem here is not to realize that it would, but to actually get in touch with them. The author limits himself to simply stating, very much in passing, something like, "go a talk to some movie directors". Well, thanks. Or, another good one: "just ask some brokers to put together a review for you." Yeah, right, they all sit and wait for an unknown guy to walk in and give them a bit of homework. Here's how you establish contacts: "say you have 50 friends..." -- do you? Fifty friends? I have four. But that's not all -- he then proceeds along this wonderful MLM idea that each one of your fifty friends will be delighted to introduce you to fifty friends of his, etc., etc. Six degrees of separation, you know. In no time you end up with six million friends, to whom you're going to be doing a favour (as the author says) by bugging them with questions. Sure, that'll work. I, for one, would simply LOVE to waste my time of a six-degree separated moron from across the country -- and I'm sure other people would love it too, after all, all people are the same, just like me. Another brilliant idea of his is "evolution", recombining things/ideas and trying. Sounds good, but what about time? Evolution has the whole eternity to work with; I don't. Mr Dauten does not deign to address this insignificant nuance.  OK, you get the gist of it. Not worth the time, thumbs down.
