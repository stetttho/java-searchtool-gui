 I have two-three books on DSP, all are good, but this one stands out as the most well-written and readable. I recommend anyone planning to approach DSP to start from this book. By looking at the reviews here it seems there's a disagreement amongst the readers as to the book's math content. Well, you do need to be confortable with calculus, or better put, not to feel intimidated by it (it's OK if you don't remember something, just go, pick a textbook and refresh what's forgotten.) But, friends, you really CAN'T learn about DSP without calculus, it IS based on calculus, so the complaints below about excessive math are misplaced: you gotta be able to swim before going snorkeling.
