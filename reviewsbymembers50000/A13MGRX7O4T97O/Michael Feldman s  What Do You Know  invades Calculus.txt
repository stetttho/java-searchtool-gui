 I don't like this book. Primarily because of its being laden with forced humour that irritates me like hell. Every chapter starts with a pageful of miserable jokes that make me want to punch the author in the nose. I was initially hoping that the main body of text may be better, but no, it's 'humorous' throughout... reminds me of this gasbag on NPR, Michael Feldman, if you know what I mean.  The book is also in general over-wordy: ideally, there's a middle ground between bashing the reader with bare symbols, and drowning him in verbosity -- a balance that is, for sure, hard to achieve: and indeed the boook fails in that respect; it's too wordy; repeatedly one gets impatient to get to the point. That said, there actually are clarifying bits here and there, so I'm giving it three rather than one star (maybe it should have been two stars, I'm not sure, but let's be charitable).   I think the book would gain immensely if the failed humour were excised and verbiage in general minimized. The book would shrink a bit too, which is good -- time's at a premium anyway.  I'm yet to find a "for dummies" sort of book that would deliver on its promise -- I suspect it may simply be impossible. We know there is no royal road to mathematics, why should there be a "dummy's" road?   Instead of the how-to-ace books try Anton's "Calculus with Analityc Geometry" (among other things, it covers about one and a half of the two "How to Ace" calculus books); it is sufficiently talkative, but not logorrheic; it has proofs as well as intuitive intros; it is simply written; it is friendly, etc. For the second-year calculus sort of thing, David Bressoud's book may be a good choice. These are not the only options of course; it's just something I happen to be familiar with and that I know not only to be solid, but also friendly.  All of this is subjective, but if tempted, peruse this book before buying. There's perhaps something to it, but I personally couldn't suffer through it.
