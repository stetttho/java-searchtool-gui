 Crude acting (soviet school?); the original story butchered and given a pop dostoyevskian, pretentious slant; Tarkovsky's mystifying narrative style has become very dated, tired, annoying (though I'll admit it was rather entrancing 30 years ago). The only thing that's still valid is Tarkovsky's rich, greasy, palpable visual textures. Overall, looks quaint. Still, I'd say it's a better film than the recent Soderbergh version.
