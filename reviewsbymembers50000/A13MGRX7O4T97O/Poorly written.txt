 The book is very well made as far as layout, fonts, illustrations, structure, detail, and the overall intent. It is, however, exceptionally poorly written: redundant, confusing, ungrammatical. The 386 section is tiny and completely inadequate -- an obvious add-on grafted onto the more mature 186 material in order to make the book look more up-to-date and, thus, competitive. Add in the exorbitant price to complete the picture of this thoroughly one-star item; I feel sorry for the students who have this book forced on them as a textbook. And yet it could be good though, but it needs a lot of editorial work + much more on the 386ex side (this is the only controller that's still used a lot).   I got much more mileage out of Intel's 386ex and general IA32 .PDFs along with Messmer's "Indispensable PC Hardware" book.   Not recommended (at any price).
