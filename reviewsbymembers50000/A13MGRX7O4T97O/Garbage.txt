 A typical CMP quick hack job: deceptively titled, poorly written, irrelevant, arbitrary, unnecessary, pompous, disjointed -- these are the qualifiers that readily come to mind. The book contains a seemingly random selection of whatever the author could probably think of, just so the overall volume adds up to the book length...  The title is deceptive: even though it suggests statecharts, there's no unifying theme here -- only the first quarter (if that much) is about statecharts; the rest is a seemingly random selection of absolutely trivial, uninteresting pieces, consisting of very poorly written text commingled with very poorly written code. And all of this is over a subject matter that's trivial and overhyped to begin with -- the fact which can't be obscured by the book's overall pomposity and proliferation of magic words ("patterns", "eXtreme" programming, quantum physics, guons, gang-of-four blah-blah, affected "scientificity", and the rest of the typical bs-mongering that usually comes from those who got nothing to say).   All right, I feel I'm punished enough having wasted my time reading it and don't want to go page by page; all I'm gonna say is this: if you want to avoid disappointment, don't buy this book sight unseen: go to a bookstore and check it out very carefully first. No thumbing through: sit down and carefully read a chapter. As for me, I'm sending it back -- not only without any trace of guilt, but vengefully. This hasn't been my first encounter with R&D/CMP books; over the years I've bought quite a few -- and it's enough; this was the last time I looked at a CMP product. R&D were inconsistent and never outstanding, but at CMP, they seem to have fixed that: they're consistently bad.
