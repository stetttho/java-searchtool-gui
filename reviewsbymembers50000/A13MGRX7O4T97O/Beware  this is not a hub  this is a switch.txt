 Works great in general, but: I needed a hub (as in "repeater") in order to hook up an analyzer to a network segment, and boy, was I surprised when my interface, after going through autonegotiation, reported that it's in the full-duplex mode. This "hub" is actually a switch! Sixty bucks down the drain. How this device is different from an identically looking Linksys device called a "switch" I don't know. The two sit on the same shelf and you'd think if they're called differently they're different, but no, for all practical purposes they're one and the same. Actually, it doesn't even have the "Collision" indicator; I wish I noticed that before buying.  So beware: even though it's called a hub, this device is unsuitable for analyzer hookup -- it's not a repeater, and as it is with any switch, you will see only the traffic going to/from your machine + ethernet broadcasts, not to/from *every* network interface hooked up to your "hub". This is confirmed with Linksys customer support, so be aware of this. As a switch, like I've already said, it seems to work fine.
