 Amazingly effective yet very simple, feels totally effortless. I only wish the vocabulary and the core expressions of every lesson were supplied in printed form; by ear it is sometimes hard to pick the words exactly right: they sound different when spoken fast or slow, and when pronounced by the man vs. the woman speaker on the tape.   Overall, I'm amazed at how the material gets lodged in your brain -- in that respect the course is truly effective. But keep in mind, the pace if very slow (not a criticism), and the course is purely, 100% audiolingual -- nothing written whatsoever (this _is_ a criticism; I'd prefer to see in addition to hearining it).  For my needs, this is insufficient by itself, but, as far as it goes, this method seems great.
