 Nietzsche's ascerbic and derisory "Das schreibt und schreibt sein unausstehlich weises Larifari, Als glt es primum scribere, Deinde philosophari" could serve as a fitting epigraph to this abstruse, boring compendium of vague, disjoint, and specious theorisings, whereby the laboured gravitas fails to obscure the fact that the author has nothing to say (as is usually the case.)   I lost interest in the book by the page 30, quit reading it on page 50, then thumbed through the rest, then contemplated a bit--was I perhaps being too hasty with conclusions? then reread a few pages and decided that I was not--and then, with certainty and relief, deposited it in the circular file where it belongs. The book is a perfect example of what's wrong with a lot of continental philosophy. Or "philosophy", better put.
