 Bought in on sight, compulsively, just couldn't deny myself the pleasure of possessing this piece. It's a book of basic astronomy, nothing terribly technical in it, good for a high-school student. The book is absolutely magnificent: nice paper, clear type, an awful lot of colorful illustrations, all very appropriate, in one word, everything you can wish for in a science book -- it is so beautiful, like a toy, you wanna eat it. If you got a kid, buy it. Actually, if you don't have a kid, buy it anyway, a kid is just a good excuse to spend the money on it; your family will fight over it.
