 Like every other Hamming book I've read this book is underedited and has a significant number of ridiculous typos (missing words, extra words, missing punctiation, etc.), but still, publishing snafus notwithstanding, the book's a very worthy read. Hamming had a long and distinguished career and he shares his insights in a very generous, friendly, and straighforward manner; the result is a paragon of no-bs literature that should be on everyone's required-reading list.  That this book is out of print is very unfortunate, but that doesn't mean you have to pay the ridiculous amounts that I see some of the sellers above are asking for. Do what I did: get it in the library. A regular public library! They will probably not have this book themselves, but they can get it via an interlibrary loan from some local college. Best things are free, remember that. Use our wonderful public library system.  Btw, there's a slide-only version on the net, freely available; google for hamming + learn to learn. It's not equal to the book, but you can get a taste of it. There's also something like an excerpt, also available on the net, a short lecture sort of thing, titled "You and Your Research". You may check these out to get a good idea of what the book is about -- but whether you do or not, be sure, the book is a must read; if you can get a reasonably priced copy, get it w/o thinking twice.
