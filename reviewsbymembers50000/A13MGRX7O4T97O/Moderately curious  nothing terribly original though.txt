 Based exclusively on secondary sources, this book is an attempt to interpret Russian history in terms of something called the "path dependence" theory. The bibliography and notes are very extensive and good (a motivated student of Russia will find this very helpful). I felt, however, that despite this impressive foundation, nothing terribly interesting has been achieved. I have not discovered anything that I didn't already know from, say, reading Pipes. The path-dependence theoretical slant appears to be, in plain words, a systematic stress on the role of social inertia in history, which, although correct and useful, is nothing revelatory or even new (terminology aside). The book is also strangely hard to read; there's something non-obvious about the author's writing style that makes it so. Overall curious, but not a must-read. The price quoted here is strange -- I can't imagine paying that much (I got mine in the library).
