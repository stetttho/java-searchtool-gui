 However, overall it's been useful to me, so I give it four stars. There are badly written books that are useless, but this is not one of them; it's worth to persevere in this particular case. I do deplore the endemic lack of verbal aptitude in technical authors along with publishers' inability or unwillingness to provide adequate editing even despite ever-rising prices.   All in all, although it's not a smooth read, if you write numeric code, you're likely to find this book helpful.
