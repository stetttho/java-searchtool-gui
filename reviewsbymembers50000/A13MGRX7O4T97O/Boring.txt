 A very unoriginal record. Overall, a couple of pieces are listenable, but the rest I'm already skipping. I know, I know: blues is a rather narrow genre, but still... every note -- nay, every sound on this record I've already heard five million times before played by different people. Moore plays well, of course, but the result, at least this time, is not interesting. I should've really given it one star, but I'm soft on musicians.
