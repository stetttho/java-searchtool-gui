 I bought this book literally by mistake. It's amazing how straight out of  the blue just the right stuff falls into your lap--right when you need it,  without your doing a thing to get it. What a wonderful book that is!  Now, I may be a reader, but by no means a writer, not even an aspiring  one--I simply don't care to write anything. This book, however, while being  ostensibly about psychology of writing, is actually about psychology of  ANY, even borderline creative, activity. I, for example, would strongly  recommend this book to every software or graphics designer, or someone  banging his head against the wall about some business ideas--absolutely  anyone who finds himself baffled by inscrutable, inexplicable mental  stoppages while engaged in any kind of creative activity will benefit from  this book's advice. Especially if that person is apt to try to disentagle  himself by the sheer force of his will power. (And even more so if that  person has been doing it for years with about 100% statistical failure rate  ;-) So, if you find yourself in a similar predicament, read this book  before you head to a shrink's office or hang yourself <g>. It's an  easy read too, btw. Another similarly (though not as pointedly) helpful  book is "Zen of Writing" by Ray Bradbury.
