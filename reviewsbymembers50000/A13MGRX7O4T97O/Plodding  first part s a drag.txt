 Everyone's praising it to the sky, I think this is because the piece is very famous and people think it very gauche to tell the truth; it must be praised. The truth is, Balanchine or not, this version is boring, plain and simple.   The first part -- the more cinematic one -- is downright unbearable even the first time around: slow, with no direction/development; this McCulkin kid, you wish someone strangled him in the cradle; he's so annoying with his ever-present mechanoid, phoney grin on his face and generally wooden act (he makes some balletic moves at times, jeez, that's something else). In general, whether acting, or dancing, the kids are totally out of place; they can't act, nor dance, for goodness sakes, they're too small yet.  The second part becomes more or less as expected, the ballet that is; this is somewhat redeeming; the set is great, and so is lighting, all seems recovering in the second part... yet they never quite make it; it's still plodding. If you listen to the music itself, you'll see that it's quite dramatic, there's development there, but here, it's all somehow even, level throughout -- it can stop halfway through, it'd feel all right, or it could go on for another half hour, no difference: you almost begin counting numbers.  Special effects are annoying, the flying bed and all.   I remember seeing another movie-version of the Nutcracker that was much, much better -- no kids and much more driving; I wish I remembered what it was, but I don't, so I can't point to it specifically. I'll try to find out though and post it here.  Overall, very mediocre... OK, maybe tolerable -- if you fast-forward over the first part. The magic, enchanting, soul-grasping spirit of this fantastic tale is almost wholly lacking though; parts are nice to look at, but overall, zero emotional entrainment.
