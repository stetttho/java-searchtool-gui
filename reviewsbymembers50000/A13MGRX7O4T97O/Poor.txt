 This "book" is actually a collection of the columns for some freebie-style publication, some of which the author wrote in 1990-92! The quality of text varies from chapter to chapter, but overall, the book is unclear, disjoint, and incoherent -- a real muddle. Sometimes it is incompetent as well: for example, it is suggested that languages that use stack for passing parameters in function calls result in nonportable source code, or that C++ doesn't have the "volatile" keyword. Yes, *this* kind of nonsense. How stuff like that gets published is a mystery to me.  (I also question the credibility of the five-star reviews below: the book is so obviously bad that I can't imagine a technical, knowledgeable reader giving it such a good evaluation. Probably a bunch of friends of the author's or the publisher's flunkeys. These reviews are brazenly disingenuous, which would be obvious to anyone who had a chance to thumb through the book itself.)  PS. To address the author's rebuttal above: the 'volatile' keyword is described in the C++ Annotated Reference Manual (circa 1990!) as part of the C++ language. And at any rate, it's 2006 now.
