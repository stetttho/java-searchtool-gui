 The film is not as bad as some here say it is, nor is it any good: this film is mediocre (which, in some sense, is worse than bad). It's a teenage revenge fantasy plus a fair amount of regular porn (I think there are even a couple of known porn actors featured there). The film isn't all that violent as people say -- that is, there's a lot of gunfire and red paint splashed on walls, but it's somehow unaffecting; the violence factor is overstated. The problem with the film is that it's uninteresting, not that it's too violent or is full of explicit sex.   I remember similarly daydreaming about a terrible revenge that I would in my dreams inflict on the Cruel World -- at the age of thirteen or therebouts -- complete with extermination of all manner of Hated Enemies and the full of pathos, Dramatic Death of the Unappreciated Hero at the end.... very much like the Sorrows of Young Werther, except for in this film it's all feminized and postmodern: the revengers are adult, women, and there are two of them. To look for any sense here is superfluous, it's all about "rage" against god only knows what, the grunge style sort of thing. Kewl, maaaan.... All in all, a waste of time.
