 This is a first calculus course sort of thing; remarkably clear, well explained, and covering more than such courses tend to (for example, it's got a section on multivariable calculus and vectors). A wonderful book to study from: Strang really skips nothing, a lot of hand-holding there, all details elucidated in a measured, step-by-step fashion, no skipping on algebra/derivations. The book, study materials, and instructor's manual are available online, in the PDF form, on the MIT OpenCourseware site, so, in order to persuade yourself that this book is as good as I say it is, google for it and check it out for yourself. Of course, reading PDFs off screen or printing them out is a pain in the neck, so you'll want to pick a printed copy.
