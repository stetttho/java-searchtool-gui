 I'm just checking this book out thinking I might want it, and of course I always read the reviews. Now, look at the reviews page of the below reviewer (W. Boudville). I hate to do this to this book since I haven't had it in my hands yet and it might actually be quite good, but I just can't deal with the tricks that publishers seem to engage in now on a massive scale.   Check this out: as I write this, Mr Boudville has already reviewed two (2) books today. Yesterday (March 15) he reviewed fifteen (that's 15!) books, and so on -- anywhere between 2 and a dosen books nearly every day going back to the beginning of time. AM I SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE HE ACTUALLY READ ALL THESE BOOKS?! Or is he renting out his name in a bid to add credibility to commercial promo blurbs? Is that how one becomes a "Top 50 Reviewer"?   Shame.
