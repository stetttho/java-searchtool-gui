 The positive reviews on this page are right on the money: the book is a sort of catalogue of procedures. It is, emphatically, not a textbook; in fact, there's very little text in it; the pattern here is mostly as follows: a concise and well written intro followed by a bunch of math w/o derivations or an awful lot of explanation, followed by a good bibliography section. The book is a SURVEY of methods -- and there is, most lamentably, a dearth of this kind of literature... You see, in real life you bump into problems, and the first thing you need is to find out WHERE to look for solutions. Yet, most of the high-quality technical literature consists of 1000-page "Introductions" to this or that narrow theory and similarly sized textbooks. Being but a simple mortal you can't hope to study them all in the requisite depth: you need a survey to guide you to the right area: only then can you dig into a typical "Introduction". Most reading I do these days is not in depth, it's rather about what is available at all, and what scientific approaches are used to solve particular real-life problems. No one can possibly know everything, there's too much to know -- and therefore there's a tremendous need in competent survey literature, of which kind this book is a paragon: it is very well done -- competent, simply written, friendly, concise -- my heartfelt thanks to the author; more of this please. Not cheap but worth the money, highly recommended.   Once more: this is not a textbook -- you are supposed to either know, or be able to learn on demand: the book will show you WHAT you need to learn and give a brief survey of the area. Do NOT mistake this book for a textbook, you will be sorely disappointed, and yet, this won't be the book's fault: the book is great, but use it as intended.
