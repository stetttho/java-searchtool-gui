 I agree with the previous reviewer that it's a balanced biography. I liked the book; anyone interested in Miller and his work would surely enjoy it. I didn't give it five stars because this book is based nearly exclusively on Miller's own writings, so if you've read all his oeuvre, you probably already know all that Ferguson says -- including a healthy degree of scepticism about the overall veracity of Henry's "autobiographical" novels. That, I think, is a flaw; I would prefer more information from independent sources -- something you somehow expect from a biography. Very little of such stuff here. But overall it's a well presented, solid investigation performed by an affectionate, yet objective researcher. Of course, you do need to have read Miller himself first, but that, sort of, goes without saying. To Miller fans -- recommended.
