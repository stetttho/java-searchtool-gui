 but atrociously written: this book is an epitome of the shift/reduce conflict -- some paragraphs defy parsing altogether. Overall OK if you're into calculus to the point of worrying about its history or if you want to get to understand how, and even more why it came about. Although the hows definitely prevail over the whys here, unfortunately. The book is far from flawless, but still, if you can get through the stultifying writing, it will enlarge somewhat your overall conceptual view of calculus. Recommended? Perhaps. If you have time.
