 A perfect title for this book would be "First Steps at Understanding Linux Kernel 2.6". It's a good book -- clear, logical, well written, and well illustrated, nice layout, fonts, etc. -- but it's not indepth. To make a Windows parallel, it is kind of like "Windows Internals" by Solomon/Russinovich, only smaller; lots of text, not a lot of code.   If you plan to really work with the kernel, you may want to go directly for O'Reilly's "Understanding Linux Kernel", "Device Drivers", and "Linux Networking" books -- you'll end up there anyway. Actually, this: if you DON'T plan to read the above O'Reilly books, THEN read this one to get a "sorta-kinda" picture of what takes place in the 2.6 kernel.  Don't get me wrong: this is a nice book; if time and money are no problem, get it, even in addition to whatever else; it's good, not a must, but good.
