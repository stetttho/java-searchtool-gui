 The book is kinda old and slighty out of synch with the latest achievements of the C++ standard-makers. And yet! it is the best tutorial book on STL there is: no hype, lotsa code, good explanations. I keep using it and I'm very happy. The only worthy addition to it I'd like to mention is the "Cow" book by Koenig. Not one from among the latest flood of the stl books is even close to the usefulness of Mark Nelson's book--one can only wish he issued an update.
