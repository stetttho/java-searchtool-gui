 Not much to say. This book is a source of very good, practical information, covering all aspects of what an aspiring musical theatre actor will have to deal with. All parents of such should study this book too. In fact, the general approach taken by the author is very useful in general, no matter what your specific target is. He covers all bases from selecting a school, to general overview of the industry and competitive situation, to how to move into a different city, especially if this city is New York. What to set your mind to, how/where to find a place to live, picking a day job, what to do/what not to do, just oodles and oodles of very, very practical advice. The book has a lot of value for anyone, regardless of the exact career plans one might be pursuing. I mean if the goal is not the musical theatre, but, say, training for a career in the movie industry, still everything other than the dancing gear and vocalizing still applies, especially the general approach of careful, realistic planning of all the multitude of mundane tasks that one will have to deal with. Highly recommended.  (The comment below about unsuitability of this book for an adult reader/career-changer is probably a bit too harsh, I mean how realistic is it for an untrained adult person to try to break into professional musical theatre as a performer? Barring a miracle, some things just can't be done, unfortunately. If you don't believe that, rent a Cats video and think how much training *must* have gone into the skills buildup of the performers you see on your screen. So, I think, the book is written with the right reader in mind - an aspiring young actor and, perhaps even more importantly, his parents.)
