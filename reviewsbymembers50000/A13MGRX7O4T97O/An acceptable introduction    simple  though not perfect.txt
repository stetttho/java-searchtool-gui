 The book is indeed a decent introduction to the discipline, also, it has an extensive bibliography, which is presented with short blurbs-overviews of the books, comments on the authors, and historical context of the books' appearance and authors' lives and works; I really like this kind of bibliographical presentation -- not just dry data. However, I have to mention that Berger's writing style, while quite decent in the first five chapters and the closing section, beginning with the sixth does descend into the typical obfuscated pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo, and structurally the book becomes hard to read, it is never quite clear, fragmentary, repetitive.  "Invitation" seemed OK to me; still you may want to check it out yourself before buying.
