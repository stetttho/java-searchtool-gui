 Is this guide good, bad, or in-between. What are its strengths and weaknesses? By someone who has been there and read this guide. Please. I'm all up to date on Burma politics and human rights. Is the GUIDE helpful? Please, someone... Thanks (I will remove this "review" when there is an answer. I don't think any of the previous reviewers have read the book, or traveled with it. Yet.)
