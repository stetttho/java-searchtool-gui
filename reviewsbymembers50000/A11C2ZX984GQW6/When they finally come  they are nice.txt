 To bad no photo -- cute as the dickens!  Right now it says "will ship soon" and "get in line" for this item (marked down to 3.99 for the pair.)  Here is something to ponder if buying these for a gift:  An eon ago, months, Amazon had these on their site as "shipping in a (week or so)". Well, that was wrong. We finally got THAT straight and they said they would send them when they came in, it would be a long time, and they would charge me then, and ship free.  They did (I had kinda forgotten that there would be a little credit to my checking account, ouch) and here they are and they are great.   I got two sets of two. I thought by the sound they were broken. But they were okay, just clanking together.  Worth the wait, no instant gratification.
