 Mac Users Only. SYMPTOM: My Mac at that time G3 OS9.1) ) did not "recognize the disk" and offers to "format the disk". If you were to do this, the camera will not recognize it. You then would need to reformat the disk in the camera, which is not an intuitive exercise. The SD media is formatted for DOS.  Minolta Senior Support only says they don't know why it works on some Macs and not others. Said try a Flash Link adapter (now built-in on many printers.)  RESOLUTION:  I enabled the File Exchange Control Panel, using the Extension Manager. (Duh! Silly me.) After the reboot, both the card reader and the camera work fine. Tip: Manually move the two DiMage extensions to the System Folder (Extensions Folder) and reboot. The "installer" just copies things to the hard disk; it doesn't actually install anything.   The card reader did not solve the problem, but, after configuring my system correctly, it is much faster than the camera is at transferring images.   Be sure you are getting the "mini"  adapter and that it includes "SD" in the description.Depending upon your Mac OS, you may or may not need "drivers" (file extensions) from SimpleTech.  Kudos to OfficeDepot/OfficeTech who dropped shipped the card reader with same day shipping. Kudos to SimpleTech support. Bad Karma to Minolta support.  **UPDATE** I have upgraded my review from one star to four. Camera performed quite well on trip to Thialand. Movies too much fun and burns battery awfully fast.(3 Batteries:1 128MB SD Card!) Battery cost exceeds camera cost. Pix turned out fine, for this price pont. You do need a tripod to get "fine" resolution to work well in ambient light. As others have noted, the menus require too much button pushing. The software it comes with is worthless, iPhoto's basics far exceed it.  I'd recommed it with those caveats. I will be upgrading soon to a newer Dimage with improved quality, will stick with the minolta with the Cannon lens.
