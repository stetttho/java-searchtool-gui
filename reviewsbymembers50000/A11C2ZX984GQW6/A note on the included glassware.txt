 This is beautiful Correlle. If you buy this set with the glasses, factor in  the glasses are going to start breaking quickly. The set with cups is a better value, IF you like cups and saucers. Sadly, there are no mugs in this pattern, just plain white. The glasses last as long as any inexpensive glassware. I got my set at WalMart; shop and compare.
