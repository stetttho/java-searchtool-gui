 La Mer should, at least initially, be purchased from a trained salesperson. There is alot of fol-de-rol with this line, and you will need assistance selecting the right product and coaching in how to use it.   If you buy it from a large enough retailer of the product (Nordstrom at South Coast Plaza, for example), you will be invited to special workshops. And any retail sales person will put you on their list and call you when there are gifts-with-purchase.   I use this line, but I also use others. My only qualm with this one is that the Creme is made with mineral oil, which I personally find is not helpful to skin. (Think about it, it's a petroleum product.) This is one reason it must be "liquified" in the palm of your hand. And not a little, a lot.   You have to be willing to suspend your disbelief and accept the product's "miracle" properties that cannot be described by science. For the analytical person, there will be greater faith in lines that are continually researching, advancing their science, and doing clinical studies. For general, versus "targeted" skin care, this is a very good line.  This line requires patience and practice. If you are a slap-dash person or someone who has to rush out the door in the morning, this is probably not the line for you.   This line is geared to Women and Men of a Certain Age (and with a certain pocketbook) and more youthful skins may find other skin care products more to their needs.
