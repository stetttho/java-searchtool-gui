 The highlight of our recent trip to Boston was a game at Fenway. I bought the book for my husband who read it before we went and did not find it interesting. I read it when we got back and found very limited amount of specific information on Fenway. Much of it explained baseball and its oddities that are true in any park. Fenway was quite accessible, and easily navigated. The fans and stadium personnel were relaxed, outgoing, and quite helpful. The fans themselves can give you any tips or explain any oddball yells. The ones in the book were not heard.  If you are going to enjoy the game and see the park, you don't need this book to do it. If you want to know the history and legends of Fenway, this book does not have it.
