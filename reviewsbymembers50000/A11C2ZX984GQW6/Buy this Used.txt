 If you are like me and buy/read everything you can get your hands on about Burma, buy this as a used book. It is a bit flat, the writing lacks style, and the perspective is an unusual one. The author seems to have a lack of knowledge about some things Burmese, which he does not seem to add to in his explorations.   But so few go to Burma and then write about it, that having any perspective is helpful.   If you are just beginning to read about Burma, start with any of Aung San Suu Kyi's books or essays. Also, her biography of her father: Aung San of Burma: A Biographical Portrait by His Daughter.  If you are looking for a more vivid read, try Land of the Green Ghosts.    Three stars only if you get it new. Four stars if you buy it used  or check it out from the library.
