 I purchased this book in 1989 and used it then, and again, later in 1994. I now live on the Big Island and can tell you that this book is not up-to-date on the easily accessible beaches. There have been marked changes in the 4WD beaches, also. What was once my Beach Bible, is no longer useful. It WAS a great book.
