 As an owner of three other Cuisinart food processors in various sizes, I could not resist trying this as a replacement for my old mini-chopper. (The cheap kind that look like tiny food processors.)  I'm keeping and I'm using it. It's just very task specific. I have had no quality control issues in about 3 months of use.  Here is some info to consider before you buy.  1a. The motor housing goes on top and is exposed to the food. Can't just toss in dishwasher. Of course it does not have an extra lid that needs to be washed. Fewer parts is not always a bad thing.  1b. It chops a couple of tablespoons at a time. You can't fill it close to the top like the cheap kind.  2. You have to remember the gray side of the knife goes up for some foods and down for others. If you use it every day, you will remember. Otherwise, keep the manual handy.  3. With the gray up (blunt end of blade), you blend on "high". With the gray end down (sharp), you blend on "low".  You will look on three pages to dig out the info of whether "sharp" means white is on top or on the bottom. And whether to blen on high or low. I just finished using it and am looking at the manual and am STILL not sure I got that right.  4. On the pro side, It is blazingly fast which is a cool thing. You literally blend for a "fraction of a second", as it states in the manual. If your reflexes arern't this fast, you will have mush. Which might be useful for a pate. (I see some reviewers like it for this and others do not.)  5. Even though I cut food in small pieces before putting it in, I  end up with things mostly chopped very fine and a few pieces not cut at all.   6. You push down on the motor housing and hold it down while processing.  That is OK, but I keep letting go of the motor (top) after releasing the processing on button, but BEFORE it has completely finished spinning, which it does not like one bit. This is never an issue with a regular Cuisinart.
