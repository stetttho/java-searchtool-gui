 As an owner of three other Cuisinart food processors in various sizes, I could not resist trying this as a replacement for my old mini-chopper. (The cheap kind that look like tiny food processors.)  I'm keeping and I'm using it. It's just very task specific. Here is some info to consider before you buy.  1a. The motor housing goes on top and is exposed to the food. Can't just toss in dishwasher.  1b. It chops a couple of tablespoons at a time. You can't fill it close to the top like the cheap kind.  2. You have to remember the gray side of the knife goes up for some foods and down for others. If you use it every day, you will remember. Otherwise, keep the manual handy.  3. With the gray up (blunt end of blade, you blend on "high". With the gray end down (sharp), you blend on "low".  You will look on three pages to dig out the info of whether "sharp" means white is on top of on the bottom. And I just finished using it and am looking at the manual and am STILL not sure I got that right.  4. On the pro side, It is blazingly fast which is a cool thing. You literally blend for a "fraction of a second", as it states in the manual. If your reflexes arern't this fast, you will have mush. Which might be useful for a pate.  5. Even though you have cut your food in small pieces before putting it in, I l alwayss end up with things mostly chopped very fine and a few pieces not cut at all.   6. You push down on the motor housing and hold it down while processing.  That is OK, but I keep lifting the motor (top) off before it has completely finished spinning, which it does not like one bit.
