 They need to wake up the engineers and amp this up. I can go thru a fully charged battery taking 40 pix at 'fine'resoution. I try to keep the flash turned OFF (it produces a blue result anyway.) and when traveling, resist movies. It is very hard to resist movies when charming children and festive occasions are going on. If traveling for 10 days overseas and with no power adapter (I don't trust them.) take 4 to 5 batteries.3 was not enough for Thailand.
