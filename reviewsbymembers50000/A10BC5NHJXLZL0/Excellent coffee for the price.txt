 If you have never tried vacuum brewed coffee you have probably never had the best coffee. (well, maybe from a french press).  I own many nice coffee makers including some hand made Japanese glass vacuum brewers. I wanted a less expensive pot for camping or when kids are running about the house.  This Bodum maker works well. It is a great bargain for a glass vacuum pot. The only reason I don't give it the full 5 stars is that the plastic filter that comes with this pot is mediocre. You will get a little sediment when you brew. Not a huge problem, but less than perfect. I replaced the filter with a Hario reusable cloth filter and now it is perfect.
