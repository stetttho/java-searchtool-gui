 This book is one of the best woodworking books I have ever read on any topic. This book happens to be on wood finishes. Not only does the author tell you about various finishes and what they might be best for, but he tells you why! Not only does this extra information satisfy curiosity, but it helps you learn how to pick a finish even if your exact situation is not listed in the book.  The author provides helpfull tricks like how to tell if a can of finish is an oil or a varnish. (let some dry on a piece of glass and check the results). How to treat pine before staining to prevent blotches. He even revleas the ridiculous labeling practices of the finish makers that often make it hard to buy what you meant to buy. Did you know that many rubbing oils are varnishes, not pure oils?!? The author has clearly studied the science of finishing. He explains the whys and hows with enough detail for an engineer like me without overly complicating matters. The pictures are helpfull and well done.  This book is definetely on my "must have" list for any woodworker. I just can't say enough good about this book.
