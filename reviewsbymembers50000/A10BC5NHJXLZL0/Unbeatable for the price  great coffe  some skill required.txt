 As a coffee fan (fanatic) when this item showed up in my gold box cheap I had to buy it. I own another vacumm pot, several french presses, a drip machine, and an esspresso machine.  This is a GREAT entry level (inexpensive) vacuum pot, it makes a lot of coffee (for a vacuum pot) and it is all glass. It is true that making coffee in a vacuum pot takes a little more skill and patience than making coffee in a auto-drip machine, but the difference in the flavor is night and day!  I could never go back to drip coffee now that I have tasted the difference.  Some tips to help are 1) USe a caorse grind.  2) Start with HOT water in the bottom  3) Let it bubble up top for about 2 minutes 4) When 2 minutes is up, remove it from the burner and set it on a towel or cutting board. This rapid change in temperature helps the coffee run back down to the bottom. 5) Pour the fresh coffee in to a thermos style container if you will not be drinkning it promptly. It keeps it hot and fresh tasting.  A vacuum pot makes awesome tasting coffee without the sediment of a french press.   One improvement to this maker is to ditch the plastic filter and switch to a paper disk or cloth re-usable filter. .....
