 This little (inexpensive) item does a lot. First of all it is a rechargable LED flashlight you leave hanging in an outlet so it is always charged. It is an "ok" flashlight.  If you slide the switch to nightlight, it is an automatic nightlight (comes on when the room is dark). In this mode the light will also come on when the power goes out. In a blackout your nightlights will automatically kick on.   This one is better than the nearly identical timex model. The nightlight on this brand is white, instead of amber. Also, the exterior is more plain and looks better on the wall.   Tough to beat this thing for $12.
