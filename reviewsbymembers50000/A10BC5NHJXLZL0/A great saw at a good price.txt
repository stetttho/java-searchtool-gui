 I got this saw at the local home center. I can't believe how powerfull and effective it is for the price. I have used it to cut framing, pipes, exhaust parts, and other misc. household things and it never dissapoints. The quick release is a big plus, just be sure the blade is seated properly and fully before proceeding.  I have used several professional models and this one seems as good as any of them.
