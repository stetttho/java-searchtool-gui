 I have been using TurboTax for years. Overall the program is easy to use and nicely done. However, each year Intuit gets more obtrusive and obnoxious about licensing and installing unwanted garbage on my machine.  This year (Tax Year 2002) the install program littered my desktop with spam. The installer also installed a hidden program on my disk drive called C_Dilla. It is part of the copy protection scheme, but C_Dilla is well known to the programming community. C_DILLA products can block access to copying CDs, spy on other files, and cause other ptoblems. It is not clear which parts of C_DILLA TurbTax installs, but installing hidden files on my machine is not very nice. I am presumed guilty I guess. Oh yeah, the hidden files are not removed when you un-install. Nice touch Intuit.  Also, if you ever want to re-install this program in the future (like if you get audited) you are out of luck. They boast that it will only install once (for printing) and if you change PCs or uninstall you must buy another license! (If they still sell it when you are getting audited in the future). This worries me.  Next year I will be checking out the competition.
