 To call this a bad machette would be to generous. It is more accurately described as a machette shaped object.   As other have noted the blade is thin, too flexible, easily rusts, and fails to hold an edge. The handle is poorly made and mine had sharp edges where the handle halves were joined. If you use it without wearing gloves this "tool" will do more dammage to your hand than to the target vegetation.   Th sheath material is 1 step above paper. Technically it will hold the machette on your belt. But if you draw the machette with anything other than utmost care you will cut the sheath.   I can't believe a company with a valuable name like Coleman would put their brand on this embarassing piece of garbage.
