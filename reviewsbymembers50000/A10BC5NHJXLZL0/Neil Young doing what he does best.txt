 It's nice to see a master at work when inspiration strikes. With this albumn Neil Young is responding to current events on a gut level. He is pissed, he does not approve of the current administration, and he is going to tell you how he feels.  This albumn has the sound and feel of a live albumn with very little studio work on top of the tracks. The use of a chorus of 100 people is used effectively to convery that these feelings are the feelings of the people, not just one man. (well, ok, about 77 percent of the people anyway).   If you like Neil Young and you dissaprove of how things are being run in the US this albumn is for you. If you are a Bush supporter, maybe not so much.   Now.... let's impeach the President for lying!
