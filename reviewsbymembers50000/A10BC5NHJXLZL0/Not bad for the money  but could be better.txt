 "For the money" is the key phrase here. Compared to buying a dedicated mortiser or doing it by hand this tool is chpear than the former and quicker than the latter. The good things are that it does work. Once you have it installed, aligned, and tweaked it seems to work fine. I use it in oak without a problem. People who are burning or breaking bits may need to adjust the position of the dril vs the position of the square chisel. Or maybe they have a defect of some sort. It seems to help if you back out often and allow the bit to clear itself of debris. Now for the bad. The molded plastic case seems like it doesn't really fit. There are not slots for all the piece and no matter how you put the parts in it doesn't seem quite right. This seems like a pretty obvious mistake so I assume Delta is just too lazy to address this. The setup requires a bit of patience and time. If the bit is not exactly square to the fence you get some wacky looking holes.  Lots of fussy screws, knobs, etc.  Overall this is better than not having a mortiser and the price is right. I would buy it again since I don't want or need to invest the money or storage space required for a dedicated mortiser.
