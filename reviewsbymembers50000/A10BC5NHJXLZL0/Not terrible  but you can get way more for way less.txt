 Bose is a true case study in Marketing over Engineering. The Wave Radio proves it. This radio uses a tuned port to accent a certain part of the bass region.   The problem is that the port seem to make a characture of the bass. Bommy in some spots and thin in others. I think the tube is an attempt to compensate for some small / weak drivers.   After a while this radio started to sound annoying to me. I have had this problem before with another piece of Bose equipment. (A factory car stereo)  For far less money check out the Tivoli model 1 or Model 2. These little radios are MUCH cheaper than the Bose and they sound much better. They also take up less table space and look nicer.   Bose is very famous. They have spent a lot of money to convinve people they are an "audiophile" brand. True audiophiles who hear the Tivoli will see that there is NO comparision. Thanks goodness I was able to return the Wave radio!   I gave this 3 stars. It does sound better than most small radios. However, it is over priced and you can do better for less. Also, it takes up a lot of dresser space.
