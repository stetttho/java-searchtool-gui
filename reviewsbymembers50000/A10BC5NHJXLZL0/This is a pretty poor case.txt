 This case has many small problems that add up to a poor case. The lock mechanism on the front is recessed. That SOUNDS good, but it cretes a lump inside the case that will warp your records. All of the edges/corners of the case are rounded. This means the records rest on the corners of the covers instead of sitting flat. The handle is much thicker than the feet, which means these cases will not stack one on top of the other. The lining material is a cheap "pell-n-stick type of foam". It is not well applied with many seams, some of which are already lifting.   There are some good features. The handles is comfortable and well padded. The latch seems strong and is lockable. The lid comes off which is nice.   If you need a cheap case I guess it beats a cardboard box. I am not sure it beats a decent milk crate.
