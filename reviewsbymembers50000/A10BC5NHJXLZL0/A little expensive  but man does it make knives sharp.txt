 I was a little nervous about spending this much on a sharpener. Now that I have had it a few days I wish I had bought it sooner. If you understand the basics of sharpening this tool is VERY easy to use. If not, it might take a little practice to get the hang of it.   The instruction are pretty good and clear.   I have sharpened everything from good quality kitchen knives to tag sale pocket knives. When this machine is done with them you could shave with em. Amazing.   I can see one pitfall for people who don't understand sharpening (or who have weak eyesight). If you have  a blade with a deeper grind angle than this machine uses you first have to re-shape the edge (on the coarse wheel). If you don't, you are simply adding a second bevel behind the old one and leaving the cutting edge alone. This may be why some people have problems. On one cheap knife I had I first had to really grind on the first stage wheel to pull an entire new bevel. Once I did it was no problem.
