 When I first got this product I loved it. Unfortunately  one of the controllers quit working. I looked around on Amazon and other buyers have also had problem with this product quitting.  This product is made by Perfect Fit Industries. I have been calling them and emailing them for a while now. They simply refuse to communicate with me. When I call I get an answering machine. When I email I get an automated reply. The net result is a complete blowoff.   I guess that is one way to keep warranty costs down on a failure prone product.   If you buy this product you are on your own. If it fails you are out of luck. If you don't belive me try calling their support number and pretend you have a warranty claim. If they respond go ahead and buy it. They won't.
