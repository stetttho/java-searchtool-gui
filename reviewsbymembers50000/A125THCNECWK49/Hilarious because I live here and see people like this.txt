 This book is quite a jewel.  I am a Southerner, born and bred, and yet I can laugh at myself as well as the next person.  Each culture has its own idiosyncracies, and this book explores the unsaid rules of the South that slyly keep outsiders at arm's reach.  For example, how was Princess Margaret to know that ladies didn't smoke, chew gum in public, or wear white shoes after Labor Day?  I certainly am not the extremist pictured in the book, but I did attend the University of Georgia and rushed a sorority, and got to witness girls talking about being in the New Orleans Day parades, and attending the Old South ball, and yes, I was a baton twirler (although according to the book, that would never win you Miss America).  It very accurately personifies a particular eschelon of Old South behavior that still exists, and makes some of it seem as rediculous as it really is.  Definitely worth a read!!
