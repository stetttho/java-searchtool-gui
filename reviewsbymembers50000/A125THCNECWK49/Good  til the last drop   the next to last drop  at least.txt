 As an Atlantan, I must say this book describes the elitist attitudes of much of this city so accurately!   Not only that, Wolfe has made an extraordinary effort to accurately and historically portray the city and  its figureheads.   An earlier reviewer thought this book was disparaging  to African Americans.  I completely disagree; I felt that it showed the  cynicism and hypocricies of the upper-class white "good 'ol boys"  in a viciously clever, cutting way.   The scenes of life in prison were  astonishing; although one tends to sometimes get mired down in Wolfe's  descriptions of things and his occasional wordiness, such an accurate  portrayal of the sordidness of incarceration (or as I imagine it!) was  painted.   Overall, I highly recommend this book.  I read it while in  college, and believe me, it is a page-turner.  It is, however, extremely  difficult to hide during boring classes because of its sheer size (plus, I  had the hardcover edition).  If you want a cynical portrayal of "how  things really are" in Atlanta, then you can take this book for the  gospel truth. The ending, however, leaves much to be desired and seems a  little overboard.
