 This book walks you through several different types of exercises that may appear on the exam, as well as explains how the test writers think.  It is relatively cheap, too, for an AP test prep book, and gives readers practical experience with realistic tests.  I used this book, halfway paid attention in class, and managed to exempt American History at a major university.
