 I had to read this book twice to decide whether or not to give it 4 or 5 stars.  In fact, the first time I read it, I was in such a hurry to find out what happened, I missed much of the intricate detail that Feilding  weaves into this book.  Upon my second reading, however, I knew this book  had to get the full 5. "Edge of Reason" has a greater depth  than "B.J." but it equally as witty and funny.  Perhaps not the  most, er, realistic of plots, but it's just close enough to real life to  make readers identify with Bridge's mishaps.  I was practically rolling on  the floor at Bridge's Christmas cards that she sent, her plots to outwit  the Evil Jellyfish Rebecca, and her attempt to find the perfect man with  "long eyelashes" through the personal ads.  On a positive note,  though, this book made me think more so than the first one.  It explored a  few more serious issues, though always in a tongue-in-cheek way, and showed  how miscommunication in a relationship can make things much more difficult  than they have to be. My main complaint about this episode - what the  heck happened to Tom?  I miss him!  He is just a side note to this book,  making him seem less of a crucial friend to Bridge and a whole lot more  superficial/insensitive. Overall, however, this book neatly finishes a  lot of loose ends from the first installment.  There is somewhat of a  cliffhanger ending, which leaves B.J. fans certainly hoping that Fielding  will write another book, and leave it at a trilogy.   A survival guide  for women everywhere who are desperately clinging to their sanity!   Fabulous!
