 I thought this was a highly helpful video.  It first shows the man's part, then the woman's, then how it's supposed to look together.  It is very basic, yes, but that's why it's called an INTRODUCTION to ballroom dance.  It's for beginners who want to master the basic steps.  I found it very helpful, and Margot Shutz is a wonderful teacher.  I thought it was fun and a good way to work out!
