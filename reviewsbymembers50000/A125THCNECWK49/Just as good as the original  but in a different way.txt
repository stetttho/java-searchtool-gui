 Although a little slow in the beginning, this book is as meticulously researched and historically accurate as the original.  I found the lessons in Irish and British history fascinating.  And the growth of Scarlett  O'Hara from selfish belle into mature woman is remarkable.  Those who would  criticize Scarlett for her insensitivity in GWTW will understand her a  little more in the sequel and cheer her on as she discovers who she really  is (finally!) and her self-acceptance.   Imagine that you are chosen to  write the sequel to GWTW.  Of course people are going to rant that you are  nothing like Ms. Mitchell, and that you just want to make a profit, blah  blah blah.  I will bet that few of those maligners know that Ms. Ripley had  written several historical novels about Charleston before this book, and  she ties in "real" history so successfully to Scarlett's and  Rhett's time period and lifestyles that one can almost take the book for  historical fact. As I stated before, this book is wonderful...as long as  you don't expect it to be the original.  Ms. Ripley has her own distinct  writing style, quite unlike that of the original book, but I feel this  allows her to express the characters better than if she had merely tried to  copy the original author's style and pace. Buy it!  Read it!  It is a  modern classic, one that I came to love after several readings during which  I discovered something new each time.  Just don't rent the movie.  It is a  HORRIBLE, boring, overly-dramatic, soap-operatic misrepresentation of the  book (actually, it is nothing like the book...the plot, characters,  everything is different!).  Most loose ends from the first book are tied,  and at least readers feel like they have experienced satisfactory closure.
