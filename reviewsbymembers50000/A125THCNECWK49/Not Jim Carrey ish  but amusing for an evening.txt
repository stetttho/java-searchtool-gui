 This book is a cute description of how a father attempts to coach his son's little league team while trying to a) not show favoritism to his son, who insists on copying a major leaguer's batting stance that makes him  strike out; b) deal with outfielders who would rather collect worms and eat  ice cream than play ball; c) decide whether to fire his drill sargeant  assitant coach; d) handle rabid mothers determined that their son's team  should win; and e) become the season champ without losing his mind! This  book is a quick read, and has some insightful comments on the behavior of  adults who are supposed to be the 'responsible' ones in the world of Little  League.  It's not a masterpiece, that's for sure, but I got more than a few  chuckles.  If anyone has ever played t-ball as a child, or watched his  younger sibling's Little League game, then that person will certainly be  able to identify with this book.
