 I am getting married in 99 days (yes, I know the number), and this book was just what I needed.  It profiles the neuroses that plague brides-to-be everywhere, such as searching for the perfect wedding-day shoes, dealing with coworkers who JUST DON'T SEEM TO REALIZE THAT YOUR WEDDING IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN WORK, and caterers who are high on drugs.  The author struggles as to whether or not she should wear her mother's wedding dress...it IS hideously ugly, but maybe it can be remade?  So many wedding trials and tribulations, but in the end, it all works out, as it will for all brides....worth a read!!!
