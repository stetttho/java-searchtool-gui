 I have read only two of Oprah's books so far, and this one is far better than the first (Deep End of the Ocean). It was definitely interesting, in the sort of way that people want to view car wrecks.  I had a hard time identifying with Delores, the main character, at points because a) she refused to help herself and b) she went through so many bizarre life experiences.  So I can not say how I would react to many of the situations that she experienced, but I can say that I wanted to reach inside the book, give her a good slap, and scream, "Do something!  Anything!"  But the best characters aren't always likeable (look at Scarlett O'Hara).  Lamb crafted a book that piqued and held my interest until the very end and helped to show many of the mistakes that women make in the name of supposed "love," "friendship," and family ties. Definitely worth a read, but be warned - it is depressing at points.
