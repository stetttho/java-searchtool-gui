 Louis Grizzard would sneer.  This book, although it has its funny moments, isn't as accurate a picture of "Redneck" humor/satire as the writer would portray.  In fact, I found myself wondering if the authors had ever been to the South at all!  Don't get me wrong; it's not all bad, but other books, such as "A Southern Belle Primer" capture the flavor these people tried to create much better.
