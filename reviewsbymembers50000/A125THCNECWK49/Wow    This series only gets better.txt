 If you look closely at the Harry Potter series of books, you will see that books 1-4 get progressively thicker.  That's because, in my opinion, they're getting better and better! Once again, Jo Rowling weaves a  spell-binding tale of Harry, Hermoine and Ron's 4th year at Hogwarts.  Just  when you think her characters can't get any more original, she introduces  more oddities.  Furthermore, I can honestly say that Rowling's plot twists  are very unpredictable.  I am 22 years old, and was held just as intrigued  by this book as I was by the first three - actually, more so. Definitely  a book worth buying.  Entertaining, suspenseful, exciting, original...and  as I said, the series just keeps getting better and better!  If you liked  the first three books, then you are going to LOVE Goblet of Fire!  So what  are you waiting for?  Go buy it already!
