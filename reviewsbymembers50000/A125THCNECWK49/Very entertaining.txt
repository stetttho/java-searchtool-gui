 This is an absolute hoot for the pet owner.  The only problem I had with the magazine is that you have to know famous "brand names" fairly well in order to understand a lot of the jokes it subtly offers. With references to "Ives Saint Bernard" and "Canine Klein," and pictorals of "supermodel" doggies, readers will find themselves highly amused.
