 Well...let's see...this book is very well-written.  The author is obviously widely-read and has a master command on the English language.  On the other hand, the book was full of so many obscure references (i.e. Salman Rushdie and the fatwa, all kinds of random artists, etc.) that if you are not as "literate" as Brauner (which very few of us are), then you can get lost in some of his analogies.  He's kind of like the Dennis Miller of literature with his random references.  I consider myself fairly well-read, but in order to really "get" this book one must be a master of history, art, and philosophy as well. With all that aside, the quirky insights into human life were very amusing.  For example, he snacks at a "hip" coffee house where the employees provide terrible service, for to actually acknowledge the patrons' existance and/or hustle with their orders would be beneath them.  Also, Ronnie, the main character, has a way of discussing things candidly, though they may be politically incorrect and controversial. I realize this book is primarily a love story and about how Ronnie doesn't really appreciate 'Sherpa,' aka Karen, his girlfriend.  I think, however, that the author missed the point.  Sure, Karen was a great girl, but why was everyone trying to make Ronnie see that she was perfect for him when really she wasn't?  She wasn't his intellectual equal, which was a very important quality to Ronnie, and they had nothing to talk about, nothing in common, except sex.  Ronnie admittedly attended her protests for the prospect of getting in her pants.   I felt that Ronnie needed someone more of a thinker, such as his sister (except for that whole being-related part), to date and find happiness...and I felt that Karen needed someone more artsy, passionate and emotional. A book that makes you think, but can get a bit overanalytical.  I'd recommend getting it from the public library rather than spending the $13.
