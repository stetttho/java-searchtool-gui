 Sigh...guess I'm getting a bit mushy in my mid-twenties.  =)  This book, although a bit cliched, shows the strength of a woman who must deal with a man that is stuck in his own past.   An earlier reviewer said that the herione of the story was "stupid" for leaving Garrett because he could not get over Catherine; I disagree.  That was my favorite part of the book.  Women everywhere have to make difficult decisions that show clearly they are not responsible for their men's emotional hazards.  Rather than hang on to Garrett and hope that he would change, Theresa chose to control her own destiny and provide a form of finality, closure. Of course Garrett recognizes his shortcomings in the end, but would he have really changed had they gotten back together?  It is all well and good for him to say that he was going to change, but the reader never gets to see if he would or not.  This, I think, allowed Theresa to have a happy memory of their relationship rather than a bitter one. Well worth a read - just bring the hanky.
