 Out of nostalgia, I am going through amazon.com, searching for books that particularly stood out from my middle school years...this book was one of them (along with Alfred G. Graebner Memorial High School Handbook of Rules and Regulations, also by Conford, and also out of print - tragedy!).  Ellen Conford had such a way of identifying with her readers.  In this book, the protagonist finds a lamp, which of course, when she rubs it, produces a genie that grants her every desire.  Or so she thinks.  For example, when she wishes for the "perfect man," a guy suddenly pops up in her bedroom, bearing flowers in hand. So saddened am I by the gradual disappearance of my childhood books such as this that I am going to try to track them all down and buy them for my future children.  Other "classics" that are out of print (grrr) are This Time of Darkness by H.M. Hoover and the entire Trixie Belden series.  Sniff sniff.
