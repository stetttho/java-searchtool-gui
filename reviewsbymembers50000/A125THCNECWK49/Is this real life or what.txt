 I absolutely loved this book.  Sure, Bridget is neurotic, and some people will tag her as a bit flighty, but that's what makes her so amusing.  I can't tell you how many times I thought, "I do that too!" when  reading this book (i.e. when hungover Bridget lies in bed, refusing to move  her head, and suddenly the thought, "Ooh, I could really fancy some  chips" pops into her head).  It shows how many women want to be raging  feminists but deep down go to war with their inner selves who just want to  get married.
