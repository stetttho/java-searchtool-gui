 Although the author obviously has talent, she has wasted little of it on this book about characters with whom audiences do not wish to identify. The mother in this book is a basket case, completely uncaring  about her family, and the reader finds himself unable to sympathize with  her over the loss of her son.  Most readers will sympathize with her  husband instead; he has born the brunt of her problems for years and  continues to do so after she loses her son at a class reunion. I really  had problems getting into this book.  Admittedly, at the end, it did leave  me thinking about it somewhat, but it is slow and unrealistic.  I don't  consider this book to be any sort of "future classic."  If I  don't consider reading a book for a 2nd time, then something's wrong (my  friends have always teased me about reading books over and over); this book  was borrowed from a friend and returned promptly when I finished it. Not  horrible, but there are thousands of other books more worth your time.
