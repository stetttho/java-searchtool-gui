 Hmmmm. I grew up in rural North Carolina and Georgia around all the sorts of people and job situations that the author investigated. She wouldn't last a month if she were really in this sort of situation. As other readers said before, she totally relied on previous money...but her main "shield" to me was that she knew it was all TEMPORARY.  She never faced the dispair of never really having money and not knowing how long such a situation would last. I did appreciate her enlightening the plight of the workers and the housing conditions, but she herself annoyed the heck out of me.  Whining, moaning and groaning about basic work (having been a waitress myself - get over it sister) and being all hoity toity about the jobs that she would even interview for (I mean, hel-lo, if she was truly homeless and out of $$ I don't think she would have been so picky) - it got a little old. But I do think it was a definitely good, although upper-class and social-class prejudiced, read.
