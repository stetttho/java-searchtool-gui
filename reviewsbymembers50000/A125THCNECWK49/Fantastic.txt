 This is a MUST READ for every bride-to-be.  In fact, I plan on buying this for an engagement gift for every friend who gets engaged from now on.  It helped me to deal with weird emotions that were running through my head during my engagement, and helped to focus on those issues that no one really likes to talk about...after all the first year is supposed to be the "honeymoon" period!!  I highly recommend.  GREAT BOOK.
