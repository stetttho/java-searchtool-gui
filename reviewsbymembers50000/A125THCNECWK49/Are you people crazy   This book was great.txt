 I thought Books 4 and 5 were the sucky ones.  I was relieved to have Book 6 come along and be filled with action.  I felt it went much faster than Books 4 and 5.  For those of you saying this book was just "filler" until book 7 comes out...well, DUH, of course it is, I mean, JKR said there would be 7 books all along, so what makes you think there would be some spectacular climax in Book 6?  Personally I appreciated Snape turning out to be the bad guy, and although unfortunate that he died, I think that JKR tries to expose a fact of life - people can be mistaken about other people, and his death showed some of Dumbledore's humanness.  He wanted to believe the best in everybody, but unfortunately, everyone isn't good and doesn't deserve a second chance.    The reason I give the book 4 stars instead of 5 is that I agree with other reviewers - I don't know how Harry will ever defeat Voldemort because he clearly isn't that smart or gifted; he's primarily lucky and somewhat stupid.  I actually hope JKR kills him off in the end because it would be a refreshing and memorable change to see a series have the bad guy win in the end, ala "Silence of the Lambs."    Oh, and what was the point of bringing up the idea that Neville could have been the chosen one in book 5?  In this book JKR points out that prophesies don't always have to come true, so perhaps Neville will kill off both Harry and Voldy for us.
