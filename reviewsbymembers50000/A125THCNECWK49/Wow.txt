 I thought this was a really thought-provoking book.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it could have been a little more descriptive, and at some points, the plot fell together just a little too neatly. Otherwise, though, it's very interesting.  Stanley Yelnats must go to a detention camp to serve a punishment for a crime he didn't commit.  He must endure the idiosyncracies of his fellow "campers" and wardens in order that he may survive.  But most importantly (in my humble opinion) he forges a friendship with "Zero," a camper who has never been or done anything worthy or useful - at least to ordinary observers. This is a beautiful tale of human frailty, prejudice, friendship, trust and of promises broken and redeemed.  Definitely worth a read, no matter what your age (I am 23).
