 Words can not begin to describe the depth of emotion I felt after reading this book.  My boyfriend at the time kept pestering me to read it, so when I finally got around to doing so (you know how it is when you  "have" to read something - sometimes you tend to approach it with  a "whatever" attitude) I couldn't believe I had waited so long to  begin the book. I could not put it down.  I took it to the pool.  I took  it to work.  I stayed up late (and woke up grumpy because of my lack of  sleep) to read it.  And then I wanted more of it. Irving does such a  fabulous job of character development it is unbelievable.  One can see the  naive attitudes of John, Owen's best friend, so clearly and how they follow  him throughout his life.  The devotion that Owen feels toward John and his  gratitude that John treats him like he's "normal" is evidenced by  all that he gives up for John.  The angst of cousin Hester, the attitudes  of the townspeople...these people just came ALIVE! I was so thrilled with  this book that I ran out and bought "The 154-Pound Marriage,"  also by Irving.  Perhaps "Meany" spoiled me, but I didn't find  this other work near as stimulating.  It was an interesting read, yes, but  it paled in comparison to the magnificance of "Meany." READ IT,  READ IT, READ IT!
