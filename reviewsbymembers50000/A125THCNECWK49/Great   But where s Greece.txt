 This book is really good.  It tells some tips that others leave out, such as:  an easy way to remember what time it is when using 24 hour time - just subtract 12!  For example, 23:30 would be 23-12 = 11:30 American time!  Also, regarding shows in London - Steves suggested booking directly through the website of the show and not through a ticket broker.  One website I was planning on booking opera tix through wanted $120/ticket...same tickets, direct, were 45 Euros...good savings tip! I was very disappointed, however, that he did not consider Greece good enough to make it in the "best of" guide.  Oh well!
