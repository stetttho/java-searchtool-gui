 To a lot of the pennywise people in the world, $20 is too much to pay for a single great idea.   Even if it is a universal truth...   A timeless piece of wisdom...   A gift from the Universe.   People complain if a work in too simplistic...   Too short...   Or too long...   Too bad -- for them. They that are disconteded, malcontents, miscreants!   Many of the greatest works of self-help and non-fiction deliver but a single or a couple of Aha Moments.   The Four Agreements -- Who Moved My Cheese? -- The Tipping Point -- Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus -- As a Man Thinketh...   Super Mega Monster Books all these, and how many ideas can you remember about them?   If you are a fan of the author of The One Thing You Need to Know, and find yourself seriously considering this book, it may just be that this is the book you need in your life right now.   The meanings will present themselves to you if you are open, receptive, and READY!   If you get an AHA! for $20, it's a bargain!   Also recommended:  the CD "Voice Lessons To Go" by Vaccarino
