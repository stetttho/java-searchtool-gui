 These progressive scan dvd players do give a much more vivid and exciting picture. This unit gives particularly good sound, and I like to watch and sing along with my many concert dvds, including the Cream Reunion at Prince Albert Hall, and the Bob Dylan Documentaries.  I also recommend a great CD called "Voice Lessons To Go" by Vacarino for anyone who wants to really improve their voice and/or singing.
