 Kim has taken on the role of sexual provocateur and sage in the shadow of her super-successful television role on Sex And The City.  To her credit her character on the show based all of her witty comments on personal  experience, but in this book, the author goes far beyond her own scope of first-hand knowledge to present a seemingly well-researched and  broad-minded approach to increasing the reader's sexual intelligence.  Beyond being just a fun and attractive coffee table book, this is a sexy, fascinating, and compelling book to actually READ!
