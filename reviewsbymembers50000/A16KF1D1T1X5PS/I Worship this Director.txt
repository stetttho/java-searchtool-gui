 Since viewing Buffalo 66 at Sundace a few years ago, I am and always will be a great fan on Vincent Gallo. This movie was challenging, but ultimately very rewarding to me as a film-maker and someone who respects an independent vision in a film. And I really enjoyed the oral sex scene -- thanks Vincent!
