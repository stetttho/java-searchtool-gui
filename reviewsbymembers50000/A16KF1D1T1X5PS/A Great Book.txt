 Men, this is a must read.  Especially if you have not done any self-help Manhood work yet ala "Iron John" or the Sterling Men's Weekend.   Perhaps this book could be your awakening.  I read it over a year ago, and I am still thinking about some of the concepts this author discusses in the book.  I highly recommend it for any man, as well as the other book and the seminar I mentioned above.  Nothing appeals to a woman as much as a truely masculine man.  And nothing is better for a man than to be comfortable with and secure in his own masculinity.
