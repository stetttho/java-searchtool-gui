 Steven Covey is one of the greatest writers alive on the subject of Effectiveness.   This book and his 7 Habits are two classics of self-help that deserve a place on your motivational library shelf.  For those really into self-help, I also recommend the CD "Voice Lessons to Go" by Vaccarino -- a disk that can change your voice and your life.
