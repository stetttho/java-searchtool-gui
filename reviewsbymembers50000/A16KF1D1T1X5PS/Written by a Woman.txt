 I think this book is interesting, but symptomatic of women's tendency to over-complicate everything and come up for mysterious and misguided logical explanations for why a guy isn't into them. Despite this author's erudite explanations, the real fact of the matter is that guys want women who can be real with them, and who they can bond with sexually without a ton of drama or co-dependency.   Notice that this book is written by a woman for women, and I offer you a simple analogy: have you ever noticed that the way a woman dresses when she wants to impress other women is very different than what turns a man's head?
