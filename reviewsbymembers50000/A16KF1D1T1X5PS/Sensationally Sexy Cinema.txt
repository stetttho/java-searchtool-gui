 This is an astoundingly beautiful, provocative, and sexy drama set in Paris and starring the greatest actor of the 20th century. I remember watching this movie for the first time with a gorgeous sensuous woman and a bottle of Crystal champagne, and I would highly recommend the experience. This is an awesome movie to watch with a hot date in the early stages of a romantic relationship -- guaranteed to get the sparks flying.
