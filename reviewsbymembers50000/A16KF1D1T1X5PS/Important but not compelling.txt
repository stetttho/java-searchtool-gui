 I understand that the rigors of academia require exhaustive research and documentation, however, that is no excuse for writing which is too dense, difficult to read, or not engaging to the reader. If more "academics" would learn how to write like real people instead of researchers, perhaps their messages would be communicated more effectively... and maybe people would LEARN more. Isn't that the point?   There is no excuse for bad writing -- even if you are a genius!
