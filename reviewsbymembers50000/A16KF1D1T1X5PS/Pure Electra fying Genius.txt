  This dvd should get a MacArthur Genius Award...  it is sexy, fun, and gets you into great shape!  But the best thing about it is how EASY it makes this workout seem.  Almost TOO EASY! Bravo!  I also loved and would recommend to anyone who enjoys singing, the  CD "Voice Lessons to Go" by Vaccarino.  It's not as sexy as  the Carmen Electra dvd, but it is just as easy to use it and improve one's self.
