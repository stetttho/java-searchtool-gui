 I have met Neil Strauss, and I worship him.   Not only is he a BRILLIANT writer, he is also one of the most absolutely intelligent, charming, and FEARLESS people I have ever met in my entire life. I watched him approach a large table of 9's and 10's at a hot club on the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles, get the whole table laughing and socially validating him, and then he walked away with a 10's phone number and an insta-date to meet a bunch of the girls later at another club. He is the man who truly made me understand that the Seduction Community is about improving the world -- when this guy walks into a room, you can soon feel the entire party kicking up a notch.   This book on the Secret Society of Pickup Artists is one of the great surprises you will get from reading a work of non-fiction; no matter how high your expectations are, they will be surpassed by his insight, wit, and clever word-craft.   The greatest gift you will get from your time penetrating the game will be to spend several hours in the company of one of America's truly great working writers. You will put this book down after turning the last page and you will feel within yourself that (because of this book) you have become a better person. The man will make you understand that your only limitations are in your own mind.   Neil Strauss is my idol, and after reading this new work by the co-author of Jenna Jameson's best-selling memoir, he will doubtless be yours too.
