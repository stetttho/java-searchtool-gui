 Yoga Journal is excellent for people who love yoga, no matter where you are in your practice. Writings on anatomy,  asana, meditation articles, diet articles -- there is an abundance with real respect for the roots of yoga.  I recommend this magazine wholeheartedly. I learn so much about body and spirit from Yoga Journal, and every issue continues to inspire and inform my practice.  Namaste.
