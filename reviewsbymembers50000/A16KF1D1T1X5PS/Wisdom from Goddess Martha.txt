 Martha is a Goddess, a Genius, a Trend-setter, and a SAGE!   This book is a classic piece of non-fiction from the queen of style, success, and savoir-faire.   She is better than Trump, and this book is better than any other success book on the market today. It is simple, EZ to use, and a lot of fun to move through. It's more like an experience than a book.   Also recommended: "Voice Lessons to Go" CD by Vaccarino
