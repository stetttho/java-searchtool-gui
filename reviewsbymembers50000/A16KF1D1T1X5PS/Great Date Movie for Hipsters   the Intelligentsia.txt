 I have always found the beauty and sensuality of Bertolucci's films to be extremely seductive.  This one is much more intellectual than it is visceral, and VERY strange, very cinema-referential, and VERY EROTICALLY CHARGED.    It's the story of a young American who moves in with a young French man and his super sexy sister.  They play all kinds of intellectual mind games and give each other sexual dares.    There is plenty of footage of the super-desirable french young thing naked and engaging in sexual play with the good-looking young american.  But it's not a straight-out turn on like the films "9 1/2 Weeks" or "Last Tango in Paris" -- although it is definitely a sexy film that is good for a date flick.
