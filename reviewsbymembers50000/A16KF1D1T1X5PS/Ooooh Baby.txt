 When I lived on my boat in Marina del Rey, there was a guy at the end of the dock living on this huge rusting old hulk of a mega-yacht for a few months (before the Sherrifs impounded it for unpaid dock fees) and that guy smoked a turkey in one of these things for Thanksgiving. Oh man was that bird DELICIOUS!
