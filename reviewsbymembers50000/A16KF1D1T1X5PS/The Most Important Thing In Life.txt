 Especially for women, relationships are the juice of life.   If you are feeling challenged or are coming up against barriers in this aspect of being human, please do yourself a favor and get this book or some other book on relationships.   We are not born perfect -- sometimes we have to study a little to improve aspects of our lives like making love, working in the business world, or having fulfilling personal relationships.   Don't be ashamed -- be proactive!   -Clint Arthur  author of "FREE YOUR LOVE NOW"
