 I watched Jerry Lewis on David Letterman's show last night, and it was great to see him looking good and speaking so fondly of his old pal and partner Dean Martin.  This book presents a very compassionate portrait of the love/ hate relationship between the two legendary entertainers, and a great inside look at the world of international celebrity.  A very well written and fun book.
