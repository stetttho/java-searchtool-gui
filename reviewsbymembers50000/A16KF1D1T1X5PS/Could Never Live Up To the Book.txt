 This movie is very well done and very sexy, erotic, entertaining, thrilling... and as a producer of erotic films and a serious student of the genre, these are high compliments from me.   It suffers by comparison to the book simply because the book was one of the greatest works of erotic literature ever written.   If you can't stand reading, then by all means watch and enjoy the film. But if you enjoy a completely unpredictable page-turner of an intimate novel, get this one FedExed overnight.
