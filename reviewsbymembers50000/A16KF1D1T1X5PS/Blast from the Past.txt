 And it's about time!  This is one of the greatest shows ever to grace the air-waves, and it's well past high time they brought this baby out on DVD.  Great for any time you need some comfort food television to watch, just in time for winter cold and flu season.  Put your boss' voicemail on speed-dial 'cause you're gonna be calling in sick once this set hits your mailbox.
