 This is an excellent and important book of its genre, but I will never forget Frank McCourt's repeated advice to us after studying creative writing with him in High School -- write what you know.  If you just stick to that little kernel, the worst grammer, the worst punctuation, the worst spelling -- none of it will matter.  When you know your subject, the writing is effortless... and amazing.
