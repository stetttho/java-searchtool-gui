 Candace is a true goddess of modern new york fiction.   I have admired her work ever since she appeared on the Montel Williams Show with my friend Tom Leonardi (author of "Secrets of Sensual Lovemaking").   This book rings truer and is more insightful than anything she has written -- she has really matured and develloped into a great writer.
