 This is a brilliant little DVD -- one which is fun to watch and very educational/informative.  John Cleese is an extremely talented and funny guide through the varieties and vintages, and a friendly host on this beginning introduction to all things Grape.  I was delighted to receive this as a gift, and I anxiously watched it right away when I got home that night -- who wouldn't?  The surprising thing is that I found myself watching it a second time because there were many little nuances and tidbits I wanted to be sure I picked up on.    I'd give this one 97 Robert Parker points!
