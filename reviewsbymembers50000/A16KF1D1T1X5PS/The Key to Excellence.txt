 Jordan's book illustrates the most important aspect of success -- call it "passion" or "desire" or "drive" -- it's that internal fire that compells a person to keep practicing, to keep perfecting, to keep going for "it" until the goal is achieved. When the work is not optional but the Only Option, everything in life takes on a different perspective -- and that is how dreams become statistics in the record books.    Thanks MJ for holding up the standard and laying it out so clearly in the pages of your book!
