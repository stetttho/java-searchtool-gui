 I think this was the best one because the star who played batman wasn't much of a star and didn't overshadow the character, and the story was very unpredictable.  I remember how great the first Batman was when I saw it in the theaters in the 80's, and this was about as much fun to watch and was almost as entertaining on DVD as that one was on the big screen.
