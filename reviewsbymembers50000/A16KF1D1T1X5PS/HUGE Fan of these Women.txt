 My wife and I were on the lookout for this show ever since we met the producer on a safari in Africa -- and we were not disappointed. The lady who created this show is so super-cool and a very hard-core super-fun partyer, so it's no wonder that these lasses put on a show that's worth every penny!  For anyone who enjoys singing, I would also recommend the CD "Voice Lessons to Go" by Vaccarino -- it's a great way to do something constructive and fun for your own voice.
