 It's funny, when I was studying creative writing with Frank McCourt, there was no mention of this book in his classroom. And in my conversations with Neil Strauss, "Style" himself never once brought up this book on Style. Who is it, then, that reads this little manual? Academics?   Everything it says is important, but the most imporant aspect of great writing is clear and engaging communication.   You can read this book, but you might do better to read the best writers. McCourt, Strauss, Hemingway, Hunter S. Thompson, E.L. Doctrow, Tom Wolfe -- now there's a syllabus for learning the elements of Style.
