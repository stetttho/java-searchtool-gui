 This is one of the books that every adult should read. I found several stories in the book which seemed like they were right out of my own life situations -- and you probably will too. It is very universal and will help you.   I also really enjoyed and would recommend to anyone interested in self-help, the cd "Voice Lessons to Go" by Vaccarino
