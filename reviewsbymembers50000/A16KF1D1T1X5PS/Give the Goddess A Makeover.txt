 Women are the center of it all.  The center of the family.  The center of the marriage.  It is so vital for every woman to be feeling great about herself and her life, because when that  joy starts to go, the little extra sparks disappear.    I was amazed at how fun this book was to read, and how clever some of the ideas are.  Even for a man, it's a great book to read for clues and insights into your woman's mind body and soul.  Women, please get this book and use it -- your men are counting on you!
