 The thing I love so much about the Ultimate Female Orgasms described so well in this little book is that when she has one (or more likely, several of them) there is no doubt in your mind about the event.  There is absolute, physical evidence to let you know that you have been a participant in the event.    That lack of evidence is the "problem" with "Regular" orgasms -- the ones that most people deal with in their everyday sexual lives.  And the little extra benefit of the "Technique" for giving her the ultimate pleasure which the reader gains as a result of reading Tommy's book.  If you are looking for a book that will help you become a masterful lover, an expert at the G-Spot and much more knowledgable about female ejac.... THERE IS NO BETTER OR MORE FUN BOOK TO READ than this one.    To the insecure or emotionally wounded reader, Tommy may sound as if he is bragging about his conquests in this book.  To me, when I read this book on a short plane flight, I got the feeling that I was sitting in on a conversation between Tom and a good friend, as the master of female sexual pleasure bestowed countless pearls of wisdom on his pal -- gems that have been obviously discovered as a result of MUCH personal experience in bed with women of all ages.  The overwhelming impression that I got about the author is that he LOVES GIVING WOMEN PLEASURE, and the clear goal of this book is to explain his methods in the simplest plain-English possible, so that the most people can benefit from this sincere wisdom.  If you are going to buy a single book on how to give a woman sexual pleasure, this should be  the one.  It is so simply written and explained, so easy to read and use the technique, and SO EFFECTIVE at helping even the lamest guy get the most frigid girl to scream and shudder with animal passion.
