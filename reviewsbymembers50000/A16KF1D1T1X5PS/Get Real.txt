 If you need it, get it. Don't fool yourself -- 'cause you're not fooling anyone else.   This subject is tough but REAL -- it must be dealt with or else you are going to be missing out on opportunities to be with people who might like you but who get turned off by your lack of true self-awareness.   I have a good friend who is quite challenged by this issue -- and I really feel bad about it because nobody can really say anything to him about it, and it is a serious problem. It is definitely costing him.
