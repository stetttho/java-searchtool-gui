 I have been an Apple person since 1984, when I got my first Mac. Since then, I have been a devotee of the elegant styling and functionality of all things Apple. The Ipod is a fine cousin to the early macs andcurrent offerings from Jobs and Company. Long live Apple, long live Macs, and long live the Ipod!
