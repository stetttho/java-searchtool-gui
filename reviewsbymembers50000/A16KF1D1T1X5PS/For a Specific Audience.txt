 This movie is erotic and provocative, but challenges some very sensitive barriers in some people, and therefor is not for everyone.  If you are open-minded, unmarried, intellectual (or pseudo-intellectual), a hipster into foreigh arthouse films, or just plain curious about the inner workings of an affair, this may be a good choice for you.  If you are married to an insecure person or frown heavily on the concept of extramarital affairs, this could be a mistake.
