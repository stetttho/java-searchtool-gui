 This movie was really funny, and ben stiller and owen wilson work great together on the big screen. Snoop Dogg as huggy bear is perfect, and anything with Vince Vaughn in it is usually pretty good. The only reason i give the movie 4 stars instead of 5, is because i am getting a bit tired of old tv sitcoms being turned into movies. Be a bit more original. If they can think of the idea to make a sitcom about Starsky and Hutch back in the 70's, then screenplay writers can write something on there own too today. Doesnt take away from the movie though, a great comedy with a lot of laughs.
