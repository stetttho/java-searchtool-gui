 Lupica delivers again! This time with a little different style than he normally uses, not as much comedy in this one as there in his others. But still, a great book and one of my favorites of Lupica. Suspenseful, greaty storyline, he kept me guessing so much i could not put the book down. Literally. Read it in one day because everytime i would say "ok after this chapter i'll take a break" he would end a chapter with a phrase that makes you just keep going. Great writing style, very basic...but thats whats great about it. Read this book, you will have a great time trying to figure out the mystery, i know i did! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
