 Napoleon Dynamite is a VERY funny movie, with many one liners that arent really supposed to be funny, but really are funny because of the way Napoleon says them ('Idiots' 'Gosh') The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because i do believe that the movie is given a LITTLE too much credit than it deserves...The movie has absolutely zero point, nothing. There are many errors and mistakes that you can find if you go to moviemistakes.com. But, it is an independent film so you cannot expect a perfect movie. However, where the film lacks in plot it more than makes up for it with hilarious scenes one after another. I found myself laughing nearly every scene...i would recommend this movie especially if you are watching with friends, because everything is funnier while with your friends.
