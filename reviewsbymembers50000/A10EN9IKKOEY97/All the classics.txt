 This CD is very very good. All of the beatles number one hits on one CD, and all digitally remastered. They all sound great! Personal favorites include Let it Be and Hey Jude, but like i said, all of the songs sound great. How can you go wrong with all of their Number one hits from the U.K. and U.S.? Great CD and defitely worth buying.
