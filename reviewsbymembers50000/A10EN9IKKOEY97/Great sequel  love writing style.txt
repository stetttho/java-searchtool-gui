 Mike Lupica has become one of my favorite authors of all time. His storylines and plots are just great, and everything comes together in the end. He keeps you waiting and wanting to continue reading, and then at the end it all pays off and he never leaves you hanging. Red Zone is no different. I dont want to give too much away that the "professional reviewers" already have, so i wont really tell about the story. Just know this: that its about Jack Molloy, the football owner of the New York Hawks, and his struggle as the owner basically. The thing that makes Lupica so great, and so readable, is how basic his writing style is. You dont hear something like "He angrily yelled" or "she obnoxiously said"...its he said she said. Very basic, but absolutely great. The ONLY thing that i dont always like with Lupica is that you cant go 2 chapters without a bar or strip club scene. But since most of his books are about sports, i dont think i can blame him, as a lot of professional atheletes probably do go to the bars and strip clubs. But anyways, Red Zone is a GREAT sequel to Bump and Run, and its definitely worth the read. Great book. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! p.s....also, if you like this one look into Travel Team, and Too Far...Those are his 2 newest books and they are just great.
