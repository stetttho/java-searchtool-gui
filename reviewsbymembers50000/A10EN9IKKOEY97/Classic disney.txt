 Angels in the Outfield is the classic disney movie. The movie has a pretty good story with Roger and JP leading the way as foster children. The movie has many very funny scenes, especially one of my favorites which is when the guy buys them food and drinks at the game, but puts their nachos in his seat so he can have hands to give out the drinks and other food. Then Roger says "wheres the nachos" and he sits right on them. "im saving them for later" is his answer. Makes me laugh all the time for some reason. Danny Glover delivers a great performance as the "pissed off coach, coaching a horrible team"...But with Gods angels helping the real life baseball angels, the team is no longer horrible. Very good movie, kids will DEFINITELY enjoy it. Its the classic underdog tale that many kid oriented sports movies of the 90's are about. (Mighty Ducks, Little Giants, Big Green, etc.) highly recommended!
