 This router does everything that it is supposed to do, so i dont really know how to talk that bad about it. It was a very quick setup and installation, in fact the disc that it comes with pretty much makes sure you cant mess it up. By no means do you have to be a tech junkie to be able to install it, just be able to put a CD in the computer and it tells you what to do. It works great, i am usually at the full 54 mbps, although every now and then that drops to around 36 mbps only because i am 2 floors below where the router is. That only happens every so often, but its not that big of a drawback really, just a little slower than usual. It really is a great buy if you are lookin at having just one modem but many computers around the house. There are 3 computers in my house all getting wireless connection from this router, and everybody is happy with it. I do not really know why some people are tearing this router apart on their reviews, they are talking about installation problems and what not. Its the easiest thing to setup i thought, and i am only 16...So with all that said, BUY THE ROUTER!!!!
