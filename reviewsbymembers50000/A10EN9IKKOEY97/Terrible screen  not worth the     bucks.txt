 I absolutely HATE this screen. It is so tiny, that you cant even see anything barely. I play sports games mainly, but on this screen its nearly impossible to play because you cant see anything. NOT WORTH 150 BUCKS AT ALL!!! There is another option out there that i will tell you about here...Go to best buy, or another electronics company, and buy a power inverter. i have a JENSEN brand 300 watt inverter. It plugs straight into your cigarette lighter spot in the car. Then, if you have a small kitchen tv that some people have, or about a 13 inch tv, you can plug that into the inverter, and have a full sized tv in the back of your car or whereever you want. Defintittely the better option, worth the money...i think the inverter is the same cost as the piece of crap screen.
