 this inverter does wonders. On a road trip this past summer, we drove from colorado all the way out to new york city, with many stops in between. The whole time, we had the tv and ps2 hooked up thru the inverter, and never did we have any problems. played constantly, it was great. DEFINITELY BUY IT if you are looking for a way for your kids to have fun in the car, or wherever. WORTH EVERY LAST PENNY!
