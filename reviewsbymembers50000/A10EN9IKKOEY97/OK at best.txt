 The main reason i give this DVD 3 stars is only because it is Will Ferrell...but the sketches chosen for this apparant "Best of" series were very poor. I only found myself laughing out loud maybe 3 or 4 times, and even then they could have done better. Will Ferrell is such a genious comedian yet this DVD makes him look almost like an amateur. These sketches are OK, but there are SO many more ferrell's that could have and should have been chosen. If you like Will Ferrell and enjoy collecting Ferrell DVDS or what not, then its worth the buy...or if you enjoy just collecting the "SNL Best of's" then have it...but if you want to get a DVD that will make you laugh non stop till you are crying then this is definitely not a good buy. Just stick to the old re-runs that are on E! everynow and then, those will make you laugh more
