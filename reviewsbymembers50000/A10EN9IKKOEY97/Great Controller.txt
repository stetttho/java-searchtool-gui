 The wireless logitech controller for the ps2 is everything i thought i would be, and then some. No longer do you have wires dangling from the ps2, down the floor, and then to where you are playing. You have unlimited range, well 30 feet to be exact. But compare that to the 10 feet or so that the regular controllers offer. ONE downside, although not that big of a hassle, is that IF you get mad and decide to throw your controller or if you just drop it, you cannot just follow the cord to find it. Just keep it in a spot you will remember it, and you will be fine. I heard people saying that the control had a slight delay, so that if you were to hit X the game would not read that for about a quarter of a second. NOT TRUE. The controller performs perfectly with no delays, and is just GREAT overall!!! HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommended!
