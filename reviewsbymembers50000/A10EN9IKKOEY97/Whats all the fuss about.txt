 I was sort of reluctant to buy this product, based on all the poor reviews here at amazon.com. I bought it anyways, mostly because its my only option to be able to play online. When i got it, i was really wondering where everybody was having all the trouble. It was one of the easiest setups i have done to be completely honest with you, and it works like a charm. Take my word for it, and i am by no means a computer genious. It comes with a startup disc that walks you through every possible step. Simple as that! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!
