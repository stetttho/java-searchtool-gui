 Nora Ephron, Tom Hanks, and Meg Ryan are at it again with this romantic comedy. Tom and Meg were a great duo in Sleepless in Seattle, and they equaled their performance in this film. Plus, with great directing and writing by Nora Ephron (i should point out that her sister wrote a lot of the script too, give credit when its due) the film was bound to be great. And great it was. A wonderful story, although not completely original, this is just a very modern day version of 'The Shop Around the Corner' which was a movie a long time ago apparantly (dont know exactly when shop around the corner came around, im only 16). Original or not, Ephron did a great job and changed many little things from the original movie that made the story even better. And with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan as the 2 stars of the movie, its gotta be good! Highly recommended!
