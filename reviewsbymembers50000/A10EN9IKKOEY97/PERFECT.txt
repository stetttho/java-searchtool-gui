 I have had my network adapter for 2 years now, and never have i had a problem with it. Ignore what the people are saying about how the adapter isnt worth it, take my word for it; it definitely is worth it!...It performs perfectly and allows me to enjoy numerous hours of gaming online...Very easy to install, especially because you can just hit *Auto* on half of the settings...so you cant really go wrong (If you do have troubles installing or it just isnt connecting, then just call sony helpline and they will get you up and running before you know it) HIGHLY recommended, great fun!
