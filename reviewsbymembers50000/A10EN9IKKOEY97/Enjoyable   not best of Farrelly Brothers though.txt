 Stuck on you made me laugh, there is no question. Very good comedy, a great storyline. How two conjoined twins set out to Hollywood, one of them is pursuing an acting career, the other has an online chat partner for three years he is meeting there in hollywood. Great acting, and great job with the prosthetics (although i am sure it was a pain for Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear to be stuck together for 3 months.) The only reason i dont give it 5 stars is probably just because i am a huge Farrelly Brothers fan and this isnt the absolute best movie they have made in my opinion, but it was still good.
