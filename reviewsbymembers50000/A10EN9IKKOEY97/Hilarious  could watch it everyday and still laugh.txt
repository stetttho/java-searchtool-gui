 For starters, the editorial reviews are absolutely 100% wrong and false. The movie is not just "intermitttenly funny" as one "proffesional" says, it is constant non stopping laughter funny. Hughes does a great job at making everyone laugh at EVERY scene that is meant to be funny, and still tie in a great story about family, love, friendship, dedication, and many other themes. Steve Martin and the late John Candy were absolutely great on-screen together in this film, and it truly is sad that John Candy has passed because this movie showed his true talent and potential. Overall, P.T.&A. is an outstanding movie that will leave you crying with laughter, crying with sadness, and crying with happiness all at some point throughout the movie...not many movies can say that.
