 I saw this movie just the other day, for the first time. I never had an interest to see the movie, because i was stupid and judged the movie by its cover, which i did not find very appealing. Well my dad (who absolutely loves this movie, its his all time favorite) finally talked me into watching it. I was blown away. The movie was just absolutely amazing. This movie moves ahead of 'Rudy' and 'Hoosiers' in my book as the best sports movie of all time. It was just that good. I mean, the movie is just perfect and inspires you to dream and the impossible can become reality. A GREAT MOVIE ABOUT AMERICAS PASTTIME; BASEBALL...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
