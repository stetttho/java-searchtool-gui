 Definitely the best controller out of the three main video game systems. Can't go wrong, everything performs flawlessly. HOWEVER...if you really want a GREAT controller, look for the wireLESS controller from Logitech. Check my review on it. But the Dual shock 2 is definitely the best wired controller you can find out there...highly recommended if you dont want to pay the 15 extra dollars for the wireless one i was talking about.
