 the movie is hilarious, i will give it that....but the plot is just SO stupid and not believable at all. I mean, if you look past the plot problems and the believablity issues, the movie would be great. But i couldnt see past it. Although some of the scenes did have me laughing hysterically, it wasnt enough to make me enjoy the movie THAT much...Thats just my opinion
