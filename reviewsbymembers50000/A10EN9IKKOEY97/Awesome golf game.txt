 Tiger Woods 05 is definitely a GREAT game. I bought 2003, and then missed out on 04 (which is when the gameface and stuff was added), so then when i got 05 i realized how big of a jump it was from 2003-2005. The Gameface II is insane, how you can mess with EVERY POSSIBLE thing, even if you have a dimple or not (like it even matters too much, but that even makes it cooler!) The gameplay is so good, and the graphics are amazing. The only thing i found that wasnt good was a few glitches, like grass floating in mid-air...but thats ok its no big deal really...Overall, there are so many things that you can do (Real time events, season, dream 18, legend tour...) that you will play this game for days on end without stopping. It is THAT fun...HIGHLY recommended
