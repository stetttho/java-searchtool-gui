 After not being too interested in going to the theatres to see Ray, i decided to buy it on DVD because of the great reviews, and i am glad i did. See, i am only 16, and i did not really know of Ray Charles too much. I just thought of him as a blind pianist and did not really know about his life story. This movie shows me what i missed in that time period. He was a simply amazing man with talent unheard of. Ray Charles is an inspiration to me and should be for everyone in the world.  Jamie Foxx should win Best Performance with his amazing job of acting as Ray. After watching the special features with the real Ray Charles, i realized how good of a job Foxx did. Everything Foxx does is the EXACT same way Ray would have done it. Simply amazing. I was blown away when watching the movie, all the hardships that Ray Charles overcame with his blindness, and his heroin addiction, his flashbacks to his brother's accidental drowning...just inspires me more than i have been ever before. Ray Charles is a legend that lives on forever.
