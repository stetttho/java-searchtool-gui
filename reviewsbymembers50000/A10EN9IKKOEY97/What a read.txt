 '4th and Fixed' was an excellently written book. Rivers kept me guessing from start to end and I could not put the book down. He goes deep within the NFL and it made me wonder if fixed games are going on in real life! Rivers used so much detail in describing all of the characters, events, and places that I had the picture painted perfectly into my head. He also threw in a little bit of comedy here and there especially when describing Roscoe getting in and out of his car. It had me laughing everytime. Overall, this is my favorite fiction sports book and I would recommend this book to any sports fan.
