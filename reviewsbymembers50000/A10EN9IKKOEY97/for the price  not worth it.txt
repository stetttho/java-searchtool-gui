 This game really isnt THAT different that nhl 2004 (which i absolutely loved by the way)...a few things changed like now the scores are more realistic, you can do the open ice control thing, etc...but overall, there isnt a HUGE change, which disappointed me. When you see the trailers on commercials or online the game looks amazing, but i just dont find that when i am playing it. For one, this game seems more to me like NHL HITZ because you cannot go into the neutral zone without getting your clocked cleaned, very unrealistic. I mean, in real nhl its not like you have tons of ice to maneuver around in while in the neutral zone, but i do know that you dont get crushed everytime you get the puck in real life. I am waiting for nhl 2006 to come out, and hopefully EA will get some of these reviews and improve on their game, and maybe get back into being the #1 video game hockey franchise again...But until then, i would go out and buy espn nhl 2k5 (which is by no means perfect, but DEFINITELY better than nhl 2005) for a meesly $20 and hold off until next year for a better version.
