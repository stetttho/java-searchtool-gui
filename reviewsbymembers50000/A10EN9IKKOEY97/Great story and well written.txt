 Travel Team is the first novel i have read from Mike Lupica and i will be going out very soon to buy many more of his sports novels. The story of travel team is great, how a 12 year old "little man" named Danny who is very small for his age overcomes his defeats and also renews a relationship with his father, who becomes his coach. The novel is very touching at times in which Richie (his dad) is talking to Danny. The only way to describe the book is already written on the front fold of the book, "Mike Lupica delivers a rousing tale of the underdog that will leave you cheering through the final page." That statement is SO true...book highly recommended for any age, although many younger ones ages 10-16 would probably enjoy it even more. Great book!
