 In my opinion, out of the three SNl Best Of's that i have watched so far (Will Ferrell volumes 1 and 2, and Chris Farley) this is the funniest and best yet. Dana Carvey is a brilliant impressionist and is able to transform his own natural voice into anything he wants to. Whether it be The Church Lady, Hans, Garth, George Bush...etc. The other two Best Of's that i watched actually left out some of the more funnier sketches. I believe the sketches compiled into this DVD are the funniest Dana Carvey did. Also, the extras are great too. You can watch Dana's original audition for SNL, watch many outtakes, a sketch that was actually completely cut from the actual show, and his appearances on Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien. Highly recommended for Dana Carvey fans, SNL fans, or just comedian fans in general...Expect to be laughing to the point of tears in this great DVD!
