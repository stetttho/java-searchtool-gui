 Friday Night Lighs perfectly portrays Texas high school football. It is not just a game there, its a way of life. Whole towns shut down on friday nights cause everyone is at the game...the story of the movie is amazing and exciting, the best part is that it is all true. Great movie, highly recommended for the entire family!
