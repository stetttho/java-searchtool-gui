 MVP Baseball is by far the best baseball game i have ever played. The new hitters eye is the best part, because in previous versions of this game i found myself swinging at EVERYTHING and completely guessing at what pitch was coming. In this game, the ball will flash a certain color as the pitcher releases it, each color represents a certain type of pitch. ie, white=fastball or cutter, green=changeup or any other offspeed pitch, red=curve or slider, etc. This feature really is great because now you have some sort of idea on what is coming, just like most real ball players do. Dynasty Mode is great again, not many real changes were needed from 2004 but its still great. I have yet to try owner mode, but i have heard its great because you can control every aspect of anything really. You can create a ballpark, make key decisions about team finances, pricing, coaching staff, and more. With ALL that said, i will repeat what is pissing everyone else off too, which is WHY IS THERE NO BARRY BONDS!!! Read the other reviews because i dont want to repeat everything they said. But anyways, this game is GREAT, and for $25 its WEL WORTH THE MONEY. BUY IT!!
