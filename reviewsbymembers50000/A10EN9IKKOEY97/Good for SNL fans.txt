 I enjoyed Anchorman more because I am a huge Will Ferrell fan rather than because the movie was good...The movie suits Will great, because there are many chances to improvise and make it funny. It sort of reminded me of an SNL skit gone wrong, but still semi-funny just because of will. However, where the movie lacks in the comedy category it really represents the 70's accurately with the whole "men rule the world" type deal. It sort of shows how women anchors came to be, and it was a small step in woman having more of a say in things. With that said, i would recommend this movie for Will Ferrell fans, but do not expect to be laughing at every single scene.
