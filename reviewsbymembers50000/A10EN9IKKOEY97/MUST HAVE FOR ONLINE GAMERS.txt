 The ps2 USB headset is amazing. I play madden 2005 online all the time, and the headset just makes everything SO much fun. You can meet new people and make new friends from all over the world, or you can choose a different route and just trash talk a lot which is just as fun too...it plugs straight into one of the two usb ports on the front of your ps2, and the wire is definitely the perfect length. Its long enough to be able to reach good distances, without having a huge mess full of wires all over the floor.  You can mute your opponents so they can no longer hear you but you can hear them. All in all, the headset definitely gets the job done, and for just 30 bucks, its definitely worth it! highly recommended! (also look into the Wireless Controller from Logitech, its great...read my review)
