 I am a HUGE hockey fan (poor me, no hockey this season) and miracle is definitely the best hockey movie ever made, and it ranks high on the top sports movies ever made. Miracle really was a hard movie to make, because they needed to make sure the hockey scenes were believable, but the acting had to be there too. They chose to do the right thing, which is teach great hockey players how to act rather than having actors have stunt doubles play hockey for them. This way they can do head shots while they are on the ice and make it way more believable rather than just seeing feet skating along the ice. The Mighty Ducks movies (though great for kids) really lacked in the hockey scenes, as most people know. Another thing that makes the movie so hard, is that now that they have good hockey players, they still need to make the goals/assists/body checks as close to the real thing in 1980 as possible. On the special features they show you tape of a real goal scored against the Soviets, which went right through the goalies legs, and they show you the movie version...its a spitting image. Amazing job on the directors part, and the hockey players who, in a sense actually have to "act" while playing hockey. All in all, Miracle does a great job at showing how much of an underdog U.S.A. was (though i wasnt born then, i can only imagine what it was like) and how amazing of a feat it was to beat the russians. Miracle also ties in some smaller stories that make the movie better, such as Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell) and his family life and how his coaching gets in the way of being with his wife and kids. I could go on forever about Miracle, but the only way to end this is to go with Al Michaels' famous line counting down the last 3 seconds of the game against the soviets : DO YOU BELIEVE IN MIRACLES? YES!
