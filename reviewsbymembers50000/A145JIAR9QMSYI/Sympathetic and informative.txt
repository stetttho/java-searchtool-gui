 I consider this the best book to start with if you are a woman wondering if you have depression and/or a companion illness, or a woman who has been diagnosed and is deciding which treatment to try. Depression (including premenstrual depression), anxiety disorder, OCD and sleep disturbances and available medication and non-medication options are explored thoroughly and clearly by Dr. Raskin.  What sets this book apart from other depression/medication books is that it addresses women's particular concerns, largely neglected by the others. Topics I am often asked about on my web site (and have not had good answers for) such as pregnancy/breastfeeding and medication and weight gain as a side effect of medication are discussed in a sympathetic, informative manner. Essential information about antidepressants and anti-anxiety medication, including side-effects, usual dose ranges and pregnancy ratings round out "When Words Are Not Enough," making it a very complete resource for women.
