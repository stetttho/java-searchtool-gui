 I wanted some insight into how to incorporate herbs into my melt and pour soap, and I found this book very helpful. Contrary to what another reviewer said, not all melt and pour soap bases contain alcohol and fillers - it is possible to get m&p soap base that is composed of natural ingredients. I was pleased to find information on different methods of preparing your own decoctions, tinctures and infusions from herbs, and also some basic information on gathering herbs. I found this book to be very helpful to someone like me who didn't know anything about herbal soaps and didn't know where to start. I have already made several of the soaps and have been very pleased with them.
