 It's very possible that the plot and character development are first-rate. I wouldn't know, because I couldn't get past the inferior writing. My guess is that much of the problem lies in an editor who couldn't be bothered to edit the cliches and repeated words (the king is "disgusted" two sentences after he says something "in disgust").  I was actually stuck in a car for nine hours when I picked this up, and chose to stare out the window instead. The only reason I'm not giving it one star is because it seemed to have potential as far as the plot.
