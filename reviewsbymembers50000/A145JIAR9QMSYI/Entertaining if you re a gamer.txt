 As a gamer who remembers the emergence of the games created by Romero and Carmack, I found Masters of Doom entertaining, although I didn't learn much that I didn't already know. This is probably a result of reading three game magazines a month for the last ten years, not a fault of the book. That being said, I'm not sure how interesting the book will be to someone who is not a gamer. Anyone who is interested in pop culture in general will probably enjoy it as well as those who want to know more about the computer gaming industry. If you're a novice, note that this book is about computer games, not video (console) games. Some sloppy editing was annoying, such as calling Windows Microsoft's "upcoming" operating system - in 1994. I assume this is referring to Windows 95.
