 The book is well written and researched, but unfortunately buys into Betty's defense. Everyone who thinks Betty is a martyr, wake up! She is a textbook example of someone with Borderline Personality Disorder. That is why she bonded with Dan and became the perfect mother - in her mind, she had no identity till she met him and gained an identity as wife and mother.  Dan may not have been a nice person or a good husband. However, on the flip side, he had no chance of living up to the expectations of a spouse with BPD. Of course, we'll never hear his side of the story. This woman was abusive and violent even before the murders and used her children as tools against her ex-husband. It's disturbing that she is a symbol for women who really are used and thrown away by their ex-husbands.
