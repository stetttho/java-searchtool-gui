 Each Elder Scrolls game has been larger than the rest. While in some ways that's a good thing, it can be decidedly a negative when you're trudging back and forth through endless open spaces. It would have been nice to have several methods of transportation available. That said, this game is enjoyable in that there is a linear path to follow, but you can also spend endless hours wandering around. There are so many different character classes that you can play the game many different ways, and will have a new experience each time. In addition, you can create a custom character. For instance, I created a character that is primarily a thief, but has as a top specialty the destructive magic. The toolkit has allowed for many, many mods to be created, and the technical aspects of the game (interface, graphics) are excellent. There are some amazing environmental effects such as a sudden sandstorm and a starry nighttime sky dotted with wispy clouds. Expect to spend many hours (if you wish to) on this one.
