 I almost didn't buy this book because of the other reviews, but I'm glad I did. I'm sure this book wouldn't be much use to an Everquest veteran, but a newbie will find it invaluable. The section on Everquest slang is particularly handy to keep you from being completely confused in the game. Yes, a lot of good information is online, and I have downloaded much of it, but when you need to refer to something quickly, flipping through a book is a lot easier than shuffling through a stack of papers (and I have mine organized into folders).  As far as any inaccuracies, this is an online game, people, not a static one. There's a new patch almost every week. Of course some things have changed. However, I did not find any glaring inaccuracies that caused me any problems. If you're an Everquest newbie, you need this book.
