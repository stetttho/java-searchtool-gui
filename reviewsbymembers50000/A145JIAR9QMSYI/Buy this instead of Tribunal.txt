 This is expansion is much more enjoyable than Tribunal, which is very claustrophobic. Bloodmoon gives you a new (large) island to explore, with an entertaining main quest and many interesting side quests. The graphics are great, and the falling snow made me feel chilled in the middle of summer. There are a couple of small irritations. There were too many annoyingly aggressive creatures outside which made quick travel impossible unless you levitated (which I ended up doing). Of course you can't do this if you're escorting someone, which made those errands tedious. I also crashed while zoning quite a few times. Overall, this is a worthwhile expansion pack that will add many more play hours to Morrowind.
