 My four month old son decided one day that he wanted to be upright, so his Gymini and bouncy seat did not entertain him. For a whole day he cried if he was not upright in some way. Even though it was the end of the day when we put this together and he's normally very cranky, he was fascinated for a good half hour.  He is so happy to be upright and have the new mobility of spinning around. He is also thrilled to have all these different toys to play with at once. The adjustable height is great, and the fact that it folds down helps us, since we travel a lot. It still is not small, but it's smaller than others when it's folded. Per the warnings in other reviews, I did not install the orange toy with the fins.
