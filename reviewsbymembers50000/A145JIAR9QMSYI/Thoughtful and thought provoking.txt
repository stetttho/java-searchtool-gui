 Am I my mind? Am I my illness? In a fascinating new book, T.M. Luhrmann makes a clear, concise argument that we cannot look upon the diseases of the mind in the same way that we look upon diseases of the body. This view is too simplistic, and allows healthcare companies to undertreat mental illness by paying for medication treatment, but discouraging talk therapy. Luhrmann used her experience as an anthropologist and four years of field work to observe first-hand the training of mental health professionals. This part of the book is of interest to any patient who is affected by how their doctor's attitude toward patients was developed. Lurhmann observes the situation and treatment of the mentally ill with a clear vision. The concerns she raises about the emphasis of the biomedical (chemical) model of mental illness over the psychodynamic (talk therapy) model are on target and worth serious consideration.
