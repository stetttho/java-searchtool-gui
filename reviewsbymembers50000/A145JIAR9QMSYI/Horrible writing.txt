 I bought this book in an airport gift shop, hoping for a diversion on a long flight. The only reason I finished it was that it was better than trying to sleep in the cramped seat. The plot was only mildly original and the writing was awful. I would also advise Mr. Patterson to never write about female protagonists, as he does not understand women at all.
