 My website has been up since 1995, but only in the last couple of years  has started being a real community. I knew there were a lot of things that  I wasn't addressing that would make the community more coherent. I've been  a member of a few of the communities that Ms. Kim profiles, but being a  community member doesn't necessarily give you insight into being a  community leader. I'm very impressed with this book. I got a great idea  for my site from it the first day I read it, which is to create a  "Welcome Wagon" page for the site. It seems so obvious now, but  somehow I had never thought of it. I put a page up on my site for new  people, and it's one of the most highly trafficked pages on the  site. Community Building on the Web is full of useful ideas that you can  apply to your community. The writing is clear and straightforward, and the  thinking behind the suggestions is thoroughly explained. Ms. Kim also  addresses much of the psychology behind what makes a community work, which  I found very helpful in generating new ideas of my own. This is one of the  most valuable books I've bought in my career as a website creator.
