 Since I love Raymond Feist's work and have played Betrayal at Krondor upwards of 9-10 times, I may have expected too much from this book. While it was enjoyable, and I found it entertaining to "read" a game that I had "played," as a Raymond Feist book it is a disappointment.  Although I went on to read the second book in the series, hoping things would improve, my initial impression did not change. Raymond Feist's writing added much to the game, but the game did not add much to his writing.
