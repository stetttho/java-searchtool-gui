 My sister had this book for her children, and liked it so much that my mom got it for me right before I had my son. I absolutely hate to cook but I find these recipes easy and fun to make. I never thought I'd be making my own baby food in a million years, but this book is a big help. Also note that the recipes for older children can be made for the whole family, and they're very appetizing. Many of the meals, especially the sauces, are suitable for freezing, so the criticism that the meals are too elaborate is not justified, in my opinion. You can prepare one batch and divide it up for freezing. You don't have to create the faces, etc., if you don't want to, but for those of us who are less than inspired or creative in making meals, the ideas are great.
