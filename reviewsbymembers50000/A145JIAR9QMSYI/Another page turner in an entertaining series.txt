 This series never disappoints, as long as you're looking for escapist detective fiction.  The storyline gallops along, and as usual, the identity of the villain is not obvious. With the exception of Summerset, who is on vacation for most of the story, the main characters are all present and consistently entertaining and interesting. Peabody is getting ready for her detective's exam and Eve is beginning to have dreams about her mother. Of course there is also the usual mix of humor, murder and mystery. A killer is emulating famous serial killers, and Eve finds that her suspects all have something to hide. Note that although J.D. Robb is the nom de plume of a successful romance writer, this is no Barbara Cartland.
