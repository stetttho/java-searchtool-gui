 The Longest Journey is the best adventure game I've played in years. It's so well written that playing it is like reading a wonderful fantasy novel.  The puzzles are logical instead of obscure; it's not easy, but it makes sense. I was very rarely frustrated, if at all. If you don't like long conversations, this is not the game for you. But if you enjoy meeting interesting characters and playing an absorbing plotline, you'll be sorry when the game ends too.
