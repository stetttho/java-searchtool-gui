 As with the other books in the series, the latest is the literary equivalent of potato chips - not very substantial, but very addictive - and hard to put down.  As usual, the minor characters are as much fun to read about as the major ones, and the plot is almost incidental compared to their interactions. The humor is sharp and character-driven. My only quibble, as with all the books in the series, is that the love scenes are definitely written by a romance writer. But I just skim past them, so this is a minor quibble.
