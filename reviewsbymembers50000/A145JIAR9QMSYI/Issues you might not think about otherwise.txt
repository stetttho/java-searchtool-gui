 I found this book very helpful in raising my awareness of accessibility issues. Someone who has been online for years may not find the information new, but anyone who is fairly new to designing web pages will be glad that they read this book. Creating accessible web pages is becoming a necessity, not an afterthought, as disabled persons' organizations are moving toward approaching the issue from a legal standpoint.
