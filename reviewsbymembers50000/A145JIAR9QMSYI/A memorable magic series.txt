 When I was younger, I read all of Edward Eager's books at least three or four times. Anyone who likes magic adventures will enjoy putting themselves in the stories. The kids are real and individual. The problems that crop up from using magic make sense and don't seem forced. Most important, these books have a great sense of humor. This is the first book in the series.
