 My grandmother died and she never believed that the man walked on the moon.It is the first time after this that i hear this theory again in this dvd.I really dont know if all what you will see is scientificslly proven or not but i found it interesting watching it.I am giving it four stars just because it is beyond funny the idea of the theory that the man never walked on the moon is true.
