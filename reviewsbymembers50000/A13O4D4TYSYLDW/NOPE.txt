 I did sit in front of my pc with UFO Aftershock installed. I was exited ready to play the latest version of a game I really loved in the past and I did experience many exiting gaming hours with it. Nothing really happened. It was really disappointing the result because what I saw is nothing new. It is what we played years ago but in our days looks really poor. As a program it is very heavy and loading procedures really disturbing. The sound is good I must admit but with good sound only you can't have a good game.  Once more I must say I was disappointed from the critics of the game magazines that give high scores (more than 80% some of them) for a game that will not last in your computer for long. I wish I never had bought this game.
