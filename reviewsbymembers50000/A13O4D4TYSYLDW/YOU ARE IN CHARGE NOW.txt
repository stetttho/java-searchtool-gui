 This is a fantastic idea really. You own a studio you produce movies you create stars you even uploading them the in the net so you can get critics on them. Do you want more? Ok here it comes with the virtual money you earn from the game you can go to the site www.thememoviesgame.com and buy clothes to dress your stars or as i read somewhere pretty soon you will be able to buy furniture or jewelry and other stuff for your movies. Sounds good uh? Well it is good sometimes very good with sense of humor almost top quality graphics. I did find some problems with the sound but they were not that important to stop me for playing. I don't know if I like this game that much because I am a cinema fanatic and deep inside me I always wanted to become a Hollywood producer. The bad news is that non experienced gamers will face major problems as the tutorial is not at the standards of a difficult game like this. The other thing that made me to give these fabulous program only three stars in the overall rating  is the fact that you are going to need many hours to spend to develop all the options of the game and as we all know nobody has spare time these days even for a very good production like this on. I think you will not waste your money in any case if you buy this game.
