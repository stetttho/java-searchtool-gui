 I have noticed all these years as a fanatic fan of  Dungeons & Dragons games and all the mythology around them  all the people who like this exceptional category of rpg's they are the same fanatic like me. Talking to these people because those they don't like these games they literally hate them I recommend this game which after all was a pleasant surprise. Most of us we were thinking that we are going to face another version of World of Warcraft but it was not like this at all. Here we are in the beginning of a new era of  Dungeons & Dragons were the Hero's are going to write their own unique story and their names are going to be known to everybody. The graphics and the sound were more than good and the interface normal for gamers of this category. After playing for months the City of Heroes I would like to see more options when you customize your hero but on the other hand I got a warm voice to guide me in my first steps. This is an adorable title and something I believe you should experience it the sooner the better. Team working is absolutely necessary for this game something that can be annoying sometimes when you cannot get a good team. I did enjoy the voice chat option that allows you to listen the comments from the other players. A litle hint clerics are the most wanted for teams out of all other characters. P.S. If you look for me in the European servers ask for Patmian. See ya in StormReach ppl
