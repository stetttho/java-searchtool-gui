 And suddenly the room was filled with the very warm and known sound of Deus.  We did wait for this album long time now all of us who believed in the group and we can say it was more than worthy. Bad Timing opens this latest work and proves in seconds that it does not come in bad timing at all to be followed of 7 Days, 7 Weeks which sounds like a inspired pop hymn with simple forms.  The guitars keep on playing an important role giving you the impression that they are in a non stop dialogue between them. You will feel it when you hear   the Cold Sun of Circumstance but in Night shopping the rock air the song brings is going to remind you where you come from. Listen to this great cd I believe it is worthy.
