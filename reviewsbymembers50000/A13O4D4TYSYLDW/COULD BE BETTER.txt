 For all of us who first tried the Kick off in Atari st almost 20 years ago we expect much more from a mid 00's  console soccer game. The graphics are really good and that's why I give it three stars but I didn't like the fact that the game includes limited number of teams (32 only)and I believe that the interface should be friendlier. I did try the game only in my Xbox because all the reviews mention that this is its best version.
