I am not going to uncover all the scenario of XB360 Dead or Alive 4 but if you plan to buy it I guarantee you will be really proud for your XB360. You will be amazed not only with the really good interface witch allows you to enjoy the battles but also with the details like the cherry flowers falling from the sky or the movement of the hair of the heroes. The graphics and the sound are really fantastic and you will enjoy it. I wish they could have more clothing options for the characters of the game but we going to forgive them for that because they really created a must have game.
