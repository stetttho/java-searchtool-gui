 Oscar's Wilde play `Lady Windermere's Fan.'has been transferred into a decent movie from the British director Mike Barker (`To Kill a King'). This is all about a humorous brilliant production with an outstanding cast as Wild deserves.  Mrs. Erlynne (Helen Hunt) is a middle age experienced woman who is desperate to find money to support her luxurious way of living. She goes in the Italian country side where she is picking up her victims. There she will meet the ideal victims a just married couple the innocent Lady Windermere (Scarlet Johansson), and her husband Lord Windermere (Mark Umbers. In the scene there is a devoted admirer (Tom Wilkinson), and a man really close to Mrs. Erlynne Lord Darlington (Stephen Campbell Moore. Secrets stories rumors will create a good movie more funny and less melodramatic all these dressed with beautiful romantic costumes and always with the background of the 19th century. I recommend it have fun
