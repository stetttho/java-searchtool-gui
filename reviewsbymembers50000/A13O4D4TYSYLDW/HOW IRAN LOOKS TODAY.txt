 Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami is taking you for a ride around Teheran through his hero in the movie Mr. Badii (Homayoun Ershadi).Silence misery povetry and the mixture of different cultures give you the sense that something is going to die in this place and reborn from the ashes. Amazing photography travells you to Iranian landscape taking its time exactly like the oriental mentality. The people dont talk very much or they dont talk at all.What you want to know it is written on their faces on their clothes and the enviroment.  Dont look for western type of action dont even look for a story everything you see is symbolic.Just concetrate on what you see and believe me if you never experienced before the taste of cherry you will now and you will never forget it.
