 The legend returns but not like he used to be. He is protecting California at the year 1850 he is a family person in San Francisco with a wife and a son. As a family person he has kind of family problems. He can't keep his promises towards his wife and she going to see another man. Well well this is definitely not the Zorro I knew and I did feel that one of the best heroes of my childhood is turning in to something different. The only similarity I found is that he is still after the bad guys and still protecting the good but I am not sure anymore about his future. For a project of $80 Million dollars I was expecting much more I do not recommend this movie and I will give it 2 stars only for the beauty of Banderas and Zeta-Jones.
