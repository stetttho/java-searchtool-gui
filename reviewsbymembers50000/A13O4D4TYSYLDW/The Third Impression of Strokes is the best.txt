 What makes this third album of the Strokes so exceptional? For sure is the most sophisticated of all three.  Also is the one that puts them in the list of the remarkable rock bands of the decade for using the cool sounds combined with Julian Casablanca's characteristic voice in an amazing result. It is really hard to describe the real cause for the feeling of optimism you get after listening to it but you will realize that this group is able to give much   more in the future.
