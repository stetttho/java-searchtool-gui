 Fantasy action magic and martial arts are the ingredients of the charming Chinese 121 minutes fairy tail directed by Chan. Like all fairy tails includes a romantic love story. The amazing photography of the movie supports perfectly the really fast action. The Promise is a very good and interesting work and becomes a real promise of what we will see in the near future coming out from the Chinese studios. I will give it only three stars because I believe that the scenario is not that strong as it could be. In the fantasy world everything is allowed.
