 This whole movie is a memory of an affair. Matt working as glaciologist in North Pole remembers every single moment he passed with his girlfriend Lisa. They meet in a music hall in London during a concert. The mutual affection is critical and they going to spend several months together. As they experience strong sexual moments together they will experience also nine live concerts. Unique performances by Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, The Von Bondies, Elbow, Primal Scream, The Dandy Warhols, Super Furry Animals, Franz Ferdinand and Michael Nyman are available in this very good movie. Even some scenes are a bit shocking I believe this a worthy to see film.
