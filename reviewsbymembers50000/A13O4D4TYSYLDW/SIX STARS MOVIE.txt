 One of the best action films I have seen the last years. The movie was not advertised like the most of the really good movies. The old question comes up once more. Should  a man take the law in his hands and become judge and executor ? The answer comes easy in the film and it is yes. But then the society agrees with such a decision? According to the film YES. The complexity of the laws that the modern societies adopted to face the organized crime finally protects the criminals instead of punishing them. In the movie there is no question about what is good and what is bad. Our Heros, two brothers (Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus) know what they do and they don't have any doubts about it. Their actions will convince a gay FBI special agent (Willem Dafoe) to change the point of his view. It is a modern and more advanced version of Michael Winner's Death Wish and I strongly recommend you to buy.
