 Space strategy games are a very special category of games with a very long history starting in early 80's with the big hit title "ELITE". Since then many things have changed of course but the main concept remains the same. You start the game with few missions more let's say instructional just to get more familiar with the interface. Right after this you will be able to command about 2 or 3 capital ships and about the same amount of squadrons. Things are easy for the moment but as you go on and on with your game you will be in the very interesting situation to manage more than 15 different ships with different specifications something that will challenge your strategic abilities. During the historical space battles you will able to take in real time decisions. For succefull results you got to know all the string and weak points of your and your enemy's fleet. Space bar is pausing the time to give you time to think and decide. Nexus has amazing graphics and sound that will enjoy even the most difficult gamer. Personally I would expect a more easy game play. I think it will entertain you for many hours.
