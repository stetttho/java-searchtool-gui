 The city of Villains is a stand alone sequel of my favorite game City of Heroes. To be honest I was expecting much more as COH player from the new game and I don't blame all these people who criticize it but there is something that we should take seriously under consideration and this that it is a stand alone game and that is how we must see it. I noticed that all the new players who never played COH just loved this game and this shows that my personal complain as an old player of the old game and my expectations should not be as criterion to judge the City of Villains.  If you see it from this side COV is a very special game. All the heroes you can create are big fun and so unique. I would not advise non experienced players to try the player versus player mode and in general I believe that such options should be avoided from those who create such smart new age games. If you have spend  hundreds of hours building your hero around Atlas City I am sure you will not be very impressed with this title but if you did not I strongly recommend you to buy and play this game it is something exceptional.
