 To restore fully the infamous Windmill Theater and the surrounding streets it is not a little thing. Director Stephen Frears (High Fidelity) with his cast will take you there for a while and only for this experience you should see this movie. Mrs. Henderson (the very very good mrs.Judi Dench Oscar nominee) 69 old widow without any experience of the market and show biz becomes the owner of Windmill Theater. What is so important about this theater? It is presenting shows with nude girls who must remain still and by this the play overpasses the censorship restrictions and qualifies as art. She will run this special theater with manager Mr. Vivian Van Damm (Bob Hoskins.  The very good screenplay of Martin Sherman gives many opportunities to Judi Dench Bob Hoskins and the other actors. I think  that this a decent   charming movie in an atmospheric romantic environment that will entertain you.
