 This book it is exactly what it says it is. Easy tips that can help you to run your restaurant and improve the service you offer to your customers. It is more for the owner or the manager but it  can be usefull to everybody who is working there even the barmen. I recomend it because of the easy language it uses and because it offers practical solutions to everyday problems.
