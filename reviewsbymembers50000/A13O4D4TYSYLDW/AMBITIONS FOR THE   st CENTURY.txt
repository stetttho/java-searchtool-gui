 A really nice documentary film from Chris Hegedus (The War Room) and Jehane Noujaim about a group of friends who start a dot com company and they climb allmost on the top.  The every day running the relationships between them the strugle to survive and make people and investors to believe in them are given with a plain and simple way which on the other hand makes the film fascinating.It could be more specific about the industry and how it really works instead of passing fast this stage and this is a missing point but the whole movie is fast just like the success and the failure in todays world. I really did have good time watching this movie. No doubt it leaves you  wondering if having just good friends-partners and bright ideas this is enough to survive in the modern bussines world or because of the globalization the good days are gone forever. See it it is worthy
