 It has been very long time since I have seen something really exciting and really innovative in computer gaming. The scenario is plain and simple for those who play rpg's you create your character with his/her special abilities you choosing from different classes you dress him/her choosing from hundreds of options and making thousands of combinations and you are almost there. All you need is a story THE STORY of your newborn super hero and his unique name. After this the big fun is out there in the city of Heroes. Bad guys are in the streets and your task is known as an old computer gamer but soon you will find out that you are not alone in this magic world. Lots of other unique super heroes are out there ready to make teams super groups or even coalitions. You are unique in a world of unique colorful super heroes from all over the world ready to become your friends what else would you call fun? The price of subscription is normal accordingly to other on line games.  From all my games I think this is something exceptional and worthy to buy. The interface is easy and the chat options fantastic. I strongly recommend this title to anyone who can control his gaming addictions.
