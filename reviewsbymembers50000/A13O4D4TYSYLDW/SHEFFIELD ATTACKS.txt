 The feeling you get when you first listen to this cd is that this is the first giant step for a new group which has come here to stay. The taste of punk rock is very strong in each song but it doesn't remind of the past at all. The two guitars from Alex Tuner and Jamie Cook take you to a new dimension where you recognize  the pure talent combined with the hard work. The second thing that you realize on the second reading is the rhythm section background from Matt Helders and Andy Nicholson with a very deep and inspired way supporting the two guitars. As the music goes on song after song you understand that these four young people from Sheffield just opened a new page in the rock history. We were right to wait for this masterpiece to be released. The free demos that the group released in internet gave us the right impression for the profile of this Sheffield attack. I bet that the older listener will remember Neil Young's lyrics "hey hey my my rock 'n roll will never die"
