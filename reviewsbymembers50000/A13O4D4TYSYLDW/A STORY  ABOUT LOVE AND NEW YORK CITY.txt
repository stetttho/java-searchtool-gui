 It is hard to believe that what you see on the screen is New York city.Maybe because what we know so far about Lower East side is gangs shootings killings and detectives trying to catch the drag dealer.But the 26 year old Peter Sollett choosed this very place to set up a true love story and a very little picture of the everyday life there.Meeting Victor Vargas and the members of his family his sister brother and grandmother introduced one by one with unique way you will find yourself somehow involved into this story.It is the age of the first heartbeats that no one can ever forget getting louder and louder during the movie.Even the whole story is around old buildings dirty streets and the heros allmost never change clothes what you see is like a video clip. You will not lose your time watching this movie maybe you will wonder if you left behind a very important part of yourself
