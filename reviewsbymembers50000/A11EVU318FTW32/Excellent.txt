 Wiesel exceptionally places his thoughts and feelings on paper as he details his horrific journey through the Holocaust. He captures the tragedy of the end result of anti-Semitism with his entire book but especially with  his description of one experience at Auschwitz. "Not far from us  flames were leaping up from a ditch, gigantic flames. They were burning  something. A lorry drew up at the pit and delivered its load - little  children. Babies!" While people say a picture is worth a thousand  words, those four sentences paint one powerful picture. Wiesel's book is  filled with powerful pictures of horror that make me glad to be born a free  American. I believe this should be required reading for every college  student or even every high school student.
