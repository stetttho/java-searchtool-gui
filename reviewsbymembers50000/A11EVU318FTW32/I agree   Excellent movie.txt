 I have read through the previous reviews and I agree - I want more!  The cast fits together so well, from Kerendi(sp?) to Valentine to Tyburn and the stories are all so well written and acted that I hated to see them end.  I especially loved the friendly romance taking place between Tyburn and  Harker which culminates in simply a kiss at the end of the movie - not some  steamy love scene. Some people may think PBS is boring but I found this  movie very exciting and have seen it both times my local PBS station aired  it. It is well worth the money if you love a good mystery that makes you  think and like a good group of characters that fit together well.
