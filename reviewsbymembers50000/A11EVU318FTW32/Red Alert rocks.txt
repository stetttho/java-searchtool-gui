 Having played Warcraft and Warcraft2, I was ready for a more "real life" fighting game with tanks and soldiers. Red Alert was the answer.  Overall, Red Alert is great! A person can play as Soviets or Allies with  funky weapons unique to both like Tesla Coils or Gap Generators.  Additionally, a person can play the game on-line with as many as four  players (more with faster Internet connections.) If you like to play  strategy and grind your buddy's head into the dirt at the same time, this  game is for you.  Oh, and I agree with everyone else - this game is VERY  addictive, especially if you play it with buddies over a network or over  the Internet.  Expect to spend several hours playing.
