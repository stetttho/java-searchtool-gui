 Interestingly enough, the reviews that dock this movie stars are written by men and women who have never served in battle complaining about bad plot development, or one-sided story telling, or just another fuzzy Speilberg  film.  Funny however, is the fact that I have heard no World War II  veterans or even war veterans in general complain about this film's  realism, that is because this film does an excellent job of depicting what  war was like for the average soldier. Saving Private Ryan put to motion  many of the bloody accounts I have been reading since I was a 7th grader  about World War II. Reading or hearing about a shell landing several feet  away and blasting a soldier with his buddy's brains is one thing, but  actually seeing it makes one realize just exactly how bad war is. The story  was good too and touched me so much that I thanked a Korean vet for his  service to our country. After a minute or two of silence to choke back  tears, he thanked me and told me Saving Private Ryan was so real that when  the first shots were fired in the movie, he wanted to duck for fear that  the North Koreans were once again firing on him. He then told me about his  experiences during the Korean War which was enlightening and something I  will remember for a long time. This is an excellent movie and instead  complaining about its inadequaces people should go to their local veterans  center and thank those men who reside there for their willingness to die so  that we may be free. Or, are we too busy  complaining about so-called bad  movies?
