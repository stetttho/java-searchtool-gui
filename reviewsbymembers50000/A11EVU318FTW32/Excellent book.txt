 While some immature students of literature may think this book boring, it is anything but. Remarque does an excellent job of detailing his experiences in the trenches of long forgotten World War I. Unfortunately,  eliments of that war still exist today in Kosovo and other regions of the  former Yugoslavia. My hats off to the young surviver named Hasan from  Kosovo who explains that Remarque's book is right on target. Remarque's  writings are only perceived as boring because we live in America where war  has not touched our shores for nearly one hundred and forty years. To  Hasan, it is a description of everyday life. I think this book is a must  read for every college and high school student and gives good incite into  what our own fighting men went through to win us the freedom we enjoy. Oh,  and if you are looking for a good description of life during the Holocaust,  read Elie Wiesel's "Night."
