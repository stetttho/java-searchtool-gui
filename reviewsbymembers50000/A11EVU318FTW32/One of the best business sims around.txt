 If you like making money and a good challenge, this is the game for you. Laying track, building stations, and buying train engines is just the beginning of this complex game.  You have to make decisions on where to lay  track, which towns to service, and (in the scenerios provided) what is the  best way to complete each scenerio. For scenerios, you are given at least  10 different maps to choose from, each with a different scenerio to  complete and each with different computer opponents.  In addition to trying  to complete the requirements of each scenerio, you have to make decisions  that keep your investors happy (or they will cut your salary) as well as  personal financial decisions (or where to invest that salary) which gives  the game a very "real-life" feel.    To add to the  "real-life" feel, the game can be played on-line or over a  network with a group of your buddies which makes it even more fun. Overall,  it is a great game which has incrediable graphics (trains, stations, towns,  and landscape are drawn beautifully), a good manual, and is highly  addictive. Actually, that is my only warning - if you like business  simulation games like Rollercoaster Tycoon or previous versions of Railroad  Tycoon - expect to spend several hours playing this game.
