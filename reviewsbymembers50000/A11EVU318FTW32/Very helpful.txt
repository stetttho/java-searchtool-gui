 I think Evan Schwartz has defined 9 good principles which could be really helpful to any e-commerce site owner who seeks to increase business. The 9 principles really do not change with every new computer chip or browser  software created but rather hold true with most humans and what they are  looking for on the Internet. Such principles like: add value to the  information presented on your website, don't just make your site a virtual  brochure but make it something interesting that people want to return to  again and again.  Give it a sense of community that makes people feel  "at home" when visiting your site (like Amazon.)  Other  principles: traditional mass-media advertising (pushing your message on  consummers) does not work on the Internet, rather advertisers need to seek  information from users to customize the advertizements to Internet users'  tastes and preferences (Amazon does this with its book recommendations  based on which books you have ordered from the site.) Schwartz also states  that even small e-commerce sites can compete with the "big boys"  because the Internet provides a medium from which these sites can carve a  niche market. Overall, this book is jammed with good ideas and case studies  (though dated) that illustrate how each of his nine principles can be used  to increase business. This book lays a good foundation for other books like  Digital Darwinism or Net Success.
