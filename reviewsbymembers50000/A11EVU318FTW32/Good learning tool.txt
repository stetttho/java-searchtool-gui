 I have always loved to read books and watch videos about World War II and this was an excellent series. First of all, it showed many new video clips that I had never seen before which helps to better illustrate the excelent  narration. The introductions by Henry Kissinger also added greatly to the  whole peice.  I especially remember the segment on Staligrad. It told an  informative story from both sides of the battle which gave it a more human  feel. Additionally, it illustrated just how brutal Stalin was in his push  to free his country from the Nazis. It also raised an interesting question  about whether or not Stalin may have been planning an invasion of Hitler's  domain just before Hitler attacked. I also agree with a fellow reviewer  about its coverage of the Battle of Kursk, very informative. Overall, I  learned a great amount from this documentary and it is well worth its  price.
