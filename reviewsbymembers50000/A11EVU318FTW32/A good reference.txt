 I found this book very helpful in preparing a presentation for my college Datacom class. Newton's defintions are fairly simple to understand and are intermixed with some rather humorous definitions such as his definition of  garage sales. I would recommend this book to any student majoring in  Telecom or Computer Networking because it gives good, helpful definitions.   One complaint I have about this book is that there are several spelling  errors (mainly missed letters on the end of plural words) in the  definitions I looked up which I found distracting.
