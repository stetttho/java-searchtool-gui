 I loved playing PGA Tour 96 for the last two years and figured that another golf game by EA would be a good one.  I was not disappointed.  The addition of 15 PGA Pro courses designed with more real-life terrain, sand  traps, and water wholes was a big step over the two less graphically  enhanced courses offered in PGA Tour 96.  Balls actually roll down hills,  curve around a valley and off into the rough, or back down a steep slop  past where you were actually hitting from (if you made a bad shot.) In  addition, I like the fact that you can but back spin and fade on your ball,  which you weren't able to do in PGA Tour 96.  Overall, I have only three  main complaints about Tiger Woods PGA (and several minor complains that I  won't mention.) 1. A bar doesn't automatically  appear on the swing meter  to tell you just exactly how high you should let your swing go before you  click and bring it back down, like it did in PGA Tour 96. 2. The aiming  arrow is really weird and slightly hard to use both when I am smacking the  ball around on the course and when I am putting on the green.  I have  missed several shots because the aiming arrow was in the wrong spot.  Additionally, there is no commentary on the green telling you in which  direction the ball is going to break (commentary that is needed for those  of us who can't seem to read a green.) 3. There isn't as many pros to  "play as" like there was in PGA Tour 96.
