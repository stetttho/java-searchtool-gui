 I have seen this movie three times and each time it never fails to make me cry. The music alone speaks volumes of the suffering of the Holocaust. Having watched old black and white newsreel film covering World War II showing planes, tanks, men, bombing, etc...makes this movie being filmed in  black and white even more powerful to me because it makes me feel as though  I am seeing old new reel footage of the horrors of the Holocaust that Elie  Wiesel writes about in his book "Night."  While no film maker can possibly capture the entirety of the Holocaust on film, Steven Speilberg does an excellent job of showing just how cheap life was to some Nazis aka. Ralph Fiennes's character. Seeing Schindler's List put a name, a face, and a voice behind all of those pictures I have seen of Jews with Nazi guns behind their heads waiting to be executed but forced to pose for one last humiliating picture before leaving this world.
