 As a 3rd year student interested in the computer field, I found this book extremely helpful in identifing which classes to enroll in and how to educate myself to be more competitive in the modern work world. It is nice  to hear from leaders in the technology field giving advice to students on  how to better educate themselves. I would recommend this book to any  student who is interested in a "cybercareer." The book was easy  to read and the little notes they posted out to the side to offset certain  important points were helpfull and easy to follow. It was much similar to a  textbook in that students can use the index and read only the chapters or  topics that apply to them. While technology is changing and some topics in  this book will become out-of-date, there are still some good fundamentals  to be gleaned from this book.
