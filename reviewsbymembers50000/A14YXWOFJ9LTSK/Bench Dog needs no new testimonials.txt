But, if you are a professional trim carpenter that has the task "nailed down" and all the experience in the world, this little old tool will give aid in speed of accuracy. Go ahead and buy it!  And, if you are a DIY carpenter who wants to emulate high quality professional results without necessarily possessing all the in and outs of the trade, it is a must have tool.  Of course, if you are the type who has to have all the cool top-shelf tool toys made, well, then this is a must have.   Lastly, if what you are looking for is a high-tech devise, forget it. If you are looking for a tool that will make your half-ass lazy work look good, forget it. If you're looking for a tool that will make your alcohol soaked brain . . .  and job error free, forget it.
