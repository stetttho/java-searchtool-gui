 I have owned this router for about 9 months. In my experience, the DeWalt has proven itself time and time again. Dead Nuts accurate, zero vibration, concentric, ergonomic, smooth starting, constant speed and runs true to the guide bushings. The plunging operation is the finest I have ever witnessed. And, to boot the clear unobstructed view of your work via the column vacuum system is without parallel. I have recently purchased the DeWalt edge guide it too is first class. Bottom Line: For the $ spent, the value is all there.
