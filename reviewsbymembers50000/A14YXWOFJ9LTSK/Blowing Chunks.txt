 I have owned this tool for about 1 year and I must say the Bosch 1594K planer is a very fine example of engineering, function, design and quality all meeting at the same place and time. If you are one who uses a planer at your occupation, you will really appreciate the handling characteristics of this tool, kind of like a Rolls Royce to a Chauffeur.  But like most tools of this caliber it has many other rival brands that also are real fine gems within themselves. I do believe that the one solid advantage this Bosch has over the rest of the competing brands is its ability to spew wood chips either to the right or the left. In fact, this planer is so proficient at wood ejection, that from a distance it looks like your blowing chunks!
