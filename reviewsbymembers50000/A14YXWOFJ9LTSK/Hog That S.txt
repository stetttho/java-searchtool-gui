 Milwaukee's 5625-20 3-1/2 HP Fixed-Base Router is one serious machine. It takes no prisoners and is no-holds-barred. If what you need is a router that is table mount friendly and approaches shaper performance this is the bad boy to have. If you need a router for handheld applications and the size does not intimidate you, this is the router to own. The machine will work for most applications other than jobs suited for a 7/8 HP laminate type router.  The fit, finish and quality of craftsmanship are top-shelf. Balance, handles, switches, locks and adjustments are well-placed and easy to reach. Soft start and constant speed technology are present and much needed on this mammoth of a beast.   I really think this tool could be converted to mill steel! The way the Milwaukee 5625-20 ploughs though the thickest and hardest wood or composite reminds me of days past when I was a Tool and Die Maker and someone in the shop was taking an aggressive cut on a Bridgeport Mill, the guys would hoop and holler---Hog That S*#@!!!!!!!!
