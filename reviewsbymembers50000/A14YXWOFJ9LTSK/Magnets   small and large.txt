 OK, here is the gag. Back in 1981 when I bought my second Vapors record, Magnets, I was emotionally and physically stunned by the sheer brilliance of the band.  And, 23 years later, as I am playing this album in the CD format on my $15,000+ esoteric system it once again has stunned me emotionally and physically. The kids, all 4 of them, join in when dad is raising the roof with high sound pressure levels and jamming to the Vapors!  God Bless the 80's!!! P.S. If you were to endure cruel and unusual punishment by being sentenced to only getting to listen to 1 Vapors Album for the rest of your life...I would have to pick MAGNETS.
