 The Bosch compact belt sander is a very well engineered and manufactured tool. I have used it on many occasions for home repair and/or remodeling with great success.  The size and weight of the tool are substantial enough to ensure durability and long life. The shape and variable speed assist in keeping the tool under control.  If you have the need to remove stock via sanding and it is in an oddball location, or a full-blown belt sander is a bit too much, take this puppy out for a ride!
