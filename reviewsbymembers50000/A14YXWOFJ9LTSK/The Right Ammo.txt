 I have owned and used this fine air nailer for about 6 months, and it has functioned flawlessly so long as I behaved. If, as some of the other reviewers have claimed, you are having problems with double firing or jamming, take a good look at the ammo you are loading into your gun. My gun went bonkers with double firing for about 6 sticks of nails and then a hardcore jam of two 3.5" nails. The jam was so intense; it galled and peened the nails as one. After close inspection, it was discovered that the malfunction was caused by operator error.  The gun was loaded with CLIPPED HEAD ammo instead of the required FULL ROUND HEAD ammo.  After hand filing the rough shards of tainted metal from the firing chamber and a good cleaning, all systems were good to go.      Bottom line: this nail gun is designed and built with first class components. As a matter of fact the gun is such a fine work of art that I believe that if it had existed in the year 33 A.D. the vile, debauchery of a mob would have used it to pin Jesus to the cross during the Passion of the Christ.
