 When the Exhumer arrived via USPS and was hand delivered to the recipient we began looking at the cats paw for a while, we examined it in full and complete detail. The Exhumer's fit and finish is unequaled. The neat little skull and cross bones emblem is a hoot. And to beat all, the resonating sound emitted when struck with a hammer is parallel to that of a pipe organ.   So, we thought, now for the test! How about a boat load of various nails, from hand driven, to power driven, from box to finish, from 1" to 3.5" all slammed into a piece of 100 year old yellow ponderosa pine. Shoot man, all the nails came up with no back talk. Next we went around looking in the basement of one of his rental properties in Indianapolis for some subject nails to remove. Now, the house we were in is about 90 years old and the basement is an old coal fired furnace type of place.    We found plenty of victims just sitting around wanting to be pulled free from their wood dungeon. Low and behold we could not put the Exhumer in a position that it would fail. All nails simply would succumb to the brute force of the almighty Exhumer.   After that time, and from now on, any job or situation that we may encounter, be it work, fun, or personal life, if we start to wavier and things are getting tough we will just sic the Exhumer on it and we shall prevail.
