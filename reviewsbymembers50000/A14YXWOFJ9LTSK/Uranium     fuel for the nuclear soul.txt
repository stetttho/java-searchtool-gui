 The Vapors have demonstrated by the artistic ability to hold fast to the claim, "one of the Fathers of New Way".  The Vapors and A Flock of Seagulls arguably could be deemed as the reason for the 80's onslaught of great music. In the beginning, God created the Vapors and A Flock of Seagulls who begat all others! Bottom line, buy this CD, crank it up, air-guitar yourself into a frenzy and hold your head high!
