 I originally read this book because I didn't know much about Watchman Nee and only knew that he wrote a lot of hymns.  However, when I started reading about his life, my respect and awe of him grew so much.  His lifestyle is so real and so encouraging.  This book was an easy read and I read it in one sitting because it is impossible to put down.  While I read this book, I was reminded of Hebrews 12:1, "Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us."  By reading about Watchman Nee, I was blessed by the radical lifestyle he lived.  He ran the race and persevered in even the most difficult of times and now he is cheering us on in our race to the end!  Go and get this book and be inspired and blessed!!
