 This is like the pinnacle for all origami folders.  If you can master all these origami figures in this book, then you are one high-powered origami folder!  This book really gives you a challenge and hours of fun, or shall  I say frustration!  :)  An absolute must, for any hardcore origamist!  If  you want a challenge, this is definitely the book for you.  I've looked at  Origami Fantasy by Kawahata, and ISSEI SUPER COMPLEX ORIGAMI, by Yoshino,  and this insect book by Lang is in the same level as these books.  I can't  stress how good this book is!  :)
