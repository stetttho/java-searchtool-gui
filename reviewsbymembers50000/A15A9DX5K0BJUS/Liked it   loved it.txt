 I liked this book and my new boyfriend LOVED the technique! I had practiced at home like the author suggests, but hadn't had a chance to try it out on a man until I started dating a new guy. I was skeptical, to say the least. What would he think? Would he enjoy the sight of me taking charge of my own orgasm? I was apprehensive, but he had popped off about women taking longer to reach orgasm, and I had retorted "that's what you think," so I had no choice but to give it a try. Just like the author Hutchins predicts, he absolutely LOVED it! He gives me the highest marks (figuratively speaking) for my lovemaking technique. His eyes lit up like roman candles, and sex sent us both into orbit. Was it exactly five minutes? I wasn't exactly watching the clock, but I don't think so. The important result was sex was fun for both of us. Will I use this technique every time? Probably not, but it sure is a welcome relief not to have to work so darn hard every time I want to have an orgasm.
