 I loved, loved, LOVED this book. It has the best nutritional advise I've read so far. I have been struggling with my weight for years but by following the principles in this book, I lost twenty pounds quite fast. I've added aerobics and weight training and lost another 10 pounds.  Try it - it WORKS!
