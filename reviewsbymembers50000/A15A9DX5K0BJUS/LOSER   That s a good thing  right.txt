 Unlike the Atkins diet, which made my breath stink, gave me constipation and a number of other unmentionable symptoms, this diet worked great for me. I didn't give up meat entirely but was able to incorporate more plant foods into my diet after reading this book. Not only did I lose 20 pounds, I also quit getting sick! Everyone at work was getting the flu this past winter, but I didn't get sick once. I didn't even take the flu shot. Everyone I know who is still trying to go on the Atkins plan (and getting on and off of it consistently because they can't stick to it) is getting sicker. Whatever their ailments before, they've gotten worse, and that includes arthritis and asthma. Meanwhile, I'm feeling better and better and looking great. Have started an exercise program and looking forward to improving my diet even more. By the way guys, if you are a Viagra candidate, then I suggest you try this diet first. The same foods that cause your arteries to clog up will cause you problems in other areas as well. Try it. If you are not too stubborn.
