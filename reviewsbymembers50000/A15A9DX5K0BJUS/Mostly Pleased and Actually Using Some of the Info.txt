 This book has some useful information, especially about exercise, but I won't try to describe it. It's been done in detail by other reviews. You will be working out A LOT, mostly weight lifting, but I especially liked his approach to the 20 minute Aerobic program which seems to be doing as much for me as twice that long on the treadmill that I used to do. He has a little different approach to weight lifting than other books. So far it seems to be working, but I don't look like the pictures YET. In one month I've lost 10 pounds and gained muscle tone. The only argument I have with the book is about his nutritional advice, but this is true of almost all body builders. They pretty much give you the party line-standard stuff. I was able to lose weight more effectively by using Neal Bernard's "Turn Off the Fat Genes." I like what Phillips says about portions though - the size of your fist. That's keeping it simple.
