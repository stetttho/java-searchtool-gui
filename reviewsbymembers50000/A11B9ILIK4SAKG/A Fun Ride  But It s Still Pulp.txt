 Make no mistake, this is a fun summer read. But that's all it is. There's a review on the cover of the book that says that it's a thriller with an "unusually high IQ." That's a bit of a stretch. Dan Brown combines an impressive knowledge of science, architecture, and art with a shallow understanding of (and apparent bias against) Christianity to produce a fun book that shouldn't be taken seriously. And there are parts where the author says things like "if he'd only known what would happen later that day, he would have stayed in bed." This is unspeakably awful and gives the feel that you're reading a Hardy Boys novel instead of a "high IQ" thriller. I also had a hard time routing for the main character because he was such a weenie. This made the more suspenseful parts less exciting because I was secretly hoping the guy would get killed. Still, the idea for the plot is great and there are parts of the book that are pure pulp euphoria. But I don't think holding a tarp over your head would help much when you're falling from a helicopter far up in the sky. Maybe that's just me.
