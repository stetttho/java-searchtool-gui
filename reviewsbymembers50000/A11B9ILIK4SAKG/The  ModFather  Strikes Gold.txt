 Well, let me start by saying that this is going to be a very biased review, considering the fact that I believe Paul Weller to be one of the coolest individuals to ever live. And I adore most of his music (the reason I didn't say "all" can be summed up in two words: Style Council). But he really launched into the stratosphere with this album. I can honestly find no fault with this wonderful CD. It's all there. If you want to rock out, listen to "Sunflower" or "Fifth Season". If you want to relax, try "All The Pictures on the Wall" or "Moon on Your Pyjamas". And if you're an acoustic fan, "Foot of the Mountain" is your song. Needless to say there's a lot more, but the only way you can find out is to pick up a copy of your own. Do so immediately!!
