 There are so many things I'd like to say about this book, but it all boils down to one thing -- this man is durn funny. His comic genius is astounding and his writing style is perfect for his genre. I will say that this book is not for the stupid -- Mike's a smart man and he makes references that might make some say, "What the?". On the other hand, if you do get the obscure references it's immensly rewarding and usually laugh-out-loud funny (which is why you probably shouldn't read it in a public setting). I can't tell you what my favorite part is because I'd virtually have to rewrite the book. It's that funny. From a dead-on depiction of single men and their penchant for moving couches, a thought-provoking diatribe on the usefulness of animals, to a stirring call to end the madness that is Radio Shack, this book WILL make you laugh, even if you're not a MSTie. If you don't laugh at all whilst reading this work of brilliance, I'm sorry to inform you that you're dead.
