 Well, let me begin this review with the disclaimer that I have not beaten this game yet. There are some people who beat this game the day they bought it, but I have neither the time or the skill to accomplish such a feat. In any case, here are my thoughts and observations so far. I really like the fact that there is no intro at all -- you're just thrust into the action at Pearl Harbor with no clue as to how the controls work or what you're supposed to do. Talk about realism! Another aspect of the game that is different from the previous Medal of Honor titles is that you're just a regular grunt in the Marine Corps -- at least in the beginning -- and then you get recruited into the OSS. There are no real mission briefs to speak of, you just do your part. That's quite a bit more realistic than the other MOH titles, where you're everywhere at once (D-Day, Market Garden, the Buldge, etc., etc.) and single-handedly bring down the Third Reich. One thing to watch out for is the fact that the Germans fought differently than the Japanese and this carries over into the game. Whereas a German in the previous games might run away, the Japs just scream and try to bayonet you. They're a lot more agressive and this can make progressing through the game difficult. To make things easier on you, you're actually allowed to save your progress during the mission, a feature I'm eternally grateful for. There's also a two-player co-op mode and, if you have the equipment, you can play online with fellow "Marines". In summary, these new features can make die-hard fans of the previous format a little disappointed. It still feels like you're playing a MOH game, though and you'd have to be comatose to not enjoy yourself while playing it. Highly reccomended!
