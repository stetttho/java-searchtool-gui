 I know a lot of you out there are going to disagree with me on this, but I hereby proclaim from the rooftops that this is the greatest single ever put forth by humankind! Period. Noel and crew had climbed to the highest peak when this was released and they could do no wrong. Coming off of a debut album that landed them in the Guiness Book of World Records, it was going to be difficult to top the tremendous success of "Definitely, Maybe" and all of the great singles that accompanied it. But, somehow they did. The title track is, ironically, the least impressive of the four. It starts off sounding dangerously close to "Cigarettes & Alcohol" and then proceeds with a great beat and lyrics that make absolutely no sense whatsoever. "Talk Tonight" is a great ballad that Noel wrote about the time he almost committed suicide in Las Vegas right before the band hit big. This is one to break out the lighters for! It's very touching, even if Liam isn't quite clapping to the beat. "Acquiesce" is a jaw-dropper that could have been a huge single in it's own right. Why it was kept off the album is beyond me. The guitar work is great, Liam's voice shines, and big bruv comes in to save him from the high notes at just the right time. The quintessential rock song. The last track is "Headshrinker", which is an ode to one of Liam's mentally unstable ex's. It's one of the hardest songs Oasis has ever done and the world is a better place for it. Thus ends one of the best experiences music listeners were treated to in 1995. Oasis was the biggest band in the world and this single established it for the ages. It made Blur shudder in fear and will make you want more. Thankfully, Oasis is still around making the best music out there, so there's plenty more where this came from.
