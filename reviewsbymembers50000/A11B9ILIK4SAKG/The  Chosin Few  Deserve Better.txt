 One would be hard-pressed to find a greater story of courage and heroism than that of the Chosin Resevoir Campaign. But if you read this book you might be duped into thinking that the "bad guys" in the story were not the Koreans or Chinese, but the United States Army. Russ's "Marine good, Army bad" ideology gets old very fast and would seem to be an insult to the Army boys who fought and DIED beside the perfect, flawless Marines. Other than this un-intelligent bias against fellow American soldiers, Russ is a pretty bad writer and gives little context to what was happening and why it was happening. This leaves the reader befuddled and makes the narrative choppy and hard to decipher. In short, there are many better studies of this campaign out there. Read those first. Semper Fi.
