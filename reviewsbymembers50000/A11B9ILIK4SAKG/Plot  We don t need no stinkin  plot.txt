 Some critic out there called this "the scariest movie since 'The Exorcist'". That has to be one of the most idiotic statements in the history of humankind. There isn't even so much as a nanosecond of scariness anywhere to be found in this trash heap of a movie. It starts off vaguely interesting, what with all of London being deserted except for one incredibly ugly naked man who wakes up...you guessed it...28 days after the world is wiped out by a plague. He finally runs into some survivors who aren't "infected" and the rip off of "The Stand" continues. Then, in the middle of the film, with no warning whatsoever, we skip from a horror flick to a truly disgusting social commentary that makes you roll your eyes and ensures that, no matter what happens, you won't care. As it turns out, our "heroes" run into a miltary outpost full of soldiers concerned with nothing more than rape. And all of a sudden the zombies stop being the bad guys and the military takes over the job, because we all know that soldiers are far more dangerous than mass numbers of murderous zombies. Anyway, the film ends with ugly naked man (who by now is at least wearing pants) enlisting the support of one such zombie in order to kill the soldiers who are going to "rape" the other two, thus ensuring that the species will not procreate and therefore die off. Hooray!..   That's the gist of this amazingly bad movie. Don't even bother renting it.
