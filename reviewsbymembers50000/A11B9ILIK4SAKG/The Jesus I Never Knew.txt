 Okay, so I stole the title from Phil Yancey! Get over it! Seriously though, this book presented a view of Christ that consistently amazed and terrified me. It's so pleasing to my soul to know that Jesus isn't the mamby-pamby, good-buddy hippie that the modern Benny-Hinn-inspired "church" has made Him out to be. No, He's sooo much better than that! Piper does an amazing job of showing Our Lord in all His wonder, love, and majesty. He isn't afraid to show us the less popular side of Jesus that isn't afraid to turn over some tables and curse some fig trees too! The prayers that end each chapter are always uplifting and can easily reduce one to tears. All Christians should pick this book up and read it at least 100 times. Don't be fooled by it's size though: it's appropriately heavy stuff that requires meditation and prayer virtually after each sentance. In conclusion, if I believed in reincarnation (which I don't) I'd suspect that John Piper is Jonathan Edwards on his second tour of duty. Read it and grow wise. And don't forget to worship too!
