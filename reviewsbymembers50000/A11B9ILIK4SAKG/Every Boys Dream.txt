 I feel the need...the need for cheese! Yes, Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer pull no punches in this 80's macho-fest that reigns supreme as the most-watched movie of my childhood. I'll waste no time explaining the plot here because I doubt there's a single living American who hasn't seen this movie at least once. The love story is pitiful, mainly because Kelly McGillis has the acting capacity of a sedated turtle and the soundtrack is more 80's than Jams and David Hasselhoff combined. But other than that, this movie just plain rocks! It's every (straight) little boy's dream come true and to deny that is to deny an integral part of being a male. Yeah, there's a lot of hokie stuff and maybe the dogfights are a tad unrealistic, but the overall product is quite entertaining. I know there are women out there rolling their collective eyes, so let me put it this way: movies like "Top Gun" touch men the way soap operas touch women. Got it? This movie made it into my "Top 25 Greatest War Movies of All Time" list that I hope you all check out and enjoy.
