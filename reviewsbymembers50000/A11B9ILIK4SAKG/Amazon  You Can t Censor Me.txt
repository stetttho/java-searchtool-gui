 I wrote a glowing review of this book over a week ago and it hasn't been placed on this page because of some "questionable" things I said therein. I used no profanity, racial-slurs, or any other kind of derogatory comment -- all I did was praise the book. That's questionable. Yet it's okay for other liberal reviewers to say things like "wipe your butt with this book". So, apparently, the only way you can get away with saying slanderous things on Amazon is if you hate this book. The two reviews that they chose to feature at the top of the page both are against the book. So, basically, what happened to me on this page proves the thesis of the book! Read it and you'll see what I mean.
