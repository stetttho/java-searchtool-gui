 This album came reccomended from none other than Noel Gallagher of Oasis, so I jumped at the opportunity to grab it the next time I went to the music store. And, after listening to it, I indeed did ask, "Is this it?" I mean, is it really necessary to use the exact same muffled distortion on EVERY STINKIN' SONG? Come on! If these guys are the saviors of rock that some have claimed them to be, then I'm going to weep and put on "(What's the Story) Morning Glory" so I can remember how it used to be. Good grief.
