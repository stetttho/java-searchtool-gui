 If you're a member of Green Peace or any other radical environmentalist group, this is not the novel for you (unless killing off the entire planet with an enhanced form of Ebola suits your fancy, that is). Tom Clancy proves he is a master of whipping up a complex, plausible, and contemporary plot in this 897 page monster of a thriller. John Clark and Ding Chavez are the main characters (sorry, but there's no one named Ryan here) and they set up a multi-national anti-terrorist task force code named "Rainbow". As soon as the organization is set in place, business is booming as terrorists start popping out of the woodwork at an alarming rate. It is readily apparent that these acts are related and the race is on to see if the bad guys will succeed in their bid to unleash a biological nightmare on the entire world. The writing is crisp, and everything you could ask for in a Clancy novel is spread liberally throughout. I only have a few beefs with this book and the first one would have to be length. Clancy could have cut at least 400 pages out and the book would still hold up under scrutiny. Parts were repetitive in the extreme and I for one thought I was going to explode if I had to read through yet another diatribe on the thought processes of Dr. John Killgore! We get the point, Tom! My other main complaint is that there is little chance for suspense when the main characters of the book are all mini-Rambo's. Even Clancy admits in the last "battle" that the foes were no match for Rainbow and it was akin to shooting fish in a barrel. Where's the fun in that? And they only took two casualties in the entire book? Come on! Anyway, those are my main beefs, but I still thought that it was a great page-turner. All faults aside, it's still a lot of fun, and if you're a Clancy fan it's a must.
