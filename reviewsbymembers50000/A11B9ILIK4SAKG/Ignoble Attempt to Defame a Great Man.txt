 If you're looking for proof that revisionism is ruining our collective understanding of history, look no farther than this book. Using the French & Indian War as his backdrop, non-historian Thomas Lewis paints an horrifically inaccurate character portrait of a young George Washington, knowing that being controversial is the quickest way to make a name for yourself in the publishing industry. This disgrace of a book showcases Washington as a dunce of a commander, a filthy Indian-hater, and an egomaniac bent on fame no matter what the cost. This is all very easy to allege when you're in the comfort of your living room and looking at things 200 years after they've happened. Washington didn't have this convinience. In short, don't waste your time with this trash. Stick to reading books about Washington written by people with a grasp on reality such as Douglas Southall Freeman or James Thomas Flexner. Washington was a flawed man, yes; but his flaws only served to make him that much greater of a man. When he reached the end of his life, he could honestly say, "I've laid the foundation for a country." When Lewis dies, he'll be able to say, "Heh-heh, I made a few bucks by writing a crappy little book that had no impact." Therein lies the difference.
