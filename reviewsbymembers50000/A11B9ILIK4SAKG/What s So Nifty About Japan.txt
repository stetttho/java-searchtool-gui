 Remind me to smack Matthew Sweet next time I see him. I mean, from the one time I met him he seemed to be a genuinely nice guy, but to withold this album from his American fans is more than a little annoying. If it were a rancid filth-pile of an album, then I could understand. But this is REALLY REALLY good stuff! I just got my copy yesterday and it's been playing non-stop in my CD player. Yes friends, Matthew Sweet is back with a vengance! Don't worry about everything sounding like it was recorded in a bathroom like on "In Reverse". Don't fret over lack of substance like on "Blue Sky on Mars". No, this is akin to all the good stuff from his glory days ("Girlfriend", "Altered Beast", and "100% Fun"). But if you're unfortunate enough to live anywhere BUT Japan, you're going to have to do some searching to find this and when you do, be prepared to pay a hefty price. Tisk tisk, Matt. So, in summary, this is a wonderful album full of addictive melodies and catchy songs. Get it if you can afford it.
