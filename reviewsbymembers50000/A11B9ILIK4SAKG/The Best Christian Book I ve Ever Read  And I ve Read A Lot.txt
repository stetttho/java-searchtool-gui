 Wow. I don't even know where to begin. Words cannot describe what this book means to me. I guess I should start by saying that I picked up this book when I was going through the worst time of my life. I was struggling with alcoholism, I had just been through a traumatic car accident, and my fiancee of three years had broke up with me. Needless to say, I had some issues with God. But I was inexplicably thirsty for Him at the same time. Enter John Piper. When I saw that this book was voted one of the top 100 books of the twentieth century, I thought I'd give it a whirl. I was immediatley hooked. The picture that Piper presents of God was one I'd never heard of before. I grew up in the Southern Baptist church and therefore had some wrong ideas about the character of God. Piper swept those away with his beautiful prose and for the first time I caught a glimpse of God as He truly is. Once again, words fail. I will say though, that it filled me was such joy that all of the bad circumstances in my life didn't seem like such a big deal anymore. I look back at the time when I read this book with nostalgia (even though it was only five months ago) and can't wait to read everything else Piper has written. If you read this book and don't weep for joy at God's goodness, something is wrong. Read it again. Only Scripture itself can surpass it. Thank you, Pastor Piper. You've made a Christian Hedonist out of me because of this book.
