 My earliest memory of Bleach stems from the time that I first heard "Super Good Feeling" and said "Whoa, these guys are trying way too hard to sound like Oasis." I scoffed, but by the end of the day I was standing in line with a copy of "Static" in my hands. It was a good, if somewhat goofy album that had catchy, three-chord rockers mixed with a bit of whacked out 80's synth. I'd give it three stars out of five. I say all this to illustrate the lack of expectation I felt when I saw that they had released a third studio album. I was loyal enough to buy it, but I wasn't anticipating that it would become one of my favorite albums of all time. Well, it did. Simply put, this is power-rock done to perfection. People wonder why the CD that came out after this wasn't so great, well the reason is that after this release there was nowhere left to go but down! Every song is finely crafted with a specific purpose and that purpose is achieved fully on each track. Whether the purpose is to rock out hardcore ("Sun Stands Still"), softly show devotion to God ("Give it All to You"), or just plain have fun ("Breathe"), a bullseye is hit every time. The guitar playing is solid, harmonies are well done, and Dave Baysinger has one of the coolest rock voices ever. To summarize, whether you're a devout follower of Christ or a wayward pagan, you NEED this CD. It's just plain great rock'n'roll.
