 This book seems to be the only resource out there for people wanting to better understand the ten month seige of Petersburg. Trudeau writes in an engaging narrative style and handles his subject skillfully. The parts that mention the explosion at the docks in City Point and the rapid narrative that describes the battle of Fort Stedman stand out as a few of the many satisfying moments in the book. Having been a Seasonal Park Ranger at Petersburg National Battlefield, I found "The Last Citadel" an indispensable resource and heartily reccomend it to all students of the Civil War.
