 Wow. As an avid reader of World War II history, this book stands out with the likes of "Band of Brothers" and "Flags of Our Fathers" as one of the greats. This book appealed to me on several levels. First and foremost, I'm a living historian with the 29th Infantry Division re-enactment group and therefore have special feelings for that particular units sacrifice on D-Day. Also, I used to go to college twenty miles from Bedford, so I could relate to things like climbing Sharp Top mountain and strolling through the town. Other than that, the story pretty much sells itself. It's hard not to fall in love with the Bedford boys with all of the anecdotes and intimate stories that Kershaw tells in the book. The writing is crisp and sucks you in to the point where you really feel like you're there, struggling with them. Even though I knew what was going to happen, I still gasped a few times. In short, if you're a World War II buff or just someone who appreciates the cost of freedom, you should definitely grab this book. It's well-written, factually correct, and tugs at the heart -- just the way a good history book should. 29th, Let's Go!
