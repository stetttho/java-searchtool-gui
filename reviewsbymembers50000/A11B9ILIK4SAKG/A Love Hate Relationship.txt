 If Ken Burns could have let go of his preconceived notions and politics before making this epic documentary, it would've easily earned five stars from me. But he didn't, thus the three star rating. There is so much good to be said about this film. When dealing with the common soldier in the ranks, Burns is dead-on. You really get to identify with the boys of '61, who in my opinion deserve the title of "The Greatest Generation". The civilian side is told adequately as well. The problem is that both of these stories suffer because of the constant attention paid to slavery. While Burns could have spent more time delving into the miltary strategies that affected how the war was fought and won, he told us instead what Frederick Douglass had for breakfast on any given day. Instead of utilizing such experts in the field  as Gary Gallagher and Robert K. Krick, we get instead pseudo-historian and certified idiot Barbara Fields who spews inaccuracies and Black Panther politics quicker than a jackrabbit on a date. This will cause a lot of annoyed fast-forwarding for those in the know. There are also rare occasions where Burns just blatantly lies, apparently to see how much he can get away with. In one scene it is said that Stonewall Jackson was "a cold-blooded killer" and that his soldiers "only followed him because he gave them victories." This is akin to saying that the Holocaust never happened. It's THAT ridiculously stupid and just as equally untrue. So, in conclusion, Burns is at the height of his form when revealing the emotional aspects and motivations of the war (you WILL cry during the Sullivan Ballou letter -- I promise). His main weakness is in injecting his liberal politics and reverse-racism into what would otherwise be the best documentary ever made.
