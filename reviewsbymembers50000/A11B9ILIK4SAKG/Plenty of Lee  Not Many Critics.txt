 When I bought this book I assumed it would be in the vein of Charles Roland's "Reflections on Lee" (which is excellent). In other words, I thought it would be a rebuttal of the current excrement that's been written by the likes of Thomas Connelly and Alan Nolan. The "And His Critics" part of the title led me to this conclusion. Well, what I got instead was a short biography of Lee that was competent, but broke no new ground. Connelly and Nolan and their unfounded, post-modern rantings were only mentioned twice in the entire book: once at the beginning and again at the end. This sorely disappointed me and made it a grueling task to finish the book. I agree with most of Taylor's conclusions, but the false advertising in the title was so misleading and irksome that I couldn't enjoy the book. For those who have read Roland's book and would like to read more in the same vein, I'd reccomend "Call of Duty: The Sterling Nobility of Robert E. Lee" by J. Steven Wilkins. Don't waste your time with this one.
