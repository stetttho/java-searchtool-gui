 Listen up people, 'cause I'm only going to say this once. Gary Louris is ten times the singer, songwriter, and musician that Mr. Olson ever was!!!! Get over him!! The Jayhawks have only gone uphill since he left, for crying out loud! This is one of the most phenomenal albums I've ever listened to -- it's truly a contender for top ten greatest albums of all time -- and the only reason that old blowhards don't like it is because it's missing a certain nasal voice. Now, to clarify my position here, I think the previous Jayhawks albums were  awe-inspiring and I like Mark Olson a whole heck of a lot. But Louris is just so more compelling that it's a crime to condemn this album just because Mark isn't on it. If you don't believe me, listen to "Hollywood Town Hall" and "Sound of Lies" back to back. Which is better? That's what I thought!
