 If you're a remotley conscious human being with a television, then you know that there are only two stages in human development: before "24" and after. If you're smart and buy this DVD, you will not eat, sleep, or think of anything else until you finish it. And when you do, well...get ready to drop a couple " f bombs", because there will be no satisfying resolutions made. Apparently, the directors want to make you a worthless, sniffling pile of raw emotion, because that's what you'll be if you watch this. But it's worth it. There's some sick, masochistic element of the human psyche that makes you want more, so you should also be prepeared to sell off any expensive items you might own in order to buy Season Two. I just thought I'd warn you. Anyway, on to the show itself. To use the word "addictive" would be akin to referring to Howard Dean as an "idiot" -- it fits, but it doesn't quite give the all-encompassing feeling that's appropriate. Kiefer Sutherland is Jack Bauer, an ex-military counter-terrorist agent in Los Angeles who has to find his kidnapped wife and worthless daughter AND prevent the assassination of presidential hopeful David Palmer (played by the voodoo guy from "Major League") in less than 24 hours. Oh yeah, and he has to do all of this without getting killed or having to change his underwear along the way. There's plenty of action, intrigue, and suspense to keep you on the brink of sanity until the bitter end and just when you think you have something figured out, something will happen that will make you think you've missed an episode. Some of the stuff is silly and nausea-inducing (mainly because of Jack's retarded ho of a daughter), but it doesn't take away from the whole picture. So go and watch "24". Just don't make any plans for the next two weeks.
