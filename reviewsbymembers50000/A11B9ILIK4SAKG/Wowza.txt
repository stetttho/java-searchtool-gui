 I have a bumpersticker on my car that reads "I Like Switchfoot". Living in Richmond, Virginia where most people have never heard of this great band, I get a lot of wierd looks. But that's okay -- I'm not ashamed to suffer for the art I love. Anyway, the point of what I'm saying is that the reason I have that sticker on my car is this album. I had known of the band for a while, but the only songs I knew were "Underwater" and "New Way to be Human" and they got on my nerves. "Learning to Breathe" blew me away, though. Some of my favorite songs of all time are on this CD ("Dare You to Move" and "Open Arms")and I can't reccomend it enough. Even though I'm a Christian I usually look down on Christian music as inferior to secular stuff. Switchfoot proved me wrong on this CD.
