 Well, I've never read the rest of the books in this series, but if they all read like this book I think I'd rather stab myself repeatedly in the eye with an icepick than continue. This book would be sooo much better if I could figure out just what in God's name King is talking about!! He gives little background to ANYTHING, refers to objects and places casually like you know what they are (when you don't), and drags the plot out way too long. But, King has always had a problem with spending too much time explaining stuff you don't need to know about. The only thing that kept me going was the hope that the other volumes would be better. Thankfully, you other reviewers out there have given me reason to keep hoping. But in comparison with masterpieces like "The Stand" and "Needful Things" this in no way measures up. If "The Drawing of the Three" is this bad, I just might shoot myself in the "heada" with a "gunna". Ugh.
