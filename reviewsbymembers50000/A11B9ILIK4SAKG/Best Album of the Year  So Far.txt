 Anyone who's a fan of great music shouldn't walk -- they should run to their local music store and get this album. Having been a huge fan of Matthew Sweet for the past seven years I was interested when I heard that he was combining his skills with those of Pete Droge and Shawn Mullins. I eagerly awaited the release of the album and was not disappointed when it came out. Granted, there are a few ... tracks like "Thorns" but "Runaway Feeling" and "Among the Living", to name a few, more than make up for it. The only warning I'll give is that this CD is highly addictive and you may never be able to dislodge some of these great tunes from your head.
