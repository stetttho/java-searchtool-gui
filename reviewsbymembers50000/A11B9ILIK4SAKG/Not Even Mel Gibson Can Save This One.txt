 Oh, the humanity! Why God, why?!! This movie had so much potential, but squandered it on stupid Hollywood fantasy! The problems are so innumerable I can't possibly delve into all of them, but let me state a few, if I may. First of all, this movie has no grasp of history whatsoever. Other than giving an occaisional nod to an actual figure from the American Revolution (whom they usually villify for no reason or remake  into John Wayne) the writers obviously just tried to remember what they learned in grade school. The British are portrayed as the gestapo, murdering women and children indescriminately and bumbling around the colonies just trying to break things and drink tea. This isn't even in the same galaxy of the truth. And I won't even get into Mel's pre-pubecent sons taking out a platoon of the world's finest soldiers! Puh-lease! The treatment of slavery in the movie is God-awful -- most of the slaves actually sided with the British because of their offer of freedom. Not so in Patriotland. And can anybody explain the reason that all of the main characters took a vacation in the middle of the fight and went to live with the aforementioned slaves? The scene on the beach reminded me of the party the Ewoks held at the end of "Return of the Jedi". The movie ends in a battle that's an apparent combination of Cowpens and Guilford Courthouse -- two battles that were months and miles apart in the real world. And, of course the good guy kills the bad guy in an extremely gross way. This is just the tip of the iceberg, unfortunately. The script is formulaic, the performances are not exactly Oscar material, and Heath Ledger is in it. Speaking of him, the one saving grace in this movie is the scene where he died. I almost jumped out of my seat and cheered. In any case, if you watch this movie, please don't think that that's the way the American Revolution really was. Please?
