 I've been a fan of Robert K. Krick ever since "Stonewall Jackson at Cedar Mountain" came out and to say that I eagerly anticipated the release of this volume would be an understatement. The combination of Mr. Krick's mastery of the facts and his engaging writing style makes the book pure reading euphoria for a true student of the Civil War. I cannot conceive of what "The Anti-Krick" was smoking when he wrote his less-than-informed review. Maybe he was put off by Mr. Krick's use of big words that he didn't know the definition of. Who knows? But to say that Krick is a disciple of the so-called "Lost Cause" is pure fiction. The man is from California for crying out loud! Anyway, I encourage everyone to read this book. Even if you're not a Civil War fanatic like me, the writing is so good that it would make Alan Nolan (possibly the Anti-Krick himself) wet his pants. I salute you, Bob.
