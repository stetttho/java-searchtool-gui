 When I first went through the material of this book, I had a crisis of faith that nearly killed me (literally). I had never been taught about this doctrine in my Southern Baptist church so it really hit me hard. I found myself viewing God as a "Cosmic Sadist" (to use C.S. Lewis's term) who toyed with His creation the way a child uses a magnifying glass to burn ants. I couldn't conceive of how a good God could create a person in need of redemption, wilfully deny that person the redemption he needs and cannot attain on his own, and then send them to a place of unending torment because the person wasn't redeemed. That smacked of evil to me. So I railed against God, felt betrayed by Him, and basically told Him the friendship was off. I went down a long path of misery that culminated in an alcohol-related car accident that nearly took my life. Now, obviously, that isn't the fault of Dr. Sproul or his book. But the chain of events did begin when I read this book (which is a poor reflection on me and my stubborn, sinful ways). After the accident, I had a lot of time to sit and ponder and I eventually came back to God. I now fully agree with everything that's been written in this book and Dr. Sproul is one of my favorite Bible teachers (even if his videos cost too much!) And I'm a Presbyterian now, which I know would make him happy! But I think a better explanation of this doctrine can be found in John Piper's "The Pleasures of God". Only after reading his explanation could I hold onto the doctrines of election and predestination AND still affirm that God is indeed good. Still, "Chosen by God" is a good introduction as long as you don't misinterpret its message like I did.
