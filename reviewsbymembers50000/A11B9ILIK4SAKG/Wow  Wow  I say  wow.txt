 Oh my goodness! This has to be one of the greatest albums I've ever had the pleasure of listening to. Sara and Sean Watkins and Chris Thile have to be three of the most talented individuals living. They're so talented, in fact, it's almost disgusting. I'm going to echo many of the other reviewers and say that I was no fan of bluegrass or country when I picked up this album in 2000. But I saw the video for "The Lighthouse's Tale" and immediately thought "I've got to get this CD." Oh how naive I was to think that that would be the only good song on the album! "Ode to a Butterfly" almost sent me into an epileptic fit (no, I don't have epilepsy, stupid!)it was so fast. The highlights for me are tracks 5-7. "Reasons Why" showcases Sara's voice better than any other track on the album and is also just a really good song. "When You Come Back Down" is the most country-sounding song on the album, but Thile's vocal's make it above average at the least. "Sweet Afton" is one of the most heartwrenching (both because of its beautiful sound and tragic lyrics) songs I've ever heard in my entire life. It's hard for me not to cry every time I listen to it. These are my three favorite songs on the album, but that in no way means that the others are substandard at all. And to the customers who gave this CD a one-star rating, one simple question: WHAT ON EARTH IS WRONG WITH YOU!!?? Get a clue!
