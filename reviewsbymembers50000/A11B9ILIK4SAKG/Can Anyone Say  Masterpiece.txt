 The world needs more people like Rich Mullins. He was a theologian, a musical genius, a poet, and a teacher all rolled into one. His passion and honesty were refreshing in a Christian music industry whose posterchildren all had perfect hair and teeth and lived a "blessed" life in their million-dollar mansions, safe and sound from the real world. Now he's gone and the only people out there making Christian music worth listening to are Phil Keaggy, Michael Card, and The Lost Dogs. Oh well. On to the album itself. Rich and his Ragamuffin band reached the peak of their ability on this record. Split into two parts -- the liturgy and the legacy -- these finely crafted songs range from agonizing prayers, to amazement at God's creation and everything in between. There's even a Christmas song that showcases Rich's amazing knack for capturing child-like wonder. The one instrumental track is a real treat for those who love the hammered dulcimer, one of the many instruments Rich knew how to play. If you're a serious pilgrim looking for music that will comfort and uplift without drenching you in bubblegum fluff, I heartily reccomend this work to you. You won't be disappointed, I promise. In closing, CCM magazine put out a list of the 100 greatest Christian albums of all time. This album was # 3 (after commercial sell-outs Amy Grant & Michael W. Smith). That oughtta say something, shouldn't it?
