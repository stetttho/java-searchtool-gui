 Well, if you read only one book about World War II this year, read "The Bedford Boys" and not this revisionist tome. Don't be fooled by the fact that it won a Pulitzer and don't believe all the glowing reviews on this page. Rick Atkinson's agenda while writing this book was apparently nothing more than to smear the entire Allied High Command and make the Axis powers look like inerrant geniuses. The working thesis for the book is "With idiots like this in command, it's amazing we won the war." Everyone from Eisenhower on down is attacked with criticisms that are occaisionaly justified, but usually extremely unfair. The GI's are no heroes according to Atkinson, but bumbling fools with inferior weapons, training, and (at least by implication) minds. This proves that Atkinson is no historian and has little idea of the extremely complicated situation that the Allies faced when they invaded North Africa. I'm suprised that my copy of the book is still in one piece since I threw it across the room at least once per chapter. In short, it's always a good rule-of-thumb to be dubious when reading a history book written by a journalist and that rule applies to this book. It has some interesting stories, but to claim to be THE book on the North Africa Campaign is a little much. I bet he's going to have a field day with Italy, but I'm not going to be fooled into reading this tripe again.
