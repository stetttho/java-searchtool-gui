 Let me start off by reccomending that some of the people who wrote reviews of this game take a course in basic spelling! Good grief people! Anyway, this is one of the most realistic combat games out there. The horror and excitement of front line combat in World War II was captured almost perfectly in this game. From storming Omaha Beach to rescuing the British Airborne during Market Garden, this game is like being in the middle of "The Longest Day" or "A Bridge Too Far". It isn't flawless, however. Some of the levels are very hard on the eyes and sometimes the sights of your gun will be directly on someone and you won't hit them. That's annoying. Overall, this game is a literal blast and you can become an expert on WWII uniforms and firearms just by playing. The history lessons at the end of each level are a somber reminder that real flesh and blood people had to die in order to stop the Nazi war machine. And I have a question for the less-than-intelligent gentleman who complained that you can't shoot your own men: why would you want to? What kind of sick sociopath are you? Get help! Anyway, if you have a PS2 and want a great first person shooter, you can't go wrong with this one. Hurry up and get here, Rising Sun!
