 Okay, this is mainly a response to Mr. Delaney's shocking (and uninformed -- "True Believers" came out in 1995, three years before this one) review of this album. This is not a horrible album by any means. Granted, it's not Phil's best, but the first song alone is worth the price of admission. I too have seen Phil in concert many times and I always wished he'd play more tunes off of this record than he usually does. Some of the songs are very Beatlesque and some touch on a faint Celtic theme. Most range from decent to incredible, but none are worthy of a one-star review. That's just plain nonsense! Oh, and Phil, in case you read this, could I get a photo with you or a pick at the very least for rising up in your defense? Please?
