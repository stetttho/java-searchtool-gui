 If you're one of the myriad of Americans who was turned on to Eddie Izzard by the incredible "Dress to Kill", you might be a little disappointed by "Circle". But, in reality, you shouldn't be. If you actually go back and review his material from previous shows, you'll know that "Dress to Kill" was sort of an "Eddie Izzard's Greatest Hits" compilation of earlier material with a few new tidbits thrown in for fun. And even if "Circle" doesn't hold a candle to D2K, it's still ten times funnier than any of the other popular comedy shows that seem to think that all you need to do to make people laugh is cuss alot and talk about sex (i.e. Robin Williams & Chris Rock). Eddie appeals to people with fully-functioning brains who have actually picked up a book once or twice in their lives. His bits on the use of the word "awesome" and his bit about Jesus and the dinosaurs are absolute comic gold. So go buy this DVD and watch one of the most talented living performers prove he's a master of his trade. Even if he doesn't make you laugh all of the time, his own personal charm covers a multitude of sins.
