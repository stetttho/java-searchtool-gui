 Whoa, what an album! To echo another reviewer, where have these guys been all my life? My journey to the Jayhawks has been a strange one. I first heard of them when the Thorns did a cover of "Blue" and then I bought "Hollywood Town Hall". The rest is history. Even though my favorite album of theirs is "Sound of Lies", this one comes in at a close second. Some of the tunes on this album are insanely hummable and you'll find yourself singing along even if you don't know the words. That's one of the marks of a good CD, in my humble opinion. It's hard to pick a favorite song on this because they're all so durn good. If you're a fan of great American music, get this and all of their other albums! You'll kick yourself for having missed out on such great music for so long. Thank you Jayhawks for putting some good music out in a world full of Backstreet Boys!
