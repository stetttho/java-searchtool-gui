 M. Night Howeveryouspellhisname is turning out to be one of the best filmmakers of all time and his latest offering, "Signs", proves it. Set amidst the backdrop of an alien invasion, this is really the story of a family who is trying to cope with a devastating loss and one man's path to regaining his faith. Mel Gibson heads this all-star cast and delivers one of the best performances of his career (which can be said for the other cast members as well). There are so many wonderful sides to this movie that I could never delve into them in one small review, but the really remarkable thing is that it is able to go from a scary scene to a heartbreaking one and then jump into humor while still maintaining believability -- which is no small accomplishment. It's one of those movies that you pick up something new every time you watch it. I've seen it at least 15 times and I'm not in the least bit sick of it. I stand in awe of this film and if you watch it with an open mind, you'll feel the same way.
