 Make no mistake, I'm a huge Oasis fan. I saw them in concert twice and actually got to meet Liam and Noel (even if it was for two seconds). Thus, I know what they're capable of in their live show and this DVD doesn't capture the full experience at all. Some of the versions on here are downright mediocre (Champagne Supernova, for one) and the rantings between the brothers Gallagher are incomprehensible. Is it really English they speak? Anyway, some of the good things about the DVD are the fact that, well, it's Oasis and they're just plain cool to look at. Noel's version of "Hey Hey, My My" is phenomenal as is the resurrected version of "Rock'n'Roll Star". If you're an Oasis fan, you should obviously buy this, but I'm still partial to Noel's acoustic set on "Live By the Sea" and almost every minute of "There and Then". I just wish they'd play more songs off of "Be Here Now" (yes, I'm one of the noble few who actually liked that album). Oh well, they're still an awesome band and I owe them a lot for getting me through High School!
