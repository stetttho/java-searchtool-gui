 James Longstreet is the classic example of the man who lives too long and says too much. This fictive attempt to excuse his pitiful performances and to detract from Robert E. Lee (who was conviniently dead and therefore unable to defend himself when this book came out)is definitely worth reading as long as you keep in mind that what he's saying is probably a little left of the truth. Recently, there was strong evidence unearthed that Longstreet didn't even write this ode to himself. In short, a better and shorter version of the content of this book can be found in Shaara's "Killer Angels".
