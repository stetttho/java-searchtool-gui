 Okay, answer me this. Why go to all the trouble to make a movie about an historic event, take the time to make sure that the uniforms were correct and even that the right kind and number of horses were accurate and then blow it all in a climax that lasts about four-and-a-half seconds? And what in the name of all that's holy is up with the trippy cartoons? They don't belong in a war film!! I mean, this isn't "Yellow Submarine", is it? Oh, the humanity! I wanted to like this movie. I really did. I'm a huge fan of the British military and was hoping that this would be in the same vein as "Zulu" or "Khartoum". What I got was this turd of a movie. I don't know why everybody in the filmmaking establishment has such an unfettered hatred of all things British. I'm really getting sick of it, though. Hippies shouldn't make war movies. And that's all I have to say about that.
