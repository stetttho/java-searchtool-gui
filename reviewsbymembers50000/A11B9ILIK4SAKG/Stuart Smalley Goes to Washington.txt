 Al Franken succumbs to using the choice weapon for liberals these days -- name calling. Pretending to be "in the know", he makes no real point in this tome except that anyone who disagrees with him is a lying hypocrite. Wow. That might be good enough for a third grade playground, but here in the grown up world it falls flat on its face. And this is truly a shame because he has such a good sense of humor and quick wit! Oh the shame of a once good mind gone to waste! If Franken wants to pretend that he can still be significant after Saturday Night Live, he'll have to try harder next time!
