 If you've never read a book on the momentous clash of arms that took place at Sharpsburg in 1862, then you should read this book to get the basic overall picture. But be forewarned: it's a VERY basic picture. Of the 156 pages, only about 15 pertain to the actual battle of Antietam. Apparently Dr. McPherson had a deadline he had to meet and had to hastily throw in the very event that the title of the books claims to explain in order to meet it. The introduction to the political and military picture in both North and South preceding the battle is probably the best you'll find in any Civil War book. McPherson makes events that most buffs already know about seem fresh and new due to his remarkable talent to concisely explain things. And if you hold to the popular opinion that the Southern Confedracy was one big Klan rally, then you'll especially enjoy Jim's barely-concealed bias against the South. Several times the author makes it clear that if Lee's army had won, "freedom" (which he fails to define) would be lost forever. But this can be forgiven, because those of us who've read Dr. McPherson before know what to expect and have developed a talent for skipping through the Lincoln-worshipping propaganda and getting straight to the good stuff. And there's plenty of good stuff contained herein. I heartily reccomend this book to all Civil War buffs and those with a passing interest in history. The writing is superb, many fascinating firsthand accounts are used, and the overall picture is given in a manner that is short, yet sufficient. Just don't heap any more hatred on us Southerners after you read it!
