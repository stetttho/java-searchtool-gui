 This book is basically the Nazi version of the history of the Bosnian Muslim Handzar SS Division. Lepre interviews the surviving Bosnian Muslims and Albanian Muslim members of the division. Many reisde in Germany where they escaped war crimes prosecutions for committing war crimes and genocide against Bosnian Serb Orthodox Christians. In fact, the Bosnian Muslims had two SS Divisions. The second division was Kama. The reader should be forewarned: This is a Nazi book, a book assembled by the son of Karl-Gustav Sauberzweig, the commander of the division. So this is the Nazis telling the story. George Lepre does a good job "writing" the book for them, the SS. He tries to present the SS and the Nazis as heroic figures. Or at the least, just soldiers doing their duty. But Himmler was the architect of the Holocaust. Lepre is a good mouthpiece for the Nazi SS. My objections to the part are detailed below. First of all, Lepre LEAVES OUT or OMITS the horrendous, shocking, and brutal massacres of the Serbian population of Bosnia. Lepre "forgot", right! In 1941, Serbs were rounded up and murdered and exterminated village by village. The Croats/Muslims carried the decapitated heads of Serbian priets on strings!!! These Muslim/Croat freedom fighters were horrendous war criminals. Lepre leaves all this out. He tells us that Serbs were murdering Muslims but doesn't tell us why they did it. And the victims were Muslim Ustasha troops. Second, the Serbs were the largest group in Bosnia during WWII. But Lepre does not seem to even notice them.  Duh!(...)
