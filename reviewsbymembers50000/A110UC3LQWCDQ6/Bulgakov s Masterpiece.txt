 The Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov in the 1967 Mirra Ginsburg translation is nothing short of a literary masterpiece. Re-reading the novel recently, I found the novel to be sublime and to transcend time. M& M is a timeless classic. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to read imaginative and well-written literature. This book belongs with the very best. It shows Bulgakov to be a great writer, one of the few really great Soviet writers. There are other translations now and there are stage adaptations and even an opera of Master and Margarita. Mirra Ginsburg's 1967 translation still stands up and is very readable. There are translations that incorporate some of the passages cut out in the 1966-67 Russian version in MOSKVA. Nevertheless, Ginsburg's translation is excellent and stands up well. The republication edition is excellent. What can you say. This is a great book. It is highly recommended.Bulgakov wrote other stuff too, plays, novels, sketches, etc. The White Guard, Black Snow, The Heart of a Dog, Flight, are some of his other works. Bulgakov needs greater exposure in the US. His style will certaily appeal to most readers. The Master and Margarita is a 20th  century classic, and required reading.
