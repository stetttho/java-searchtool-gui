 ALL THNGS MUST PASS is a brilliant album which features Harrison at his peak as a songwriter and guitarist. There are some great Harrison solos here (along with scorchers from Eric Clapton)and out-of-this-world slide guitar work. This is hardly mentioned. George Harrison pioneered the sitar in pop music and the 12 string Rickenbacker sound that everybody ripped off from him. Harrison also developed the guitar riffs that are featured on this album (WAH-WAH, WHAT IS LIFE). Harrison is underappreciated and neglected as a guitarist, but this album shows him to be one of the greats. Listen to his solo on ISN'T IT A PITY or WAH-WAH. Moreover, people forget that in 1971 Harrison released THE CONCERT FOR BANGLADESH, another musical milestone that won Grammy album of the year and featured Bob Dylan, Ravi Shanker in one of the first benefit concerts. The 3 record set was brilliant. So this album is only PART 1. PART 2 is the Bangladesh concert.On this album, every song is great, there is no filler. Harrison also has a certain drive and conviction here. It is a milestone in rock music. This album is deserving of the praise. More people should listen to it. If MC HAMMER and MILLI VANILLI can sell over 0 million records, why can't really brilliant music sell? This is the real deal. Harrison is at peak form as vocalist and guitarist. His playing is understated, less-is-more. Clapton adds more firepower. Buy this album. You won't be disappointed.
