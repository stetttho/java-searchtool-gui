 I cannot believe this is the same girl from The Sherbrooke/Hellion Bride books. And why on earth does CC insist on tragedy after abuse after disaster for her heroines, I think I read three CC books in a row where the  heroine miscarries/is abducted/is abused. And Colin? I don't think so. He  leaves her alone with that witch and although he knows she is a virgin, he  sure doesn't care, does he? Sinjun, my darling, you deserved better.
