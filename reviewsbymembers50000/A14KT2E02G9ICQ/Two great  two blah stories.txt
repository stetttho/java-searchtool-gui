 I bought this because I needed a Dara Joy fix, because I am dying for High Intensity to come out already, and I certainly liked her story about  Trystan and Lois Ed. BUT!!! It was Anne Avery's story of Jack and Marlis  and their e-mail romance that really caught my attention.  It is my  favorite of the bunch and since then, I have read some of Ms. Avery's other  books, like her newest, Bartered Bride.  The other two were okay, but  nothing out of the ordinary.
