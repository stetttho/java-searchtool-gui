 This is my favorite of the Bride books. Alexandra is so sweet and  persistent in her love for Douglas, you feel for her when he rejects her at  first. Sinjun is a hoot, and Melissande is your typical air-headed  princess-beauty thing, but she meets her match in Tony. I like the  characters, and I liked the other Bride books as well.
