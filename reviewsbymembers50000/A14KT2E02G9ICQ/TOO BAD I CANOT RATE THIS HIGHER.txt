 In response to a comment below, I hear there are two more In Death books planned so far, so TAKE HEART!!!!  This book is just awesome, now it's  letdown time, because we have to wait months until the next one. Since Nora  writes so fast, ahem, maybe she could whip one out every month or so.  I  certainly wouldn't mind.
