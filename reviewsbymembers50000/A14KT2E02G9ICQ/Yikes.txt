 Obviously this book is not for me.  I like books where the heroine doesn't sleep with half a dozen men, and where lovers don't call their women b*tch  as a precursor to sex.  As far as the sex scenes, I found them boring and  just there for shock value.  Like I said, this book/author is definitely  not for me.
