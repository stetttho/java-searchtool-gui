 Amazing.  The tale of the magnificent and powerful Austras continues in Shattered Glass. You will love each moment of Helen and Stephen's tender courtship, and follow each step in Helen's physical and emotional transformation. The only bad part of the book is when you realize you are out of pages to read.
