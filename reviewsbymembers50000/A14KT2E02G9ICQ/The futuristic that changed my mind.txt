 I have to say, I was never a fan of these stories.  The SciFi always seemed to get in the way of the characters, and strange words and new  creatures always seemed like gimmicks that never quite gelled.  I picked up  this book because I got Dara Joy's books and this always popped up as a  recommendation and boy! Was I glad I did.  Talon and Kari are a wonderful  couple, their struggles as they deal with being on opposite sides of the  law and their dealings with their feelings for each other were wonderful to  read about.  I hope Ms. Kyle writes another futuristic romance soon.
