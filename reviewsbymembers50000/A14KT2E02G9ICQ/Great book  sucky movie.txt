 I looooved Duncan's Bride, and so was happy to read dear Robert's story. In case you feel tempted to hunt down the TV-movie: DON'T! It is nothing  like the book. I seriously hope that if Ms. Howard allows any other of her  books to be made into movies, she gets the movie to actually resemble the  book. The plot was changed, the characters were changed, ugh, the has-been  actors sucked..... you get my drift.  The book, however, ROCKED. Sweet,  innocent Evie is someone who will not accept the scraps of affection Robert  wants to throw at her. She wants it all, and boy, does she get her wish.
