 You can tell this is one of those 80s romances where the heroines were meek and moronic and spineless.  Camille annoyed the heck out of me, she  was wishy-washy and idiotic and at least the book wasn't a hardback because  it left no mark when I threw in against the wall.  Ms. Brown has done MUCH,  MUCH better since this, but I suppose at the time it came out this was the  norm, like some of the old Linda Howard books.
