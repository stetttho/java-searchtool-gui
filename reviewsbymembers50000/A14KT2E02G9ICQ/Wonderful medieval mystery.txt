 This is not the type of book I usually read, but I was glad I picked this up.  Magdalene and Bell, the women, the Brothers, even Baldassare who  appears for only a few pages, are wonderful, very well drawn characters. No  pseudo-medieval speak to distract the reader, but very well researched.  I  love this book and will read Ms. Gellis' other works.
