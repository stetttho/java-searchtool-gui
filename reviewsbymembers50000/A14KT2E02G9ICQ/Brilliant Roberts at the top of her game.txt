 I loved this book.  Nora creates a world of family tensions and finding love when one least expects it. Unlike other authors who write trilogies,  Nora's don't fall in quality.  Born in Ice is wonderful, as is Born in  Shame. As far as the "voice of dissent" below, how convenient  that those who post negative reviews never post their names or e-mails.   It's very easy to throw a stone and hide, isn't it?
