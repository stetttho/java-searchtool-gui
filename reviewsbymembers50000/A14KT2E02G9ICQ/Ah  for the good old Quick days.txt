 After reading some of her recent (very) idiotic books, I went back to the book that got me started on AQ. I swear, it does not compare.  THIS is a wonderful story.  But lately, all her books are THE SAME: Bluestocking/spinster obsessed with unfashionable stuff (metaphysics,  ancient cultures, godawful precious stone, unsolved something or other,  etc) hires man of affairs (I swear, if AQ uses that phrase ONE MORE TIME)  and even though she has kept herself pure, she has sex with him at the  first opportunity. Then, there will be a sex scene in some bizarre setting  (cave, dusty museum, etc) and some run of the mill complication, but, aided  by their nutball relatives/house staff/friends, the mystery is  solved/treasure found/murder solved, etc, and there you have it. In the  godforsaken case Ms. Quick reads this. Please please, stop  assembly-line-ing your books. I have a computer program that does better,  and I want a hero and heroine I have not met before, for god's sakes.
