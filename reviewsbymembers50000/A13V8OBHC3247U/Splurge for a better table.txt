 I bought this for my 6 week old daughter because the price was nice and the table was attractive. I tried to put it together and I could not figure it out! It does not seem very sturdy at all and I would be worried putting her on it. I am returning it back to the store. My sister has the same table and her's is fine. Maybe I just picked up a bad one.
