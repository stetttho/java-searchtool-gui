 This is a great car seat from graco. It is a very cute pattern which would work for a boy or girl. It seems very comfy for my baby, she sleeps in it frequently. My only gripe is that the handle is very loud and sticks sometimes, but maybe it just needs to be broken in. Also fits great in her matching colby stroller. Highly recommend!!
