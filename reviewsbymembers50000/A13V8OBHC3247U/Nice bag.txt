 This bag looks very compact, but it holds a ton! You can carry it many different ways. It is very pretty, husband does not mind carrying. It fits perfectly in the basket under my stroller. Only problem is that the zipper gets caught on the plastic inner liner. Worried about it ripping. So far so good.
