 I got this warmer as a shower gift. It does warm the bottle to the perfect temperature. It has drawbacks, though. I took us 6 minutes to heat up a bottle that we had in the fridge. It also developed some brown crusty looking stuff in the bottom of it, and all the numbers rubbed off the measuring tube. We barely even use it anymore because it it not too convenient when you have a hungry baby waiting for her bottle.
