 I love the snuzzler. I put it in her car seat due to her little head always drooping to one side. Works great! Did not have any trouble with the straps fitting through it. There is no padding in the back of the snuzzler, just the sides which seems to make her feel secure. I would highly recommend this over any other infant support.
