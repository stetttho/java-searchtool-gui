 I got this as a shower gift from my baby registry. I honestly don't trust it. We put it in both of my baby's ears and we got different readings each time. You can't even tell if it is all the way in their ear. I now just put a regular thermometer under her arm and feel more comfortable. It is nice and compact, though.
