  The continuing story of the exploits of Aubery and Maturin.   A mixture of derring-do, and unrequited romance and high seas.  	 I like the story, however I feel that the fact that there is a series of stories perhaps devalues each individual story.   I also would like to be sure that the action parts are based on some reality - the enthusiasts for the series say that it is, and the writing has  a realistic historical flavour; however the 'top-gallants a lee, bring 'er about, nicely lads' stuff could just as easily be gobbledook for all I know.    	As a true son of Erin, I am quite happy with the reversal of usual  stereotype - to have the English partner (Aubery) as a bluff, rash, unreflective type, and the Irish (or Catalan) type as reserved, intellectual, reflective but deadly.    p.s. this one also has requited and unrequited long distance love, perhaps to interest the Signoritas.
