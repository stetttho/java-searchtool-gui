 This is an exceptional book.   I hated the first fifty pages, as it starts in the aftermath of a catastrophe, but is very unclear as to what exactly happened. The narrative is first  person, in the words of teenager Vernon Little and he can be quite tiresome to listen too.   I also felt it was shaping up to be `a poor white kid gets put upon by life', kind of read - which in fact it turns out to be, but in a wonderful, quirky, unpredictable kind of way.    Gradually, you find, through Vernon's narrative, that he is essential a loyal child to his mother, though betrayed by her and almost all the adults with whom he comes in contact.  His sense of confusion, alienation but his fundamental humanity come across in the latter half of the book, once you get your bearings on the viewpoint of the narrative.  I won't give away the story, but realize there is a happy ending and that, like the best books, it takes some time to acclimate. Once you get to know Vernon Little and his world, you will recognize him as a friend, and a classic literary character of our era.  There are two weak points about the book in my opinion, one general one about the media manipulation of a tragedy - a thoroughly modern point, but made rather unrealistic by exaggeration. The media figure represented in the book was so thoroughly manipulative and corrupt as to be one-dimensional.  The other weak point, I think, is the happy ending - it comes from nowhere in the last number of pages, a little too quick for my taste.  Overall, I can't rate the book highly enough.
