 This is an excellent read, combining many aspects of 18th Century British society.  Colley advances the view that the English aristocracy incorporated fellow Protestant from Scotland, Wales and to some extent Ireland in the aftermath of the loss of the  American War.  This re-invention, combined with the expansion of the mercantile class spurred the re-emergence of an renewed Empire.  As the Century turned this Empire viewed itself as morally correct by abolishing slavery, reforming Parliamentary electoral politics and eventually re-incorporating Catholics into the political class.   	Along the way she gives convincing descriptions of the waning of Protestantism as a political force, the emergence of the Hanoverian dynasty and its (successful) efforts to achieve mass popularity in Britain, the status of women in society among other things. All this is achieved with an accessible style. 	I think the books great strengths are its description of the aristocracy, and the  early Hanoverian kings (George I,II and III), it goes into great depth about Protestantism and the growth of trade.  I believe the weaknesses of the book are in its dealings with the post 1800 years - the reign of George IV and William are glanced over, and sometimes contradictorily. The Regency period is described as a period in which public morality became a concern of the ascendancy classes, however, George IV's behaviour would seem to contradict this. Overall an exceptional read, a tremendous summary of the times, very thought provoking and well worth the time spent.
