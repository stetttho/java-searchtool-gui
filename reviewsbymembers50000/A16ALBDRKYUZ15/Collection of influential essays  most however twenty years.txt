 These are essays, which in the main were dissenting from the received wisdom of the 1970s concerning Third World - that population expansion was `out of control' and keeping people in debt, that there existed a vicious cycle of deprivation and so on.          His views on the supremacy of free trade, the counter productive nature of most forms of aid,  and good local governance have become mainstream opinions, however they were not always so.   	As this is a collection of transcripts and speeches, quite forceful language is used, and there is a lack of reference to empirical evidence, which I found quite disappointing - as anecdotal evidence is fine, but examples can also invoke counter examples e.g. if Hong Kong exemplifies the innate progress of motivated, free people in the absence of natural resources, secure boundaries and representative government then what does the economic progress of Mainland China represent? 	His positive essays - Land and People, Population, Honk Kong, Western Aid and the title essay are very thought provoking and convincing.  There is a challenging essay on egalitarianism - that people are born unequal in terms of talents, which is very thought provoking.   However I was unhappy with his critical essays - on  Western Guilt,  the Liberal Death Wish as these had the flavour of an after dinner speech in a particularly reactionary dinner party.  These seemed to be a wide ranging attack without purpose.  It is quite useful to propose that wealth is a result of differential economic activity, but how useful is it to propose that western guilt about slavery is misguided because Arab countries practiced slavery more brutally for longer? 	The book is worth reading for the title essay alone, and the introduction by Amartya Sen is erudite and intriguing.  The key emphasis of the book is on freedom as the basis for development, freeing the individual within society to make progress and to retain the benefits of that progress.
