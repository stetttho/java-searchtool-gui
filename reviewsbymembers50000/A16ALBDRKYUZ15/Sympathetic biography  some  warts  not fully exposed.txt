 I read and liked McCullough's biography of Truman, so when John Adams came out I wanted to read it, even though I knew very little about the 2nd President.  Like Truman, McCullogh;s biography of Adams is very detailed and quite sympathetic. He gives us a good view of the small, energetic, persuasive lawyer from simple New England roots, who  took on an empire. He conveys some of the passion that drove Adams to convince the Continental Congress to take on an Empire, and declare Independance.  He makes it clear that this, not the Presidency, was the achievement of which Adams felt most proud.  Like Truman, Adams felt very isolated and lonely in office and longed for New England throughout. The correspondance between Adams and his wife is a main source for this book, however at key points in his life - particularly during his Presidency - seems to have been too busy to write and at these points the narrative, in my opinion, goes flat. Just before this book I read 'Founding Brothers' by Joseph Ellis.  It gives brief, yet telling, outlines of the main characters in the US war for Independance. Adams in portrayed as a man who in life was quite impetuous and sharp-tongued, who, towards the end of his days, felt slighted by the common perception of his role in the run-up to the Declaration of Independance.  In particular he is portrayed as feeling jealous of the role that was ascribed to Thomas Jefferson - who Ellis portrays in all his complexity. Ellis views Adams vanity and need for vindication by history as the reason for Adams' reconciliation with Jefferson in the last years of their lives.  McCulloghs portrays Adams as a kindly retiree, reaching out a hand of friendship to Jefferson many years after major conflicts between them.  I find Ellis description more convincing.  Overall McCullogh has written an accessible and sympathetic portrait of Adams and his contemporaries, a good primer.  However if you want to dig a little deeper I would recommend Ellis' book.
