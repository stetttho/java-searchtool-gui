 This book was originally written in German, in 1950,  and I approached it apprehensively, assuming it would be ponderous.  However it is quite a straightforward read and lively in its interpretations.  It shows the evolution of British political life, through the lives of Henry Fox, and his son Charles James and of William Pitt, father and son.    The only hint of its Germanic origins are the occasional analogy to Schiller or Bismarck.   	The book is quite favourable to the liberalism of Charles James Fox and opposed to George III's attempts to disband the party system.  In the latter it is clearly at odds with the view (of Linda Colley and others) that after the  defeat in the American war of Independence, that George III reinvented himself and became the non-political, patriotic and popular embodiment of  Britain.    	The book is strong on biography, and shows some of the dissolution which was a feature of political life at the times, Charles James Fox and both Pitts were unable to control their personal spending, Fox was an inveterate gambler and the Younger Pitt is described as being a victim of alcohol.
