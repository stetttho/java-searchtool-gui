 The main character in this novel can literally feel no pain (until a curious incident towards the end of his life).  This inability aids him through his life as he moves from childhood poverty, through various ordeals.  His lack of feeling (and empathy) allows him to become a successful surgeon - he's not too squeamish to experiment - but eventually arrogance gets the better of him.  He joins a competition to inoculate the Russian Czarina of the day, which entails a hazardous trip across 18th Century Europe.  It is the failure of this quest which finally moves him to feel pain, and thereafter he spends a period in a lunatic asylum, event though released he seems a much reduced, more ordinary figure.   I liked the book for its descriptions of 18th Century life.  It gives a feel for the emergence of Scientific method, which is beginning to break away from superstition and faith-based beliefs.  It gives a convincing view of the type of person who would drive this search for scientific knowledge as ruthless and willing to break through social norms.   On the downside the book feels like an vehicle to be used to discuss various social and historical themes and settings.  I did not feel much empathy for the main character (maybe this is intentional), and my main sympathies were for the secondary characters - much of the story is told by way of their descriptions of the action, rather than in direct description.   In general a cerebral exercise, illuminating for those who are perhaps interested in the history of the times.
