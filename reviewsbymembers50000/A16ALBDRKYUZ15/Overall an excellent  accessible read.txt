 I was pleasantly surprised at this novel.  I had been meaning to read it for many years, and everything I had heard about it left me thinking that it was the great American novel and that Gatsby was a Svengali.   I was surprised at how sympathetic (and rather pathetic) Gatsby turns out to be, I was also pleasantly surprised at the accessibility of the story itself.  The writing however is a complete delight, the first person observations work well and the style is completely captivating and believable.  None of the characters are completely sympathetic but nor are they outrageous. 	Overall an excellent, accessible read. Don't be put off by its `classic' reputation.
