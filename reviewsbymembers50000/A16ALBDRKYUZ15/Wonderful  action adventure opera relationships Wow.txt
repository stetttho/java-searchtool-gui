 I don't normally read novels, but the plot outlined intrigued me - its based loosely on a kidnap in Peru a few years ago.   Prachett manages to unusual event of putting opera centre-stage in a kidnap drama, and still manages to  Make the book a compulsive page turner. To flow with the book you have to suspend disbelief - benevolent kidnappers, Art (specifically opera) as the secret soul of a cross section of people, which humanizes an intolerable situation.  Various improbable relationships etc. But the overall affect is entrancing.  The ending, predictable at the outset, seems indefinitely suspended so that by mid way through, the reader yearns for everyone to be either left alone or released to an improved world.  However the predictable, becomes inevitable but the end of the siege is described in removed, almost balletic terms. Wonderful.  Read this book. A few quibbles -  the country is never named, mainly referred to as ` this place' ` this hellhole' etc.  This is too cumbersome, Why not say Peru, or make up a name?  Some of the international characters have names which are  Straight out of the headlines - the Russian character Lebed ( a tough general in the Yeltsin years) , the Vice President is Iglesias (reminiscent of the crooner)  (, the Japanese Watanabe ( equivalent of Smith), which doesn't help with the disbelief suspension.  However an excellent read.
