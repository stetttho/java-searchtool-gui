 I had given up on this series after the last book (HMS Surprise) because I was getting lost in the seafaring terminology and there was a bit much of the love-lorn simpering in the tale.   The Mauritius Command restores my faith in this series.    It's a great tale of derring-do in the Indian Ocean, its based on some actual events and actual ships and overall the tone is very convincing.  The women folk are left back on land, and only intrude to an acceptable level of letter writing etc.  My (paperback) edition contains a valuable afterword by Brian Lavery who describes the actual ships on which the tale is based, and gives a worthwile overview of the seafaring terminology.  I still won't be able to distinguish a fore topsail yard from a quarterdeck, but at least Lavery is reassuring that they are meaningful terms.   	Jack Aubery continues on his lucky career in the British Navy, almost - but not quite - achieving lasting fame and fortune; this being more necessary now that he has a wife, three children and a mother-in-law to support.   For me, this book develops Stephen Maturin more - he is still secretive, reflective, reassuringly Irish and intellectual, however he develops a melancholia which is only temporarily suppressed by his furtive diplomatic activities.  O'Brien moves Maturin one step closer to Sherlock Holmes by hinting at his opiate use during the story
