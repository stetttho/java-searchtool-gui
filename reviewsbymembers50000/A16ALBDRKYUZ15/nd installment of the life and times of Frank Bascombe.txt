 I liked this book, which is written in the first person, despite not liking the main character.   This book is a sequel to `The Sportswriter' which was a breakthrough for Richard Ford. I haven't read the first book yet, but this one takes up with Frank planning a 4th July trip with his son, who lives with his ex-wife and her new husband in another state.  	The book works through a series of thoughts, reminiscences  and rather mundane activities which Frank goes through before and during the weekend. Through his preparations we get a view of Franks life being an " Existence Perid", neither particularly happy nor sad, without a clear purpose.  His relationship with his colleagues and clients - he is now a realtor - is, in my view, the best part of the book. The dialogue with his ex-wife and new girlfriend is extremely good, and the general craft of the book - to sustain a descriptive novel, which details ordinary events, in a monologue - is excellent.  The story takes many different turns, some related, some incidental but somehow never lags.  Strangely, as Frank's major purpose is to spend some time with his son, I felt the son's character and the dialogue between Father and Son, were brittle, hollow,  superficial.  Perhaps this was intentional, but I got no great feeling of any credible relationship between the characters. 	Overall an excellent read.
