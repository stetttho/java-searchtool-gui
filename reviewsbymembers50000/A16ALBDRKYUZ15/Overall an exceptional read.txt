 This is a tense, terse account of  post Apartheid South Africa.  The  main character flees his `first world' life in urban South Africa, and works in a dilapidated and  under-used hospital in a rural area.  This being South Africa the legacy of racist rule is mixed with the present day rich/poor divide and the (white) author confronts politically inspired waste of resources and poor planning.  However the main thrust of the book is the characterisation of the main players, and this  is done supremely well.  The spare style of the book echoes the ultimately futile fate of all the characters, all have something to hide and nothing, ultimately, to strive for.  It is a wonderful read. The book has been criticized as the work of yet  another white author predicting the inevitable descent into chaos of a newly independent black African State.  I believe this is not the objective of the book, there are however extremely bleak views which can be taken about South Africa, its basic poverty and its mounting health crisis and the inevitable inefficiency and corruption of government.  This book offers this bleakness as a backdrop to a clear-eyed tail of human aspirations and disappointments
