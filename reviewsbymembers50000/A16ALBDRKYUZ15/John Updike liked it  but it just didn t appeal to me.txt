 I liked Fryan's play Copenhagen, I thought it intellectually stimulating, courageously able to deal with scientific topics and I loved the unravelling of the layers of meaning. So I was eager to read this novel.  Like many recent novels (Curious incident of the Dog in the Night, Vernon God Little) it is written from the viewpoint of a small boy.    	The setting is Second World War Britain, and while the story is involving I just did not get moved by it.  I was continuously reminded of the stories of Richmal Compton - just William, about the adventures of an eleven year old boys, his friends and their interaction with the adult world.  In Spies there is even an annoying local girl - Compton's book had Violet `Violent' Elizabeth, Frayn has Barbara Berrill.   	Between the Just William flashbacks and the feeling that the style was following a trend, I found it hard to warm to the story.  That being said, the story flows well, the book is quite a quick read, the story is told with style - shifting between first and third person descriptions as the character moves in and out of reminiscences, there are excellent evocations of the memories, smells and atmosphere however the expectations which I had on starting the book were  not realized
