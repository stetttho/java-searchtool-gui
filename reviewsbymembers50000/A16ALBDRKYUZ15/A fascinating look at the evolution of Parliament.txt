  	This book is divided into two - the first part discusses the structure of parliament, its origin and place within 17th Century society.  The second parts gives a narrative of the events of that century, with  parliament playing a central role.     To my mind the first part is the more fascinating - the fact thatparliament saw itself as a rather confused amalgam of law giver, judicial seat and advisor to the King often brought it into conflict with the King and society and yet Parliament - and especially the Commons - had the ability to cope with these contradictions and thrive.   Smith also paints this amalgam in the context of the confusion of the British Constitution - was the King above the three estates (Lords, Clergy, Commons) or part of them (King, Lords, Commons)?.  These ambiguities left enough room for the emergence of various forms of government through the century and enough common ground for their eventual resolution as part of the Restoration compromise.  Through the text Smith gives a lucid explanation of the origins of Private Bills (partly a judicial function) - which were to seem so corrupt in later years, and the power of impeachment and attainder which were to be used to such partisan effect.   If you want a lucid, single volume introduction to British politics in the 17th Century this is the place to start.
