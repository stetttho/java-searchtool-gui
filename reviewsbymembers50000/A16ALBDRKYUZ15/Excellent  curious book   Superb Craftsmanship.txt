 This is the original book about Frank Bascombe, a sportswriter who is not very into sports.  I read the sequel, Independence Day, and liked it, with liking the central character - a major achievement.   In this book Frank has the excuse - for me - of being numb following the loss, some years before, of his son.  The entire book is written in the first person, and, like the sequel, describes a short period of time - the Easter weekend.   The level of detail, the apparent banality of the events and the amount of introspection could make for heavy going, so it is  a tribute to Ford's craft that he can make this story quite readable, indeed intriguing. 	As in Independence Day, Bascombe's world view could be described as `Comfortably Numb', he is content, if not happy, with his broken marriage, being close (physically and emotionally) to his remaining children, and with his current (failing) relationship. He describes his work - sportswriter - as one in which he can indulge without commitment, major expertise or intense effort, which is not what one would associate with the USA.  I have more sympathy for Bascombe in this novel due to his bereavement, but Ford seems to imply that this listless, aimlessness could be a permanent condition, in which case it would seem to me to be a bleak message.  But perhaps the point Ford is trying to make is that there is no message, that he is describing a character adrift, without the energy to make definite choices. 	A very rewarding read.
