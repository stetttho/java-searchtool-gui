  This book is set of short stories translated from German.   I am not sure whether it is the authors gift or this gift in combination with the translation which give these stories their sense of remoteness and in some cases alienation.  In most fiction, the author strives to involve the reader as closely as possible with the character and the narrative, however in these stories, the reader is held at a remove, the characters seem to carry on almost  in suspended animation and at times the stories do not work towards an understandable conclusion.   However for all that, they are magnificent, memorable and thought provoking.   I won't say more, read them
