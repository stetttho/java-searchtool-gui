 I read this because I had not read any Hemingway to date.  I was quite surprised at how modern it was, despite being written eighty years ago.  It is a story of a man fighting for a country not his own, alternatively torn by idealism and selfishness. He becomes involved with a woman, eventually they escape to neutral territory and there's a melodramatic ending.   	In general I thought his descriptions of place - the first scenes are of the countryside disturbed by armies marching through - were compelling.   His descriptions of people are not quite so vivid, although it is possible to imagine the rough and raw nature of army life - boredom, gore and terror- from his dialogue.  I thought his description of the relationship, while initially promising, degenerated into conventional pretty quickly.  The initial courtship seemed to have the right mix of pretence and ambivalence, but later on it seemed to be one dimensional.  	Overall quite a surprising book, however I suspect not his best.
