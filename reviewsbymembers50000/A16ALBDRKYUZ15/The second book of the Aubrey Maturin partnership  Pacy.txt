 I read Master and Commander recently - prompted by the Movie - and  loved it.  This, second, book in the series continues the adventures of Jack Aubrey - a bluff, impetuous Naval commander, and the reserved, cerebral Dr. Maturin. 	This book opens with Aubrey anxiously waiting for promotion to post-Captain and courting young ladies, when he is made bankrupt overnight. Various adventures ensue, which the usual derring-do. This book marks the first time that Maturin is explicitly identified as a spy.  His work aids Aubrey in securing commands, promotion and therefore an understanding with the young lady of his dreams.  Maturin's world view and prospects are more sombre and morose.	 	The book itself contains a huge amount of naval jargon, mainsails, topsails, etc. etc., curiously however it doesn't lose the narrative for me, despite the facts that I have no idea what the terminology means, the pace of the narrative doesn't lessen, and I am quite happy to ` go with the flow'. 	Overall a good read.
