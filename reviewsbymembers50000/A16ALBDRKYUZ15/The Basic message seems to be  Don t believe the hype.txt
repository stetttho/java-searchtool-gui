 This book covers some of the bases in regard to innovation - in particular it mentions the Diffusion of Innovation Theory, propounded by Everett Rogers among others.  He gets a lot of mileage out of failures (such as New Coke and The Smokeless Cigarette) , under the general guise of "what were they thinking", and he clearly describes how foolish ideas can get backing from powerful, influential ideas and how other people then  fall into the Emperor's New Clothes Syndrome.  There are a lot of good references in this book to successes, failures and studies relating to the Dot Com boom.  One curious omission, in my view, is any reference to the work of Geoffrey Moore, whose work in the marketing of innovative technology products is a must-read for anyone trying to define the topic. My basic impression of this book is that it is good on description, adequate  in referring the reader to deeper, more original,  material but very poor on analytical contribution.
