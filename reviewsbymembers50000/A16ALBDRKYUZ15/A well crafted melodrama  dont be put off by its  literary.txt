 I had heard about this book for quite a while, and it was on my list of `must read, someday' books.   Having read it now, I consider it a well crafted melodrama so don't be put of by its `literary' reputation.  The book is divided into four major episodes concerning a certain family and friends before, during and after World War II. There is an air of foreboding in each episode and each chapter seems to detail events which, while appearing normal, seem to be bringing doom closer.  In this, I think, the crafting to the pace of the book draws the reader onwards to find out what happens. The descriptive passages had less power for me than the dialogue, however the story was compelling. 	The main character is an aspiring novelist and this I found to be the aspect I liked least.  I find writers writing about writing to be self referential, boring and bland, and this features more in the book than I think is necessary.  It seemed to me to break, rather than enhance, the flow of the book and to provide very little by way of insight into the thought processes of the characters.  This was the main flaw I thought in an otherwise entertaining read.
