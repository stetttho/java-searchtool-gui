 I find Tony Hillerman so relaxing. His descriptions of the desert this time were not as breath-taking, but they worked. I hear there's a map of sites mentioned in his novels. Some of these descriptions seemed written with the map in mind. Of course, the Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn continuing affairs of the heart are fun. I mentioned to a friend that I had just finished the new Tony Hillerman. "Is Jim Chee still in love with the school teacher?" No. Now it's a fellow (sister?) police officer. The lawyer is definitely out. Then there's always something worth reflecting on - and this time it's on page 134, in a conversation with his uncle. While standing in a street, where a Navaho drunk is lying in the gutter, the two men watch as a white Lincoln Town Car driven by a Navaho glides by. "Which one acts like he has no relatives?" It is followed by a discussion on healing. "To cure them, you must make them believe. You must believe so strongly that they feel it." This reminds me of Parker Palmer, in the introduction to his book on teaching. He says, more or less, that we teach who we are. It seems that Tony Hillerman is saying the same thing about healing.
