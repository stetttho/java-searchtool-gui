 Susan and I were just sitting here checking on the availability of one of our favorite books and we see that this is out of print. Woe, woe!  We only own one copy between us and that's been lent to someone who hasn't returned  it.  This is a book about the love of teaching and its challenges.  It  delights and nourishes all those who teach or want to teach.
