 A visiting friend left this book for us as a gift, and what a blessed gift. I promptly bought 5 copies to give away myself. We have this very human need to hear stories of people. We can slake it with celebrities ~ or with saints. This is a book of heros and heroines spanning the centuries, with a decidedly Catholic bent. It's readable and it's fresh. I don't always agree but I am always challenged. There is a saint for each day; my husband and I have taken to discussing this saint of the day.  Christopher Lasch wrote:  "In a narcissistic, self-pleasing culture, we welcome celebrities, because we lack imagination and courage.Traditional heroes make demands on us, but celebrities make no moral claim on us.  Glittering stars in our culture merely feed our narcissism, our love of self, our addiction to what society finds pleasurable.  But heroes stretch our imaginations, and stand as imperatives, calling, demanding we live a higher, holier life."   This book helps us hear the call of the saints.It's a wonderful antidote to celebrities and at the top of my list for gifts.
