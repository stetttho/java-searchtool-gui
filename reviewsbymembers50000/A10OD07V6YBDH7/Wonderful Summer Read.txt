 Prodigal Summer. I loved it. I acknowledge that it's kind of preachy. This comes, I think, from her writing methods, which, I hear, are to get the idea first, and to imagine the character which can best mouth the idea. All of her characters start as ideas. One can feel it. I also was amazed at the accurate description of menopause and how it mimics pregnancy. When I first skipped a period, I had all the symptoms of pregnancy; I was sure I was. Her descriptions rang true to my own experience.   My husband pointed out how the scenes move visually. Imagine you are hovering like a satellite about that valley and mountain, and the four voices rotate...each scene is physically adjacent to the next, although one doesn't realize that until halfway through. I love the way surnames emerge and one realizes the connections. Even the furniture connects them! (The two chairs put out for the trash; one winds up on the ranger's front porch, the other appears somewhere else as well.)
