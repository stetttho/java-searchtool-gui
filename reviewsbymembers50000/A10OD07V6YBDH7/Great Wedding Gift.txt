 This is my favorite wedding present. My husband and I have been reading a psalm to each other every night for almost 25 years. We've gone through a lot of translations in this way, and this book meets our three criteria:  (1) a lyrical translation (2) a text which fits on the narrow headboard of  the bed and be lifted easily with one hand while lying in bed (3) a  physical text which honors these ancient words of God. (The Abbey Psalter,  for example, meets criteria (1) and (3) but not (2).) I don't mean to be  flippant; this is not only a physically beautiful book, but one suited to  daily use. A rare and wonderful gift.
