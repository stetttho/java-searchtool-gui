 A friend of mine said she no longer reads adult ficition because it's depressing. I want to pass her a copy of A Place of Acceptance. The novel, like the cover, is full of light. While there are plenty of problems - old secrets, new ones, accidents, illness and the simple friction of life -  every character in the novel does some growing. One leaves with the sense that with love, persistence and grace, all things will be well.
