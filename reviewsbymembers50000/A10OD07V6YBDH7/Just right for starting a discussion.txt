 A group of ten women from our parish met recently to discuss this book. We were surprised that it hasn't attracted banner headlines. We found it to be a prophetic book, and disturbing, in the way good prayer is disturbing. It described not only the problem we have with the hierarchical structure of the church at the top but at the bottom, too. The problems that exist between bishops and the pope, exist between priests and their bishop, and most especially, between lay folk and their pastor.  We took his advice to heart - " How does the Pope propose to pursue the search for unity? At the outset, he mentions four things: the centrality of the cross, reflection, prayer and conversion. There must be honest reflection on past differences, the purification of memories, mutual forgiveness, and honest, clear and calm vision of the present divisions."(p.17) This book was a wonderful place to begin a small group discussion in a parish. Some of us thought that Archbishop Quinn might have mentioned the primacy of conscience, and so strengthened his argument, but, as he says, " I have rarely given a talk...without someone pointing out that I failed to speak about something of great concern to them."  We closed our discussion with the promise to pass this book on, to keep this reflection going, out of love for our church.
