 Charming Billy by Alice McDermott I read this book because (a) Alice McDermott's son was attending the same high school as my son and I thought if I ran into her, I would like to have read her book. (b) It won a critical award (The National Book Award? The Pulitizer? I don't remember) and (c) because my husband loved it. My husband is from New York; that must explain it. It was beautifully written; that explains (b). I never ran into her. I was vaguely depressed by the story, but not involved enough to care.
