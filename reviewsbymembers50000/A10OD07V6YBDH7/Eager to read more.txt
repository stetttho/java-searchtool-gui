 I particularly liked the mix of personal encounter, eye-witness description and factual research. We're reading this book in our JustFaith program;it offered rich ground for discussion without handing us conclusions.The local speaker we invited on the topic of international poverty was from Mexico City. He was wondering if this book is available in Spanish. (Anyone know?)
