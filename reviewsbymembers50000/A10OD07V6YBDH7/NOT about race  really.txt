 Caucasia By Danzy Senna Our book club read this in October, 2000. I kept some of my notes here... Carol said she thought this book was about identity, which I found more thoughtful than thinking about it as a book about race. It speaks about parenting, too - the destruction that a kind of self-absorbed parenting can do.  It was initially boring. I kept note of the places I found it especially so -  p.101: "Something happened to her. It broke her." That's ALL the detail we get about that. Never mentioned again. P.156: Does every noun have to have an adjective? But then, I begin to get interested. There was some reflection on class (p.172 " blueblood upbringing spared her shame.") and I wonder what class has to do with shame. A lot, I think. (another note on class from p.308) A little melodramatic in places - p. 357 "The job was mine to do alone." There were historical dates (of fashion) that I thought she got wrong - p.245 - jelly shoes And when did we get hip to Zora Neal Hurston - not in the early 70s, I think...and belly button shirts were not then either. Small things I like:  P.238 p.244 p.315  - the freedom we feel in a culture not our own. p.329 - is white contagious? p.364 - the way we are stone cold to our families and flower before strangers... p.402 - the last paragraph big things I like: p. 343, 381 - that this book is about telling the truth. And this should have been what I said first, before all the nitpicking. There were some great scenes...especially the reunion with her sister. The description of emotional shock was perfectly rendered. And it was a truth full book, for all its flaws.
