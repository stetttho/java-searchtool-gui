 (a review for those who have read S is for Silence) A look at fantasy and lies: that's what this is. Everyone fantasizes about sex or money and then tries to protect both their own and others' fantasies. They've decided who's guilty and they don't care to have that fantasy shaken either. The flashbacks are fantasies as well - or, at least Jake's are (they are certainly incongruent,) which gives us a clue that perhaps Tom's are, too. Did he really receive that faintly Nigerian-smelling letter announcing new wealth? Did that mean he didn't need to risk his wife's displeasure by weaseling his money elsewhere? Or is that his private fantasy to explain the money? It could also be that insurance money is fantasy, the one thing in Violet's life she doesn't share, and the safe deposit box contents are just the  purloined jewelry and a couple of thousand dollars. Kinsey is dogged about the truth that no one really welcomes. The funny thing is: there's not enough evidence to really figure out what the truth is.   There is a Harlequin Romance feel to this story which is kind of depressing in the end. The author's curt little note in the beginning that it's her story and she didn't get it wrong is an alert that she will drive this story line where she will.
