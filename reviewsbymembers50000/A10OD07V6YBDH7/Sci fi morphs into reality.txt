 Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson A few pages into this book, I had to check the date of publication - 1992! Which meant it was imagined no later than 1991 - and much of the technology which was imagined is now a fact. Sadly, harpooning one's way down the LA freeways on skateboards has NOT happened.  Definitely a book for the younger crowd; in fact, it gave me some insights into teenagers. The heroine is a delightful 15 year old girl, but a girl who was imagined by a boy, that's for sure. There were a few scenes which rang delightfully true - when she is taken in by an elderly man's courtliness, for example. I suppose the hero is the main character, but I didn't find him nearly as appealing as the girl.  There are some interesting notes on class - p. 61 - "class is more than income, it has to do with knowing where you stand in a web of social relationships." And a great quote - p. 121"Don't let evil into your operating system." Or p.223 "The social structure of any nation-state is ultimately determined by its security arrangements." p.140 got me to thinking about "personalized attention" and how hungry we are for it. p.147 made me think about what makes real real. It's a question raised by virtual reality, including the virtual classroom.  p. 217 raises the idea of the story as incantation, a self-fulling fiction. Just what does fiction do to us? Unsatisfying : the parent/child relationships (p.226). Silence is the best stategm? I don't think so. This one posits the teenager who is silent as savior of her oh-so-out-of-it mother. Appealing perhaps, to teens, but not helpful.  The analysis of religion is dismissive of faith. Fun as this book was, I won't recommend it to the teens in my life. It's a nam-shub (p.217) for sure.
