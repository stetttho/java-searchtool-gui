 Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability is to a web designer what a rifle is to a soldier.  If you've ever been involved in building a web site that will serve as the virtual world shingle for a corporation or government entity, you should have had this book with you during the project. Get it now if you'll be building such sites in the future.  Web sites don't become popular because someone in a meeting says, "Woudn't it be great if..." They become popular because they are focused and usable. Don't Make Me Think takes you step by step through the process of making a web site focused and usable. Once your web site is focused and usable, you will find that your web site will attract the only thing that justifies pouring your heart and soul into a web site - an audience.  If you build it they will come was a very popular moniker in the 90s. It isn't true. It should be, if you build it right, they will come.  The premise of this book is that if you make people think too hard about finding something on your web site, they'll go away and they won't come back. So if you are interested in having people come to your site and then come back for a second visit, this is the right book. I won't tell you what the author tells you about the logic behind keeping visitors. What I will tell you is that Don't Make Me Think follows its own rules. The book is superbly designed. It's full of practical examples of what works and what doesn't. It answers important questions like are we really asking the right questions? It's good. Buy it if you need help building a web site that will actually keep people interested in the content of said web site.
