 I usually enjoy zombie flicks. This one made me do all the mental work, and I ended up feeling robbed.  The special effects were good, but how many times do I need to see a crowd of shamblers feasting on entrails while the victim writhes and screams? Too much emphasis on gore and too little attention to making the plot work.  That was really where the movie failed. Zombies are supposed to be retarded. That is what makes zombie flicks worth watching. If zombies are intelligent, it means I have to care about them, and I don't want to do that.  Watching the "intelligent" leader zombie in Land of the Dead "figure out" how to fire his weapon was absolutely painful, as were all the scenes where he "taught" other zombies to do things zombies aren't supposed to be able to figure out how to do.  It totally ruined the movie for me that these groups of shuffling, rotting creatures could walk upright properly but somehow managed to randomly figure out how to fire weapons. At the beginning of the movie, the zombies can all be mesmerized by fireworks, but at the end of the movie they have somehow collectively figured out how to ignore fireworks, but they still haven't mastered how to walk without jerking around and flailing like idiots.  Boo. Campy. This is the worst of the Romero films due to a terrible script and unbelievability.  One additional note or irritation about the flat, campy characters in this film - why are Hollywood prostitutes always so unrealistic? I'm sure there are high class call girls out there, but none of them are streetwalkers. If you want to write a streetwalker into your script, she needs to be ugly, used up and pretty dumb. The smart call girls put ads on the Internet and you call them on the phone to set up an appointment. Suspension of disbelief doesn't mean you get to write characters that irritate your audience.
