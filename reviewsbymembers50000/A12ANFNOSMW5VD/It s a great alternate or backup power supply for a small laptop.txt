 Why do I spend time writing reviews of stuff? Because I hate crappy products that waste my time and money. So I try to save other people some grief or point out something I think they might really like when I come across it. This is especially important to me while I'm in Iraq, because if I have to deal with a crappy product here, it's a heck of a lot harder to get the item replaced, repaired, or whatever.  Anyhow, the Kensington power adapter I bought for my laptop is awesome. I originally bought it because I wanted something I could use in my truck back home, and I ended up liking it so much I've been using it as the primary power adapter and carrying it around in the war zone for a few months now.  What's great about it? It works with anything. Any computer at all. It came with a little black bag to carry it around in that has every kind of attachment for any computer that uses a power supply up to 75 watts. I like how small it is and I did like the self-retracting slimline cord a lot. Of course, I broke that part pretty quickly, and I think if you are a little bit rough on stuff, you will break that part too, if you buy one of these. But it hasn't mattered because the rest of the unit is really solid and has taken the beating I've given it with no problem.  Anyhow, the bottom line is this - the adapter comes with everything you need to hook up anywhere, whether you're at home, on the road, in a plane or fighting a war in a foreign country. I've used it several times to recharge a friend's laptop too, and that's pretty awesome. I would buy one of these again in a heartbeat, but if I did, I would want something with more wattage capability, because a lot of the bigger laptops suck more than 75 watts.  The Kensington Retractable Laptop Power Supply would get a Best of Show if it wasn't for that retractable cord minder breaking.
