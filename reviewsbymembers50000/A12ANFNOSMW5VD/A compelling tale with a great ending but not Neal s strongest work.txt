 The Diamond Age was a good read. As with all of Neal Stephenson's work, it was chock full of memorable prose and interesting characters.  An example sentence that struck me:  "Grandfather loved to tell stories of criminals, how they tried to excuse their own crimes by pleading that they were economically disadvantaged or infected with the disease of substance abuse, and how the Lone Eagles - many of whom had overcome poverty or addiction themselves - had dispatched them with firing squads and left them posted around the edge of their territory as NO TRESPASSING signs that even the illiterate could read."  This novel is filled with interesting ideas about nanotech. It's not a novel for children unless they are ready to digest orgy and rape scenes. The idea of phyles and the Victorian and Confucian societies are both highly interesting. Some parts of the novel moved slowly, but the novel's climax was a definite page turner and I thought Neal wrapped up many of the ideas nicely.  As another reviewer pointed out, though, Neal introduces some interesting characters and then they are never heard from again, which left me slightly disappointed.  Overall, a worthy read. Spend a few hours of your life with this book.
