 The Kite Runner is the compelling tale of a coward from Afghanistan who grows up and overcomes his own flaws. It is the tale of two countries, Afghanistan and America. It is the tale of three generations.  I read this book while in Iraq serving as a soldier, and the narratives involving the Taliban and the mentality of rule by terror and intimidation all ring very true and were made that much more poignant by the explosions that sometimes rocked my trailer while I read. The characters in the novel were never far from my own heart.  The Kite Runner flawlessly shows us our modern world, where the past and the future come together, where heaven and hell are only a plane ride away, and where self-discovery is still the most important journey in life.  Buy this book, read it in the quietest place you can find. You won't regret the time you've invested.
