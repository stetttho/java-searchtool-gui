 As a transhumanist, I had high hopes for The ImmortTalist Manifesto. I should have taken the time to read all the Amazon.com reader reviews first (about half the reviews appear fake, which is telling in and of itself). This book is written at a high school level from a perspective of arrogance and self-righteousness. It�s a litany of copy editing mistakes accompanied by immature socialist diabtribe about ending war for all time and building a new world order based on the unrealistic and incomplete �Immortalist� worldview.  You doubt me? Read this:      My childhood friends have all grown old, fat and ugly. I now look more like their son than their classmate or peer. I am still getting carded by bouncers at bars and clubs. I will outlive my enemies and marry their children.  The above is certainly not expressive of the attitude of a human being with the potential to build a political alliance capable of changing the world. The above words are typical of a man who rambles extensively in his manifesto about how we have a social responsibility to offer immortality to the rich and poor alike on a sliding scale but whose web site offers to teach the secrets of immortality for the price of only $1 million. The book most certainly gives no practical advice on extending one�s own life. The �wisdom� contained within is nebulous at best and is outright useless at worst.  �Elixxir� wants to smash poverty, terrorism and war through an Immortalist world government and via socialism. He espouses using the world�s military budgets for longevity research. This is an appealing (to me) if highly unrealistic idea. The first nation to follow this advice would be invaded by its enemies shortly thereafter. Imagine the United States making a declaration tomorrow that all military budget dollars will immediately be used to extend the human lifespan. I wonder who would pick up the pieces after the nation destroyed in civil war and China got through ravaging what remained.  The manifesto itself is poorly copy edited yet the writer claims to be a Yale graduate. The writing style is best described as disjointed. Rather than presenting a concise synopsis of some realistic plan for extended longevity or actual immortality, this book reads like a drug addict�s rambling tale of the first time he did heroin - how great it was to fall in love with the drug. Switch heroin for immortality and you have The ImmorTalist Manifesto. The only difference is that �Elixxir� is in love with immortality and claims to have the secrets to live longer yet manages to ramble for 223 pages without giving any of them away in a concrete or practical fashion.  If you are interested in living longer, this is not the book for you. If you are interested in a personal guru - a fakir who will gladly take your life savings - then by all means, purchase The ImmorTalist Manifesto. You�ll need to have a million dollars to actually have any �secrets� revealed to you. Narcissism, hypocrisy and immortality don�t go together in my worldview, so I will avoid any further publications by anyone calling themself �Elixxir.�  If you�ve been thinking about buying The ImmorTalist Manifesto, please visit Immortalism: The Official Site first, for a taste of the true emptiness that awaits you.  I�d like to live as long as possible assuming I�m healthy and happy. I�d probably committ suicide if a self-inflated narcissicist like �Elixxir� ran the world.
