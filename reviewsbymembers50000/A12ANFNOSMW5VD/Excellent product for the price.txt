 This little shaver is great for those of you who have found a reason why you might want to trim areas you'd never thought of trimming before.  I'm in Baghdad, Iraq and the heat here is absolutely awful. I sit in an air conditioned box all day typing. However, I am constantly having to get up and go talk to people who are outside in a one story parking garage. When you go from 72 degrees to 105 or higher on a constant basis, your body does weird things like sweat profusely followed by freeze drying into a sticky paste. It's fairly disgusting and unhygenic.  Needless to say, I purchased this product to try and minimize the added heat and feeling of stickiness caused by the constant environment change.  The Bodygroom itself does a good job of trimming and gets pretty close the skin without any nicks or tugging. It works fine in both pits and the groin area, which are the two that were mostly bothering me, since I'm not very hairy elsewhere.  If you're looking for a super close shave, this product alone won't do it. It did get close enough to eliminate chafing and itching without any cutting or pinching, so I'm impressed with what it does for the price.  Update: Don't drop it. I dropped my Bodygroom from a height of about 6 feet (hanging on a nail in my hooch) and the plastic casing cracked. It still works with some liberal application of duct tape. Oops!
