 Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life is a positive look at the life of author-philosopher Ayn Rand and was obviously lovingly made by people who have read her novels and were part of her inner circle of friends. No matter where you find yourself in the political spectrum, Ayn Rand's viewpoints have probably touched you, directly or indirectly, through the power of her ideas and her philosophy of Objectivism, which has gained a firm foothold among libertarians and individualists. Objectivists are now fairly easy to find anywhere you go.  This movie is of interest to anyone who has explored one of her novels. If you have an interest in collectivism and how it can shape people, this is also a good movie to watch. Rand's life was full of highs and lows, personal tragedies and lofty achievements. It is worth examining. A Sense of Life is a positive portrait of her as a human being, and glosses over her personal flaws. And that is OK with me, because from my perspective, Ayn's life had a far more positive impact on humanity as a whole than her personal flaws had a negative impact on her inner circle.  Lives ripple outward, and Ayn Rand's body of work has touched millions of people. Whether you agree or disagree with her worldview, A Sense of Life celebrates Rand and her important ideas. If you've made it through Atlas Shrugged or The Fountainhead, and found anything in them that left you spellbound or wide eyed, then this biography will likely hold your interest. A Sense of Life may not be the perfect biographical movie, but it's a good examination of a life worth examining.
