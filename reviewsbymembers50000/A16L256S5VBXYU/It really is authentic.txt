 My dad was Hungarian, and the recipes I have from my grandmother are the same as those in this book. I was thrilled to find a few recipes in the book that I didn't already have. I cooked them and was amazed to find they tasted exactly right, just like grandma used to make - delicious!  The best thing about it is the tips that June Meyer includes about how to make the recipe come out right. It's just like having a real Hungarian home-cooking expert at your elbow, and don't assume you know how to do everything. Highly recommended.
