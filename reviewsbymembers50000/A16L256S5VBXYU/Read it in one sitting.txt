 This is a book to read in one go, in total privacy and quiet and plenty of time. I had all three and am heartily glad. It takes plenty of concentration, immersion even.  Sebald assumes his reader is intelligent with a good memory, he explains things just once and relies on you to understand it and remember it at the right time. What a treat! The long sentences and paragraphs aren't at all difficult, which is extraordinary since they were written in German and translated. Hats off to both writer and translator. They build up as you go to a beautiful rhythm, though I suspected they'd lost something from the original German. Unfortunately the edition I read didn't translate any of the non-German (French, Czech); with my schoolgirl French and non-existent Czech, I hope I didn't miss some important stuff.  The passage about the nature of time was breathtaking, summing up the swirling eddies of the book's structure. The way he layers time upon time, memory upon memory, each echoing and amplifying each other. Sigh. I really felt it couldn't be fiction; was it? Probably. He's just that good a writer. The section on writer's block was bleak, it seemed it came from personal experience, how words and sentences were stripped of their meaning.  I don't think I've read many books with that much impact, so much substance and so much incredible skill. Other writers could take one of the ideas and write a whole book. I will definitely reread it several times as I'm sure much of its subtlety will reveal itself more fully.  I honestly can't think of anything I've read lately that's better.
