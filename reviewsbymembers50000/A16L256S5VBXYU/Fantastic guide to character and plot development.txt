 This should be on every writer's bookshelf. Noah Lukeman writes as though he's an ancient finger-wagging English teacher, so I was surprised to see the bookflap photo and find he's quite young. Overlook the slightly disapproving tone, because the book is a gem. Few books are able to distil so much knowledge into such a short space. Detailed character-building exercises take up a large chunk of the book, because Lukeman firmly believes that character is the plot. He doesn't just work through appearance and background, though he does this in detail. He also covers which characters to put together, major and minor characters, how often they should appear, who they should interact with and when, what they react to, etc. Next he explains the different types of journey your characters can be on and how that affects the story, how to build suspense and develop conflict. Each chapter has suggested exercises to practice what you've learned.  This deserves to be a classic.
