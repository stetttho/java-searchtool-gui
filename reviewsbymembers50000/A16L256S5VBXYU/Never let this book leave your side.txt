 As web designers, we have a responsibility to avoid the worst mistakes. There are so many of them to make, and they are so easy to avoid! By using this well-presented book, you can design a site that avoids the worst bloopers.  Rigid rules  are rarely 100% right, but I don't think that's the intention here. I'm sure Jeff Johnson is aiming for "rules of thumb".  I'm not always sure I agree with his solutions, and they won't always work in every situation. Sometimes the blooper would be the right solution in a particular instance.  But as a starting point everything in this book makes good sense, and the examples show clearly what he's talking about. It's an easy read as well. I highly recommend it.
