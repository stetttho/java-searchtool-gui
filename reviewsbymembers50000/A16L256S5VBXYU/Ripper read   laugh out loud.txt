 For the first time, I felt as though the story of Jesus might have really happened. Yes, there were things in this that almost certainly didn't happen - years in a monastery in Tibet, strange demons that attack you in high mountain eyries - but Jesus and his pal Biff have a real life, dust-in-the-shoes gritty reality that made the story come alive for me. Biff is completely irreverent in his approach, but this story is deeply faithful to the intent of Christianity and the meaning of Jesus. I had to read this is private. The one time I was in a cafe I laughed so loud it was embarrassing!  It's a stroke of genius having Biff come back to life in the present day. The only disappointing thing was the ending. Without giving away what happens to Biff (you know what happens to Jesus, right?) it really doesn't make sense to me. I just don't believe he would have given up so easily.  It's a small niggle though. Read it. You won't be sorry.
