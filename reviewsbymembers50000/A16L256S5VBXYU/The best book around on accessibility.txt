 This book beats the others I've seen hands down. Not only does it explain exactly what the problems are; it also tells you how to go about fixing them, in detail, including code solutions in some places. Where there aren't solutions it presents very useful workarounds. The W3C guidelines only take you so far. This book gets you to the next level, and helps you start thinking the right way so you can solve new problems that come up in a similar fashion. Now, if someone would only write a book on making web sites *usable* for people with disabilities (not just accessible), we'd be laughing.
