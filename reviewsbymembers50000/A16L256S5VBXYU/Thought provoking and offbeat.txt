 Some parts of this book were riveting and I found myself convinced about several of their main ideas, relating to the astronomical uses of the ancient henge formations, the flood/comet theories, early use of writing and even the link between the ancient Jews and the Celts.  The Masonic material was far less convincing, and I noticed when this topic came up the academic footnotes tended to try up - whether or not that's important depends on your point of view on academic rigour. There are some breathtaking assertions simply stated without any attempt at substantiation or even explanation. Despite this serious flaw, the book as a whole was fascinating and gave me a great new insight into prehistoric times. I enjoyed the deeper understanding it gave me into the structures like Stonehenge.  Definitely worth a read.
