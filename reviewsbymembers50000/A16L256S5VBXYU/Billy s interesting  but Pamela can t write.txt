 I love Billy Connolly, as so many people do. He's funny, irreverent, with an air of both danger and vulnerability. I used to like Pamela back when she was a comedienne,  and as a psychologist, I'm sure she's terrific.  But please, stick to your day job, Pamela!  As a writer, she's dull. Sentences plod by:  "Bill was very happy."  "Billy still struggled with his academic work, but the atmosphere at St Gerards' was much more supportive..."  "The idea of doing the unexpected always had great appeal for Billy." You get the idea. I can sense she loves Billy, but she can't tell a story for peanuts. The book only occasionally has the flavour of Billy Connolly, and I missed him. The real Billy was just out of the frame, his head peeking around the corner, ready to tell the tale in his own inimitable style, but Pamela was in front, blocking the way, saying dolefully "Oh, poor Billy." Having said that, it was an interesting story. Billy's tenement childhood has had a huge impact on his life, and there are plenty of anecdotes. Just don't expect it to be all that entertaining.
