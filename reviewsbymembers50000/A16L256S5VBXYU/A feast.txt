 Whether or not you saw the movie, this is a beautiful recording. The playing is delicate, subtle and refined. The choice of repertoire is delightful. Just one small flaw. Jordi Savall, like most performers, uses breathing to come into the first note of a phrase. Unfortunately, his breathing is audible and quite distracting on some tracks. I'm unsure whether this is due to him overbreathing or bad microphone placement/post-production technique, but either way it gets to me. It's not enough to stop me listening though, because it really is superb playing.
