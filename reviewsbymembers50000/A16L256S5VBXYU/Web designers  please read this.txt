 If everyone designing a site read and implemented the advice in this book using the web would be an utterly different experience. Beautifully organised and cross referenced, clearly written without in any way being patronising, this is a useful book for anyone designing an interfaced. People already working in interface design can learn a thing or two as well. A must read.
