 By the end of this book, I had totally fallen in love with Lou Arrendale, the autistic hero of this magnificent work. As a high-functioning autistic man, he has a job at a pharmaceutical company. At first it seems that it's merely a sheltered workshop-type job, but we gradually discover is extremely skilled and specialised.  Similarly, as the book develops we find out that Lou is a thoughtful, kind and interesting person with a strong personality. He works hard at fitting in to "normal" society by remembering the right things to say and do.  Of course we all do that, but most of us remember more easily and the actions come automatically, whereas Lou has to approach every social situation as though it were a maths problem.  Lou's dilemma revolves around whether or not he should accept his company's offer of an experimental drug that they say will make him "normal".  Will he still be himself? Will he still love Marjory, the woman he fences with? As an autistic man, she'll probably never love him. As a normal man, will he still care for her?   A subplot that concerns someone stalking Lou is far less satisfactory than the main plot, and is less interesting than the key ideas, but it does add a certain amount of suspense.  The most satisfying thing about this novel is the characterisation. I felt I got to know not only Lou but all the major and even some of the minor characters. I learned a great deal about what it might be like to see the world from the point of view of an autistic person, and what it's like to be so different from everyone else. This book is rich, powerful and affecting. Strongly recommended.
