 This recording is my favourite blues CD ever. Buddy's voice is smooth, full of emotion and gutsy. The backing is rich and funky. It's personal, cut from the heart. I imagine it's like having him at your kitchen table and pulling out his guitar...there's not much in the way of production overlaying the acoustic sound. If you like blues this should form part of your essential collection.
