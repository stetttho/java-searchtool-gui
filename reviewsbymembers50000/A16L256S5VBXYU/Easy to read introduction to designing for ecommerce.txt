 What a pleasure to find a book on this subject that's easy to read. Andrew Chak puts forward each principle clearly, with illustrations, then at the end pulls it all together in a demonstration of how it works in the context of one example. He divides users of ecommerce sites into browsers, evaluators, transactors and customers, and shows you how to satisfy each one. He links his ideas to persuasion techniques put forward by Robert Cialdini in "Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion".  He explains that you can use six key elements of influence to change the behaviour of web site visitors: - scarcity - commitment and consistency - reciprocity - social proof - authority - liking. While this book doesn't go into any great depth or subtlety, it is an excellent introduction to designing for commercial web sites. It requuires no background as an interface designer, usability expert, graphic designer, marketer or programmer, but would be helpful for all of these disciplines.
