 Noah Lukeman writes as though he's 100 years old, so finding out he's actually quite young gave me a shock. The tone in this book reminds me of a finger-wagging, stern English teacher. On the other hand, if you read each chapter carefully and do exactly as he says, your writing will definitely get better. No question. The small flaws that clutter the first few pages can ruin a book over its length. Usually they point to someone who isn't good enough at their craft, hence the name of the book. Removing them will do your writing a lot of good, however finicky they may seem at first. Experienced writers will gain little from reading this, though. Instead, I'd recommend Noah Lukeman's second book, The Plot Thickens.
