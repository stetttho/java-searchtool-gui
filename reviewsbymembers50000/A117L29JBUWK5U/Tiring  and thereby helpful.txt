 This book has been immensely helpful for me and my understanding of why I have always had so much trouble with sleep. Dr. Jacobs sets the record straight on a number of sleep myths but can be repetitive when he is trying to make a point. For example, he drones on for 16 pages about how sleeping pills will do more harm than good. This may be an effort to extend the length of this book.  Instead of providing us with a 200 page verbose browbeating the author would have better served us with a concise text that could have easily been less than 100 pages. And also, when he is trying to prove a point, Dr. Jacobs will cite some vague statistic. When trying to prove the effectiveness of his "Relaxation Response," or "RR" for short, the author says, "Dozens of scientific studies have proven that the RR is an effective treatment for insomnia," and that is it. If he's not going to be specific, why bother mentioning it at all.  As for the "6-week solution" this book provides, it seems to have been added as an afterthought. The 6 week program consists of keeping a sleep diary for 6 weeks. That's it. The point, of course, is to try to find a connection between what you did to help yourself sleep and how much you slept, but don't buy this book looking for a miracle 6 week cure.  In the end I still recommend this book to anyone with sleep trouble. There are some incredibly useful things in this book that make trudging through it worthwhile.
