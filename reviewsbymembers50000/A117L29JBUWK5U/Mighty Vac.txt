 After a year of use, this vacuum has proven itself to me again and again. It's very powerful for its size and it's great for cleaning corners. The scorpion is also great for cleaning the car, where a powerful vacuum is needed to get dirt out of all the crevices. The tip of the vacuum is only about a square inch, and the only attachment that increases that area is the upholstery brush, so it has limited application. It may get tedious cleaning, say, the steps or a large room, but for any small room, tight corner or vehicle it does the trick.
