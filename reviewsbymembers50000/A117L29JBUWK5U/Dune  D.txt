 Emperor picks up where Dune 2000 left off, and the planet Arrakis is without rule. The three houses are fighting for control of the spice under the Guild's watchful eye, but are the Guild really what they seem? After you have chosen a house you will be greeted by your leader. The leader of House Atreides is the Duke Achilles, played by Michael Dorn (Worf), and you may recognize the leader of House Harkonnen as Seinfeld's FDR. Near the beginning and end of the game there will be lots of cutscenes between missions filling you in on what's happening, but for the bulk of the game you're pretty much on your own, battle after battle. You will also have the option of forming alliances with subhouses, and this will help greatly in the long run. The game itself is well designed, it is the first 3D game of its kind, before Warcraft III. The closer you get to an enemy homebase the more their portion of Arrakis resembles their homeworld. The game itself is huge, and takes a relatively fast system to run smoothly on. My system is a 2.0 gHz and it runs fine until the really big missions at the end, when the processor seems to be overloaded keeping track of so many bad guys. All in all, a great addition to Westwood's Dune series. And, if you're computer isn't fast enough, try the game's predecessor, Dune 2000.
