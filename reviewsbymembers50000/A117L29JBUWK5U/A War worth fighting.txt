 Blizzard decided to put a spin on Strategy style gaming by adding persistent characters, as in a Role-playing game. You can still play customized battles against computer enemies or your friends, or with your friends against the computer--pure strategy game. But in campaign mode, you have a Hero that must survive each scene, so it's a little of both worlds. You get a new hero each Act, so your hero still isn't as important as if it were a true RPG. It takes some adjustment, but it's worth it. This game has character, and that sets it apart from other strategy, and even some role-playing games. Units are more than just fodder and attack-bots, they have personality. The dwarven gyrocopters could be straight out of the Adventures of Baron Munchausen! And it actually feels evil to play the undead. Single player mode can be a bit trying with some tedious objectives that don't make sense. Why again do I need to find exactly 100 zombies before the bad-guy does? What I love about Warcraft 3 though, is that it isn't about building the biggest force, since there is a practical limit to how large your army can be. It's about building a stronger force, and a powerful hero is crucial. Strategy takes more planning, which is important to me in this style of gaming. This is sure to be a classic, definately worth getting.
