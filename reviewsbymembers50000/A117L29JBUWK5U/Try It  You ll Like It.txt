 I haven't been good about keeping up with the latest trends in portable electronics over the years, but my Sony Discman (manufactured 1993) is finally starting to die on me so I decided to see what this iPod craze is all about and get my feet wet with Apple's most introductory model: the iPod Shuffle 512mb. I must say, I am an instant convert.  Every aspect of the design of this player displays the seamlessness and perfection that can only result from thousands of hours of product research. It is a small, unassuming piece of plastic that essentially has controls for play, skip, volume and manages to play 10 times as many songs as my old 2-pound Sony, which will be sorely missed by the way. My earbud headphones come in a plastic case that takes up twice as much space as the actual player. And, of course, the most important part: the sound quality is incredible. I am just floored by how great the music sounds. The true test of time will be if this thing is with me as long as the Sony (probably not since it uses an irreplaceable rechargeable battery).  Don't waste your time with any other brand of MP3 player. Apple has cornered the market by staying ahead of the pack in terms of storage capacity, innovative design and reasonable pricing. You just can't mess with perfection.
