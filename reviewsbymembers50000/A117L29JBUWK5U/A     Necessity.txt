 Let's face it, if you're a fan, you've probably already ordered the video and decided to read the reviews as an afterthought. It's full of the unexpected, and since I haven't seen a 311 show in 3 years, it gave me a much needed 311 fix.  It's 2 hours long, and there's at least a few scenes that could have been left out, but that's what DVD is for. The Milk Challenge: 2 Dozen guys downing a gallon of milk each as fast as possible. I didn't find this entertaining but maybe you will. The band goes to Japan, and watching a Japanese fan that doesn't speak English sing "Come Original" is just amazing. The band describes them as politely obsessed. There's also footage from the old days in Omaha -- Good stuff.  Shaq is airlifted in to play a song live with the band. While he may not be the most talented artist, he is still fun to watch. And yes, he crowd surfs. Lots of Videos and Live footage, and some great behind-the-scenes. I had to get this on VHS, but I highly recommend the DVD so you can skip the milk challenge.
