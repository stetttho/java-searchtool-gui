 Tenacious D has super-power. What kind of power, you ask? Well how about the power of flight? That do anything for ya?  Tenacious D are innovators. Check out the "One Note Song" if you don't believe. Anybody could have written it? Well guess who did, baby. The D. For some solid rocking, there is nothing better than "Explosivo." "Rock your socks off" was great acoustically, and, of course, rocks even more now. Rocking is very important to the D. If they didn't feel they could rock you, they wouldn't be wasting your time. And give me back my schnitzel. Karate chop!
