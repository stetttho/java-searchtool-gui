 There's little to ask for when it comes to a gadget like this. It should work, and it shouldn't be confusing. This little card  reader fits both categories. It takes up very little space. I  just plug it into the USB port when I need it, XP always recognizes it right away and it always works, and when I'm done it goes back in the drawer. I've used it for several types of SmartMedia cards without a hitch. Having been through many  soggy peripherals over the years I appreciate it all the more when I come across something that works this well.
