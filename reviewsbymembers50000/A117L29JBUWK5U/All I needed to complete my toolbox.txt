 For the everyday handyman, this set is all you're likely to need when it comes to torx screws. I couldn't imagine coming across anything bigger or smaller than the 4 sizes included here while fixing things around the house. They're good to have around so I won't have to spend time digging out, and in the process butchering any more torx screws in the future.
