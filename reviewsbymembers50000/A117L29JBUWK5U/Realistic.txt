 Thunderstorm in the Wilderness is a great relaxation CD, since it's really more wilderness than it is thunderstorm. The sounds, which range from running water/rain to many animals, are all very soothing as the storm rolls in. The storm on this album isn't very fearsome as far as storms go, so between loons, frogs, owls and other birds the sounds of nature take center stage for most of the album. This CD consists of one long track, about 51 minutes, which is mixed evenly enough that there aren't times where you'll be jolted by sudden changes in volume.
