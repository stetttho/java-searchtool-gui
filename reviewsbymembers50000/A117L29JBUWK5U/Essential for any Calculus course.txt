 In Calculus I, I was taught using computer programs how to solve Calculus problems but never actually learned Calculus. This put me in a tough spot when I had to start Calculus II and didn't know what I was doing. In this course we weren't allowed to use calculators and everything I learned in Calculus I became useless. Fortunately, I came across this book and I was able to teach myself Calculus in a matter of days. I also tried several other Calculus supplements and the only one I can recommend is "How To Ace Calculus" and its sequel for anyone taking Calc II & III. Whether you're dumping a fortune into an education on brushing up on some old math this book is the only supplement you need.
