 This is the kind of game that doesn't go out of style even as new technology flows in. Sure, it may not have the graphics and A.I. of newer games, but it has a lasting appeal. I've been playing one version of this game or another for 7 or 8 years, and the game itself has changed very little. This version adds new weaponry, more complex fighting, and a more balanced system than the previous Dunes. It also adds some great video clips. Between each mission you are briefed by your Mentat (one of 3, depending on which house you choose at the outset), and the acting is surprisingly good for a video game. John Rhys-Davies plays the Atriedes Mentat. The Mentats for House Harkonnen and House Ordos live up to their infamy as being "evil" and "insidious," respectively. The game is quite challenging, and the interface is easy to understand. However, units aren't as intelligent as they could be. For example, en route from point A to be B, a pack of tanks will go out of their way to run into a dead end, point C, where an enemy rocket turret is waiting. They will then turn around and continue to point B while being shot at. You have to keep your eye on them. This is a very stable game that will provide many hours of play. It's a different experience for each of the 3 houses, so you may want to go back and play it again. Emperor: Battle for Dune picks up where this game leaves off, so I highly recommend this game to play before Emperor.
