 This little modem replaced our Motorola SB4100. It's better looking and takes up less space, at about the size of a portable CD player. This model uses new technology (A-TDMA & S-CDMA) that triples the upstream capacity to 30Mbps. It is also DOCSIS 1.1 & 1.0 compatible and will work with older technology. I've been using this modem with Adelphia PowerLink with great results. And, if for no other reason, it's worth getting to save the five dollar monthly rental fee. Pays for itself really.
