 Great nature albums are so acoustically balanced that they don't need music, and this is one of those albums. It's not busy with the sounds of other animals, or of anything else for that matter, just the sound of the surf. The beach where this was recorded must have had a very gentle ocean, as the waves don't seem to crash as much as they roll. Sometimes the sound of trickling water can be heard, as the wave slowly washes away. There are no sudden changes in volume or dynamics throughout the album making it perfect to put on repeat and fall asleep to.
