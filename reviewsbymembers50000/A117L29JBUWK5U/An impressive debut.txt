 I originally didn't give Hoobastank a chance, until I heard them in concert opening for Incubus. They put on a hell of a show and I bought the CD, which turns out to be almost as good. The album has some really great songs, and some decent songs. Things sort of lose momentum about halfway through, but the album is short, so you can listen to the first few songs again, which are worth a second listen anyway. This is energy-driven music, and best listened to with the Bass turned up. The vocals are melodic, and the contrast is good against the rest of the band. Sometimes, the lyrics become a little too Woe-is-me, like the world is working against poor Hoobastank. The pace of the music more than makes up for this fallback though. Overall, it is definately a disc worth having.
