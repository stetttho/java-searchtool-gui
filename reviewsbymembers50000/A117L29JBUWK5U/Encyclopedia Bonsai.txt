 The first one hundred or so pages of this book are devoted to the art of Bonsai before it goes into description of the different types of Bonsai. For each listing there is a photo of the tree in Bonsai form, as well as four icons. The icons tell whether or not this is an outdoor bonsai, how much water it needs, how much sun it can get, and how hard it is too grow. The actual description under each listing is divided into five parts: a brief description, repotting information, pruning and wiring information, feeding (fertilizing) information, and additional notes. Ultimately, the descriptions could be more detailed, but provide all of the necessary information. There are many species covered, but the list is by no means all-inclusive. Coast Redwood, Baobab and Cotoneaster are conspicuously missing from this text.
