 Without a doubt Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers was the most exciting band I've heard in a live performance.  His week long gigs at the Keystone Korner in San Francisco were legendary.  Every one of his many groups were  outstanding though, propelling many of his "youngsters" into  careers of their own.  The group on this CD was one of the best. There  are many things that make this CD a real joy.  From the four original tunes  by Benny Golson and the title track by Bobby Timmons to the solid muscular  drumming of Blakey himself.  For me though there is one thing that  dominates this date----Lee Morgan.  Lee  Morgan absolutely rules.   Trumpeter Woody Shaw was once asked one of those interview questions, 'What  was your biggest influence?'  Without skipping a beat he said,  'The solo  Lee Morgan takes on "Moanin".  Amen.   From the very first  press roll off Blakey's snare  Morgan is launched.  Bolting out of the gate  this young artist is barely containable. The urgency of Art's drumming and  the rest of the team compels this dynamic trumpeter to dig deep, creating  flurry after flurry of spectacular rhythmic gymnastics, artfully blending  them with melodic ideas that just burst out.  His harmonic ideas on this  piece too are so sweet. Morgan pulls out all the stops, at times employing  his signature half valve technique, double tonguing, triple tonguing,  slurring, sliding, and just plain carving up the beat.  The elegant  construction of this gem of a solo has you sitting on the edge of your seat  in anticipation and at times in disbelief.  And what a tone!  Smooth,  round, big. Lee's solo on the alternate track is a nice addition and  would have made a decent first cut if for some highly unfortunate reason  his masterpiece was never recorded. The rest of this CD is excellent too by  the way.  But oh man,  Lee Morgan!
