 I love this music!   This CD has everything---mood, attitude, fire, swing.  This is one of Mingus'  few large works, and what a gas it is!  The way the soloists are completely integrated with the ensemble is pure genius.  Elevator music this is not.  Mingus demanded artistry from his  collaberators and so this music is demanding of the listener, as it should  be.  Like his other great album "Black Saint and the Sinner Lady"  I never get tired of hearing this one. I always hear something new each  playing.  Emotional, engaging, soulful.  I love this music!
