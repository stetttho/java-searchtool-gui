 This is one wild session.  Recorded live in the studio (I'm guessing mid sixties) after the band had been on the road. A small coterie of Ellington nuts just happened to show up to hear one of Duke's most creative performances. Guest artists include Dizzy Gillespie, Jimmy Rushing, Ray Nance, Clark Terry along with regulars Cat Anderson, Johnny Hodges, etc. and nine, count them nine percussionists! Vibraphonists, xylophonists, marimbaists and a glockenspiel. The first side of this album is played as a suite each tune blending with the next. Underrated clarinetist Jimmy Hamilton wails on  "Red Shoes" adding that great personal touch Duke's groups are known for. The sax section lays down a groove for "Butter" Jackson's and Ray Nance's raw plunger solos, a style rarely used these days.  The finale to the suite is called "Ready, Go!"  and features the indefatigable Paul Gonsalves in one of the stellar performances of his career. Dizzy delivers a fine muted then open solo on "Upper Manhattan Medical Group",  and Johnny Hodges takes on "All Of Me" next and nails it beautifully.  The most avant garde selection follows. "Tymperturbably Blue" features (what else) nine tympani with a commanding ensemble puntuating this furtive and dark melody with occasional stabs from the screaming trumpet section. Pianist Jimmy Jones plays an adroit intro to "Hello Little Girl" a blues for which Jimmy Rushing is well suited.  Dizzy plays on this and drummer Sam Woodyard propels Rushing with well placed bass drum "bombs". This CD has a lot to offer the "intellectual" jazz listener, but if hearing this session doesn't want to make you get up and dance around the living room I recomend therapy.  A desert island pick for sure.
