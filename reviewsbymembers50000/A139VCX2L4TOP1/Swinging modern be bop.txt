 Benny Golson known mostly now for Hollywood scores and studio work was no slouch as far as playing chops went back in 1957. This CD has several original compositions including an often recorded "Whisper Not".  The opener, written by Ray Bryant, "Something In B Flat" is a cooker described by Golson..."[as] a type of melody that an instrumentalist might devise while ad-libbing..." Nice solo by Art Farmer. Golson's "Step Lightly" has that feeling of walking on eggshells.  A real moody tune. The melody and ensemble work on "Just By Myself" is very nice.  This tune is typical of tunes on this CD...an interesting and well thought out composition.  Golson's groups do not slack off and rely on "jazz formula" ie: play the head, take solos, trade fours, yada yada. His music holds your interest. Nice writing. The album is essentially two groups: The Benny Golson Quintet (BG, Art Farmer, Wynton Kelly, Paul Chambers, and Chas Persip) and the quintet plus Gigi Gryce, Sahib Shihab, James Cleveland and Julius Watkins on French horn. Benny plays nice and Websterish on the ballad "You're Mine You". There's some Lucky Thompson in his playing too. Chas Persip gives the Gigi Gryce tune "Capri" that big band feel with solid drumming. One of the best Art farmer solos is heard here. "Benny Golson's New York Scene" was recorded in 1957 for the Contemporary label.  They produced so many gems its hard not to get a winner like this one certainly is.
