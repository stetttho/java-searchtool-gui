 Vince Guaraldi was one of the few very talented jazz musicians who could span the divide between so-called pop and serious jazz. I think when a  musician can touch the neophyte and the afficianado alike the music is  something special. "A Boy Named Charlie Brown" is one of those  very hip jazz albums that fortunately found its way to the mass market's  ears. The swinging good feeling of the tune "Linus and Lucy" is  so infectious you can't help but smile. No jazz missionary should leave  home without this CD!
