 This is a thoroughly enjoyable CD, pairing the crem de la crem of the jazz piano world.  Most people rate Oscar Peterson as one of the most  swingingest melodists of the later part of the twentieth century but I  think his nomination as best percussionist should be considered after  hearing this CD. Benny Green is the most complete and interesting pianist  since Bill Evans.  I've never been disappointed by his playing whether in  concert or in the studio.  When you listen to Oscar and Benny trade fours  on "The More I See You" or "Limehouse Blues" and  juxtapose their playing you can obtain a clearer glimpse into each artist's  style. A TEN on the groove-o-meter!
