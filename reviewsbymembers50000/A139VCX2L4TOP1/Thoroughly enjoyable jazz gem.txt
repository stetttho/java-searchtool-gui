 The Oscar Peterson Trio never sounded so good.  What a beautiful blending of melody and rhythm this group has.  An atomic clock could be set with what Oscar, Ray and Herb do.  The addition of Stan Getz's melodic ideas  makes this CD a true joy.  One gets the impression from how Oscar sometimes  starts his solos by quoting the previous soloist that the guy can play  almost anything that happens to enter his head.
