 This book IS NOT ABOUT OGOPOGO, the mystery creature of Canada's Lake Okanagan. The creature does not even make an appearance in this story. It is an okay murder mystery, but based upon the way it is packaged I was sorely disappointed. Also, the author fills the second half of the book with "facts" about Ogopogo and the creature candidates that may actually exist within Okanagan and other lakes throughout Canada. Almost all his facts are in serious error.
