 There is a new phenomenon going on among writers of cryptoficiton-- that which deals with the subject of unknown animals. No longer are writers subjecting us to the "monsters on the loose" killing innocent victims who haplessly encroach upon their secret domains. No longer are we being made to endure the "whimsical" tales of the mis-understood monster and its lonely outcast human friend. D.L. Tanner is one of this new breed of author who has taken the legend of the Thunderbird and painted for us a vivid and believable portrait of real animals that have continued to exist beyond the point of their supposed extinction in the fossil record. He has tailored his story with very human, very sympathetic human beings who face all forms of danger to be rewarded not only with the discovery of the legendary creatures in the flesh, but also with the discovery of a relic population of long-thought extinct peoples (I will not risk spoiling the adventure for you, but trust me, it is well worth reading.) To sum it up, you will believe the Thunderbirds are real. You will feel as though you are as much a part of this novel as the characters who take you there.
