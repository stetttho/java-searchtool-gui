 The author informed me that this book is targeted at teenagers. I must say that is not at all the case. Anybody of any age who enjoys an extremely well-written, well-paced, very well-researched adventure is going to like this book. It's not just a tale of survival, but an exciting thriller with a very menacing creature that is not supposed to exist-- but does! I understand a sequel is soon to follow. I am waiting for it to hit the stands!
