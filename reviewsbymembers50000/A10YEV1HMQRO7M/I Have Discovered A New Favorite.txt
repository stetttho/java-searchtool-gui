 I am usually extremely picky about the fiction I read, as I am often disappointed by derivative works that just lack any kind of emotional bite.  Not true here. I came across this series by chance and it looked interesting, so I purchased this, the first in the series. Two days later I finished it and immediately ordered the rest. This is great stuff! The characters are highly believable (and likeable). Mr. Rucka does not pander to petty preaching (as the plot revolves around a controversial issue), but rather paints a vivid and disturbing picture of the often brutal reality that surrounds his topic. This is one of my favorite books and I can't wait to read more from this author!
