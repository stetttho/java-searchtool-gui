 If you are a follower of cryptozoology and a serious researcher on that subject, then this is a book that will not disappoint. It is as close to a total compendium as something of this nature could be. It is literally a must have book that compliments the works of Roy Mackal, Bernard Heuvelmans, Loren Coleman, John Green, Karl Shuker, et al. The drawbacks-- mainly the price. It is clearly prohibitive to many who might otherwise "clear the shelves" to have this book (or books since it is two volumes).  Hopefully the price will come down and this wonderful book will become more widely available to interested parties.
