 As a researcher deeply involved in natural history, as well as a lover of fossils, I have found this book to be the most comprehensive work on the subject of fossil shark teeth. The author has done what so few guides and record books do-- he covers all the available data on his subjects. This includes both common and scientific names that are no longer considered accurate. But by doing so Joe Cocke provides us with the full spectrum on this topic. I only wish other authors would do the same.
