 As a writer who specializes in novels about prehistoric life forms continuing to exist into the present, this book is an invaluable reference. For anybody interested in prehistoric life, this beautiful book presents artistic and extremely life-like images of the extinct fauna that came to populate the planet following the dinosaurs. So much so, that you will believe you are seeing them in the flesh. I was especially pleased by the terror birds and the evolution of the prehistoric whales.
