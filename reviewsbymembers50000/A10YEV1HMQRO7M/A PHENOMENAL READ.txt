 This is by far the best book I have ever read concerning the UFO enigma. I suppose it takes a certain amount of willingness to believe the statements being made in this book, but having read at least forty other books on this anomaly that cover various factions of the UFO subject, I find the evidence compelling, to say the least. This was the first book that gave satisfactory clarification to much of the muddied, often mis-leading material from other expose's on the subject. The only thing I really question is, if these aliens are so altruistic by wanting to assist humankind in solving our self-destructive ways, then why have they continued (for at least fifty years, probably more) to allow people of highly questionable moral integrity to be the keepers of their secrets, so often at the cost of innocent lives? A great, great book.
