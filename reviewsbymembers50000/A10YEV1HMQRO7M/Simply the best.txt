 There's really not much I can add to the previous reviews which state quite nicely what this book is about. However, I have to mention that this is the first book I have come across (at least for the general reading public)that goes into such depth on the evolution of whales. Nowhere else have I been able to find the kind of in-depth information which Carl Zimmer has put in this great book. He is one of my favorite writers and I look forward to anything he writes in the future.
