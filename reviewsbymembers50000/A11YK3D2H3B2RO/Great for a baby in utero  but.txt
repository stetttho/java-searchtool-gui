 Not too great for a toddler!!! When I first ordered this book, I thought it was the original one, not one that was to be read in utero. I was also suprised at how tiny the book was. I got this book AFTER my daughter was born, so I never actually got the chance to read it to her while she was still in the womb. I recently started to read this book to my daughter a few months ago, she was a little over 1 year. She dosen't seem to enjoy it very much and I think the book is way too long to hold her interest. I also think some of the language and rhyming is a little hard for her to grasp. My recommendation is that if you want to purchase this book, do it while your baby is in utero and read it to him/her until the birth. After the birth, get the original version.
