 My husband and I gave this to her at Christmas. She really seems to like it and will play with it for a good amount of time. She loves to put the ice cubes in the shape sorter and press the button. She likes to put the pans on the stove and hear them sizzle or boil. My only complaint is that sometimes she seems to get her finger stuck on the door to the microwave. Otherwise, this is a great kitchen for the littlest tike in your family!!
