 That draws you closer to God. The intensity and passion with which he sings will touch your heart. My favorite song is "Your Love Broke Through". I can barely listen to this song without having tears well up in my eyes. It is so moving and he sings it right from his heart. Expect to be changed as a result of listening to these cd's. You can't help but want to worship God when you hear Keith Green sing!
