 This is the sweetest book! I'm not sure who loves it more, me or my daughter. The illustrations are simple yet colorful and eye catching enough for my active 17 month old. This is one of the only books she will sit still for. It really captivates her and holds her attention. I recommend every mom adding this book to their child's collection!
