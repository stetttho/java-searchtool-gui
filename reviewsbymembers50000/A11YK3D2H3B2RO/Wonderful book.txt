 Stormie has done it yet again! The Power of A Praying Wife is wonderful and this book is just as good. The book is divided up into chapters that correlate to a different part of your childs life. For example: Feeling Loved and Accepted, Establishing An Eternal Future. At the end of each chapter is a prayer you can pray for your child. I always insert my child's name whenever it says he or she to make it more personal. Stormie writes these prayers in a way that I never could. Each prayer is exactly what I want to pray for my child, but didn't know how to until I read this book! A must have book for every parent!
