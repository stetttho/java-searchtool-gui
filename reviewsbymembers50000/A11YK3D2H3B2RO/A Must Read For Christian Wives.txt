 Nancy Wislon has packed a powerful punch into only 109 pages!! I recommend this book to any wife who wants to learn more about the role God has given her. It is a very easy read and can be read in a day or two. My favorite chapter was the one entitled "Principles and Methods". This chapter alone is worth it's weight in gold! It was like a breath of fresh air for me. A cold glass of water on a hot, sunny Texas day! Nancy is very direct and dosen't hold anything back. I find her style to be refreshing and much needed in todays society where women are only told what they want to hear.
