 This toy was given to my daughter as a gift when she was about 2 months old. She really liked it. I think the black, white and red colors provided lots of stimulation for her. When she got a little older, she started batting at the rattles and toys that hung down. She also really enjoyed the looking at her self in the mirror that hung down. Of course, she also loved chewing on it too!!
