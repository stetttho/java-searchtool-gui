 My favorite thing about this book is that Dr. Sear's encourages you to know your child. He acknowledges that each and every child is unique and that spoke volumes to me. There is great developmental info. and the breatsfeeding advice is great. He is the father of 8 children and I highly respect him and value his advice and experience.
