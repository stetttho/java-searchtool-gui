 My 17 month old absolutley loves this book! The pictures are vibrant and colorful and she loves the repetitive phrases all through out this book. She wants me to read to her all day long and this book is always in her stack of "favorites". She is learning the many different sounds animals make as a result of reading this book over and over and over! I highly recommend you add this gem to your child's library!
