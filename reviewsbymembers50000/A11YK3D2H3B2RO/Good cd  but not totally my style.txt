 I love Raffi's simple melodies and happy tunes. I know my daughter will enjoy him for years to come. My favorite song on this cd is "All I Really Need". It is such a pretty song and can actually bring a tear to me eye, LOL! The song speak's of a family's love and it is very sweet. That said, Raffi is too much of a tree hugger for me. He is very much into saving the earth and while I agree we should all do what we can to take care of the earth, he goes a bit over board. For example, the song titled "Clean Rain. He sings a verse in there about "how the rain used to fall clean". Well, as far as I know, it still falls clean, LOL! What's that all about?? God is the maker of rain and if it meet's his standards, it sure as heck meets mine! All in all, it is a sweet cd, but with a heavy "save the earth" undertone.
