 I love Dr. Brazelton's style. He is such a gentle, caring man. He is the kind of man any child would love to have as their grandpa, let alone their pediatrician. I love his chapters on the newborn and the different temperments. It really helped me to understand my daughter better when she was a newborn. Now that she is almost 17 months, I still consider it an invaluable resource. When she was 14 months, I read ahead to his chapter on your child at 15 months. It was amazing! I kept findig myself shaking my head "yes", "uh-huh". He provides great developmental information for each stage of your child's life. But what I love most is that he get's behind the child's eyes and can tell you what is going on inside of them emotionally. I highly recommend this to everyone!
