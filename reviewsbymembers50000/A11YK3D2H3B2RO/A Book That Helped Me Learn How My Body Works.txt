 This book explained so many things to me that no one ever did. I learned so many things about my cycle and the changes it goes thru each month. This book gave me the knowledge I needed to know to conceive my daughter, who is now 17 months. I was also able to spot some potential problems as a result of reading this book. I highly recommend purchasing this book to any woman who wishes to learn more about her body!
