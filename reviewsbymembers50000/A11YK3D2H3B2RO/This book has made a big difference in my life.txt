 This book was hard for me to take at first because I wanted to fix my husband. I thought he was the one with all of the problems. Boy, was I wrong! The first chapter is entitled "His Wife". That threw me a bit because I thought this was a book about fixing what is wrong with your husband, LOL. Well, the first chapter will bring you to your knees and serve you a big 'ole piece of humble pie! The book is divided up into 30 chapters. Each one deals with an area of your husband's life such as his faith, his future, his work etc. If you are buying this book to change your husband, think again! Thru this book God will change you first and deal with your sinful heart and THEN he will work on your husband. Expect this book to change YOU first!
