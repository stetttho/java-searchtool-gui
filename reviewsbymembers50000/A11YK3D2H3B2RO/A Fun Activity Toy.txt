 I purchased this toy for my daughter when she was around 3 or 4 months old. She really enjoyed it and loved to kick her feet on the pedals and watch the gym swirl and twirl. She especially enjoyed the music and sounds. This is one of those toys that can overstimulate your baby very quickly, so watch out!! It is cheaply made and not too sturdy, but we have never had any problems with it. My baby is now 17 months old and still plays with it!!
