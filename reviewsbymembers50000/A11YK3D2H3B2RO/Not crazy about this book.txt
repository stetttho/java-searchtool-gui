 First of all, I dislike Gary Ezzo's tone. He comes across as very sarcastic, arrogant, and condescending if you have a different parenting style.  While I liked the sleep/feed/wake cycle, his breastfeeding advice is terrible. 4 feedings 4 times a day, starting at 4 months???? What a joke!!! My advice is to remember that this is one man's opinion and not the end all be all. He has no medical training and certainly no type of training when it comes to lactation issues. Use your common sense and mother's instinct to guide you.
