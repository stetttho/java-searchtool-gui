 We just purchased this book a few days ago, and my 17 month old daughter already loves it!! She loves hearing all of the different sounds and the pictures really seem to hold her attention. Also, the text on each page is not too long, as she can't seem to handle books that are too long at her age. I love the ending, it is very cute and sweet!
