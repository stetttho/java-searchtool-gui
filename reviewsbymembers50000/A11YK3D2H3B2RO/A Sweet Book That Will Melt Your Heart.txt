 I love reading this book to my 17 month old daughter. The dialogue really touches my heart. Little nut brown hare is so sweet and Big nutbrown hare is such a loving parent. My favorite part is the end.... This is a must have in your child's library that will be enjoyed for years to come. This would make a really great shower gift for a mom-to-be!
