 This book has been my daughter's favorite for several months now. The illustrations and are colorful and vibrant. She loves the repetitive rhyming in this book. She has learned many of the noises animals make because of this book. I highly recommend everyone add this treasure to their child's library. You won't be dissapointed!!!
