 There were a few neat ideas in this book. My favorite idea was the mommy and daddy tapes. I like the idea of making a tape for my 17 month old that includes songs, scripture, the alphabet, and so on. She loves hearing our voices and I am sure she will really enjoy them. What I didn't like was the fact that alot of the ideas sounded a bit unrealistic to me. Sit time, talk time?? Give me a break! Play alone time?? This book sounded a bit too much like Gary Ezzo's ideas and the things he presents in his curriculum - Babywise and Preparation For Parenting/The Toddler Years. Oddly enough, the authors dedicated this book to the Ezzo's. There influence is very obvious thru out this book. I felt that the authors had unrealistic expectations of what a toddler could do i.e. sit time. They don't seem to have a basic understanding of child development and what a child is capable of at each age. My advice is to read this book with a discerning eye. Take the good stuff and leave the rest!
