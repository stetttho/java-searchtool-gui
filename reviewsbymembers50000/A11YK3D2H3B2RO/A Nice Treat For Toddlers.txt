 This book is a special treat for my toddler. It is very bright and colorful and pretty short. It emphasizes counting and eating cheerios, LOL. My daughter loves to get this book out a million times a day so I will go get some cheerios. I have had to start putting it up after reading it twice, or she will just want to read it all day long and the eat the cheerios that go along with it too! A neat book that you are sure to get alot of use out of!
