 I already had a review on this album but i need to change some things. This is in my view the best Madonna cd ever. And it is my favorite cd of 2003. I think she made some mistakes with it though like not releasing the American Life video. That really slowed records sales down and it took 4 months to go platinum and fall off the charts. I like all the songs. Each song is right for every mood because most of the time you'll need a more dancy and trancy cds than those ballads and rock cds. My favorite song is Love Profusion. And it just recently became my fave because i saw the video. I loved the video so i started listening to the song more. I think Love Profusion should have been the first single and Nothing Fails the second single. That way i think it would have did better and probably would have been atleast double or triple platinum. She also chose not to release the Love Profusion single in the U.S. which i think was also a mistake. And the video was only released over seas. I hope she makes one more last video which is Nothing Fails to close the American Life age of hers before moving on to another album. And i heard that she might tour but i doubt it since the album didn't do its fullest. Nobody Knows Me is also on radio play overseas. So far only 2 songs from the album went to radio in the U.S. which are American Life and Hollywood. Her e.p. is pretty good also. I like the remixes and the song Your Honesty. So this is my update. Cant wait for a new album by Madonna!!
