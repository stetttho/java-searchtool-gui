 This is P!nk's best album....She totally blew me away. I wasnt sure if i should get it at first but then i did and it just takes you away. I listened through it the first time and i loved it. Trouble,God Is A Dj, Last To Know, Humble Neighborhood, and Waiting For Love are my favorites. I was listening through 'waiting for love' and i was about to skip it. And just i was about to, the chorus came on and i was like whoa.....She was singing like a f*cking singer.....Her voice is so awesome. So Waiting For Love is my fave...The dvd is good to. I recomend this cd very much to anyone!!!!!!!!!!!
