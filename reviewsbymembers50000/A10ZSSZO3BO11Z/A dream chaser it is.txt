 This is a great video collection of her past videos. I love it. From the sweet 'I Wanna Love You Forever' to the record label controlled image of 'Irrisistible' and 'A Little Bit' I love the 'A Little Bit' video but that was the time when she was controlled by her label which made her album flop. But overall this dvd is awesome. I like the footage from the Dream Chaser tour and the biography stuff. This is the best dvd before Jennifer Lopez's The Reel Me..
