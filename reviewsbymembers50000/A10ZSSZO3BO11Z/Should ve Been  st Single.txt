 Talk About Our Love was the worst choice for a 1st single. Brandy's album was so highly anticipated and was her best album ever. But she released the most horrible song as a first single. Afrodisiac would have been a huge summer hit. Then 'I Tried' would've been a great 2nd single.   I LOVE this song. Its my fave on the album. The video sadly was only released over seas while Who Is She To You was released in the U.S.   Hopefully Brandy will make a comeback.
