 WOW I MEAN WOW!! This is by far the best rock cd i have ever heard.I really loved the song Bring Me To Life and i had to buy the cd.For a minute i thought that Bring Me To Life would be the only good song.Evanescence proved me wrong.This cd is a hit.And i have to admit i never really listened to rock til this cd. My Fave : Going Under: this song really makes me scream.Amy's voice is so power full on this as she soars thru my speakers.I sing it to the top of my lungs. My Last Breath :  I thought this would be a technoish song when it first started.So i wuz like uh oh.But it turned rock real quick.And it still stayed on top .I love it absolutely. Bring Me To Life:  The first single off course everyone knows it.I love this song.It makes me sink into a deep trance and makes me view a dark place of love.I love it totally.Her voice on this sounds so HAUNTING!  Further Comments: My friend told me her fave song wuz Haunted on this cd.So i listened to it.This is the only song that i think should have had more work.But itz the only one that i think that on.The rest is perfect. Recomendation:  I recomend this cd to people that like hard rock with a taste of dance.But itz mostly rock so dont think itz like a dance cd.But this cd has my recomendation to people that love good music in rock!
