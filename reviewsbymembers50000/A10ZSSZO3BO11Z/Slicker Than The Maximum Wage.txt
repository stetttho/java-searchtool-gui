 This is the best Craig David cd.......I liked Born To Do It but this cd is muuuuuch better.These songs are the kind i can relate to and am used to since i grew up in Europe...Craig is like a brother to me .I look up to him..And i went to 2 of his shows in the uk that rocked. S.T.Y.A.-This is a hot track.The rap is awesome Whats Your Flava-The track that made me by the cd. Even though we didnt see to much of the video in the U.S. Fast Cars-This was the second song that i started liking after buying the album. Hidden Agenda-Great song. Ive had a relationship like that once. I didnt see the video in the U.S. that much. Eenie Meenie-This song rocks...But if u listen to it to much you'll start skiping the end part. He rocked this song at the concert. Y.D.M.Y.W.T.T.W.R.D.-This is a great ballad. Its slow but it is funky. Rise N Fall-This third single i dont think hit stores in the U.S. And i didnt see the video in the u.s. either. But is a great song. Personal-Great song...The best part is at the end. Lovely. This track is for all the love makers.And the video was great.But i only saw it once in the u.s. Hands Up In The Air-This was the third song that i started liking after buyin the cd.Great club hit. Love it. 2 Steps Back-Great song to dance to......Very rnb ish......and gets ya off your feet. Spanish-I didnt listen to this song until i played the whole cd one day...Thats when i started loving it....The rap is off the hook. And i loved the video.It starts out like Fill Me In did. But i dont think this was a single in the u.s. What's Changed-Katie Holmes makes a great appearance on this track. I really like it. World Filled With Love-This song i can really relate to. Its like walking away pt.2 I really love it. And the video was awesome.But it didnt get released in the u.s. I like all the tracks on the cd.And hope to see more from Craig.
