 This is a good R&B debut cd. THe only thing I don't see much on here is good vocals. Ciara's vocal range isn't that high. But that's about the only complaint I got.   Goodies- 10/10 1st single  1,2 Step- 10/10 2nd single  Thug Style 10/10 one of my favorites. should be the 4th single.  Hotline 5/10 I'm not diggin this song that much.  Oh 10/10 3rd single this is my fave song on the album.  Pick Up The Phone- 9/10 this beat is addictive  Lookin' At You- 8/10  Ooh Baby- 6/10  Next To You- 8/10  And I- 10/10 this song should be track #4 instead of Hotline.  Other Chicks- 5/10  The Title- 6/10  overall I give this album a 8.
