 This is a pretty good package. U finally get the lyrics to all the songs. A fold out poster is also present. I didn't have the dualdisc before. Now I do since it comes along also. Then theres the dvd.   It seems like they had cheap budgets for the Big Dreams video/movie. It wuz completely fake actors and set. But it wuz ok. The acting coulda been better. And the Caviar video wuz also cheap. But I like it also. Snoop makes a good appearance.  The biggest fan session wuz obsessive. Them girls should be on me like that haha. Anyway this package deserves a 8/10 rating.
