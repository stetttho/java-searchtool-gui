 This album is great. I liked her first album but this one takes you away. She explores more deeper rock sound. I think it fits her well. Best Songs: Take Me Away (Should be a single, this is my fave song) Together Don't Tell Me (1st Single) How Does It Feel My Happy Ending (2nd Single) Nobody's Home (3rd Single)  Forgotten (This beat is awesome) Who Knows Slipped Away (talks of her grandfather passing.Very deep.
