 This is a great collection from britney. It shows stuff I've never seen before. I didn't even know that there was a regular version of the overprotective video. I thought she just had a remix version. I finally got to see the full version of th I Love Rock N Roll video. I saw parts of it before but never saw the whole thing. I never saw the Born To Make You Happy video either but I knew she had one for the song.  This is worth buying. It tops all of her other DVD's. Her last DVD sucked. And the one before that did too.
