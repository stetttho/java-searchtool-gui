 Updated July 22nd 2005, I found out somethings about this cd so I had to edit it.  This album was not what I expected at all. Last year I hated his voice now I'm listening to the album everyday. I bought the cd cuz I got stuck on Lonely and the cd was only 9.99 at Target. Anyway this album should have been called Journey cuz it tells u so much about his life. Plus the song Journey is my favorite on here.   My Fave Songs: Locked Up (Remix) -1st US single & video Trouble Nobody Bananza - 1st International single & video Ghetto- 2nd International single & video Show Out Lonely- 2nd US single & video Journey- should be 4th single  July 22nd- I didn't know Ghetto was a single until I saw the video on Launch and did some research. I also didn't know Bananza was the first official single for this album and was a hit overseas before Locked Up was ever heard in the US.  July 6th - This album is hot. The beats are great. Akon produces the whole album which is good cuz labels these days never let their artist work on their first album themselves. Ratings 9 1/2 out of 10 July 6th 2005 edited July 22nd
