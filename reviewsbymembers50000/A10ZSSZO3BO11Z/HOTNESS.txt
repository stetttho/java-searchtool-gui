 This cd is the ultimate summer banger. Anyway....I already wrote a review but I had to update it. This album deserves way more than just gold status. I think it should have gone diamond instead of dropping off the charts so quick. And she should've known that Who Is She 2 U would be a misunderstood hit. And Kanye West is a horrible producer. His own stuff sounds ok but when he produces for other people he seems to loose his touch. Like Janets song. Kanye made Janet flop so bad that some people didn't even know she had an album out. I hope he don't mess up Mariah Carey like he did Brandy and Janet cuz she's already struggling to sell records and he don't need to mess it up more. Anyway this whole album is good. The only songs that aren't all that are the songs Kanye produced.  I don't understand why Talk About Our Love was the first single.   Afrodisiac should've been the first single. It would've been a huge summer hit.  I Tried would've made a good second single after Afrodisiac. Focus after I Tried. Who Is She 2 You as the fourth single  Finally as the last single.  If she would've released these songs in this order than the album would've prolly sold better.
