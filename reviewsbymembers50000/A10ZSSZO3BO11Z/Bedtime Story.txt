 This was a slight improvement from Erotica. Still not the best but a lil better than Erotica. This was supposed to be her comeback album. But it sold the same amount of copies as Erotica did. 2 million copies. Bedtime Stories sold a lil faster though.   Survival 8/10 Not the best opener. Sounds like a filler.  Secret 10/10 1st single. This is a memorable song.  I'd Rather Be Your Lover 4/10 I never fell for this song.  Don't Stop 5/10 Sounds like another filler.  Inside of Me 7/10 Nice ballad. Not my favorite though.  Human Nature 10/10 4th single. This has a addictive beat.  Forbidden Love 10/10 My favorite ballad on this cd. This was gonna be the 5th single.  Love Tried To Welcome Me  5/10 I never paid this song much attention.  Sanctuary 10/10 I always loved this song. The melody is awesome.  Bedtime Stories 10/10 3rd single. This song doesn't really fit on the album but its still my favorite on here.  Take a Bow 10/10 2nd single. This is a great album closer. This song introduced me to Madonna way back.             I would give this album a 8/10 for an overall rating. I gave Erotica a 7/10.
