 This is a great cd. She really fits with the pop music sound. Her voice makes them sound so much better than some pop music today. I bought this cd so late because i thought it would be another one of those ballad albums she does. But then i saw the one heart video and decided to give it a try. Its awesome. But the Chrysler imprint was not necessary. She sold this whole cd to them. And she is kind of selfish for putting Have You Ever Been In Love on this cd and had to nerve to make a video for it to promote her Vegas Show. Great cd though Best Songs: Love Is All We Need One Heart Faith In His Touch Reveal Jetaime Encore I Drove All Night (Not the best cover song but its ok)
