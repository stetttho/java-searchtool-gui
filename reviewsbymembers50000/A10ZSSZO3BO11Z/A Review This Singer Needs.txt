 OK.. I don't get it. If u don't like Britney why keep talking bout her or listen to her? It makes no sense. No one is putting a gun to your head saying listen to her or I'll shoot you.  Britney does not have a high vocal range. DUH we know that. Thats why she makes dance songs for us to listen to. Her music is about dance not singing if you haven't noticed. Her greatest hits tanked. DUH its very rare that a greatest hits album sells.  Her album sales have slipped. DUH cuz she hasn't come up with that great songs to make everyone want to buy her albums.  Anyway I like the beat of this song. The video was cheap cuz her label didn't even want to make a video for this song. But Britney begged so they gave her little money. Better than nothing. I hope she comes up with a good 5th album so she can sell like she used to.
