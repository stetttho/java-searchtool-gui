 Her first album was kinda kiddie like while this album has a harder edge to it which I really like. She co-wrote 3 songs this time. The best songs are: Fly Hide Away Weird  Mr.James Dean (awesome vocals acompany this song) Haters (you can tell this is towards lindsay lohan) Rock This World Dangerous To Know   and others. I just got the cd so I'm still getting used to all the songs. But I love this cd I hope it sells atleast 5 million copies.
