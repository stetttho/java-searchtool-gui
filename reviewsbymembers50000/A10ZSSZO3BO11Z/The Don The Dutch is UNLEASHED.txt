 This is a great cd......Bow Wow has really matured......He is writing his own songs(finally).Not by Jermaine Dupri. I think leaving So So Def is the best thing Shad ever did....even though the cd has some low points.....But i love it......His best cd ever...Can't wait for the third single! Get It Poppin'-5/5 Let's Get Down-5/5 (First Single) Eighteen-2/5 A low point of the cd Follow Me-5/5 My Baby-5/5 Great Video (Second Single) The Don,The Dutch-5/5 (Third Single) The Movement-5/5 Sounds like a 2pac song I Can't Lose-5/5 Hey Little Momma-5/5 my fave song.....should be a single I Got Ya'll-4/5 Hate the hook I'll Move On-5/5 Mario is a great feature to this song! To My Mama-5/5 Amerie should have done more vocals! I'm Back-4/5 Should have been on the cd as a regular track.  And what is up with tracks 13,14,and 15? They have nothing on them ...Great cd Bow Wow
