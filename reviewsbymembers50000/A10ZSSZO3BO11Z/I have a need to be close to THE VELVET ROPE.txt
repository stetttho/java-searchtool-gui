 This is by far the best album Janet has released. She really poured her heart into this album. Continuing her sexuality from the janet. album to some strong talk about Abusive Relationships and celebrating the human spirit. I loved all the videos. \ Best Songs: Velvet Rope You Got 'Til Its Gone  Go Deep Together Again What About Every Time I Get Lonely Special The tour for this album was great. She has yet to top the album or tour.
