 This is a great cd. She really shows that she knows how to write a song. There are great dance songs and 2 great ballads. I believe that her song 'Everytime' is the answer to Justin Timberlakes 'Never Again'  Best Songs: Me Against The Music Boom Boom Showdown Breathe On Me  Early Mornin' Toxic  ( Great Video,good effects ) Outrageous Touch Of My Hand  ( Fave Song should be a single ) Shadow Brave New Girl Everytime I cannot stand 'The Hook Up' it is the most gayest stupidest song she ever has sung. Ok thats my review!
