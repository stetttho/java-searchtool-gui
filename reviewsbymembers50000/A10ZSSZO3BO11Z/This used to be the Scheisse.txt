 FOR PEOPLE THAT DON'T KNOW TIC TAC TOE READ THIS!   The Members were Lee, Jazzy and Ricky This was their follow up to their self-titled debut which sold 1 million copies in germany. It was lead by the singles Leck Mich Am A,B Zeh, Ich Find Dich Scheisse and Verpiss Dich. This album sold 2 million in germany. It was lead by the singles Ich Wer So Gern So Bloed Wie Du, Mr.Wichtig, Warum? and Bitte Kuess Mich Nicht.  This cd was when Tic Tac Toe was at the top of their game. But then Ricky left and everything went downhill. She was replaced by Sarah but it didn't help. Their last album Ist Der Ruf Erst Ruiniert which had 2 singles Ist Der Ruf Erst Ruiniert and Isch Liebe Disch flopped and they were dropped from RCA. The last song heard from them was Isch Liebe Disch but it failed to succeed.   Ok.. back in 1997 they were hot in Germany. Thats where I was at the time. I used to play this cd everyday.   Ich Wer So Gern So Bloed Wie Du- 10/10  Mr.Wichtig- 10/10  Das Geht Mir Auf'n Sack- 3/10 I always hated this song  Warum- 10/10 this songs about their friend dying from drugs.
