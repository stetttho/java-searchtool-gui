 I'm still trying to collect all of Mariah's albums. I got Daydream,Butterfly,Rainbow and Charmbracelet.  This album is really the one that made me start really liking her music. The r&b ish Hip hop tracks are great work by Mariah. Although i have to say that Charmbracelet beats her Rainbow and Butterfly Lp's. This is a great cd.  Fave Songs: Honey Butterfly (The most beautiful video ever) My All The Roof Breakdown Whenever You Call (I also like the version with Brian McKnight) Outside
