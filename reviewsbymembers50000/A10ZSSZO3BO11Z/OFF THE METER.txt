 I saw these guys at the Army Concert Tour last saturday at Fort Bragg in fayetteville, nc. Man I did not know Q could sing like that. He hit the highest notes ever. And when they performed What If I was like damn Slim is pouring his heart into this song. He looked like he was bout to cry. I like performances that make u feel goosebumps. It made me feel bad that I had their cd burned so I went out and bought it. Its a good cd.    Fave Songs What If  U Already Know If I Hit  Let This Go
