 This cd is by far never as good as her first one. This one went like 45 steps down from perfect. Her first one i could listen to from 1-17. This one i have to keep skipping tracks cuz they suck. I liked Then Ya Gone alot and some other songs but other wise this album was garbage. She barely went platinum with this album. I think this was a horrible sophomore album. I hope her third album Concrete Rose will be better.
