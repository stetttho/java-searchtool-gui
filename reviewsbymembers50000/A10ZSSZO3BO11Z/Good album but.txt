 Ok this is a good album and i like the new songs especially Makin It Last All Night but d*mn.   This rerelease is enough. Now they rereleasin it for xmas again? Wut is their problem? Mariah is forced to go along with it. I dont really think she'd do this to her fans purposely. Cuz b 4 this album she never did that. Def Jam just are desperate cuz they havent got any success from any of their artists lately. Ashanti flops, Ll Cool J flops, etc.  Mariah i'm a diehard fan. Stop doing this to your career. The company has made enough money of this album now.   Next single i heard is spose to b So Lonely which makes no sense since one and only is part 1 y release only part 2?
