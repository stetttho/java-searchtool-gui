 I liked The Last Temptation and I still think thats his best album. But this album comes up so close behind it I like it as much as The Last Temptation.   The first three singles Wonderful is okay, New York was huge I loved it and Caught Up is one of my favorites on the album and the best single so far.   My other favorites are Where I'm From, Last of The Mohicans, Life Goes On, Get It Started, What's My Name, Never Thought and The Manuel.
