 Ok forget 50Cent. This album shoulda sold more than 2 million copies in the U.S. ! Its worth selling atleast 8 million. These songs are so hot. The lyrics are deep and the beats are thumpin'! This wuz the Hip-Hop album of 2005 and maybe of 2000-2006. Cuz its hot as hell.! I'm mad how Put You On The Game wasn't promoted. It shoulda been everywhere and the vid shoulda been a big budget vid!  My Fave Songs: Westside Story- hot.. didnt need 50 Dreams- 3rd single.. shoulda been promoted better Hate It Or Love It- 2nd single.. shoulda had less of 50 Higher- ya'll know this feeling haha How We Do- 1st single.. Dre classic beat Put You On The Game- 4th single.. very underpromoted. Hot song that shoulda had atleast a million dollar budget Start From Scratch- this shoulda been turned into a documentary We Ain't- Hot  Like Father, Like Son- Pure lyrics  This cd shoulda sold 15 million around the world atleast. ITs hot it gets a 10/10 rating from me!
