 This album reminds me of everything i used to think when i wuz 16. But i do believe this isn't completely wut teenagers talkabout. Its too sugar coated at times. Like Young Love.   Favorites: Poppin Gimme That Yo Ya Man Aint Me Run It  This is a good debut for a young one. I hope next album Chris writes a bit more. 8/10
