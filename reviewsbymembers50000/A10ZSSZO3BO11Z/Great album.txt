 This is brandys third best album. Afrodisiac & Full Moon being the first 2. Well this album has great production. The calloborations are very highlightive.  Best Songs: Angel In Disguise The Boy is Mine (shows that brandy is better than monica.lol) Learn The Hard Way Almost Doesn't Count Top of The World (great collaboration with mase) U Don't Know Me (this beat drives me crazy i love it) Never Say Never Have You Ever (beautifully written) Happy Tommorow (a ballad to cry for)
