 People are hatin so much on Chingy these days. This cd is off the hook. I think its equally as good as his first album. Too bad him and DTP aren't together no mo. Anyway...  Haters 101- funny a$$ intro.  Give Em Some Mo- 8/10  Fall-N- 8/10  Balla Baby- 9/10 not a good choice for a first single.  Leave Wit Me- 8/10 R.Kelly isn't the masterpiece we know on here.  Make That A$$ Talk- 10/10 my fave on the album. The beat is irresistible.  I Do-  9/10   Don't Worry- 8/10 Janet does an OK job.  All The Way To St. Lou- 2/10 worst song on album.  26's- 10/10 My 2nd fave song on album.  We Clubbin- 9/10  We Do- 9/10 another one of my favorites.  Wurr Da Git It Gurlz At- 10/10 my 3rd fave on album.  Bring Da Beef- 8/10  Balla Baby Remix- 10/10 this should've been the original version. Would have been better as a 1st single.  I think this album deserves better than just a Gold Certification. I think it should be 3xPlatinum just like his first album. I give this album a overall rating 8
