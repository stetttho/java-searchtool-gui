 This is a great album. She didn't beat her Velvet Rope LP (best album by her and best album of 1997-98) yet but this is still good. She explores alot of flavores on this album like she did with the All For You LP. Rock,Pop,R&B,etc. I got this cd the first day it came out and i listened to it all the way without skipping a track which is a good sign. I absolutely love it and i think i'm gonna be stuck on it for a while. Can't wait for her tour in the fall.
