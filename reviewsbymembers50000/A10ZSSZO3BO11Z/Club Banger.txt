 I'm gonna write this review like Ll's been making music like this since he came out. Cuz if not then i'd be dissing him cuz when he came out his music was way different.   To me this album is hot. This is my type of music. Rap on top of these beats is perfect. Most rap albums seem incomplete but this one doesn't at all.   Headsprung- 10/10 1st single has a killer beat  Rub My Back- 10/10   I'm Gonna Get Her- 10/10 smooth with alot of funk in the beat  Move Somethin'- 10/10 my fave on the album. the beat's irresistible  Hush- 10/10 2nd single 7Aurelius is one of the best producers ever  Every Sip- 9/10 sometimes not that impressive  Shake It Baby- 10/10 once again a killer beat  Can't Explain It- 9/10 smooth beat   Feel The Beat- 10/10 my second fave song  Apple Cobbler 8/10 this hook could've been better  1 In The Morning- 6/10 worst song on the album  I give this album a 9.5 for the overall rating
