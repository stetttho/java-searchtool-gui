 Her first cd was awesome. I liked every song on that one. Her second one wasn't all that and it seemed like a downfall for her. But her third cd is the best one. This cd has so much fire. The beats are hot. Only U was the perfect first single for this album. The intro to this song is sick. I love this album Favorite Songs: Only U (HOT) Focus Take Me Tonight Don't Leave Me Alone (HOT) Don't Let Them  overall this cd deserves 5 stars cuz Ashanti improved a whole lot from the last album. She's back! THE PRINCESS OF HIP-HOP AND R&B
