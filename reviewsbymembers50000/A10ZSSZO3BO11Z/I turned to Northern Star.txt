 I didn't know Melanie C had a solo album until the end of 2002 when i heard I Turn To You. It became my fave song for a while. So i decided to search for her album. I was thinking all of her album would be like I Turn To You. But it wasn't. She took more of a rock,R&Bish vibe onto making this album. I think this is much better than her spice girls days. Her voice is awesome. All the videos were great. Especially the one with Lisa Left-Eye Lopes. This album i have to say is better than her sophomore solo album Reason. I'm just stuck on this one. Fave Songs: Go! Goin' Down (the video for this could have been better) Northern Star (the video for this was ok) Never Be The Same Again ftr.Lisa Left-Eye Lopes (Love the video) I Turn To You (This is her best video to date) If That Were Me (The video for this was very emotional.Loved it) Why Closer I really recommend this cd to everyone because it has alot of different flavors. Something for everyone. Pop,Rock,R&B,Techno and more. This cd is not in stores in the U.S. so you should order it. Its worth it.
