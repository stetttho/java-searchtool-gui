 I've been a fan of The Kelly Family since 1994 when i was a little boy. At the time the huge hit AN ANGEL was out and i still love that song. This album is sooooo great. I think its their masterpiece. My faves are Fell In Love With An Alien and I Can't Help Myself. I can't wait for their new cd being released in July of this year (2004). Keep it coming kellys. Stop departing members though.
