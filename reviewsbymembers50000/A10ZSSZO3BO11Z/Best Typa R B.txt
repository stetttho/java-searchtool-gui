 I gotta say some of the songs on here remind me of other songs by other artists. Some of these sound similiar to Mario's Let Me Love You which Ne-Yo wrote.  Since I haven't listened to this cd obsessively imma write a fair review on wut i think of it so far!  Stay- First single wuz good. But didn't take off at radio. I like the song and it shoulda been promoted better.   So Sick- Second single is good. Its a lil ova played now tho. BUt it wuz worth being a #1 single. The beat and the melody fit perfectly.  When Your Mad- Third single is good. This is one of my favorite songs on the cd. I can relate to this one. The music is like a charm bell or sumthin.  It Just Ain't Right- creative sumthin that i could prolly relate to. Everyones thought of their past relationships while havin sex wit ur new partner haha.  Mirror- somethin i've definetly done. this song i can really relate to. its one of my faves on the album. the beat is tight.  Sign Me Up- the worst song on the album but is still a good song.  overall i give this album a 8/10 rating. This is a good debut for a R&B singer
