 [...] Do ya'll have ears? This is a great debut album. It mixes pop, rock and trance together. The mix of this album is awesome.  First- 8/10 great album opener.  Nobody 'Til You- 8/10 love the music.  Symptoms of You- 7/10 the chorus isn't that great.  Speak- 10/10 3rd single awesome song. This is where the trance was mixed in with pop.  Over- 10/10 2nd single. This is a awesome ballad. The vocals are great.  Something I Never Had- 8/10 good song.  Anything But Me- 9/10 pop mixed with rock.   Disconnected- 9/10 another great slow song.  To Know Your Name- 10/10 definetly my favorite song on the album. This is the song that mixes pop, rock and trance together. I hope it becomes the 4th single.  Very Last Moment In Time- 8/10 great lyrics.  Rumors- 10/10 1st single again pop and rock mixed together. Great song.  This album to me is perfect. Most of my favorite types of music are on this album. Overall rating 9.5
