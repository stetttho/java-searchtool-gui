 You know people Mario's age in the business don't have the courage to put this type of music out there. People this age go through things like this. Thats one reason I love this cd. And plus these are some of the hottest beats eva. Mario's vocal range make the slow songs explosive.   18- 10/10 this is how I feel alot. Just slam it in their face.  Let Me Love You- 10/10  1st single I've always liked this song.  Couldn't Say No- 9/10 I've been through this. lol  Boom- 9/10 Everyone says it sounds like a rip-off version of Usher's Yeah. Well duh.. it has the same meaning and it was written by the same producer. Hot song.  How Could You- 10/10 2nd single. The vocal range is awesome.  Girl I Need- 7/10 Haven't really gotten into this song.  Call The Copes- 10/10 My favorite song on the album. Its so explosive. Should be 3rd single.  Here I Go Again- 9/10 This song copies the style of Brandy's "I Thought". But I like it.  Nikes Fresh Out The Box- 2/10 Worst song on album. Completely cheesy. Doesn't fit in with the other songs.  Directions- 9/10 Good slow jam to make love to.  Shakedown- 10/10 Its good that Mario has a upbeat song for an outing. It makes the album worth listening to from beginning to end.  Let Me Love You Remix- 10/10 The style is changed. I like this version as much as the original.  This album shows more maturing from Mario. I can completely relate to every song. Overall Rating 9
