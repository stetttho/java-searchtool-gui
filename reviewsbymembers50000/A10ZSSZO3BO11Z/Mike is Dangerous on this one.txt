 I think alot of people agree in saying that this is Michaels best album. The beats on here are monstrous. Their addictive. This album should have sold more than 7 million copies.  My favorites: Who Is It Give Into Me Will You Be There In The Closet  These singles were released: Black or White Remember The Time In The Closet Heal The World (Video only released overseas) Jam Who Is It (Video and Single only released overseas) Give Into Me (Single was not released but there was a video) Gone Too Soon (No commercial single was released)
