 This album is legendary. The lyrics,the music the everything. It has a smooth vibe. Pain is Love was a goog album and I didn't think he would beat it but he did. Even though The Last Temptation didn't sell as well as Pain is Love I think it should've been diamond. The singles weren't promoted well and neither was the album. My fave songs are Murder Reigns and Thug Luvin which both were singles.
