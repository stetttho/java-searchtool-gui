 I didn't like this the first time around, but after the second listen, I started enjoying it immensly. Maybe I was expecting something like the first offering, where Cut Chemist and Shortkut do some really progressive,  crate digging, instructional-record sampling, turntable action. But then  this reviewer realized that THAT wasn't their goal, and to compare the  first volume to this one would be totally unfair. What Dj Z-Trip and Radar  manages to do is to create more of "party" album; though not as  experimental as their predeccesors, it is a lot more fun and they show off  their skratching skills none-the-less. In this musical gumbo they throw in  Afrika Bambaattaa ( "Planet Rock" being a b-boy favorite ),  Beastie Boys, Run DMC, LL Cool J ( before he became wack ) Busta Rhymes,  Black Sheep, Dj Kool ( everytime I hear "clear my throat" I want  to do the Ed Lover dance for some reason ) and Roger & Zapp ( you can  never, ever, EVER, go wrong with More Bounce to the Ounce. Never ). All in  all, these BombShelter DJs give you reason to take cover from their ensuing  sonic assault.
