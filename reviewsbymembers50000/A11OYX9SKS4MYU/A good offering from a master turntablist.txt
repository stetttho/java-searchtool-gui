 Rob Swift, DJ extraodinare from the X-ecutioners, gives us the latest in turntablism. Even though I was expecting more instrumentals, I wasn't really disappointed since the MCs that come show up go well with Mr. Swifts  tight production skills- speaking of which, the MC best track, in my  opinion is "I'm Leaving", which has one of the dopest guitar loop  I've ever heard ( which  perfectly compliments the somewhat melancholy  subject of leaving your girl ), too bad it's only two and some odd minutes  long. Other highlights are "all that scratching is making me  rich", which is him on the ones and twos and various others on drums,  guitar, and horns, each instrument taking turns over the scratches that Rob  Swift deftly manipulates. All in all, a good solid offering of the DJing  aspect of hip-hop.
