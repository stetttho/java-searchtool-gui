 Thank the Almighty for NAFTA... Coming straight from Toronto, the 3 dj/producers Mr. Attic, Swiff, and Mr. Murray, collectively known as Da Grassroots, come out with an incredible hip-hop album sure to blow 'heads off the map. Along for the ride are lyricists from the Canadian scene, and  the final product is an album with VERY tight production values and equally  tight lyrics. The grooves are more on the subdued tip, lots of jazzy piano  loops ( incredibly done on tracks 15 and tracks 19 ) and effective drum  beats; each song compliments the various MCs very well. The only real party  joint is track 22, the "Three Rhyme Superstars" which livens  things up a bit,with the microphone being constantly exchanged between the  three rhyme- stylers. Though there is nothing here that is groundbreaking,  it is some REALLY good, creative, sample-based hip-hop. I never even heard  of the MC's on this album, let alone da Grassroots themselves, yet after  hearing one of the cuts, "Thematics", on an underground hip-hop  station, I was impressed enough to buy the CD, and I was not dissapointed.  My only gripe is that the case doesn't correctly label the song names to  the track numbers. Other than that, this a very good album,  showing that  the Canadian hip-hop scene is alive and thriving.  On a side note:  AAmazon lists only 2 songs when there are 24 tracks on the album itself.
