 This is perhaps the purest hip-hop beatstumental album ever dropped. Pure in the sense that that whole album ( except two tracks ) features hypnotic, head-nod inducing loops that doesn't stray from familar pastures. Down-tempo and bass heavy with the occasional horns, there is no mistaking that this is hip-hop, not trance, not ambient, not lounge, but back to the basic HIP-HOP with a jazz state of mind. The problem with this is after hearing the first 30 seconds of every track there are no suprises-- it's not as multi-layered as DJ Shadow's offerings, not as eclectic as Nobody, and not as experimental as DJ Krush. Tracks that at first sound fresh soon become repetative and extended, with the emerging U.N. mc's giving it a fresh change of pace. I have almost all of Pete Rock's album, and his audience knows very well his ability to make bangin' tracks --with mc's--, so I was kind of dissapointed with this solo joint. Soul Brother no.1 manages a near masterful album, bogged down only by it's lack of versatility.
