 What a waste of film. Especially with a name like Tsui Hark appearing on the case. I wouldn't mind the illogical premise ( anyone who dies is a potential zombie<!?> which over time would transform into a vampire ), as long as it delivers on the action-- but unfortunatly, it exuberates an already silly plot, which in itself is jarring and lacking in direction. The narrative doesn't have the same charming aimlessness of say, Time & Tide, and features truly corny comic moments. The action is standard wire-fu, and it's compentantly done, though there's really nothing that stands out here. The monsters look like crap ( no, really ), and move like they've been out in the sun too long. Don't waste your time on this-- for some real good fun go get Vesus instead.
