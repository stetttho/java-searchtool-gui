 It's obvious from the glowing reviews that Samurai X is, indeed, good. And yes, for those of use who don't have the attention span of a DragonBall Z fan, this is a great OVA to watch. With its attention to historical fact, emphasis on fluid animation, and a tragic love-story along with it, any anime-fan worth their salt should find something to like in this series. The visual presntation is suprisingly, bright and clear, but the main charachter, Himura, who is clothed in a dark kimono, is not. In this context, we are able to see the vivid contrast between him, and the world that he is surrounded by. Such is the origins of Himura Kenshin, and to say that this a departure from the Rurouni Kenshin tv series is a gross understatment ( though their IS an underlying grimness in the tv series itself, when one looks in-between the humor and light-heartedness ). There are no bouts of slapstick punctuating this show; this is just a straight out story of violence and blood. And at times, it's emphasize on the slaughter is the show's strength and weakness. It's constant barrage of bloody images, though powerful, lacks a certain subtlety, and we seem to find ourselves lingering too long at the maimed corpses. In the film Mononoke Hime ( or Princess Mononoke for the un-initiated ), the combat was often very violent, but not neccasarily gory. The amount of blood in Samurai X makes one wonder if the gore was done for gore's sake, and it almost detracts from this finely woven story. Yet, this is just the first half of 2 part DVD series, and the ending is better than the beginning. A worthwhile purchase indeed.
