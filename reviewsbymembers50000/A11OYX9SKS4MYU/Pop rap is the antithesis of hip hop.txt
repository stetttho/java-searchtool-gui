 If this is the future of hip-hop, then I worry for hip-hop. Unfortunatley, this isn't, and true hip-hop artists will always keep coming out with better and more original albums than this mindless tripe for the masses. As  an early review said, almost all of Will's hits are based on earlier, more  recognizable hits ( a la' Puffy ), and frankly, it re-enforces the  stereotype that rap, and hip-hop as whole, is not music or an art, but  thievery on a grand scale-- that it is unoriginal, and derivative (which it  certainly is not). And although his stance on non-profanity is commendable,  it is marred by the albums obvious commercialism. Good rap can be done  without vulgarity, as done by Blackalicious, LA Symphony, Guru's  Jazzmatazz, and Fresh Mode. This is music for people who don't listen to  rap, and if you fit that description, then this might be for you.
