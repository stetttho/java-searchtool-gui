 ...along with DJ Spinna's "strange games & things". But unlike Spinna's lp that offers a mix of dusty records from 70's soul and r&b, Breakestra is an actual live band that churns out funky breaks-- a bit of The Barkays, Skull Snaps, James Brown, The JB's, The Meters and innumerable others listed within the liner notes. And just as the album title implies, it truely is a "live mix", with the cuts played together and connected with a bridge/drum breaks. Most are instrumentals, and some feature vocals from Miles Tackett; part Master of Ceremony, part James Brown's second cousin. But primarily, those of The Beat Generation will recognize a lot of the breaks as implemented by Primo, Pharcyde, EPMD, The Artifacts, DJ Muggs, Large Proffesor, KRS-One and The Beatnuts, to name a few. The  real fun is in naming what break was used by which artists, though for musicphiles, dusty fingered dj's and cats who wear gator shoes, naming the actual cut by the orignal artist should prove interesting. So go ahead, join club rootdown: squares and the musically challenged need not enter.
