 Ya'll probably gonna hate me for this, but really, the Blackout album is "aight". Like an earlier review stated, the beats are, at best,  less than standout. They're not wack, per se, but to someone who listens to  Hip-hop alot, there not the BOMB either; "Cereal Killer" a cut  that everybody here seems to like, was used first by The Coup, and more  effectively at that. "Maad Crew", uses a relatively new sample  for its beat, "Sandworms", which is featured in the Mushroom Jazz  collection that came out just a year or two ago ( it's a beat too new to be  used, imho ). But Funk Doc and the Ticalion Stallion come correct with  there charismatic flows, and they do have a certain chemistry that is hard  to beat. Hard-core fans probably already have this album, but for the  others, save your money for Mos Def's new joint, " Black On Both Sides  "
