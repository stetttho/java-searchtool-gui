 Watch ALIENS. Then compare. Then wonder what the hell happened. Like the comment made earlier, this does no feel like an ALIENS film ( I am by no means an expert on movies, yet by the first few minutes of the movie, I  knew it was being directed by some french guy ). The characters were more  like caricatures in there one- dimensional acting, and they had a  "cartoonish" aspect to them. Probably the most ludicrous part of  the movie was the "richochet"  scene where one of the  guns-for-hire shoots his pistol in the air to hit the marine below (  totally out of place in the ALIENS universe ). It's saving grace was the  way the movie potrays the ALIENS, in that even though a threat to humanity  and must be exterminated, they still hold a loathsome beauty and grace that  man can only pervert and never perfect. It's only unfortunate that this  message is blurred by laudible parodies of evil scientists and equally  inept military men.
