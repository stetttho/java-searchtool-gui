 At first veiwing, I thought this would be a dark comedy, and it starts like one: death of a long-time friend first evokes panic, then is replaced by an almost callous attitude ( as seen in the high school bathroom ) and  eventually deception and betrayal follow. The bright settings and clothes  are a stark contrast to their grim deed, and Rose Mcdowell plays her role  wonderfully. Unfortunatley the plot soon turns ho-hum as the movie  progresses, losing it's scathing humour and becoming cliched in its  "thwarting the evil ploys" of Mcdowell. Also, there were numerous  plot holes in the movie, especially concerning the "crime scene"  and the police' acquiring of the suspect. I guess the only comparison to  this movie would be Heathers, which far out shines this pale copy.
