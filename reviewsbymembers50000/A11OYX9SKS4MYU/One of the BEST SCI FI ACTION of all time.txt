 This is probably the BEST action/sci-fi film ever made. It has it all: Great creature design ( a la Giger ), great weapons ( the pulse rifle, smart guns, the drop ship ), kick-a$$ action, and, importantly, it was  humorous but never tongue-in-cheek ( the Marine banter always make me  laugh, especially Hicks ). This also is one of the most influentual sci-fi  films out there, ( excluding, of-course, STAR WARS ). Don't believe me?  Look at the SPACE MARINE board and video games, and read past HEAVY METAL  issues and look for "Alien-esque" storylines ( where a bunch of  people are out destroying aliens & bugs with cool weaponry ). It also  "spawned" a pretty successful comic line by DARK HORSE, which did  ALIENS more justice the the next two movie sequal ( look for it if you can,  these were AMAZING graphic novels ).
