 but still a good effort. Lyrically they leave one lacking, and at times, their rhymes are somewhat awkward. Yet they come through musically, being innovative enough to develope a real laid back groove of their own, more  akin to the album "Do You Want More?!?!?!!!?" by The Roots( and  to those who decry BEP weak when compared to The Roots have to recognize  that it took them at least there 2nd album to be truley adept at what they  do. Organix was good, by "DYWM!?!?!!!?" was GREAT ) There is a a  lot of potential in BEP as seen ( heard? ) in "Behind the Front"  ,and hopefully there 2nd album will surpass there 1st offerring. A worthy  purchase, none the less.
