 I was a little hesitant when I picked up this album; don't get me wrong, I'll always have fond memories of them Dogg Pound Gangstaz, especially during the legendary Death Row days ( you know, straight bumpin'  "ain't no fun when the homies can't have none"  while ditching  school and avoiding LAPD, and listening to "summertime in the  LBC" during bar-b-ques ) but as the years progressed I've moved on to  artists like Common, The Roots, Polyrhythm Addicts and the like. But you  know what? Kurupt still representing and he does a suprising good job of  it. His latest, "The Streetz iz a Mutha", shows that this gangsta  MC is still dropping them hits. Who Ride Wit'Us is a the joint that's just  begging to be bumped down the boulevard, and Ain't S**t Without my Homies  is the roll-dog anthem that chronicles the going-ons of street friendships  without getting too overtly setimenal. The only weak track in Kurupt's  offering is Tequilla, but thankfully it's followed by the short but sweet  Trylogy. And of course it wouldn't be a DGP album without Daz, and you know  Nate Dogg is doing a hook somewhere in there ( and he is ). As for the best  cut on the album, it's a toss up between Live...Mike with KRS-0ne, and the  hidden track right after it, Callin'Out Names. Where the former is a  harmless mic session over a funky bass and piano loop, the latter is the  now infamous f**k Ruff Ryder song, in where he specifically calls out DMX  and JaRule. Maybe it's cuz I can't stand both them fools and there music to  begin with, but that track provided a satisfying end to a superb album. And  you know what else? I don't think I heard the word "thug"  mentioned the whole time I was listening to the album. Now thats GANGSTA.
