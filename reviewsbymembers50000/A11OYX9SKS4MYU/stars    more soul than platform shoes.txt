 You can predict ones musical output by the company one keeps-- here we have The Soulqarians and Dr. Dre on the boards, ?uestlove from The Roots drops by, and we got Mos Def and Common <together!> on a track. With that kind people, you can't really go wrong, now can you? As another disciple of the Neo-Soul collective, Bilal does a standup job with this album, giving discerning listeners soulful, jazzy, and at times, groovy beats. One thing about the neo-soul sound that is consistent is its excellent production values, and this is no different. Tracks like "All that I Want" with its beautifully blistering melody and hook will drop you to your knees, while "Sometimes" a song about regrets, small & large, will get you chuckling ("sometimes I wish a I had no home training"! ). The prerequistite "girl why'd ya leave me?" track is there ( "When Will You Call?" ) and the "one ESPECIALLY for the ladies" cut is "Soul Sista". "Sally" is notable in its mockingly mischievious tone, and "Love Poems" is straight-forward and incredibly good. This level of craftmenship harkens back to likes of Prince and Marvin Gaye, before R & B  became disposable, so go ahead and give this brother a chance.
