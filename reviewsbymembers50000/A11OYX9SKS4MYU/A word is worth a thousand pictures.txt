 Stephen Powers, aka ESPO, gives to the world of publishing, The Art of Getting Over. No, it is not a self-help book, but a journal documenting the escapades and works of Graf kings past and present. Bound in black ( thus  resembling a graf head's "peice book" ) it contains hundreds of  full-colour and black white pictures, showing the different styles and  forms of graffiti and the evolution thereof. Also, within the pages  contains excerpts of the lives of the various artists, from the interesting  ( The REVS ) to the near tragic ( GKAE from L.A. in particular ).  Though  at times one could get lost from the numerous crew & name dropping, it  is noteworthy enough to warrant a place in Hip-Hop history. The highlight  of this book is, of course, the amazing art displayed, featuring Mr.  Powers' impressions of the various faces of graf: wether it be block  letters, wild styles, throw-ups, to the basic tag. It would have been of  particular interest to have put in words the aesthetics of graf in greater  detail by someone who is active in the art ( especially to the laymen ),  but we only have tidbits here and there scattered through out that leaves  the reader wanting some more. An excellent addition to any Hip-Hop library,  it might just make a graf head out of you.
