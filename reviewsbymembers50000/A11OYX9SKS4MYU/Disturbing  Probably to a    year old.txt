 This film was a dissapointment. The acting and cinematography were fine and all( Sir Ian McKellen, who potrayed a wizened Nazi criminal, did so  beautifully ), but as far as the story goes, it was pretty weak. Maybe I  had higher expectations, since having read Apt Pupil in Kings' collection,  "Four Seasons", which by far was a more compelling study of one  boys morbid curiosity turning into a repulsive obsession and finally into a  sick and murderous lifestyle. In the movie, there is no real suspense nor  is there anything actually "disturbing" about it ( yes, there  were the boy's dreams and images, but they were so few & fleeting that  there impact was, more or less, not felt ). Even if I didn't know about the  short story, the film itself is bland.  Admittedly, it starts off strong,  though it soon loses its momentum as it becomes pointless meandering of a  kid who tries to hide his relationship with the old man. Those who think  that this movie is "unsettling" or "shocking" would be  foaming in the mouth after reading Kings novella. A rental, maybe; but a  purchase? A definite NO.
