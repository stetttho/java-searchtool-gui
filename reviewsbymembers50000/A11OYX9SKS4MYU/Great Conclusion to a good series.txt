 How typical of fanboys... one of the first things I noticed when reading the reviews were the comments on "not enough fighting as the first disc" or "I expected more fights" etc., etc ( Heaven forbid the same people watch the Patlabor movies ) . I guess when one ignores the great pacing, the vivid imagery, and the tasteful cinematography of the third episode one would consider it "slow". But what the last two installment does is create a believable situation to the tragic and heart-rending tragedy of Himura. There is a noticeable introduction of CG elements in here, but it comes across as akward, especially with the melding of real-time sea-water and animated cels. Thankfully, this process is only done briefly, and does not hamper the overall visuial feel of series. The animation is solid, and the combat scenes of the last episode are so good that one can almost forgive the overtly violent scenes from the last two. And sorry, but just 'cuz there are swords and samurai in here doesn't necessarily mean that a Kurosawa comparison is in order.  Needless to say, if one already has the first OVA, there is no reason for you not to have this.
