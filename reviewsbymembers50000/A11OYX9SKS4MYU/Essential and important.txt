 The epitome of classic NYC graffiti, Subway Art has become the veritable Bible for this particular subculture that has exploded around the United States, and also the world ( just to name a few: Germany, Iceland, Denmark,  Amsterdam, France, and Japan ). Contained herein are the masterpeices by  the Kings of the Line, Dondi ( R.I.P. ), Blade, Lee, Kase, Seen, Lady Pink  and a host of others. The pictures are large and there are some fold-outs,  capturing the SIZE and LENGTH of what are basically moving steel  masterpeices. There is a brief line or two about tags and throw-ups, but  the book concentrates more on top-to-bottoms, window-to-bottoms, and whole  cars. What is important about this book is its documentation of an up and  coming subculture that basically gave a big EFF YOU to an environment that  was comparable to some 3rd world countries by  creating an art that was not  only dangerous ( in its execution ), but creative, and beautiful. The  message that "we are here, and WE SHALL BOMB", in SPITE of  Transit Authoriy and the indifferent system which placed them there is  characteristic of adversity which spawns creativity ( the same adversity  that created Hip-Hop ) . An important peice of work, and a must for art  afficiandos and graf & hip-hop heads alike.
