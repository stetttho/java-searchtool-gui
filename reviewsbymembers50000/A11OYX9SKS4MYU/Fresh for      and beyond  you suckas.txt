 I've finally figured these guys out. I copped "Blow your Headphones" first, then "Very Mercanary"-- only when I finally got "Remedies" did I realize that these cats were a hip-hop jazz band, in the PUREST sense.  And with their sophmore effort, one can see the obvious growth and sharpening of musical skills that true artists experience with their second album( i.e., The Roots, Common, ATCQ ). More discplined tracks makes for pure listening pleasure; witness the abrupt but timely jump from "Ginger Jumps the Fence" ( puncutated with skidding sounds, no less ) to the laid back, jazzed out "Put it on Tape". Jazzy cuts with a noir feel to it best descibes this group, and they are a bit more lively then, say, DJ Cam's "Mad Blunted Jazz" ( due to, of course, the actual use of live instruments ). Another notable, "Mr. Chombee has the Flaw", almost goes to full-tilt Swing, but not quite. Most cuts include some great scratching and the tracks with What What are ludicrously head-nod inducing, though the one with Fabian and Big Ted try too hard, and this reveiwer recommends skippage on that one. This is one for the Beat Generation.
