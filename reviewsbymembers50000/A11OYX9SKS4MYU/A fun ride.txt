 I didn't know what to expect when I picked this up, but it had a cool cover, it was in japanese, and it had an unintelligible plot summary on the back cover-- hey, I couldn't resist. So I borrowed it  and watched it. And watched it with a group of friends. And watched it again with my brothers. Which made got me some late fees from Blockbuster, but what the hell, I had a lot of fun with this one so I didn't care. This is what moviemaking should be- creative, funny, and most importantly, cool. And man, this movie oozes with coolness, and a sense of humor that isn't so pronounced compared with other asian cinema. This is an independent, Yakuza, Samurai,  Zombie flick, and man, it all comes together under 40,000 dollars. If I tell any more, it wouldn't be as fun. Get this, watch it, and love it.
