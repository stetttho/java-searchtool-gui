 Uh oh, a negative review-- time to hit the NO button! But seriously folks, as an avid listener and consumer of "downtempo" music (hey, we have a name for it now! Time to make compilations and market the living daylights out of it), I have found that LemonJelly is in a word, bland. There's always been a crucial balance in creating loops and making the music interesting enough so as not to bore the listener, especially since there are no vocals accompanying said tracks. Some people hit it right on the button-- Fat Jon (of Five Deez), DJ Cam, Saru, Bonobo, etc. And some, like LemonJelly, don't. After the novelty of the first listen wears off, I noticed the sterile production and the tepid beats. Maybe it's because I judge downtempo music like all other types of sounds I listen to- Hip-Hop, Jazz, Neo-Soul-- that it should stand up to serious, multiple listens, rather than be regulated to background music (hey, you want wallpaper sounds, go get some MUZAK <tm>). LemonJelly doesn't have any real strong "boom-bip" sounds in its array, but employ a less forceful sonic tone that would work if it weren't so lacking in personality. On the upside, it does feature some cool liner art, indicative of electronic music's love with graphic arts and design, but unfortunately the cd case's dimension is a bit too large, making it the lone sheep in my CD collection ( off to the side, LJ! ). In summary, do yourself a favor and get Troublemakers' Doubts & Convictions, instead of this yawner.
