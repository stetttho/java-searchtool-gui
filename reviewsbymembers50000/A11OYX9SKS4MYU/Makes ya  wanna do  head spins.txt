 Representing the second most under-rated element of Hip-Hop ( the first being Graf Art ), The Official UK Breakdancing Championship delivers in spades. This video not only shows the heated nature of true hip-hop ( in  the same way MC's and Dj's battle, and Graf heads compete to be kings ), it  shows B-Boying is alive and thriving, not just within the confines of  America, but across the globe. The camera work, quick as it is, capture all  the movements of the various crews, though admittedly this approach seems  akward at first. There is enough moments of amazing acrobatic feats that  would make any hip-hopper get up off their chairs and say  "OOOOOHHHH! ", yet this video is far from perfect. The music  is dubbed over ( rather than use the original from the championship ), and  it leaves something to be desired. And the battle between Germany and  Denmark ,as it neared the end, starts to become over-stretched and tedious.  I would have given this a solid Three stars, but I had to add another for  that AMAZING battle between Japan and the U.S. ( a battle so furious that  even the DJ exclaims "now THAT was a BATTLE! "-- also, peep  veteran B-boy Crazy Legs and others on stage as they themselves are amazed  at the incredible exchange of body rockin' moves ). At any rate, walk,  don't run, and get yourself a copy of The Official UK Breakdance  Championship, a worthy addition to any Hip-Hop collection.
