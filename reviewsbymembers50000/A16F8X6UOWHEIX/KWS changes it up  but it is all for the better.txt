 Look, I know that there is going to be a lot of people out there that will not like where Kenny is heading with his music. That's the nature of the beast. I know that there will be a lot of people going "Kenny should just stick to the blues!" I own all of Kenny's cds, and love every one. I never did think he sounded much like Stevie Ray Vaughan, but a lot of people did. Now that he's changed, they're calling him a sellout. He can't win with those people. That being said, this is a great album, and it shows a more mature Kenny writing good songs and playing the guitar better than I've ever heard him. And, oh yeah: HE'S SINGING NOW! I love his voice, it's got that bluesy rock and roll grit about it, a la Lenny Kravitz. But Noah Hunt absolutely blows away Believe and Burdens, they are so intense. Noah has improved as well, and I'm glad to see he's sticking around. And on Let Go, Kenny now has something that he never had before in his songs: good harmonies. It sounds really good. On the musical part of it, I love where he's gone, partly because I am a fan of Lenny Kravitz (when he rocks out) and Kid Rock (especially his new one). And yes, Mr. Ritchie contributes finely to the song Spank, one of my favorites on the disc, along with Alive, Be Mine, Ain't Selling Out, and Believe. So, if you want to be a blues nazi, and not listen to anything besides blues, you won't like this one. If you are a little open to change, then this might satisfy you thirst for good music. Rock on, Kenny Wayne Shepherd.  ALL OF THESE THINGS THAT YOU WANT ME TO BE IT MEANS NOTHING TO ME AIN'T THAT SOMETHING AND WHEN I TRY IT'S A THORN IN MY SIDE AND IT'S PULLING ME DOWN I'M TELLING YOU I AIN'T SELLING OUT  And he's right!
