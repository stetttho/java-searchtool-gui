 Los Lonely Boys consist of the three Garza brothers: Henry on guitar, JoJo on bass, and Ringo on drums. This cd that they have made is one of the best cds to come out in a long time. It appeals to everyone. Just look at all of the positive reviews this album is getting on this site. They can't be pegged. When someone describes them, you'll get "Well, they sound like Stevie Ray, Santana, Ritchie Valens, Buddy Holly, and Willie Nelson all combined." That is the sign of a great band, when you can't paint them into a corner. From rockers like "Senorita" and "Real Emotions", to slower numbers like "More Than Love" and "Velvet Sky", this band mixes it up in a way that hasn't been done in years. The scary thing is, their hit single, "Heaven", is not even the best on the cd. That falls to either "Senorita", "Crazy Dream", or "Real Emotions." Just think what the Garza bros. have in store for us. It gives me goose bumps just thinking about it.
