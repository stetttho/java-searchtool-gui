 Buddy Guy is one of the last bluesmen left from a great era. He is what Jimi Hendrix would have been had Hendrix stuck strictly to the blues. While he may not think he is one of the best, he certainly deserves to be up there with Muddy, Howlin' Wolf, and BB. One reason is because of this album, definitely his best in the past 20 years, and definitely one of his top three. Here, Guy delivers what everyone expects of him: screaming guitar work and powerful, powerful vocals. There is no better blues singer in the business than BG, and as a guitar player his style is uniquely recognizable, and has no equal. The best tracks on this disc: I Smell Trouble (with Double Trouble guesting), Please Don't Drive Me Away, Love Her With A Feeling, Someone Else Is Steppin' In, and Don't Tell Me About The Blues. Those may be the best, but the disc as a whole does not have one weak track on it. I happen to like the clean sound of this album. If you can make it clean and keep the grit, that is awesome. Buddy did it with this album. However, nothing compares to seeing him live. He is one of the best live acts ever! Do yourself a favor: if he's ever in your neck of the woods, be sure to go see him. You won't regret it. LONG LIVE BUDDY GUY AND HIS POLKA DOT STRATOCASTER!
