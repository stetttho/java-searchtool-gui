 To the people who are absolutely tearing this album apart, saying that EC is not trying or is too laid back or didn't play this whole album by himself, you're being a little narrow-minded. Listen, this is Eric Clapton's favorite musician's work he is trying to do. He is trying to be very respectful to the Robert Johnson while, at the same time, trying to do it so that he sounds like Eric Clapton. Robert Johnson's work is typically laid-back, so Eric's tribute album will generally have the same vibe. Doing the whole album with just an acoustic guitar would be too reverential, in my opinion. Eric is also getting older. Do you people honestly think he is going to be the rip-snortin' guitar god all the time? No, he will be that guitar god a lot but he will also do deliciously played stuff like he played on "Unplugged" or this new cd. This album is not the greatest masterpiece of all-time, but it is a good one that keeps me happy and makes me respect Robert Johnson even more. For that, I am going to give it 5 stars. That and to hopefully offset a 1 star review that came from someone who thinks that all blues records should sound like they were recorded through a tape recorder.
