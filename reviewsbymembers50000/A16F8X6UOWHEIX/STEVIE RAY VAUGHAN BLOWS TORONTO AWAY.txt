 This performance captures Stevie Ray Vaughan & Double Trouble playing a smokin' set of tunes at Toronto's El Mocambo in late 1983. In this very intimate setting, Stevie, Whipper, and Tommy play a fantastic set, a type of performance that Stevie always gave. He starts out with two instrumentals, "Testify" and "So Excited" (my personal fave). Then he goes into Jimi Hendrix's classic "Voodoo Chile (Slight Return)". After burning through "Pride And Joy", he goes through Howlin' Wolf's "Tell Me" and Buddy Guy's "Mary Had A Little Lamb". Then, the show-stopper: "Texas Flood". Almost ten minutes of textbook blues-playing, culminating with him playing behind his back. Watching him play this song is like someone punching me in the gut. Then he plays behind his head for "Love Struck Baby" and does a great cover of John Lee Hooker's "Hug You, Squeeze You". Then he has his rock-star moment with Hendrix's "Third Stone From The Sun", beating his guitar, Number One, to death on the stage. It makes one realize why Number One looked the way it did. He encores with "Lenny", a performance so beautiful and so full of passion that it would melt the most hardened blues-purist's heart. SRV then concludes the performance with Lonnie Mack's "Wham!", then sets his guitar down, says "Thank you so very much, we got's to go", and he and Double Trouble leave the stage. This performance is so fiery and intense. There is no way to describe it. You'll just have to go out and buy it. GO AHEAD! BUY IT NOW! OR ELSE! LONG LIVE STEVIE RAY VAUGHAN!
