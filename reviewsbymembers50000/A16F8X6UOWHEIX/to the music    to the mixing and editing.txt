 God, I hate this remix! So does Billy, in fact, for those who are wondering who remixed this. In the December 04 edition of Vintage Guitar Magazine, Billy says, and I quote, "There were some odd releases previous to Chrome, Smoke, & BBQ that had been remastered and I think re-mixed." See, he doesn't like it that much either. But I can't give this thing less than 5 stars because the music does shine through. I can't let what the record company did ruin this for me. This is my favorite ZZ Top album, the perfect combination of great songs and blues instincts. I love everyone of their albums, but this one is my absolute favorite. From Francine to Just Got Paid to Bar-B-Q to Whiskey'n Mama (my personal favorite ZZ tune) these guys rock out and play with passion. I literally think Billy's strings are burning up when he plays slide on Just Got Paid and Whiskey'n Mama. It makes me realize how lucky we are to have them around today. They have not made one bad album ever! A couple of a okay ones, but they're still listenable! ZZ Top is one of my top five favorites ever, right along with Stevie Ray Vaughan, Eric Clapton, Buddy Guy, and Jimmie Vaughan. Here's my advice: buy this cd, but realize that it will sound way different than what was originally released, enjoy it for what it is, and pray to God that Warner will follow up the great box set Chrome, Smoke, and BBQ with the all of the original albums completely remastered. Peace, love, and ZZ Top!
