 Personally, I think the title of this cd is hilarious, not stupid or silly. Aerosmith has never taken itself seriously. This is a great cd that returns Aerosmith to the days of "Walk This Way" and "Train Kept A Rollin'", while keeping it all current. This is blues done Aerosmith style, which is to have fun with the songs instead of staying true to them. Aerosmith has sounded tired lately, and this is the shot in the arm that this great band sorely needed. While these are blues songs, I don't consider this a "blues album." It's a great rock album, though, one that is constantly in my rotation. If you love old-fashioned Aerosmith, you will absolutely love this. Highlights are "Road Runner", "Eyesight To The Blind", "Baby, Please Don't Go", "You Gotta Move", and "The Grind."
