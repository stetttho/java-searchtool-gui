 It's not my favorite movie, but I always enjoy it when I watch it. There's some good laughs, but the main reason I got it was because of Stevie Ray Vaughan's playing Pipeline with Dick Dale. Stevie's only movie appearance. I really like that version of Pipeline. So, a pretty good movie with Stevie Ray Vaughan. Makes for a good time.
