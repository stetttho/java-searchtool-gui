 Can ZZ Top make a bad album? That lil' ole band from Texas continues their consistency with "Mescalero." From the bar-band stomp of "Alley-Gator" to the hard rock of "Punk-Ass Boyfriend", this band continues to rock just as hard as they did back on "Tres Hombres." The way they recorded it was interesting as well, with lots of distortion. It makes you think at times that this is an LP, which works well for this cd. Even though this cd is great, there are a couple of clunkers that probably shouldn't have been thrown in, like "Stackin' Paper." This should have been an outstanding, 12 song, 5 star cd. Instead, it is a very good, 16 song, 4 star cd. This band does not get enough credit. Among the many rock bands or artists who started out in the 60s-70s, ZZ, Aerosmith, Eric Clapton, and Carlos Santana are the only ones I believe have kept a certain level of quality in their music. Hopefully, ZZ will rule the charts again. Oh, and 0 stars to RCA Records for doing a crappy job of promoting this cd.
