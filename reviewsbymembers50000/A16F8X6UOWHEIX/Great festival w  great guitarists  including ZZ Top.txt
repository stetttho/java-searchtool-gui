 Think of any guitar player alive, and it's more than likely they'll be on this dvd, although it is a shame that Jeff Beck was not included in this package. Like everyone else has said, there is some you'll like, and some you won't, but it encompasses every genre of music where the guitar holds a prominent position. My favorite performances were Sweet Home Chicago, Six Strings Down, and Rock Me Baby, along with anything else by Clapton in the festival, and ZZ Top.  By the way, don't listen to this idiot P. Duffy who basically says that Billy F. Gibbons of ZZ Top is not a great guitar player. He's a retard. Billy is great. Clapton thinks so, and that's all that matters.
