 Wow. As a young pup not that was not around during the 1970s, I can tell you just how much the music of years gone by, and the music from today that draws so much from years gone by, sounds so much better than a lot of the crap out today. People like Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and ZZ Top consistently hold up so much better than Britney Spears, Blink 182, and Good Charlotte. This great live album by Led Zeppelin proves just that. Here, they blister through a set of great classic songs. It plays to the band's strengths: Plant's howling, Page's fantastic fretwork and arrangements, JPJ's versatility, and Bonham's lightning and thunder. This set has given life to some songs, namely Stairway To Heaven and Rock And Roll, that have been worn out by Classic Rock radio stations spinning them three times a day. These live versions just have so much energy. The sound quality is also really great, especially for the time period. The drums can be heard very well. There's not as much hiss as you would normally hear. My only complaint would have to be Moby Dick. A great drum solo is always appreciated, but at 19 minutes? By the way, the extended medley versions of Dazed And Confused and Whole Lotta Love are awesome, and just kick my ass everytime. It's just that Moby Dick is too much for me to stomach, and I love longer songs like Skynyrd's Freebird and Stevie Ray Vaughan's 13 minute rendition of Voodoo Chile (Slight Return) on the Live At Montreux discs. How about Communication Breakdown instead? Or When The Levee Breaks? But that's a minor quibble. Overall, a great set from Zeppelin's best period, the first five albums. After that, they lost a bit, but were still great nonetheless. Hey, bands of today, instead of trying to be like Green Day or Nirvana, try to be like this band, or the other great bands of this time, like Hendrix, Cream, Pink Floyd, The Doors, ZZ Top, and Stevie Ray Vaughan. Be more like Los Lonely Boys, and the music will be a lot better.
