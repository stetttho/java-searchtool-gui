 "Chrome, Smoke, & BBQ" is ZZ Top's career-spanning box set, or at least the period they were with Warner Bros. This is a great set of tunes, and it is interesting to see them progress from album to album, song to song. And the sound is a hell of a lot better than what's on the albums. Man, those suck! I've only bought ZZ Top's post-WB cds, and I had "Eliminator" and "Afterburner", which weren't re-done for the dreaded "Six Pack", because they were released during that period. I was going to start on the old albums, figuring I would live with that sound. Then, this set came out, and I purchased it, and I won't touch the old albums until they are remastered. It just won't seem right. Now that they have ZZ's greatest songs sounding right, maybe Warner will get it together and remaster all of the old albums. ZZ also needs to stay away from the remixes. Why not put on "Dust My Broom" from "Deguello" or "Balinese" from "Fandango"? That would've been much better than the "Give It Up 2800 Mile Remix". Oh well, most of the material that is on this record is great, probably about 98%. This will just have to do for now. Until the remastered albums come out, THIS IS WORTH EVERY FREAKING PENNY! Long live the Reverend Billy G, the Dust Man, and the Beardless One!
