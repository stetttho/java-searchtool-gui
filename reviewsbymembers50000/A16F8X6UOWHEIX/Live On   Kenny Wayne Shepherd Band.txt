 This release, Kenny's third, finds him leaning towards the rock side of things. It seems as if Kenny is starting to become more mature on this record, playing more economically than on the first two cds, "Ledbetter Heights" and "Trouble Is...". Noah Hunt's vocals are very good on this record also. He makes the transition well from hard rockers like "In 2 Deep" to slower numbers like "Last Goodbye" to blues wailers like "Shotgun Blues". This whole record kicks from top to bottom; every song is great. People who say he still sounds like Stevie Ray Vaughan on this cd I don't agree with. Honestly, can anyone imagine Stevie doing a song like "In 2 Deep"? I think Kenny's songwriting and guitar playing drastically improved on this record. Maybe now he's finally ready to step out of Stevie Ray's shadow when his new album drops in the first week of September. Highlights are the hard rocking "In 2 Deep", the Skynyrd-meets-Robert Johnson "Was", the ballad "Last Goodbye" and the absolutely beautiful, Grammy-nominated "Electric Lullaby".
