 You know, Los Lonely Boys's self-titled platinum debut is a great album, one that harkens back to the days of Stevie Ray Vaughan and Duane Allman. But as great as that album is, this is where LLB does their best: in front of their loyal and rapid Loopies and Lonlies. Here, we find the boys playing in front of 25,000 people in their musical hometown, Austin, Texas, during the SXSW festival. They play a great set, and are full of energy. Even on the slower songs, it makes you nod your head. This shows that they are truly one of the best bands to come out in the new millenium. Also, the bonus features are really hilarious and interesting. From Henry's Sean Connery impression to Ringo's meeting of his third-grade teacher, they continue to entertain, even without the instruments. This band is going to be a band that is around for a long time to come. (...)
