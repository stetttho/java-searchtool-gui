 First of all, I loved Me & Mr. J. But still, I thought he could've done a better job, and he rectifies that by releasing "Sessions For Robert J." Done after the band had been touring for a while, the band is concise they jam together great. There are even some solo accoustic performances by Clapton in the same hotel room where Robert Johnson recorded his historic recordings back in the mid '30s. Clapton has never sounded better than he does here. His guitar playing has consistently improved over the years, and so has his singing. The band is tight, and they jam with ease. I've been spinning this cd nonstop since I got it. I really like the versions of Sweet Home Chicago and If I Had Possession Over Judgement Day. This album just seems to be more of a jam-type session, like From The Cradle. And it's all the better for it.  Now, I must take an opportunity to mention Clapton's second guitar player. Many people have asked me who this guy was. His name is Doyle Bramhall II. Y'all may have heard that name before. His dad, Doyle Bramhall Sr., helped write many songs with the late, great Stevie Ray Vaughan, particularly hits like Tightrope, The House Is Rockin', and Telephone Song. Doyle II has also played with Stevie's band Double Trouble and singer/guitarist Charlie Sexton in a band called the Arc Angels, which put out an outstanding cd in the early 1990s. Clearly, Doyle has the lineage to be great, and he is! Be sure to check out his cds: Jellycream and Welcome. You won't be disappointed. He's as good a songwriter as he is a guitar player. Marry You and I Wanna Be, which are from Clapton's and B.B. King's great collaboration Riding With The King, are his songs. You can hear them on Jellycream. Remember: if it's good enough for Clapton, it's good enough for you.
