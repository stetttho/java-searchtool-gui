 Saying that XXX is ZZ Top's worst album is very ironic, for when someone says that this is a band's worst album, they usually hate it. But ZZ Top is a different story. Through their amazing ability to remain consistent, they have produced their worst album, but still so good that one comes back for repeated listens. Many bands would kill to have this record be their best. The songs aren't on a level with La Grange or Tush or something like that, except for a couple: Poke Chop Sandwich and Crucifixx a Flatt. I only skip over three of these songs: MAde Into A Movie, Dreadmonboogaloo, and Belt Buckle, and Belt Buckle is growing on me. The rest of them are good and are worth repeat listens. So, this is probably the greatest worst album ever produced! Leave it to ZZ Top to do that. ZZ Top's albums are grouped into three areas, those of absolute brilliance, those of greatness, and those of goodness. Absolute brilliance goes to Tres Hombres, Fandango!, Deguello, Eliminator, and Rhythmeen. Greatness goes to Rio Grande Mud, Tejas, Afterburner, Recycler, Antenna, and Mescalero. And goodness goes to ZZ Top's First Album, El Loco, and XXX. Point is, even when ZZ Top makes a bad album, it is still good enough to listen to. How many bands can you say that about. Remember these two rules when considering what to buy from ZZ Top:  1.Always trust the Top 2.NEVER EVER BREAK RULE #1!
