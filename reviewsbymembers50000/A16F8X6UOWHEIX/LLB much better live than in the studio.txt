 Los Lonely Boys, like Stevie Ray Vaughan and Carlos Santana before them, can be great in the studio, but it's live on stage where they truly shine. What better way to prove it than releasing Live At The Fillmore, recorded in October of last year at the historic San Francisco concert hall. The band rips through many selections from its debut album, including Crazy Dream, Dime Mi Amor, and Real Emotions, and also throws on three songs not on the debut: Man To Beat, which showcases Henry's extraordinary harmonica talents, and covers of Ritchie Valen's La Bamba and War's Cisco Kid. Of note is also that Reese Wynans, the legendary keyboard player for Stevie Ray Vaughan's band Double Trouble, guests on keyboards for the whole show, and it is a welcome addition, because this guy is one of the greats of the ivories. Henry cooks it on the six string, especially on the Santana-inspired Onda, Jojo adds fills and keeps the beat, and Ringo pounds the hell out of the skins. And the harmonies on this cd are beautiful. The accoustics of the Fillmore really do add a layer to their already great harmonies. This can especially be heard on the acapella version of More Than Love and the smash hit Heaven. Overall, this is a great live cd, and one that I know I'll be listening to a long time.   IF YOU LONELIES AND LOOPIES LIKE LIVE TEXICAN ROCK AND ROLL, GIVE ME A HELL YEAH! LLB FOREVER!
