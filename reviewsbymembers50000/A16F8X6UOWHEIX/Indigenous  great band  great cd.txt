 Indigenous's new self-titled cd is one of my absolute favorites. Mato is a great guitar player, and the songs on this cd show that the band is evolving, writing better tunes and playing with a confidence that only comes from experience. Most of the songs are hard rocking blues, with a couple of slower numbers thrown in for good measure. The sound on this record is very raw and live, like they just played the songs and released them without any mixing. Highlights are "C'mon Suzie", "You Turn My World Around", "I'm Still Here", "Movin' On", and a smoking cover of Jimmy Reed's "Shame, Shame, Shame".
