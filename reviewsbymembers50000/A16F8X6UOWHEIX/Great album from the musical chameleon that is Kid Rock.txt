 What is Kid Rock? A rapper? A country singer? A bluesman? An American Stoned Pimp? As Kid says on "I Am", "You'll never put a finger on me." However, on his newest self-titled offering, he stays away from being the hardcore rapper quite often. Only twice on this album does he rap, "Intro" and "Hillbilly Stomp", which really isn't a rap song, with its backwoods beat and Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top guesting on vocals. Due to his great friend and collaborator Hank Williams, Jr.'s influence, he has gone the country/blues/classic rock route, drawing from Lynyrd Skynyrd, ZZ Top, Hank, George Jones, and Bob Seger. The guests reflect this also. Along with the Right Reverend Billy G, there is Hank Jr. on "Cadillac Pussy" and blues-rocker Kenny Wayne Shepherd giving some absolutely hardcore blues licks to "Black Bob." While his rap-rock songs were very good, this style seems to fit him like a glove. This album is one of the better albums to come out in a long time, but is getting no love from the record-buying public, where when you try to do different things instead of following the formula, you will get slammed. It's a darn shame. Because Kid Rock is one of the great musicians out there today. Artists like him are one in a million and should be held as such.
