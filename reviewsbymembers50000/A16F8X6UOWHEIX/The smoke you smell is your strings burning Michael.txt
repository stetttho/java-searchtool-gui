 Wow! Michael Burks is quite a talent. And this cd has quickly become one of my favorites. Great songs, great guitar playing, and great singing from this blues beast. Here he gets funky with songs like "One More Chance", just plain rocks out with songs like "All Your Affection Is Gone," and slows it down with songs like "Time I Came In Out Of The Rain." Michael's voice reminds me so much of Albert King's, but it's not in a copying sort of way, it's just that he has that honey and smoke vocal style. And on the the way it's recorded: you know, things change. The recording equipment around today is just a lot better. It captures things more clearly. I really like the sound of this album, and it's one I know I'll be listening to for a long time.
