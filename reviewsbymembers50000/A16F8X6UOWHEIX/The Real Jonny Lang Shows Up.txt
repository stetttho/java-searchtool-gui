 For his first two albums, Jonny Lang amazed us with great guitar playing and soulful singing. One problem though: on "Lie To Me" he wrote only two songs, on "Wander This World", four. With "Long Time Coming", we see Jonny writing his own music, with 12 of the 15 songs his own. There is less Stevie Ray Vaughan and more Stevie Wonder, with more funk and soul than blues. He lays off the guitar solos, which was a slight disappointment to me, but the songs are good, which keeps me satisfied. And his voice has gone from being excellent to being one of the best in the business; just soulful and powerful. I always thought out of all the young guitar players who came out that were being compared to Stevie Ray Vaughan, Jonny deserved it the least. Not because of being less talent (certainly not the case!), but because he seemed to be coming from a different place. The only reason that I am not giving this cd 5 stars is because of a lack of guitar solos, because I saw Jonny live doing these songs, with solos, and they kicked absolute a**, and the songs were better because of it. This is the real Jonny Lang, whether you like it or not. Take it or leave it. Personally, I'll take it.
