 This biography on Stevie Ray Vaughan is the best I have seen so far. To me, it is the defining biography until Dan Forte comes out with the "official" bio. It shows that while many view Stevie as a god, and thought that he was this mystical figure, it shows that he was just an average joe, who happened to have extraordinary abilities. The most interesting part of the book to me is when the fan presents him with a rubbing of Hendrix's gravestone, and he tells the fan to get rid of it, saying that it is too creepy. This book also shows how Stevie became who he was, and how the insecurities that he had enabled him to become the great guitar player that he was. I've reread this book 6 times since I owned it. It's like my favorite movie: I just keep going back to it again and again. Rave On Stevie Ray, may you rest in peace, and may you play a hell of a jam with Hendrix and Albert King in that Great Gig In The Sky.
