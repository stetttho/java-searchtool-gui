 I don't know how you can read one of Joan Druett's books and not want to be the character.  I often wonder at the scope of it all - the huge ocean and traveling from point of land to point of land but Joan Druett brings it all to you in this story.  Her name is always on my mind when I enter any bookstore looking for books.
