 Christina Skye has such a wonderful combination in all her books - mystery, supernatural (ESP, ghosts, visions, etc.), and romance.  This story goes to an earlier time; but, yet, parallels the present, too.  I simply cannot put down her books.  The story combined with the every present mystery keeps me reading until the very end.  I look forward to every Draycott Abbey book out there.  You will too!
