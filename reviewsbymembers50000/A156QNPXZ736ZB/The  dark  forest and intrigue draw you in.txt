 This is the first book by Marsha Canham that I read.  I have every one of her books.  I couldn't wait to read the second and, then, the third - The Last Arrow.  So many possibilities present themselves as to who these men are in the forest - could it be Robin Hood and his merry men?  All I wanted to do was read on to find out.  Marsha Canham is also in my list of "Top Five Authors".
