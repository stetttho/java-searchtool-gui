 I love time travel and history at the same time.  This is such a good example of both.  I was drawn into the history of her story. I even did more research on the flood after reading her book.  In time travel, it always adds more interest when they go back and forth from the future.  The items that become important to them (that they take back with them to the past) is always interesting.
