 I love Jill Barnett's ability to make me laugh out loud when I am reading her stories.  She places such unusual people together in such hilarious circumstances you can't put her book down.  I am always searching for her latest book when I'm in a bookstore.  Her name is one I always remember with a smile (or should I say, chuckle) when looking through the romance book section.
