 The Last Arrow follows Through a Dark Mist and In the Shadow of Midnight.  Again, the forest is always in the background along with the "dark" and mysterious characters.  I loved the first encounter of Brenna and Griffin - her "ability" is so wonderful and so deliciously astounding to all the male population (except, of course, her own family).  I did do a lot of crying while reading this marvelous tale of "Robin Hood" and the "could have beens" of such a fantastic era of history.  Yes, I could believe in Robin Hood with Marsha Canham's ability to tell the story.
