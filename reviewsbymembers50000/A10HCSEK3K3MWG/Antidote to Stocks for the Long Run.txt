 Shiller explains why the incredible 225% increase in the Dow Jones Industrial Average from the beginning of 1994 through the end of 1999 was unsustainable: "as a rule and on average, years with low price-earnings ratios have been followed by high returns, and years with high price-earnings ratios have been followed by low or negative returns." Writing in 2000 when the price-earnings ratio on the S&P500 was nearly 45, compared to a long-run average of about 20, Shiller was preparing us for a bursting of the stock-price bubble. His message was sobering and prescient then as well as good education now. Caution: the reader will have to whack through thickets of details in Chapter 1 such as "The average real return in the stock market (including dividends) was -2.6% a year for the five years following January 1966, -1.8% a year for the next ten years, -0.5% a year for the next fifteen years, and 1.9% a year for the next twenty years." In Part 3: Psychological Factors, Shiller outlines principles of behavioral finance. For example, past prices and stories help form people's views of the stock market. He reviews classic experiments in psychology, which documented the significance of peer pressure and trust in experts. Shiller's interpretation is that people take uncritically what experts on the stock market offer, presumably that stock prices will continue to rise, which encourages them to be overconfident. The author puts forth a good explanation of efficient markets theory but applies much criticism. He proclaims: "I see no reason to doubt the thesis that smarter people will, in the long run, tend to do better at investing." Reading and understanding Irrational Exuberance will help put the individual investor in the company of those "smarter people."
