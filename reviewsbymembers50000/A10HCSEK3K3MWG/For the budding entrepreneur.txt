 Hess intends to turn young people onto economic freedom and inspire them to be entrepreneurs. One way he does this is by engaging the reader in some soul searching so that the youngster may consider whether he is the adventurous type that might want to start a business or the risk-averse type that might prefer to work for someone else, or worse, blame others for what he doesn't have. The reader will encounter a positive attitude toward work. Hess writes about various things a kid might want to work for. "But the fact that you can work", he proclaims, "is one of the good things about living in a country as free as ours."    The book is not a collection of specific projects that kids can do for fun and maybe earn a few bucks from adults who have encouragement or charity in mind. In fact the author devotes a few pages to explaining why a lemonade stand might be "something that would teach a bad lesson rather than a good one for a kid who wants to start a business." In a chapter addressed to parents, Hess also states that "This is not a book to recommend that the only impulse to nurture in a young person is the specific impulse to make money." Homeschoolers might find the book useful. "The truth of the matter," says Hess, "is that the main burden of getting a youngster to think about economics as something important, real, and lively is going to have to be a family project, not a school one."
