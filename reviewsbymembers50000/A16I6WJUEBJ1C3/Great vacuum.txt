 I am really impressed with this vacuum.  I had an old Dirt Devil vacuum that I used for stairs and the new Eureka is so much more effective.  I could not believe the amount of dirt and cat hair that came out of the carpeting with the Eureka, even on the main carpet areas that I regularly use the big vacuum on.  Great for upholstery, too.  It seems overall that the designers of this vacuum actually thought about customer needs and wants.  The only drawback is that is is a bit heavy.
