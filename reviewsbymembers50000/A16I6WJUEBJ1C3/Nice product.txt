 I have the mini version of this salad spinner.  I would not actually use the term "mini" to describe it, since it does hold a lot of lettuce.  It will hold a whole small head of leaf lettuce (chopped, of course) when packed full, which makes enough for two big plates of salad (or probably 4 small side salads).  I like that it is smaller in size (not clumsy or hard to handle, takes minimal storage space), has nonskid bottom, really dries lettuce well, is easy to operate and even has a brake to stop the spinning.  I just rinse it off when done (easy for quick weeknight dinners).  I like the operation of this product (push down) better than the large Zyliss spinner that I own that has a pull-string.  The small Oxo spinner is also great for drying blueberries.
