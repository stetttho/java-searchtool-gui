 This is a great cooling rack.  It is very heavy-duty and solid - you could not flex or bend it if you tried.  It is large enough to hold a bunch of cookies, about two cookie sheets full.  The cross-wires are flat, not round, so the cookies lie more flat and it is easier to get them on and off the rack with a spatula.  The wires are spaced so that cookies do not fall through.  I'm not sure how important nonstick is for a cooling rack, but I have had no problems with sticking.  The rack is easy to wash.  I purchased another of these Calphalon cooling racks to use for my holiday baking marathon and am throwing out my previous rack since it seems flimsy in comparison.
