 I bought this chalk line since we were doing a major reroofing project and needed to snap every other row to keep things straight.  For the first part of the roof, we used a cheap aluminum chalk line with cotton string and had to change the string every so often because it frayed.  Also, the string would get stuck inside the box and be difficult to pull out (it even broke once).  The new Tajima had no such problems.  It does take a little while to get used to the difference in string - the Tajima nylon string is thinner and stretchier than the cheap line.  But it makes fine, distinct lines.  Also, the Tajima blue chalk seems to be finer than standard blue chalk and it makes a sharp line and probably aids in the ease of pulling the string.  The string recoils fast when you wind it up.  The plastic-covered metal end on the string where you attach it to things works well.  This tool seems to hold a lot of chalk (or maybe uses less per snap), so it doesn't need refilling very often.  It also looks good - a pretty red color but the case does scratch a bit when dropped from the second story and the paint has rubbed off at the edges from frequent use.  Overall, we have been very satisfied with the Tajima Chalk-Rite.
