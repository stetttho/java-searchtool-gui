 This is a very high quality pan.  It is heavy and has excellent nonstick qualities, both inside and out.  It washes beautifully due to the nonstick surface.  Although it is cast aluminum, this pan reminds me a bit of cast iron in that it needs a little time to heat up due to its thickness.  It is great for making a frittata, pan of fresh hashbrowns or potstickers.  This pan can go into the oven to finish cooking or broiling to brown the top of a dish, for instance melting cheese on the top of a frittata.  Another thing I like about this pan and that is a requirement for me in any cookware, is the lack of rivets inside the pan to attach the handle.  In pans with rivets, food always gets stuck in the rivets making it difficult to clean.  All of the Look cookware has handles attached on the outside of the pan, making it easy to clean and stir/scrape food while cooking.    I also have the glass cover for this pan due to an order mixup with a non-Amazon company.  If I had to purchase it over again, I would definitely buy Look brand but would have bought a size of fry pan that would have a single cover that could fit multiple pans (for instance, I have the 12" Stir Fry pan and also love that pan).
