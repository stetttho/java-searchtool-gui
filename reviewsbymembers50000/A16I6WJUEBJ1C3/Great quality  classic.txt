 I have had this spice rack for over 12 years.  It was expensive at the time (and still is).  It is top quality and worth every penny.  JK Adams is a Vermont company that makes great products - beautiful maple wood and smooth ball-bearing turntable.  The spice labels are made of a plastic and wipe off easily.  The 32 bottle size allows for a nice assortment of spices.  I purchase my spices in bulk at my local food co-op/natural foods store - they are much cheaper and so fresh. This rack sits on my counter and often gets compliments from visitors.  I saw some cheap racks similar to this one in a discount store and they are a joke in comparison to this one.
