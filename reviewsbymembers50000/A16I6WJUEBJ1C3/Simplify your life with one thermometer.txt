 This thermometer works fine for all my kitchen tasks.  I wanted one thermometer to use for everything - yeast, yogurt, candy, meat, and this does the job.  Pluses: seems to be accurate, waterproof (easy to wash), auto shut-off, wide temperature range, small for easy storage.  Minuses: it does take several seconds to read the final temp, the on-off button is kind of small, cannot be left in the oven (in a turkey, for example).  Overall, I give it 5 stars.
