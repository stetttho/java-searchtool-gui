 The other reviews were right on that this pressure cooker is an awesome appliance!!!  It is miles ahead of my stovetop PC, which was a pain to use. I have only used my new PC once so far, to make risotto.  I used the "Brown" function to brown onions before adding the rest of the ingredients.  I was so impressed with the speed and nice browning.  It worked much better than my gas cooktop -- I am considering using the PC for sauteing alone. Then I added the arborio, a bunch of chopped veggies (portobello mushrooms, red peppers and asparagus), salt and water and started the PC.  The risotto was done in 7 min, just as expected.  Added the requisite parmesan and dinner was served.  The risotto tasted yummy!   The nonstick interior is great -- the sticky risotto residue just washed right out.  Much easier than cleaning pots and pans or oven casseroles. I *highly* recommend this pressure cooker -- it is a great time saver for everyone's busy lives.  I can't wait to use it for other recipes.
