 This is a very good bread machine.  It is great for making pizza dough in 45 min.  As for bread, when I have left it unattended, it has burned a couple of loaves of bread, even on Light Crust cycle and that is why I am rating it as 4 stars.  I find that I have to remove the bread a little early from the baking cycle and then it turns out great!  I have found that the Basic Rapid Bake cycle (1hr 55min) works for most loaves, including 50% whole wheat.  The 4 to 5 hr cycles are too long for me.  I use SAF Perfect Rise yeast (red package) and get excellent, consistent results versus the other well-known brands.  Check out the King Arthur flour website for some great recipes.
