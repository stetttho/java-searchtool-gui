 I make a lot of muffins and bought this pan to replace an older one made of thin aluminum.  I have also tried nonstick steel pans in the past but have not been happy with them since they take a long time to heat up in the oven, tend to burn things due to a very dark finish and may even rust if water collects in the turned over edges.    The T-fal Patisserie pan is excellent quality, very heavy aluminum, with a light gray finish.  It has slightly larger muffin cups than my previous pan.  It is nonstick but still needs a generous amount of nonstick cooking spray to avoid sticking.  This may lessen once the pan becomes more seasoned with use (I did season before use, as directed).  I baked several batches of muffins and all turned out perfect -- no burning and came right out when nonstick spray was used.  I plan to buy another T-fal pan so that I can make multiple batches in the same session.  Great quality for the money!  UPDATED 12/21/05: I'm sorry to say, I want to change my rating of this pan to 0 stars (system will not let me change the star rating).  This muffin pan is a piece of junk.  It was great at first, but after I used it for awhile, the nonstick coating became totally non-functional.  I did not notice any peeling of the coating, as another reviewer stated.  Even with liberal spraying with nonstick cooking spray, muffins now stick to the pan like crazy!  The last time I used it, I even had a hard time cleaning off the stuck muffin debris after soaking in hot soapy water and scrubbing with a green Scotchbrite!  This pan will be leaving my house ASAP.  Do not buy this pan!
