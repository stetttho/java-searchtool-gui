 I was quite disappointed in the performance of this pan.  I lightly sprayed it with nonstick cooking spray but my low-fat muffins still stuck like crazy to the pan -- I was expecting the pan to be nonstick since it is silicone.  Also, the muffins baked very unevenly in the pan, something that I have not experienced with metal bakeware.  Maybe a lower baking temperature is necessary. In any case, this is both my first and last purchase of silicone bakeware.
