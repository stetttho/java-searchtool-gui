 This pan is really nice.  It is made of very thick aluminum with a nonstick coating.  The edges of the pan are continuous with the rest of the pan, not folded over like some steel pans, so this pan is very easy to clean.  Baked goods turn out great in this aluminum pan compared to nonstick steel or "aluminized steel" pans.  The chocolate cake I baked for Mother's Day turned out perfectly!  Exceptional quality, especially at this price!
