 This waffle maker is a great value for the price.  I have made waffles several times and never had a problem with sticking.  It is important not to open the waffle maker early to check the doneness of the waffles - that might be why other reviewers had a sticking problem.  The recipes I made used only 2 Tbsp oil and there was no sticking.  My only complaint is that batter will run out the back if the batter is not evenly spread over the grids or too much is used (I agree to use less than the specified 1/2 c).  I have made recipes both where the eggs are mixed in the batter and those where the whites are whipped separately and then folded in.  The latter case resulted in very light waffles - crunchy on the outside and light and tender on the inside.  The former case resulted in still excellent tasting waffles with a minimum of work.    I found that a time of 6-7 min worked fine for waffle doneness - leave in longer if you like very crispy waffles.  I set my timer for 6 min then let them cook just slightly longer.  I personally like the waffle stix - easy to eat and fun for adults as well as kids!  They heat up well in the toaster for waffles anytime.
