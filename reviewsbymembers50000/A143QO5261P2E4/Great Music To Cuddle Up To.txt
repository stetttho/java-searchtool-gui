 What an amazing little album.  What an amazing little surprise. I'm not your typical "Beach Boys" fan- as a matter of fact, this album was kind of forced on me by my over zealous husband. I'm glad he did.  I  can't believe what a friendly, warm, soothing little record this is.   I  play it at home after everyone has left for the day and it's just me and  the music.  What a comforting little opus Brian and his friends have  created. Not at all what you'd expect.  The songs are so pretty and  light.  I reccomend this to everyone.  It has become my very favorite  Cd. Highlights are the title track, "Little Bird" and  "Busy Doin' Nothin'".  What a far cry from "Fun, Fun,  Fun"!  Brian has incorporated a Bossa-Nova beat into some of the  songs, while a couple others are flat-out waltzes!  And they all work!   They're all incorporated into this one, fantastic, albeit short, gem of an  album. I don't mean to gush, I just want to share this wonderful nugget  with everyone.
