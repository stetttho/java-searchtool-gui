 B.J. Thomas probably has more "greatest hits"compilations than any other artist on this plannet! And one of thebiggest problems is, a lot of his "hits" are re-recorded. There's also the BIG problem of the same songs being duplicated from compilation to compilation. Not so in this marvelous collection.  I really don't know where else you can get a lot of the country classics included on this disk.  The tracks were all licensed from Columbia and highlight his years on the label as a country hitmaker.  The albums these tracks were culled from have long been out of print, and the other collections have not been able to access licensing.  (Or maybe it was too expensive.)  And for some reason, many of these songs, Bj has not chosen to re-record. There's no filler here.  Every track is either a bona fide hit or a classic album track. B.J. has never been in better voice.  This collection is well worth the price. Highlights include "Whatever Happened To Old Fashioned Love", "Two Car Garage" and "Night Life". Excellent liner notes as well.  I always enjoy reading about what I'm hearing, as knowing the history behind the recording always enhances the listening experience for me a lot. Perfect music to cuddle up with, or go to sleep by, too!  (That's a compliment, by the way) I highly recommend this Cd.
