 I didn't expect much when I picked up this book- I got a whole lot more than I bargained for. Larry Singleton is a strange fellow.  I really liked how the book contained chapter after chapter of direct quotes taken  from police interviews.  The subject is grisly, but the cat and mouse game  is hilarious.  Larry trips himself up with lie after lie, time after time.    You almost feel sorry for him. The book maintains a healthy balance,  however, as we feel the pain and gain a lot of empathy, and sympathy, for  his victims- especially his first. This was a fast read.  I couldn't put  it down. I was afraid, at first, the book might be too graphic- and too  morbid- but it wasn't.  It was well written and a real page turner.
