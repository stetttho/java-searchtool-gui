 What an interesting guy.  It has been said, even by his daughter Carnie, that it is amazing that he is the sole living Wilson brother.  He has had a history of mental, drug and weight problems and emerged virtually  unscathed. You just want to reach out and hug this big teddy bear of a  man.  This gentle biography is a fascinating look at a true American  original.   This is one of the more comprehensive of the  "Biography" series- and it is a real plus to have access to the  man himself. Brian is so raw and honest- what an impressive, wonderful  man.   This documentary does him justice.
