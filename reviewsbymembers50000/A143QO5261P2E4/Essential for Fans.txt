 Essential for fans, not so essential for non-fans. Some of the previously unreleased material has been unreleased for a reason- it's just not as good as what's already out there. With the exception of  "Brian is Back", mainly by Mike Love, there is not much here for  the non fan. It's all good, a treasure chest for fanatics, but other  compilations are better. On the plus side, there's a lot of music on this  single disk- and none of it is bad.  It's better than mediocre, even.  It's  just that some of the "alternate" takes vary so little from the  original, and none are better, that the biggest question is- why?  The  answer: for the long time fans.
