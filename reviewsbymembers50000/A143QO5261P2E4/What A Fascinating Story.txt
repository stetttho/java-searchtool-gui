 Oh my Gosh!  What Dave Pelzer has been through. After reading this book, I went out and bought ten more copies to give away.  What I was giving away was hope!  That Mr. Pelzer could go through what he did and come back as  strong as he is is nothing short of a miracle.  Dave shares his whole  life with us and holds nothing back! While some of it is graphic and hard  to read, it is ultimately a story of triumph. The book is not an easy  read- I had to literally put the book down several times to wipe away the  tears- but I believe I am a better person for having read the book. It  puts things into perspective.  God bless you, Mr. Pelzer.  You are loved.
