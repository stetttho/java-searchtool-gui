 "Stephen Lives" is a misnomer.  Stephen doesn't live.  Stephen is dead.  He hung himself from a tree not far from his house. Stephen does live, however, in the mind of his mother, who wrote this book, but  claims "Stephen" dictated the words to her from the  afterlife. If read, and then re-read, several things become very  apparant.  The biggest thing is that I belive the author is trying to come  to terms with her son's suicide by beliving he is still with her, that  death is painless, that the afterlife is wonderful and that his death was  not her fault. Grief and guilt will do strange things to a person.   I  do not reccomend this book as it depicts Stephen's death as a triumph- and  seems to be geared for parents with depressed children as a book to pass  on. That, I believe, would be a mistake.
