 Anne has the way of weaving a story! And what a story this is!  Getting inside the head of a mother who "sacrifices" her small children to win back the heart of a lover- she has done the impossible.   We hate  the mother, we understand the mother, we cry for the mother, we despise the  mother...  Anne Rule has made this murderess so three dimensional.  We can  somehow understand things we never thought we could with Anne as the  teacher. And we are taught without even knowing it.  That's a gift, Anne.
