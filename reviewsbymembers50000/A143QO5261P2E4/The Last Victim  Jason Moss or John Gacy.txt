 Jason- I don't belive you were afraid of John Gacy.  I don't believe a lot of your book.  It just doen't ring true.  I believe you victimized Joh Gacy.  Which is why I'm giving this book a five star review. I may not  believe you, Jason, but your book was a quick and entertaining read. But,  I believe it was also a work of fiction. By the way, your  "scary" meeeting with Mr. Gacy had me rolling on the floor.
