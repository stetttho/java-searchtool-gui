 This book is a fascinating read!  I'm on my third go round.  Idon't think this book is going to convince anybody that some of thekillers in the book are innocent.  Conversely, I think it shows the killers in their true light- manipulative con artists who have no remorse and belong right where they are. How they spend their time, the thoughts that go through their heads- this is amazing stuff. What we're getting here is the real thing- straight from the killers themselves. I think those who criticize the books don't give the average readers enough credit.  If the average person could truly be swayed by the killer's arguments of innocence (only a handfull admit guilt), then we would be in trouble. However,the killers aren't that clever and the average reader isn't that stupid. Hats off to Jenny on an astounding effort her first time around. I love this book.  My copy is so dog-eared, I think I'll get another.I like the puzzle of figuringout what she said by the content of her replies. And, yes, I believe Jenny was a little manipulative too in her dealings with the killers.  Good for you, Jenny.  Dear Serial Killers- how did it feel?   END
