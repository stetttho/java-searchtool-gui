 A smug, gum chewing Mike Love leads the band in a very short set of uninspired versions of Beach Boy songs. Their set is very short- so why the inclusion of "Papa-Ooo-Mow-Mow", "Long Tall Texan"  and "Hawaii"? Nowhere is the "genius" of Brian Wilson  evident.  Nowhere are the beautiful Beach Boy harmonies.  The only thing in  abundance on this video is Mike Love's hamminess. This is still a must  for the hardcore fan.  And it is goofy fun for people longing for the 60's.    When all is said and done, there are a few good points.  Brian before  his breakdown, Mike Love strutting around like a proud peacock- something  tells me he's putting us all on and this is all done with a wink and tongue  firmly in cheek- and hearing the group without benefit of a back up band.   It is impressive that they can play their own instruments and get away with  it. Nice time capsule.  Sadly uninspired.  Too short.  Needs a better  song selection. I'm glad I got it, but hust barely.
