 This set is very comprehensive, very enjoyable and very good. I never knew that The Grass Roots were so prolific!  Every time there was a new song, I said "Hey!  I know that song!", with a great big smile on  my face. The titles are foolers.  Most people are familiar with  "TempTation Eyes" and "Sooner Or Later"- but songs like  "The River Is Wide" and "Wait A Million years"- I  didn't know I knew them intil I heard them again.  Very hook-heavy!  I sang  myself hoarse singing along with this compilation! This stuff is great.   A little bit folk, a little bit rock, a little bit pop. The anthology is  worth the price just for the inclusion of "Mamacita"- one song I  HADN'T heard vefore, but haven't stopped playing since. This is the most  played compilation in my collection!
