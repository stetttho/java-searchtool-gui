 Much has been written about this book being so steeped in Western classical music that people who aren't familiar with such music will find the book boring or trite. That's not the case. True, there are long  passages where the musicians talk in musical jargon. Seth makes no attempt  to explain it in any way to the reader; that's the way they talk, and  that's what you would have heard if you dropped into the conversation.  Skimming over such passages does not detract from the rest of the book,  which is lyrical and well written.
