 Richard Gordon, author of "Doctor in the House" and other books in the "Doctor" series, turns to medical history here. But unlike most other books that usually focus on the triumphs of medicine, this one  is a catalog of disasters. It is a potpourri of quirky anecdotes. You can  read about such items as the London surgeon Robert Liston who prided  himself on being quick and amputated a leg under 2 1/2 minutes (and the  fingers of his assistant as well), about Sir William Lane who was so  obsessed with constipation that he began to remove his patients' large  intestines the way others removed appendixes, and how Britain developed an  anthrax bomb to combat Hitler's Germany. But while many anecdotes  themselves make for hilarious or shocking reading, after a while they begin  to grate a bit. Although grouped into sections, there does not seem a  strong unifying thread. Perhaps the book might have more appeal if read in  installments rather than from cover to cover.
