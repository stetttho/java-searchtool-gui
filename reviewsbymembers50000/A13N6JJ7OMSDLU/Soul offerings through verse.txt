 I have heard it said that reading Tagore in translation is like looking at a beautiful piece of embroidery from the wrong side of the cloth. But those who do not know Bengali must rely on translations, and in the case of  "Gitanjali", Tagore himself has translated his verses into  English. This is poetry that evokes all the feelings that make us human,  such as love, devotion, faith and aspirations for that which is noble. The  lines have to be absorbed, reflected upon, and at the end, we become all  the better for it. One can only wonder how much more touching the verses  must sound in Bengali.
