 This is different from the usual kind of book on Indian history in that it goes beyond a listing of dates and a narrative of events. The author, veteran journalist and scholar Rajmohan Gandhi (incidentally, also a  grandson of Mahatma Gandhi) holds that two dominant threads run through  Indian history -- revenge and reconciliation. He cites the Mahabharata (the  ancient Indian classic about the Kurukshetra Civil War) as exemplifying the  desire for revenge, providing examples such as the slaying of Drona and his  son Asvatthamma's vengeance. The Buddha's teachings are portrayed as an  influence for the reconcilers who came later on. Having thus set the stage,  Gandhi then takes the reader on a journey through Indian history -- ancient  India, Islamic India, British India and the post-independent India --  examining events and the thinking of various leaders through the lens of  revenge and reconciliation. Pakistan, Bangaldesh and Sri Lankan history is  also touched upon, but the focus is on India. Obviously one book cannot  cover all the history of the Indian subcontinent and the author has to be  selective, but he has done a fine job; events right upto the 1999  Indo-Pakistani skirmish at Kargil (Kashmir) are touched upon. This is a  stimulating read. A familiarity with Indian history will definitely help  the reader, but even other readers will learn something by reading this  book.
