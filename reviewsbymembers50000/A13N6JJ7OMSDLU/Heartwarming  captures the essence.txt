 This book must be read by anybody who has an interest in India, whether they are Indians or non-Indians. I recommend that anybody who plans on visiting India also read this book. The typical tourist book gives  practical information on what to see and where to stay and what to wear.  But it won't give you an insight into the land, its people and its culture.  And if you do not get that, you haven't got the most from your trip. This  book will prepare you for the discovery of India. The photographs are  marvellous, a visual delight.
