 The hustle and bustle of busy Beijing must present a startling contrast to  the corn fields of Iowa. The similarities and surprises that another  culture can provide are described in this book by University of Iowa  journalism professor Kenneth Starck who spent a year in China teaching  journalism to Chinese students in the mid 1980s. Besides the differences in  the U.S and Chinese news media and the perplexities they cause in teaching,  Starck also describes his forays into China with his wife and daughter.  Besides the obvious (a visit to the Great Wall), there are also little  delightful episodes; one such is when an inspector on a train demanded that  Starck's daughter hand over her Walkman cassette player, and slipped on the  headphones to check what kind of music the American girl was listening too.   While Starck sweated ('we could be in real trouble'), the inspector  started to bop to the music and handed back the equipment to them with a  smile. "We passed," Starck writes. "So did the  Eurythmics."
