 Bertrand Russell often gathered essays he thought would have lasting value, and published them as collections. This book not only has essays, but the text of talks he gave on the BBC. The topics are wide and  disparate. He begins with books (and their authors) that made a deep  impression on him while he was in his formative years. Then follow essays  on politics, starting off with "What is Freedom?" and "What  is Democracy?" -- two basic questions that many people don't even  think about. The "Divertissement" section contains pieces of  fiction. Russell stated that he found fiction a useful medium to express  ideas he half-believed in, but had no firm grounds for belief. The last  section is on "Peace and War," and includes the famous Vienna and  Manchester addresses on nuclear bombs. His style is incisive and pithy as  usual. If you like Russell, you should not miss reading this book.
