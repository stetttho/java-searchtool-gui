 There are several management books that profile a few particular organizations (say Southwest Airlines, or Ford), analyze what they do right and do wrong, and draw conclusions from it. But the organization you work for may be different from the ones profiled, and it is a debatable point if those conclusions can work as effectively in your setting. But in this book, the authors have profiled 80,000 managers over 25 years from all kinds of companies -- from humble start-ups to established, Fortune 500 giants. This makes their observations and conclusions very interesting.  A thought provoking book.
