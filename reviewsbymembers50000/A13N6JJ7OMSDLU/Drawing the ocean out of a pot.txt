 The Hindi saying "Gagar mein Sagar," or The Ocean in a Pot, is particularly applicable to the Bhagavad Gita. The Gita must surely be one of the shortest scriptures in the world -- it has only 700 two-line verses.  Yet in those 700 verses lies an unlimited wealth of wisdom. However, most  people only see a pot of water, some sense there is more to it, but it  takes a person of realization to draw out the ocean from the pot. The Gita  has been debated down the centuries in India, and in the West since the  first European language translations appeared in the 18th century. However,  scholars and theologians who only analyze it with the intellect have often  been baffled with the text. For instance, some verses of the Gita's later  chapters sometimes apparently contradict what was said earlier. When a  saint or a sage comments on the Gita, it is a different story. There is no  contradiction; obscure lines are explained with a simplicity that is  brilliant.  Many sages such as Adi Shankaracharya have left us their  commentaries, and now the grand tradition is kept up by the scintillating  commentary of Paramahansa Yogananda, one of the spiritual giants of the  20th century. With deep perception, Yogananda explains how the dialogue  between Krishna and Arjuna that occurred on a battlefield in a bygone  millennium is as relevant in the here and now to you and me as it was to  people way back then. The ancient warriors are an allegory to the battle of  life -- that tug-of-war in our bodies, minds and souls with different  forces pulling us in different directions. It shows how the Gita is a  blueprint for emerging victorious. The numerous cross-references to the  Holy Bible underline the contention that truth is, in essence, one -- the  various religions just state it differently. This is surely one of the  greatest commentaries ever written on the Bhagavad Gita; it is a book for  the ages.
