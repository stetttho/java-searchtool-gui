 Many of us forget math concepts we were introduced to at school. For a quick brush up, this is a good reference book. Fractions, decimals, percents, arithmetic concepts, elementary algebra, trigonometry and other such items are all covered. Besides, in keeping with its title of  "everyday math," the book also goes into such things are interest  rates, IRA and 410(k) math, stocks, mortgages, basic book-keeping and even  casino gambling! The occasional anecdote or story pertaining to math (one  was on the titles of alcohol measures such as jeroboams and rehoboams,  another on the Father of Algebra) give welcome breaks from the technical  text.
