 How often do you use words such as "feedback," "basically," or "simplistic" ? Are you sure you know exactly what they mean, and does the person being addressed interpret them  in exactly the same sense that you are using them (provided you know what  they mean, of course)? Communication skills are important, and this book  deals with "weasel words," words that originally meant one thing  and now mean quite another. With great wit, the author discusses 44 such  words. It also alerts us that language changes, and we have to keep up with  it along with other changes in the world.
