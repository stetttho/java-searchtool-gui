 It's said that when Pamela Travers, the creator of Mary Poppins, was asked what she thought of this movie, she said something like, "Oo-ooo-h, I shall be very silent."  It's quite true that the Mary Poppins books  and the movie are very different. For one, the Mary Poppins of the books is  much more prim and prissy and proper than the Poppins played by Julie  Andrews in the movie. There are four children in the first book (Jane,  Michael, John and Barbara) and a fifth (Annabel) comes along in the next  book. Some of the books also read more like a series of incidents than a  tightly-knit story. The movie tells a definite story: of how a father who  is estranged from his children gets re-united with them through all the  strange and wonderful things that occur when the perfect nanny with magical  powers literally blows into their house with the east wind.  Some incidents  from the books that are portrayed as written, others changed to suit the  movie.  When the movie deviates greatly from the book it is based on, I  haved liked the books far more than the movie. "Mary Poppins" is  the exception, where I feel the books and the movie have their own (and  very different) charm. Julie Andrews is terrific, the setting of Edwardian  London great, the songs are fabulous, and this is a movie to be treasured  and seen over and over again down the years.
