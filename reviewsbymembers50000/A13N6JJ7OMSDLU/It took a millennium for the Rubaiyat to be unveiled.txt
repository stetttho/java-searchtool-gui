 Omar Khayyam was a multifaceted man who lived at around the time the  second millennium of the Christian era was beginning. He was not only a  scientist but also a Sufi mystic, and his Rubaiyat (book of verses in  quatrains) has evoked much interest and endless debate. The best known  English translation is that of Edward FitzGerald. Here is a sample  verse: "Here with a Loaf of Bread beneath the Bough / A Flask of  Wine, a Book of Verse---and Thou / Beside me singing in the Wilderness ---  / And Wilderness is Paradise enow."/ Whose imagination can fail to  be stirred? But most people see this as a glorification of wine, women and  song -- a handbook of hedonism. Could such an earthy and earthly book be in  keeping with Khayyam's reputation as a Sufi mystic and a saint? Now towards  the end of the millennium, the Indian saint, mystic and spiritual leader  Paramahansa Yogananda has commented on the Rubaiyat in his book "Wine  of the Mystic."  Omar was indeed a mystic. The divine intoxication of  the love and joy of God could only be conveyed to the people of his age  through metaphors and allegory that described the pleasures they could  understand. One must read the Rubaiyat in conjunction with "Wine of  the Mystic" to really get to the heart and soul of one of the world's  classic books.
