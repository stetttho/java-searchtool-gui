 The opening of this novel does indeed show girls at play at a boarding  school in East Africa, but it soon becomes clear that the title refers to  the four teachers at the school -- the only white women in this remote  region with nothing much to do after school hours. There's Miss Poole, the  headmistress, a colonial born in Africa who does not care for England and  continues to stay on even as independence for this African nation means  lowered standards for whites like themselves. There's Bettyjean (B.J.)  Lebow, a peace corps worker from San Diego, who struggles hard to match her  fantasies of Africa with the realities. There's her room-mate, Pam Male.  And finally Heather Monkhouse, who has had some sort of trouble in Nairobi  and taken up teaching at this remote school. When finally two black men go  out on a date with two of the teachers, a trail of tragedy engulfts each of  the teachers' lives. The writing is uneven in patches (this was one of the  author's early novels), but there are flashes of black humor.  The funniest  parts include scenes of the teachers taking turns in hosting group dinners  at each of their homes although they cannot stand one another, each trying  to outdo the other in being a rude and poor hostess.
