 The definition of philosophy varies according to the philosophy we adopt,  says Russell. So then --- there are some general problems which people find  interesting, and which do not belong to any of the special sciences, and  these problems raise doubts about what we consider knowledge. The  definition and exploration of this problems is philosophy.  With this  introduction, Russell discusses some problems: the physical world, man from  without (environment), man from within (consciousness, emotions, ethics  etc) and so on. An outline is clearly limited, and Russell does not include  many branches of philosophical enquiry such as metaphysical inquiry and  some aspects of authority and state. But within its constraints, the book  is still a good read.
