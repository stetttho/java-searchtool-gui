 Kierkegaard had a complicated personality, and wrote many of his greatest  works under pseudonyms.  He is ponderous and verbose a great part of the  time. But the reader who persists is richly rewarded. According to  Stendahl, Kierkegaard ignored most philosophical questions, or rather,  approached them from unconventional angles and therefore one must be  familiar with his indirect method of exposition to get the most from his  writings. In the first three chapters, she gives background biographical  material and then provides summaries of the thought in some of  Kierkegaard's major works such as Fear and Trembling and Either/Or. These  are not a substitute for reading Kierkegaard directly. But for those who  have read his books, they are good review summaries.  For those who feel  daunted by Kierkegaard, they can act as appetizers to get you to go for his  books.
