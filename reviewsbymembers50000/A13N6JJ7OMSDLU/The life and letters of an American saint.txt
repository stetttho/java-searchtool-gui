 Edith Bissett's tough childhood days must have fueled her desire to seek  out firsthand the deeper meaning of life. She delved into the world's great  religious and philosophical writings, but became convinced that to realize  the truth, you needed a guide who had already "been there and done that."   In 1925, she met the great Indian saint and spiritual leader, Paramahansa  Yogananda when he was in Seattle. Later, she joined his monastic order and  took the name of Gyanamata ("Mother of Wisdom"). This book is a summary of  her life and also contains many of her writings - journal entries, letters  she wrote to Yogananda (and ones she received from him), counsel she gave  to other truth seekers and so forth. Her inspiring writings cover the gamut  - right attitude, devotion, renunciation, loyalty, dealing with suffering,  gratitude, and much more.  We learn so much by reading this book, and also  realize why the author was called "Mother of Wisdom."  A veritable gem.
