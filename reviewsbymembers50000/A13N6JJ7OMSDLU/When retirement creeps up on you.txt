 Many of V.S.Naipaul's books are set in his native Trinidad, or other Caribbean islands, or locales such as Africa. This novel, however, is entirely set in England and all the characters are English. Richard Stone,  a sixty-two year old bachelor is a librarian in a corporation who is  approaching retirement. Unnerved at the prospect, he suddenly decides to  marry. He also draws up a plan whereby his company can help its retired  employees who are now pensioners, many living in penury. The plan, against  all odds, becomes a success but Naipaul shows how victories can be  bittersweet. A charming book, and a real treat to read even just for the  style and the use of language.
