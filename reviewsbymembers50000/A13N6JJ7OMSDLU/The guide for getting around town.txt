 This is a street atlas that has proven its worth over and over down the years. The newer edition is in color and it has become slightly larger, making it easier on the eyes. The old black and white edition had its own  convenience, though; it  was of a slightly smaller size size that would  just about fit into the pocket of a coat jacket. I hope the publishers will  reconsider bringing this back, while still keeping the bigger sizes for  those who would rather have them.
