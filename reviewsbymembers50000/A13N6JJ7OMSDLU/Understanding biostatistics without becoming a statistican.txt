 As a medical writer and editor at The Cleveland Clinic, Thomas A. Lang found that the lack of clear understanding of statistics by non-statisticians affected the clarity of their writing. Physicians had the  same problem while writing up their research papers for publication. Lang  perceived a need among medical and science writers to understand just  enough of biostatistics to make them better writers and editors without  becoming statisticians themselves. He devised workshops that were conducted  by the American Medical Writers Association which were enormously  successful. The logical next step was to write this book based on the  valuable teaching experience and feedback he got at those courses. In other  words, this is a book that wasn't written in a vacuum but is the result of  a perceived need, and the author's experience in meeting that need.  Co-author Michelle Secic has also contributed with her expertise, making it  a valuable book for people in this field.
