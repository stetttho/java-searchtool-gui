 Kierkegaard is widely hailed as the "father of existentialism," or at  least his ideas are believed to have been seminal to this philosophical  movement.  Kierkegaard's life was what biographers might call uneventful.   He was a theologian who lived all his life in a small town in Europe  (Copenhagen) in the early 19th century, died a bachelor at 42, authored  many philosophical and theological works, and virtually unknown outside of  Denmark in his lifetime and for decades after his death. Yet today his life  is studied because he was so influential to the movement in which many  other great thinkers are said to belong (Heidegger, Jaspers, Sartre, Buber,  Camus and Nietzsche). Thompson goes into a fairly good detail of  Kierkegaard's life (and Kierkegaard does not always come across as a  likeable man). But he falls short when he tries to show us how  Kierkegaard's life generated his thought - at least, to people who are not  familiar with some or all of Kierkegaard's works.  In this respect,  Stendahl's "Sren Kierkegaard" is the better book where the biographical  material is brief but enough to relate to the good summaries of  Kierkegaard's books that follow.  Also, Vardy's "Kierkegaard,"  though limited in scope, offers a good introduction of life and thought for  somebody unfamiliar with this philosopher.
