 This book mixes fast action and suspense with interesting spiritual, ethical and moral issues without becoming too much of a `heavyweight' book.  The concept that there are interested groups after secrets suppressed for centuries, secrets that can bring down modern-day Christianity with all the possible repercussions forms a solid plot for the action. Once one has read a conventional thriller and knows `whodunnit' the book is pass. But when it makes you think of other issues and pick up other books to explore some of the concepts raised, the book becomes more than a run-of-the-mill thriller - and this book falls in that category. Another book of fiction of note is Gore Vidal's `Julian' (about the nephew of Constantine the Great who wanted to revert to the old pagan religions from the newly established Christianity). After finishing "The Da Vinci Code," the question that lingers on is: how much is fact and how much is fiction?  For those who are interested in pursuing this, some good books to start with are Bart Ehrman's "Lost Christianities," John Shelby Spong's "Born of A Woman" and "This Hebrew Lord," and Marcus Borg's "The Heart of Christianity."
