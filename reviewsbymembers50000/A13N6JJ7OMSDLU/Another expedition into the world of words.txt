 This is yet another delightful book by Philip Howard (who was literary editor of The Times of London) where he explores the ins and outs of a few words, phrases and expressions that range all the way from  "economics," "crocodile tears" and "as sick as a  parrot."  Many entries provide information both curious and  interesting. For example, "watergate" originally meant a channel  of water, then referred to a gate giving access to a channel of water -- a  famous example being the "Traitor's Gate" in the Tower of London.  Now of course, the Nixon White House has given it new meaning.  This book  is full of information like this. The section on South African English,  depicted in the form of a conversation between an Afrikaaner and an Indian,  amuses as it informs.
