 This engagement (desk) calendar for 2001 has some of the most beautiful photographs of nature and landscapes. Facing the photo is a page where the week's engagements can be noted and there's space for brief notes as well.  But it is the pictures and the accompanying quotes that make this calendar  sparkle. Each lovely photograph is accompanied by quote from the writings  of Paramahansa Yogananda, the renowned saint and yogi from India who  founded the international yoga organization, Self-Realization Fellowship.  However, the spiritual and inspirational quotes  are universal in their  scope and will inspire people from all creeds and faiths. So will the  photographs! Page after page, the quote seems to match the photograph so  well that one cannot but marvel.
