 Hearing Dr. Wright speak, I bought this book on the spot.  Dr. Wright does a great job applying behavior principles to common situations, in language non-behaviorists can understand.   You'll take away from his book the idea that you should look at your own unique pet in your own unique circumstances to pinpoint any behavior problems you may be having, letting just exactly what is happening, when, and where help you guess _why_.  If you can guess the why, you can plan a way to intervene that will be effective -- and you'll learn how best to decide if you are indeed being effective.   Dr. Wright also emphasizes assessing the mood of your dog and changing a bad mood to a good one in order to facilitate behavior change.  He further gives good research-based information about reading dogs' body language and how to respond if a dog is fearful, aggressive, etc.   But Ain't Misbehavin' doesn't just address problems such as aggression or separation anxiety.  On the contrary, how to build a positive relationship with your pet (so problems don't appear) is a primary focus. In sum, a really good dog AND CAT training book that both gives you guidelines for living happily with your pet and offers suggestions for responding to serious problems.
