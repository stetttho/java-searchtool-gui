 In a romantic comedy, there's no real suspense these days. Boy meets girl, and boy and girl get together, usually for keeps. The only way to add any variation to the theme is to make the characters or the setting appealing, or to have witty and/or wise dialogue. I'm not sure why this movie was so panned by the critics, because _What Women Want_ surely delivers appealing characters in the form of Helen Hunt and Mel Gibson, and an interesting setting in the head offices of a large Chicago advertising firm. Yes, the movie was a bit long. I was ready for them to resolve the romance before they finally got around to it -- and Marisa Tomei's funny character is disposed of in a ridiculous and neat way that leaves the hero unscathed -- but Helen Hunt was charming and has rarely looked lovelier, and she gave the role her usual depth. Mel Gibson did a good job, and his Astaire-like dance number was an unexpected delight. I thoroughly enjoyed _What Women Want_ and felt I'd been given a slice of (no doubt glamorized) life of two successful ad execs juggling job and romance in the big city. The device of having the hero be able to read women's minds was used for the most part effectively, without bashing the audience over the head with it. Certainly an imaginative way to allow the hero to grow emotionally. Now, I'll end with a comparison: this movie really was a long re-working of just about every episode of the TV show Bewitched, wasn't it? Only this time "Samantha" gets to be more overtly smart in turning everything into successful ad campaigns!
