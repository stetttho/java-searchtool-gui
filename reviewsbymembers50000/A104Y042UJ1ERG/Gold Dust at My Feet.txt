 I certainly made it to the sunny side of the street when I chanced to hear Michelle Walker this past weekend.  What a wonderful voice she has, equally at home interpreting classic favorites and contemporary numbers.  And let's not forget the wonderful players she has backing her up -- the bass and guitar work are wonderful, as is the pianist.  I got her CD on the spot, one for myself and one to give to a friend. Do yourself a favor, and get this CD.  We have a wonderful "new" jazz artist to treasure!
