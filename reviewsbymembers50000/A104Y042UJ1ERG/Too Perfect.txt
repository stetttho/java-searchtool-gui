 I like many of Andrew Greeley's books (Patience of a Saint is a favorite of mine), but I couldn't like this book as much as some of his others because I found Nuala altogether too perfect.  Greeley's female characters are almost universally beautiful (goes without saying), strong of character, and usually very successful, but Nuala was just a bit beyond the pale for perfection for me.  Really, she was described in such unrelentingly rapturous terms I couldn't get beyond it.  How about some praise for our hero Dermot?   Oh, well, probably just jealous.  Call it sour grapes!
