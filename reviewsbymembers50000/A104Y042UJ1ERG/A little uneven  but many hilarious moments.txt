 Somehat uneven and not as tight in terms of plot as many other Allen films -- basically more of a setup (wacky family seeking asylum in embassy) to let the jokes roll -- but many laugh-out-loud moments and gags.  I often find Dom DeLuise to be just too much, but here he shows a little restraint and gets the priest character just right.  His "priest" has a network of intelligence behind him, & he telephones them with "subtle" coded messages such as, "The boy with the blue hair is fondling a chipmunk." He also performs some of the best magic routines I've ever seen; best because they are so hilariously stupid.  ROFLMAO to see him giving the tricks away either as he's performing them or immediately afterward, when he casually put down the "secret" prop or whatever in plain view.  Great laughs, easy to watch -- Allen gives us one of his lowbrow characters rather than his intellectual neurotic types.  Enjoy!
