 Story of young woman who is given a measure of financial independence by her oppressive father, and how she gradually reaches for some small measure of autonomy.  The "Five Towns" are the author's fictionalized version of the corresponding cities of the region in England where the famous potteries & glaziers are. Frequently, reviewers note the Methodism in this novel -- it does give a look at the everyday lives of Methodism when it was much more controversial (!) than it is today, if it ever was particularly revolutionary in America. I was more struck by the personal circumstances of Anna's plight than her religious questionings, although the latter are definitely imposed on her character by the author. An interesting attempt by a male author to describe a woman suppressed by her domineering father, by strict moral and religious conventions, and by her own personality.
