 Described by the prolific author as "my serious novel," _Anna_ is the story of a young woman's struggles to free herself from the oppression of her domineering father.  The title character is given a  chance to live undreamed-of experiences when she inherits a fortune in  properties and business ventures on her 21st birthday.  Simultaneously, she  finds herself the declared object of affection of one of the town's most  desirable men.  As her story unfolds, she is attracted to another man, more  vulnerable, and must try to resolve many different demands on her sense of  duty and her emotions. Set in the early 1900's, Bennett succeeds in  evoking a strong sense of place with his fictionalized Five Towns of the  Staffordshire Potteries.  Critics have praised his full description of  Methodism and Methodist church life of the time, as well.  Bennett conveys  sympathy for his protagonist and portrays the limitations placed on her for  her gender without falling into condescension, concluding, "She had  sucked in with her mother's milk the profound truth that a woman's life is  always a renunciation, greater or less." Anna's attempts to expand  herself spiritually and personally, and to gain a sense of personal  efficacy, make for an interesting read.  However, Bennett violates  flagrantly the old writer's adage, "Show not tell," as when we  are told repeatedly Anna's father is a miser and a tyrant long before we  see him saying or doing anything miserly or tyrannical.  Further, anyone  looking for an intensely psychological novel with thoughts portrayed as  stream of consciousness should be aware that Bennett's style descends from  a Realist tradition.
