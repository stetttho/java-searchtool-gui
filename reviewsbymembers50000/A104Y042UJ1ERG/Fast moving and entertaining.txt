 What a relief to find a dog-lover's mystery without all the voluminous asides of Susan Conant or the occasionally too cutesy Laurien Berenson.  (Not that I haven't read and enjoyed both those author's books).  Enjoyable dog training information, and the mystery really moves along, with plenty of characters to keep one guessing, especially as negative information about each suspect keeps turning up.  Nice characterizations; both the protagonist and her mother are appealing.
