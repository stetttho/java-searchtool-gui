 I have enjoyed several of the books in this series, but found this one to be very slow going.  All the protagonist seems to do is whine and complain about the other characters -- that is, when she's not launching into long digressions.  The latter are, perhaps, meant to be informative about dogdom and humorous, but in this book Holly's usual digressive monologues left me cold.  Try some of the other books in the series instead.
