 Eric Clapton is the blues. That was why he left the Yardbirds and that is why he formed Cream. He did move away from the blues on his albums, but he always included at least one blues song in concert. This CD focuses on his  blues soul. And he pulls it off in spades. This is much better than  "From The Cradle" his first attempt at an all blues album. The  first CD focuses on studio recordings while the second one goes to the  stage to hear some of those concert performances. Every song is timeless  and anyone who is a serious Clapton fan should own this.
