 Here is another album of guys who want to try and show how angry they can be. The bad thing about this is that there is no substance to it. Just because you can shout profanities doesn't mean your music is going to be  good."Stupify" is getting the airplay right now. I would not be  surprised to see these guys disappear like many other hate bands. This is  just noise and nothing more.
