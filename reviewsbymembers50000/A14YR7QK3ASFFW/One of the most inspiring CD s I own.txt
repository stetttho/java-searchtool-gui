 I bought this CD for two songs, Wonderful One and Red Letter Day. Little did I know that this CD is so full of great music that I would listen to it constantly. It was a couple of other albums that got me interested in Newsong and this by far is better than the ones that introduced me to the band. If you are looking for a praise CD and one that will also lift your spirits, this is one to own. I take it with me almost constantly. I listen to it at work, in my car and at home. It is that good.
