 This is the one Albert King CD to own. All of his classics are here. The booklet is nice, but not too wordy, and the sound is fantastic. It is easy to see how he influenced Hendrix, Clapton and all the other rock guitarist  that played the blues. King is a left handed wizard and it's all heard on  these two CD's.
