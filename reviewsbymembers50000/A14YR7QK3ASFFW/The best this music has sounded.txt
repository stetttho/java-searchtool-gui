 This festival was a landmark of the Vietnam protest movement. The box set is an improvement over the original CD sets that were released before it. For one, the remastering cleaned things up a little. Another thing is the packaging. The booklet contained with the set is a nice addition. And then there is the music. Ritchie Havens, Jimi Hendrix, The Who, Country Joe and the Fish, CSN, and many more. But, the most amazing track is still Ten Years After. This set should be owned by anyone who claims to be a fan of Folk and Rock music.
