 This is my favorite Jimi Hendrix album. A friend of mine turned me on to it and the sound was absolutely astonishing. I was excited when I was able to replace my worn out vinyl with the CD. This has many of Jimi's ballads  on it and some heavy duty rockers. It also shows a little jazzier side to  his music. For something very different, bassist Noel Redding takes the  lead vocals on one track. While the somg is not that great, it still has  that classic Hendrix feel to it. Simply put, this album is strong from  start to finish.
