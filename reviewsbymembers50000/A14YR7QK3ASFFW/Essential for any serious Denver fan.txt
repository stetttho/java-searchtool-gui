 This 4 CD set does an excellent job of John Denver's career. All of the hits are here. But, it goes much deeper than that. It shows just how good a songwriter he was. While he didn't put out much right before he died, this  is the way he should be remembered. These timeless classics should be heard  by any person who says they are a serious music fan.
