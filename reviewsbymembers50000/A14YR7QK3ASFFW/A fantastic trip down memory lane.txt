 The History Of Rock series is a great way to find some of the best oldies out there. This one starts off with Dion's Runaround Sue" and keeps right on trucking thru such great songs as "Keep Searchin" by Del  Shannon, Curtis Lee's "Pretty Little Angel Eyes," "He's So  Fine," "Hey Paula," "Smokey Places" and many more.  The only thing I don't like about the disc is the inclusion of "Last  Kiss." But, since it's the last track on the CD, I can take it. Simply  a good disc.
