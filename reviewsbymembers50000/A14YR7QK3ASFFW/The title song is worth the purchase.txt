 This group is now one of the more forgotten bands of the 70's. This album has really been put aside. That is a shame, because the title track is one of the best songs they ever recorded. Plus, "Slippin Into Darkness" is on this album and it is a fine song also. They really didn't get funky until later, but this album should not be passed on.
