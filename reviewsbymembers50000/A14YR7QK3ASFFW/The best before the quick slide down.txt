 Whitesnake, to me, never put out great music. But, this album kicks. The title track opens things up and it sounds just like the old Whitesnake. "Love Ain't No Straner" and "Slow And Easy" are also  good, but point to things to come. The rest of the album is solid. After  this, they went video and really started sounding like all the other hair  metal bands of the 80's.
