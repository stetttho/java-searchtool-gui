 Apparantly, Atlantic Records was trying to milk one more album from the Bon Scott era. This one is weak. The best track is Jailbreak. It would be nice if they would release the bands first couple of albums in their true  import form. There are other albums to get by this band. This is one that  you should get to complete your collection.
