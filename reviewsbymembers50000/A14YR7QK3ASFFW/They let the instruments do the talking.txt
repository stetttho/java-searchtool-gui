 When Miles Copeland first formed IRS records, he put together the No Speak series...artists who made instrumental albus. This was one of the first ones released. It definately shows that Wishbone Ash moved into the 80's  and away from the progressive 70's. These guys are talented musicians and  this album definately shows that. The only hang-up is that Wishbone Ash  also had some decent vocals and they are not on this album. That was what  really made this band stand out. The dual guitar attack is also limited. It  has a very 80's, high-tech sound. This is not the first album to buy, but  it makes a nice addition once you get "Argus' "Wishbone  Four" and "Live Dates."
