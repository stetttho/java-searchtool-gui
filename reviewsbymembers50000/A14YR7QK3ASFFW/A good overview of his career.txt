 This collection covers many of his most popular songs up to 1981 or so. The disco beat of "Give Me The Night," the smooth guitar work in "Breezin," and the original version of "The Greatest Love Of  All" make this a collection that shows his pop side. It also shows his  jazzier side, with songs like "Last Train To Clarksville." The  show stopper is his version of "On Broadway." While it doesn't  compare to the version by the Drifters, it still is one of the best  performances he has ever done. Overall, a collection that doesn't miss.
