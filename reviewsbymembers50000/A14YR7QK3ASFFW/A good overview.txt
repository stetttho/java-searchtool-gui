 This CD does a good job of looking at these glam rockers and the career they built in the 70's. Songs like "Litle Willy" "Fox On The Run" "Ballroom Blitz" and "Love Is Like Oxygen"  bring about guilty pleasure memories. But, there are some good songs  missing from "Desolation Boulevard" such as "Solid Gold  Brass" and "Into The Night." Still, it is a good CD and not  a bad place to start a collection on this band.
