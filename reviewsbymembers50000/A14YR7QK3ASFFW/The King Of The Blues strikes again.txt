 B.B. King keeps on amazing me with every album. I found this one at a used record store and I still can't believe somebody would get rid of it. "Breaking Up Somebody's Home" is a fantastic cut. B.B. let's his  guitar do alot of the talking and Lucille speaks loud and clear. Not  everything B.B. has put out has been great, but this one should be in the  collection of every blues fan. It is that good.
