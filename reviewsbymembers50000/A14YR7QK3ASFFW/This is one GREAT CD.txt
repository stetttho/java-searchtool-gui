 The Hot Nuts are a very good R&B band. I first got hooked on the 45 of "Baby Let Me Bang Your Box" and I've never looked back. This recording sounds remarkably well, considering the age and source of the  tapes that were used to make this CD. I hope that more things are released  by Doug Clark And The Hot Nuts.
