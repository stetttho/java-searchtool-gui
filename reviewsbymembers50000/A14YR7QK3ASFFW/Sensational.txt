 Nothing beats a good rock and roll instrumental, and this collection has some of the best. My favorites are "Wild Weekend," "Apache," "Walk Don't Run," and "No Matter What  Shape Your Stomach's In." Plus, Rhino records does a wonderful job of  remastering all of the songs. They have never sounded better.
