 These guys have been around a number of years and they never lose their spark or desire to praise God. This album has some amazing songs on it. "Lord I Lift Your Name" and "Show Your Power" are my  two favorites. Many songs have that rock appeal that their fans like, but  others are softer and show even more harmonies. These guys are just  awesome.
