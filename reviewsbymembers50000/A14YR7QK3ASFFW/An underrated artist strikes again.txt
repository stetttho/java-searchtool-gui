 John Hiatt has never received the respect he deserves. This is an album that does him justice. The title track and Pirate Radio are two very good songs. While this album doesn't rank up there with his Perfectly Good Guitar album, it is still good and will not disappoint new or old fans.  Keep on rocking John!
