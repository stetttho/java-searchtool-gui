 The mini disk format is the best way to record. The ability to organize the disk the way you want after you finish recording is a big plus. Also, you can erase the disk at a later date if you decide you don't want what is  on it. There is a protection device on the disk so that you don't  accidently erase the disk. Last, but not least, is the quality sound the  mini disk format gives you. Cassettes will sound so inferior once you start  using the mini disk player. Sony is the best one out there. I have read a  number of specs concerning the other brands, and this one rates very high.  Keep a look out for this one and you will be very satisfied once you  purchase it.
