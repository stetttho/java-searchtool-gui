 Erik Braunn and Doug Ingle always had fights about who was the most important member in the band. With Ingle gone, this album shows you who was right. Ingle was gone by the time of this release and Braunn and the rest  of the band was just trying to benefit from the name. This is just a waste  of money. By the way, Sun And Steel was just as bad.
