 This albu brings together the many people that was the Weavers. The main person is still Pete Seeger, but to hear the others blend in with those harmonies is just amazing. The set starts off with "When The Saints Go  Marching In" and really continues to sizzle from there. The version of  "Wimoweh" is one of the best I have ever heard. The other  Carnegie Hall concert albums are better, but this one is very good. Buy it  and enjoy. You will not regret it.
