 That one song has to be one of the best in CCM. It tells the story of the resurrection from Peter's eyes. It is very true to the Bible in its lyrics. Adam Where Are You is another solid song. This album has been forgotten by people who like heavier music. Don't let the long hair and early 70's look fool you. This album is for people of all ages. Truely sensational!
