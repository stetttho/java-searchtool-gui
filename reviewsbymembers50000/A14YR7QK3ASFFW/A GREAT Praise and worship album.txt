 With only one album under its belt, you would think Sonicflood really didn't have much to put out a live album. If that is your thought, then you are wrong. Sure, songs from the debut pop up. But, the feel of this concert is truely awesome. And, those songs from the first album really hit hard on this one. These guys are so sincere in their worship and it shows. Fans of Bill Gaither may think it awful to call this kind of music praise music. But, God knows their heart and that is good enough for me. Praise on Sonicflood.
