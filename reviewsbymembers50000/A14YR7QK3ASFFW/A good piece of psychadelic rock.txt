 This album was a defining moment in rock history. At one time, it was the top selling album for Atlantic Records. The title track is absolutely mind boggling. "My Mirage" is a good song. "Termination" is  also good. The packaging is also fanastic. The booklet, along with the  jewel case, is an added attraction.
