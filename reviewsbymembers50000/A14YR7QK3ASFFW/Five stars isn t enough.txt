 I purchased this set when it first came out and it is the one box set that I can listen to over and over. Hendrix IS the best rock guitarist, in my humble opinion. This set contains all three of his studio albums that were  released prior to his untimely death. But, the big bonus is the fact that  they are the British releases of his albums. That means :Are You  Experienced" has such gems as "Redhouse" "Stone  Free" and others that were left off the American releases of the  album. Each disc also contains a nice booklet and the fourth dis, which is  a best of, does a better summation of what Jimi was all about than does the  album "Smash Hits". I know that it says the set is not available,  but if you ever see it, grab it. It will truely show you why Jimi is still  considered a big influence among true guitarist.
