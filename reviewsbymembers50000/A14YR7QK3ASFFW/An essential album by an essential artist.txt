 There are many albums out there by Pete Seeger, and this one is one of my favorites. It has songs written by Woody Guthrie and others, but also features many Seeger staples, such as "Guantanamera" "Bells  Of Rhymney" "Wimoweh" and "Little Boxes." Seeger  is an artist that needs to be heard and he is getting that respect by the  release of this and other Seeger classics.
