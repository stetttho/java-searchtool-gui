 "Chasing Shadows" is a good song, with some great drumming by Ian Paice. But the ablum as a whole really does not follow suite. The over-long "April" is one of the worst things this band has done.  "Blind" is not bad, but then again it follows "Chasing  Shadows" and therefore just does not stack up. Early Deep Purple is  best represented on "Shades Of Deep Purple." This album is  basically for compleatist only.
