 I purchased this album after seeing Ginny Owens in concert at my church.  She has such a nice voice and her commitment to the work of God is  undeniable. All of the songs show that she is an excellent writer and a  wonderful singer. I am just glad that she didn't get a job as a music  teacher. The lives she has touched and will touch is far more important.  Keep it up.
