 This is the ultimate look at Janis Joplin. Every album she recorded during her brief career is here. That includes the two Big Brother albums. "Down On Me" is a great song from this period. Plus you get bonus  tracks and her two solo albums to boot. Janis deserved a set like this. A  career like hers just can't be sampled.
