 This album is what Motorhead is all about. None of this wrestling theme song stuff. They let it rip. The first song, "Ace Of Spades," sets things off and the guys don't stop. This is the classic line-up and the classic sound that Motorhead brought to the stage. It is one LOUD album that all speed metal fanatics should not only hear but own. Don't let the imposters fool you. Bands like Metallica, Megadeath and the Misfits owe a great deal to this band. Motorhead kicked the door open for them.
