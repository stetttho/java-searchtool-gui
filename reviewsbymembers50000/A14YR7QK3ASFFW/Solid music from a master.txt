 Bill Black took the sounds of the day and gave it his own twist. With Black on bass and a guitar and drum, the bottom was filled out and the saxaphones and organ took over from there to create a sound that was different than anything else released at the time. This particular album shoes his versatility, from upbeat rockers to slower ballads. I recommend the individual albums, but this is a great starter.
