 Fire Down Under is a good 80's Heavy Metal Album. "Swords And Tequila" get it started and they don't slow down. My favorite song on the album is "Feel The Same." It starts with a slow grind and then really kicks with some classic HM guitar licks. This is a solid album from start to finish that needs to be heard.
