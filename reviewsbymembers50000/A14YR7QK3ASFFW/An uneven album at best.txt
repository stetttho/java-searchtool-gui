 When I think back to what Yes was and then I hear this album, I shake my head in disbelief. Only "Tales" "Tormato" and "Relayer" are worse. The songs really don't have that Yes sound. Geoff Downes and Trevor Horn couldn't do much with their former band The Buggles and they don't add much here. This band should have called it quits after "Going For The One" but they didn't and this is what you get. Subtract Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman and you get what I consider a fake Yes album. Get this only to complete your collection. DO NOT START HERE!
