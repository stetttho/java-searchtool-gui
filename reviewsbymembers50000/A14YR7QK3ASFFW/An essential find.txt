 "Dimples" "Boogie Chillun" "I'm In The Mood" "Crawling Kingsnake" These are all essential songs by John Lee Hooker and they are all right here. It is a shame that this CD is  apparantly out of print. Released on VJ in 1959, Hooker shows all the power  that most people who listen to his later stuff find so appealing. If you  can find it, buy it immediately. It is worth the search and the purchase. I  liked it so much that I got it on vinyl and CD. It is a staple of my blues  collection.
