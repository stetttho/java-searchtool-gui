 This is the album that broke BTO in the U.S. "Takin Care Of Business" and "Let It Ride" are two fine songs. The thing that brings this album down are the two songs that Tim Bachman wrote.  "Blown" is OK but "I Don't Have To Hide" is possibly  the worst song this band ever produced. "Give It Time" rocks like  there is no tomorrow and "Stonegates" is also a good song.  "Welcome Home" and "Tramp" are above average.
