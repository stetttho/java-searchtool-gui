 The songs in this set are the singles from Melon Collie and the left over stuff that did not make it to that album. The singles are good, but the other stuff is just not that impressive. Covers of The Cars, Missing  Persons, and Alice Cooper do not help that much. The packaging is very cool  for those of us who remember the old 45 carrying cases. The booklet is OK,  nothing really fancy. Overall, it just did not impress me that much. If  it's the singles you want, get Melon Collie and leave this behind.
