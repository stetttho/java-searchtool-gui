 Dallas Holm has been spreading the Gospel for many years. I first saw him in 1980. Rise Again is a standard song around Easter that many have identified with. Back Seat, Front Seat is the Southern Gospel sound that  Holm is somewhat comfortable with. I like the Contemporary sound a little  better. He has a fantastic voice, has upbeat and slower songs, and has a  terrific backing group. Holm continues to spread the Gospel today, but this  album got me listening and is still one of my favorites by him.
