 Brook Benton has voice that can't be topped. This set shows off that voice. The classic "It's Just A Matter Of Time" starts things off. The B side, "Hurtin Inside" is actually just as good. "Endlessly" "Kiddio" "Think Twice" a couple  of duets with Dinah Washington and the unforgettable "Rainy Night In  Georgia" are just some of the highlights. Plus, Rhino did a wonderful  job of remastering these songs. They couldn't sound better. For a slice of  50's, 60's and early 70's romance, pick this up.
