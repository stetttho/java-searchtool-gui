 This is the most essential AC/DC album around. It is the last one before lead singer Bon Scott died. Every song will rattle your teeth and leave you begging for more. The band also shows it can play hard blues, as the  closing track "Night Prowler" proves. The title track, "Shot  Down In Flames," "Walk All Over You," and "Girls Got  Rhythm" will have you banging your head. If you are a fan of this band  and do not own this album, then pic it up immediately.
