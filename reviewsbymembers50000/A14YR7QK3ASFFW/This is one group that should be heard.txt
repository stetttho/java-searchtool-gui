 Three Crosses combines many styles of music on their debut. You have a pop sound with Calvary, a bluesier sound with Mission Bell, and a ballad with Mary's Song. The vocalist is not as good as some others in Christian Music,  but he is not annoying. The musicians give everything a contemporary feel  and the music will make you feel good. This is an album every Christian  should listen to.
