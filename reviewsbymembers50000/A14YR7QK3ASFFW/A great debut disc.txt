 The first album by this artist and it is a good one. It starts off with "I Believe" which is a good praise song. The title track is also good. My favorite track is "Martin Luther." It is such an inspirational song. I have two other CD's by Wes King, but this is my favorite of the bunch. I listen to it quite frequently.
