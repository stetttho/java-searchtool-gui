 I am a big Robin Trower fan. Have been since I heard "Day Of The Eagle." But, these two albums are quite disappointing. The guitar playing is nothing really fancy. I don't hear that Trower sound that I'm used to hearing. Saying that, there are still some decent cuts on this CD. Get the earlier albums first then move to these.
