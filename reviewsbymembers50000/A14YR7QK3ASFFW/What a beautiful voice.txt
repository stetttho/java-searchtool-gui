 She has been known for her country rock sound, but Linda Ronstadt shows what kind of voice she really has on this collection. This set contains all three albums she released with Nelson Riddle. These standards are treated  with the respect they deserve. Her voice is smooth and the arrangements fit  her perfectly. This is just a great collection.
