 This CD does a good job of sampling many of the best songs of Folk Music. "I'll Never Find Another You" by The Seekers is one that is not anthologized very often. You also get a small dose of Irish Folk with The  Rovers. This is not a bad introduction into the Folk Music genre. But, you  will want to purchase albums by these artists once you get this.
