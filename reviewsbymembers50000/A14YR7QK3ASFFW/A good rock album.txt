 This album came out and, I feel, turned rock and roll's head a little bit. These five guys knew how to dish out the rock with a touch of class. "Never Been Any Reason," known to many as Save My Life I'm Going Down For The Last Time, is a timeless treasure that is still being played on Classic Rock radio. This is not the best album by this band, but it is the only studio one available. Lead singer Jon Schlitt left the band and took over the vocals of Christian Rockers Petra.
