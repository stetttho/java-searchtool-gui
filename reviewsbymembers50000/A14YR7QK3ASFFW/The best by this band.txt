 I was first introduced to this band in 1978 and this album is my favorite. Michael Schenker is one of the best guitarist around. He can play the lightning runs and the melodic breaks. But, the real steal on this album is  the songwriting. They just matured on this album. "Too Hot To  Handle" "Try Me" "Gettin Ready" "Love To  Love"...they are all very good songs. This is the first of their  albums to pick up. It's almost a best of in itself.
