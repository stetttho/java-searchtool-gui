 I had a chance to see these guys a few years back and they floored me. I  became more than just a casual fan. This album, one of three accapella  projects they've done, is one of my favorites. The harmonies are just  dazzling. As for the selection of songs, they are very easy to learn and  sing along with. It's a shame that contemporary christian radio stations  will not play this music once in a while. These guys, along with accapella,  should be heard. Don't miss out. Buy this and enjoy.
