 Here is one of the weaker disc of this exhaustive look at the 70's. Personally, I could do without Mocedades and Sister Janet Mead. Terry Jacks is also another throw away. But, you do have Stealers Wheel, Black Oak  Arkansas, Blue Swede and Redbone and that offsets the worst on this CD.  This is one of the few disc in this series you will probably program to  skip songs.
