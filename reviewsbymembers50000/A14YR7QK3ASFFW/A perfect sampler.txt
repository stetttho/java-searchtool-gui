 The WOW series is the perfect way to sample CCM music. This 1998 CD is one of the best. I first discovered Caedmon's Call because of this CD. I also found Third Day. Plus, you get Michael W. Smith, Rebecca St. James, DC Talk, Jars Of Clay and much more. A total of 30 tracks makes this a good pick. In fact, it is hard to say which one is the best. This one just helped me find artist that I had never heard before.
