 This collection has 10 familiar songs. The true find is "Here Comes Summer" by Jerry Keller. This song is hard to find, but tells of true love separated by summer vacation. "I Saw Her Again Last Night"  by the Mamas and Papas is one that is not anthologized too often.  "Beach Baby" is a three minute blast of pure innocence. And who  can forget Tommy Roe's "Sweet Pea." The sound is also good,  considering the age of the music. The only drawback is that, at 10 songs,  there is plenty of room on the disc for other songs. Still, it is a disc  for the price.
