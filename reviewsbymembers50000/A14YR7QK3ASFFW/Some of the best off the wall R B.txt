 This collection goes into the sleezier side of R&B. "Sixty Minute Man" is true bravado. " "Big Long Slidin Thing" has the same effect as "Baby Let Me Bang Your Box." Add "Big Ten  Inch Record" and 14 others and you have one truely great set. Rhino,  of course, does a good job of transferring these songs to a digital format.  A good bang for your bucks.
