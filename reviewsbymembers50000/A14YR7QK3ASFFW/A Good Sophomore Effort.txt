 Pat Benatar's second album s her best. "Hit Me With Your Best Shot" and "Treat Me Nice" are good pop songs. She does a good job on the Rascals "You Better Run." But, the masterpiece on this album is "Hell Is For Children." She writes and sings about a difficult problem---child abuse. It is not overdone, but makes its point. Too bad that in 1980, nobody really paid attention to the message, just the music.
