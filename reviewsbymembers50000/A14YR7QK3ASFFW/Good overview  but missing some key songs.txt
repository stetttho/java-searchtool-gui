 This 80's metal band came and went real quick. In the process, they left some amazing songs. This collection does a decent job of collecting important songs from the band. But, it is missing "Our Love" from  the album "The Blitz." It is also missing a couple of early songs  that defined their sound, "Burning Bones" and "Tokyo  Nights." Besides those flaws, it is a good CD.
