 Imagine two guitar legends hooking up on an album. Imagine those two being blues artists and what you have is a fantastic album. Eric and B.B. compliment each other so well that your stereo might melt from the music  that comes out of it. The ferocity that B.B. gives each recording is what  you expect. Eric gives it a more subtle sound. Both play terrific solos and  the vocals are very passionate. My favorite track is "Key To The  Highway" simply because it is acoustic and that is my favorite style  of blues. This CD is what everyone who likes blues would expect from these  two. Absolutely fantastic!
