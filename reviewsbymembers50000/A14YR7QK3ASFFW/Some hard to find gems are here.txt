 R. Dean Taylor, Alive and Kicking, Mungo Jerry, Bobby Bloom, and Jerry Reed make this disc a must. The disc also has it's bad points and they ring loud and clear: the Partridge Family and Bobby Sherman. There is also the  average with Melanie and Hotlegs. As you go through this series, you will  find that many of the disc are like this one, very uneven with a few gems  that you will have a hard time finding anywhere else.
