 This was originally released as a doule album when it first came out. It focuses too much on Rocka Rolla and not enought from Sin After Sin. Sad Wings Of Destiny is well represented as it should be. This is not the  classic JP sound most are used to. It is a decent way to hear them building  their sound.
