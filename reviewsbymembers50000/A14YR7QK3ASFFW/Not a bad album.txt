 At first, I had a hard time listening to this album. It was very harsh sounding. After a few listens, I realized that this was just another masterpiece by this band. They went out on a limb, trying to break  themselves from the Andy Warhol scene. Had it been released later in their  career, nobody would have written this band off. As it was, it was their  second album and it alienated any possible new fans. That is sad. It's not  my first choice, but it is still one of my favorite's by this band.
