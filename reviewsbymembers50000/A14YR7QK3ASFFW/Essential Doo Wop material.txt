 The Crests had one of the best voices in Doo Wop in Johnny Maestro. His soaring vocals on "16 Candles" is truely astounding. "The Angels Listened In" is one song that should have made it but didn't  for some reason. This CD gives you these two and more gems. Buy this disc  and you will not be disappointed.
