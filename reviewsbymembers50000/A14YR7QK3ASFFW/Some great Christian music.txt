 Dallas Holm has one of the best voices in Gospel music. I first got hooked on the Live album and quickly found this one. I have always liked Rise Again, but I Saw The Lord and Here We Are are two songs that rank up there  with his best This CD does a good job of looking at his earlier work. I'm  just waiting for a CD that does him justice after this period.
