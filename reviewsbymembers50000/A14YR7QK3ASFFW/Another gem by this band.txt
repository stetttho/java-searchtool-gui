 This album shows a mellower side of this band. "Candy Says" and "Pale Blue Eyes" are two of the best songs that Lou Reed ever wrote. This album, had it been released after the first album, would have  probably opened them up to major popularity. Instead, it came after  "White Light, White Heat," one of the noisest albums ever  released. This album deserves to be heard. It is the one album that is  overlooked.
