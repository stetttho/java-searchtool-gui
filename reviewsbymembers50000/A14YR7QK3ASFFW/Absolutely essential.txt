 B B King is the number one Blues artist. This set proves that. Although it doesn't even scratch the surface of his recording career, it does a good job of introducing King to the person looking to get started with a  collection of his music. The more familiar fan will also like the selection  of songs provided. The cut with U2 from their Rattle And Hum album is also  very good. There is not a bad song on here. The only question is when will  there be a second box set so that we can enjoy more of his music in one  nice set? The booklet is also good and informative.
