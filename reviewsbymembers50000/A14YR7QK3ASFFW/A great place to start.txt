 This band could never really be represented by a compilation album. So, you need to find the best studio albums and go from there. ELP's debut is a good place to start. Along with Classic Rock staple "Lucky Man" you also have "Take A Pebble" and "Knife's Edge." The band really never sounded tighter than this. The next album, "Tarkus," proved that.
