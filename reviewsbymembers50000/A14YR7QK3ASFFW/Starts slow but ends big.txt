 With "Midnight At The Oasis" starting off the CD, you could think that this disc will be a wash. But, just a couple of cuts down, you will find "Radar Love" "The Night Chicago Died"  "Keep On Smilin" "Rock Me Gently" "Beach  Baby" and "I Can Help." My favorite on this disc is  "Life Is A Rock But The Radio Rolled Me," a look back at the  present and the past, done just a little different. One Bo Donaldson &  The Heywoods song is enough, so one could have been replaced by something  else. But, this is yet another gem of a CD showing the inconsistancies of  the 70's.
