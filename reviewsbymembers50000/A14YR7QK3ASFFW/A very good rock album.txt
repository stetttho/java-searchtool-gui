 These guys from Canada show they can rock on this album. The title track, "Roll On Down The Highway" and "Sledgehammer" are some of the best songs this band ever produced. "You Ain't Seen Nothin  Yet" is a good top 40 song while "Rock Is MY Life" is a good  song about the life of a rock and roll star. This is a good place to start  a collection of BTO.
