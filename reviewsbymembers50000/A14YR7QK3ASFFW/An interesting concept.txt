 On this CD, BB King brings in many of the people he influenced to remake many of his classics. As one reviewer mentioned, it really is not the true blues that many people have come to love from BB, but that is not all bad.  Just look at this list of names he teams with: Eric Clapton, Tracy Chapman,  Willie Nelson, The Rolling Stones, Bonnie Raitt. This is an impressive list  and they do a good job with the King Of The Blues.
