 This album, originally released in 1973, is a classic Nelson album. It contains "Whiskey River," and that should be enough. But, you add the title cut, "Sad Songs And Waltzes," "Devil In A Sleeping Bag" and eight others and you have a classic Willie Nelson album. It ranks up there with "Red Headed Stranger" as one of his best albums ever. It is a must own for fans of all music.
