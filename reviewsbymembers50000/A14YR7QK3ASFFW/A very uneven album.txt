 This is one of the weaker albums that Yes has released. It has grown on me some, considering I thought it was absolute garbage when I first heard it. "Don't Kill The Whale," "Does It Ever Happen," and  "Arriving UFO" are not bad songs. It's just that the band sounds  like they are going thru the motions. It was also one of the last albums  that Jon Anderson was on. Not as bad as "Tales From Topographic  Oceans" but not even close to "Fragile" or "Close To  The Edge."
