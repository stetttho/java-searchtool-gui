 I was looking for something to listen to while I surfed the web and put this album on. It is one of the best albums I own. After more than 20 years, it never sounds outdated. The duel guitars and vocal harmonies can't be beat. My favorite songs are "Time Was" "Blowin Free" and "Warrior". But, every song is simply astounding. How this band got overlooked in the 70's still amazes me. Please don't pass this up. It will be one of the worst decisions you could make. BTW it's not just for guitarists, but anyone who is looking for a good, talented band.
