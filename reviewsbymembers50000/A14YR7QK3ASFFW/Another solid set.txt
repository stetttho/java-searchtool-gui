 This disc will bring back some pleasant memories. Any disc with "Drift Away" on it is almost worth purchasing no matter what else is on it. This one just happens to have "Brother Louie" "It  Never Rains In Southern California" and "Stuck In The Middle With  You". The sound quality is exceptional, just like any disc by Rhino.
