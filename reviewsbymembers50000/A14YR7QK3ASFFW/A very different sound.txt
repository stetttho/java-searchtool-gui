 This is the first incarnation of Deep Purple. The song that most people are familiar with is "Hush" and it is the best song on the album. "And The Address" is a scorching instrumental. "Love Help Me" has a nice guitar solo and is a good pop song. If you're looking  for the headbanging sound of Deep Purple, this isn't it. But it's still not  that bad.
