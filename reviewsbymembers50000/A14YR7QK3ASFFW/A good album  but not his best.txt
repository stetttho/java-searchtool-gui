 John Hiatt is the voice that has not been heard by many. He is a great songwriter and has a unique vocal style that doesn't bore you. This album, while very good, is not his best. But, songs like "Death By  Misadventure" "She Loves The Jerk" and "Girl On A  String" are better than most songs that more popular artist release.  You can't go wrong if you purchase this CD. It is that good.
