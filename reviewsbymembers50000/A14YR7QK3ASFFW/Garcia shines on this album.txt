 This album came out at the time when the Grateful Dead was at their pennicle commercially. The album isn't much different than a Dead album from this period. A relaxing feel, above average vocals, and instrumental  dexterity. Garcia is a master of many string instruments. He shows it here.  It also contains many songs that popped up at Dead concerts at the time and  in later years. If you are a Dead fan, this album will fit right in. If you  have a mild interest, you might want to pick this up. It will surprise you  and may lead you to dig a little deeper.
