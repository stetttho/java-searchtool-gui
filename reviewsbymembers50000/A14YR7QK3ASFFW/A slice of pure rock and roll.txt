 These guys serve it up hot and heavy and get right to the point. "Got No Shame" is one of those songs that you will not forget once you hear it. The harmonica comes on in a bluesy form and then the band kicks it into gear and they don't stop for the whole album. This is what rock and roll should sound like, not some of the other stuff that is being passed out as true rnr.
