 These two albums are not the best by UFO. It sounds like they are just trying to finish the project so they can move on to something else. Phil Mogg is a better vocalist than what you will hear on this CD. Michael  Schenker is long gone and the rest of the band just goes through the  motions. Still, you can't ignore a song like "Chains Chains" and  that alone makes this worth the three stars I give it.
