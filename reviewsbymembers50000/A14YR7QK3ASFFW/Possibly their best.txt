 This album by BTO is my favorite. It rocks from the start with the title track. "She's A Devil" is one of Fred Turner's best vocal performances. Even the hit single "Hey You" is a heavier song,  compared to some of their other singles. This is the album I started my BTO  collection with 25 years ago.
