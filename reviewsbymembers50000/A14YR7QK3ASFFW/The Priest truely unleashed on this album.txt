 Judas Priest let it all go on this album. "Green Manalishi" "Exciter" and "Sinner" are powerful. But, the song that won me over was "Victim Of Changes." How much more powerful can a  song be. In the studio, this was just another heavy metal song from the  70's. On this album, it is a beast released on the listner. These guys have  always been a better live banc, and this album proves that. This was the  first album I bought by this band and it is still the one I listen to the  most.
