 Rhythm and Blues is some of the toughest music available. This set focuses on the King label. Based out of Cincinnati, King gave artist like James Brown a chance. Hank Ballard also recorded at King records. Work With Me Annie is one of the best songs never played on oldies radio. The booklet is  very imformative and the pictures are also nice. Many of the songs on this  disc have been forgotten, but thanks to this collection, they just might  make it back.
