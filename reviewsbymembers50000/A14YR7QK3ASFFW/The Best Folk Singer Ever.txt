 Pete Seeger is the most essential folk artist ever. This album proves that. It starts off with Seeger and his banjo, but moves quickly to the songs that made him popular. He also does a few Bob Dylan tunes, including  a wonderful version of "A Hard Rain's A Gonna Fall." The second  disc includes many familiar songs, including "This Land Is Your  Land," "We Shall Overcome," and his signature song  "Guantanamera." It also includes a number of introductions and  conversation with the audience. The original album only had a small portion  of this concert. Having the whole show enables a person to hear the magic.  Simply one of the best folk albums ever released.
