 I first heard Arise My Love when the choir of my church sang it in an Easter pageant. The song struck a chord wih me that I never forgot. This CD also has Can't Keep A Good Man Down. It is also one of my favorites by them. These guys have great harmonies and they do many different styles of Christian music. They are very good and inspire me probably more than any other group or singer.
