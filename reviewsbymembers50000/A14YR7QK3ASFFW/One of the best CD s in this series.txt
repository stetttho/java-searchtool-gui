 This CD contains a nice variety of oldies. Everybody knows CCR, Buddy Holly, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis and the other big names. The true find on this disc is "Silhouettes" by the Rays. It runs circles around  the version by Herman's Hermits. Mickey and Sylvia's "Love Is  Strange" is also good. Along with the Turtles and the addictive  "Teen Beat" by Sandy Nelson makes this a top notch collection.
