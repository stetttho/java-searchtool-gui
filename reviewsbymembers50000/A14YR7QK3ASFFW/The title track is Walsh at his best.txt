 "The Confessor" is the song that many fans of Joe Walsh had been waiting for. Not since "Rocky Mountain Way" has he shown that he can rock with a vengeance. "Good Man Down" also is a good rock  song. The rest of the album is a mixed bag, but the songs mentioned above  make this a better than average album.
