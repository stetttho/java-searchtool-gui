 The Moody Blues are one of my favorite bands. Along with this collection, I have almost all of the albums featured on this set. The set starts with some hard to find material from the pre-Days Of Futured Past album. Fly Me High is a lost gem. The other albums are represented very well. My only  complaint is that Go Now was not on this set. I know it doesn't sound like  the Moody Blues that most are familiar with, but it is still is a glaring  omission. Still, it is a good set and the bonus disc is a good addition.
