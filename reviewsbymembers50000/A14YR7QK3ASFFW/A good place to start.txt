 This first album by ELP is a very consistant listening experience. From "Knife's Edge" to "Lucky Man," ELP keeps things tight. It would be the last time they would do this for a full album. Many purists  believe that the more they stretch it out, the better they are. It all  depends how long you can listen to Keith Emerson make noises with the  keyboard. I can't for very long, that is why this release is my favorite.
