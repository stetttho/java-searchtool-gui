 Bob Dylan's throwaways are better than most people's keepers. This CD set brings that out loud and clear. Everybody can name their favorite Dylan song, but mine has to be "Foot Of Pride." I first heard this song  on the Dylan anniversary album. Lou Reed performed it and it blew me away.  There are many demo's and alternate arrangement of songs that make this  absolutely wonderful. It may not be your first choice for a Dylan album,  but you will want to obtain it quickly. It is that good.
