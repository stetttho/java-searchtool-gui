 When this record came out, pop music and rock and roll needed it. Gems like "Come On Come On" "Need Your Love" "Ain't That A Shame" "I Want You To Want Me" "Surrender"  and "Clocks Strikes Ten" just jumped out of your speakers. The  fans treated these guys like they were the Beatles. That they are not. But,  Rick Nielsen can write a catchy tune and Robin Zander has a good voice.  This album broke them in America and it deserves to be considered one of  their classics.
