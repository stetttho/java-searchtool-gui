 At first I was skeptical of this band, but a quick listen to this CD and I  was convinced these guys know what they are doing. "Straight  Shooter" goes for the jugular with a force that some Christians may  need while "Once Again Here We Are" has a nice melodic sound.  None of the songs are presented with a harshness that the lyrics can't be  understood. After all, it is the words, not the music, that matters. Bleach  is honest, CCM, that will leave you wanting more.
