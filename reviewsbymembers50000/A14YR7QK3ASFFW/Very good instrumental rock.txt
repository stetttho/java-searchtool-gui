 Bill Black was the bass player for Elvis in the early years. On his own, he continues to make quality music. This disc covers two of his albums. The first dozen tracks is the "Smokie" album. It contains two of his  big hits, "Smokie Pt2" and "White Silver Sands." He  shows his true rock roots, though, with "The Wheel." This song  stomps, moves with incredible speed, and will surprise you. The last dozen  tracks are remakes of early rock and standards. Again, the quality of the  music will suprise you. Early rock instrumentals don't get much better than  this.
