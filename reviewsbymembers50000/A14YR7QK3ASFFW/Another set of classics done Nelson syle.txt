 Willie Nelson has again pulled some of the best standards and has done them as only Willie can. It starts off with a Nelson original, December Day, and moves through such classics as the title track, "Sentimental Journey," "You Always Hurt The One You Love" and 11 others that will put a smile on your face and just make you feel good. The musicianship is first rate and Nelson's voice is a true classic. If you own the other standards albums, you will definately want this one. If not, then pick this one up. It is a treasure.
