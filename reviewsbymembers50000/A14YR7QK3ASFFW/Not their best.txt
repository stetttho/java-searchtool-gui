 This live album by the VU was a little disappointing. After listening to the studio albums, I thought this would be right up there with them. I was wrong. The performance was not that good. The selection of songs was fine,  it was what I would expect from a VU concert. However, I would want a  little more inspired performance. Go with the two volumes of Live 1969  first. It is much better.
