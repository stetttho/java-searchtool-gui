 While "Highway To Hell" is a better overall album, this disc has possibly the best song these guys ever did: "Sin City." This song absolutely kicks. The other songs on the album are strong. Angus can still  rip a solo off that will leave your ears bleeding. Bon Scott had one of the  most interesting voices in rock and roll. Get this one and rock your blues  away.
