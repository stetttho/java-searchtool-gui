 These guys make such nice music. The main review mentioned "I Can Only Imagine" and while that is a very good, this CD is packed with them. "Bless Me Indeed" is based on the prayer of Jabez and reminds us just how powerful our God really is. This is a must purchase for anyone who likes a variety in their music.
