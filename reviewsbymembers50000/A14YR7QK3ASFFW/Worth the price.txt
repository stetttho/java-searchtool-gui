 This twofer is one of the best deals you can get by the Kingston Trio. The album New Frontier is considered one of their best anyway and is worth the price of this selection. Add another album and you have a steal. I'm just  glad to see that something besides greatest hits collections are being  released by the Kingston Trio. They should be heard not just for the hits.  These guys can play guitar and banjo pretty fine also. Plus their harmonies  are not too shabby. Overall, this is a good buy.
