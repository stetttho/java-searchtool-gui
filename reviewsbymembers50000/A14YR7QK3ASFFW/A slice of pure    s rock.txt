 This album brings back memories of a decade when the music wasn't that good. Squier brought about a rock and roll sound that many stations wouldn't play until he opened the door. "The Stroke" was the top  40 hit, but album rock latched on to "My Kinda Lover" "In  The Dark' and "Lonely Is The Night." He's not the most talented  musician around, but his music does rock.
