 This is the strongest album Bowie has released. The scope of the character Ziggy Stardust is explored as Bowie transforms into the character. "Moonage Daydream" is my favorite song on the album.  "Starman" "Ziggy Stardust" and "Rock And Roll  Suicide" are right behind it. No other Bowie album, track for track,  can match this one.
