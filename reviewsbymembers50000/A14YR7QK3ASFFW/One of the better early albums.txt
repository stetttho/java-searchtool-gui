 This album is a powerful force in the NWOBHM. It followed Sin After Sin and is much better than that one. "Exciter" is a concert favorite and "Beyond The Realms Of Death" is one of their more melodic  moments. But, melodic for this band still kicks. Not the first JP album to  buy, but it is one to add to the collection.
