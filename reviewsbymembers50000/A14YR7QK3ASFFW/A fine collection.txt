 This 4 CD set does a good job of looking at an important rock band. The thing I like is that it collects stuff from the first two albums. This was before they really started stretching things out. It also touches on the later years, covering the albums 90125 and Big Generator quite well. The  box has the classic Yes artwork and the booklet is also nice. A good place  to begin a Yes collection.
