 The songs on this disc bring about a guilty pleasure when I listen to it. David Seville, the voice of the Chipmunks, is represented by "The Witch Doctor." Standard fare by Big Bopper, The Coasters, Dixie Cups,  Angels and Leslie Gore are also here. The one gem is Edd Byrnes  "Kookie Kookie Lend Me Your Comb." Overall, not a bad CD.
