 Following the very popular "Live At Budakahn," Cheap Trick unleashed this album on the public. While not bad, it begins to show some that CT was wearing down some. "Dream Police" and "I Know  What I Want" are two very good songs. But, my favorite track is  "Need Your Love." It first appeared on the Budakahn album and it  sounds just as good in the studio. One song I feel that is overrated is  "Gonna Raise Hell." The song never really made sense to me.
