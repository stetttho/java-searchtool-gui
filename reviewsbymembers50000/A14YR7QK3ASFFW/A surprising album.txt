 When this album came out, I was excited that a new Priest album was on the way. When I put it on, I was shocked at what I heard. This was not what I expected. But, it is a good, solid album. "Heading Out To The  Highway" is as strong as they have ever sounded. Each of the songs has  their own merits. The star of this album is drummer Dave Holland. He plays  better on this album than on any other JP album. Pick this up and be as  happy as I was.
