 This album answers the question of what happened to Noel Redding after he left the Jimi Hendrix Experience. The album is not that bad. "All Night Drinker," "She Came In The Morning," "Mr  Moonshine," and "Magic Forest" are all very good songs. The  sound of the group has a folk style to it. It is not what you might expect  from somebody who just left the JHE. Still, there are nice harmonies, some  exotic instruments (at least for rock and roll) and some decent  songwriting. Overall, a pretty good album.
