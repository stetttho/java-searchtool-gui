 The life of Woody Guthrie is one that is hard to trace. He lived the life of a hobo and one as a father and husband. Klein uses all the resources he possibly could possibly get to tell the life of the most imporant figure in  American Music. Guthrie suffered throughout his life, and the author makes  sure the reader understands that. He also points out that Guthrie was not  the most polite person, but that he also was one who cared for people. The  story of Woody's childhood right up to the time of his death is one that  needs to be read by anyone interested in the music of America.
