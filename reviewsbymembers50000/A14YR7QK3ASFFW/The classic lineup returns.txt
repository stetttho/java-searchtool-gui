 This is the Deep Purple lineup that most people are familiar with. But, this album doesn't bring back all the magic. The title track and "Knockin At Your Back Door" are two classic songs. But, the rest  of the album is hit and miss. This is not Machine Head or Fireball  material, but it is good and that classic Purple sound can still rock.
