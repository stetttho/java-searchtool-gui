 The Drifters are one of the most popular vocal groups of the 50's and early 60's. If "There Goes My Baby" "Up On The Roof" "On Broadway" and "Save The Last Dance For Me" ring a  bell, then you need this collection. If they don't and you want to explore  the early era of Rock And Roll before The Beatles hit the USA, then pick  this up. The sound is also good, considering the age of the music. Simply a  must have for any serious collector of music.
