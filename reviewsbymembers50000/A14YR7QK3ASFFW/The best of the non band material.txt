 This album shows that Hayward and Lodge were the prime reason the Moody Blues became so popular. It came out at a time when the Moodies were still a very popular 70's band. It doesn't sound that much different than a Moody  Blues album. One thing that is missing is the spoken word before songs. It  just shows the melodic and rock sides of these two. Hayward still has one  the of most pleasant voices.
