 I resisted "going digital" for a long time.  When I finally took the plunge and compared cameras, the Sony DSC-P200 was the standout.  Consider this:  The P200 has a metal case -- not plastic.  The lens is a Carl Zeiss -- the same German optical firm that makes lenses for Hasselblad and Leica.  The P200 is made in Japan by the same Sony subsidiary that makes the professional digital Betacams used in Hollywood.  The design of this camera deserves an award - the placement of the buttons, shifting of the lens to the extreme left side - the result is a camera that "feels right" -- never do I touch the wrong button, or have to search around for the right function.  The photos?  I shot Macro, fluorescent, incandescent, cloudy, and bright sunshine -- exposures were excellent and the 7.2 Megapixel Super HAD sensor produced images that did not pixelate until I had enlarged them to 200X!  I bought the Sony DSC-P200 (and I recommend getting a 512MB memory stick -- you can get 130 images at the highest quality setting) and the two of us have been inseparable.
