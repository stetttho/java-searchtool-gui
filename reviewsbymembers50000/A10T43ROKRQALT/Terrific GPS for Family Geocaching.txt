 My 8-year old son read an article about Geocaching and really got excited.  I wanted to get a GPS handheld that offered great value and ease-of-use.  I tried the Garmin eTrex, eTrex Legend, Geko and the Magellan eXplorist 200 (a local Geocaching club let me field test the units) and I downloaded the manuals from the Garmin/Magellan websites and poured over them. The verdict -- I bought the eXplorist 200.  The base map gives you the major freeways, highways, and cities -- even parks and national landmarks.  The buttons and functions were the most intuitive of any of the models tested -- very important when you have children operating the unit.  The LCD screen is as big as the expensive models and highly legible in ambient light.  My son loves it and the entire family is getting lots of hikes and geocaching done in the great outdoors. What happens next?  I will save up for a more powerful unit with a PC connection, map software, etc, now that we are hooked on GPS navigation.  The eXplorist will remain with my son -- like cell phones, it is always a good idea to have an extra one around...
