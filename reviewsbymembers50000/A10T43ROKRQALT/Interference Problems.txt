 I am on my fourth set of wireless headphones (having gone back and forth between radio frequency (RF) and infrared (IF) designs).  In general the RF perform better (especially the newer digital models) and I genuinely liked the RCA's UNTIL a neighbor purchased a 900 mhz base station for his cordless phone system.  The resulting interference rendered the RCA's useless (it turns out that current cordless phone designs send out transmissions even when the phone is not in active use).  Keep this eventuality in mind if you live close to other people -- what works today won't necessarily work tomorrow...
