 This recording deserves a special Grammy award -- it is both disturbing and hilarious at the same time.  The surreptitiously recorded rantings of two roommates in San Francisco (one gay, one straight, both drunk) is full of profanity and painful historical references ("I am not saying that Hitler was right... but") that deserve a listen in total privacy.  I am not kidding -- make sure that no children, spouses, co-workers, or witnesses of any kind are in the vicinity when you play this baby...
