 As a dentist, I take a lot of intraoral (macro) photographs.  I have a Minolta X570 as my main camera and recently added the Canon Rebel Ti.  I agree with the user who recommended that you read the manual several times -- it took me three "reads", with the camera in front of me, to really grasp the "creative modes" -- but the effort is well worth it.  Yes, you can use the camera forever on the fully automatic mode, but learn (at least) the following: -- AEB (auto exposure bracketing): the Rebel Ti will take one shot at exact metering, then one shot stopped down and up (you decide the bracket range).  One of them will be the "money" shot. -- multiple exposures:  it sounded hokey to me initially, but the ability to superimpose images is fun to experiment with and yields surprisingly good results. A-DEP (automatic depth of field): this one is worth the price of admission!  When subjects are at various focal lengths from the lens, use this feature.  The Canon's brain will determine the nearest subject and farthest subject (as covered by the seven autofocus marks in the viewfinder) and compute the ideal shutter speed and aperture necessary to render all in focus. **WARNING** If you buy the Rebel Ti kit at a warehouse (Costco or Sam's), check the lens -- it probably has the designation "III" on the front.  The one from Amazon (and camera stores) has a "II" on the lens ring -- according to the Canon EOS website, the II has more elements and better specs than the III.  If you can find a Rebel Ti kit with a lens marked "USM", that one is better still -- but the kit price will be ...more (and I doubt that the optical quality difference is even noticeable).
