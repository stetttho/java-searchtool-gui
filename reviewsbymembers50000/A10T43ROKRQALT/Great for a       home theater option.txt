 My situation is this -- my son is too young to watch action movies, and if I were to "rock the house" with a 5.1 surround sound speaker system after his bedtime, I would be guilty of child abuse.  Since my Projection TV is already using a pair of JBL speakers in a stereo set-up, I bought this Sony subwoofer to upgrade to a 2.1 set-up (two stereo speakers and a powered subwoofer).  The extended bass really enhances our television/DVD viewing, and remains kid-friendly.  One key point -- take the time to measure your stereo speakers per Sony's instruction manual and set the Crossover switch (on the subwoofer) accordingly.  It will give you peak performance from this subwoofer...
