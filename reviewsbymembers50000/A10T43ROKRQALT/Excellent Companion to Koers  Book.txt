 Previously, I had purchased Diane Koers' "Paint Shop Pro 9: Photographers' Guide" from Amazon.  It is an excellent book, and I highly recommend it.  Over time, however, I found some gaps in Koers' book and so I purchased McMahon's book.  Now, I find I refer to McMahon's book more than Koers. McMahon does a better job of explaining PSP9's toolbars and basic workings.  He also gives valuable insights into the digital darkroom while he discusses PSP9's functions.  Like Koers, he uses excellent examples and sample photos to illustrate his points.  The print quality is outstanding (the book was printed in Italy and, as with all Elsevier publications, the offset process is exemplary) and enhance the lessons. For the aspiring photographer who wants to master digital darkroom techniques using PSP9, I recommend the following books: This one (of course!) Diane Koers' "Paint Shop Pro 9: Photographers' Guide" David Kays' "Paint Shop Pro 9 for Dummies"
