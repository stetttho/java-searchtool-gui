 I doubt that Artisan even bothered to remaster this DVD release -- it looks like it was either 1) taken directly from the Laserdisc master or (and most likely) 2) taken from a general release print (not the original print) of the movie.  What a shame -- Artisan usually produces some great DVD packages, but not this time.  Save your . . . money. . . and wait until a better DVD transfer hits the shelves...
