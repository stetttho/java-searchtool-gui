 Koers book is outstanding -- but as a novice digital photographer and fledgling digital image editor, I needed something else to supplement Koers' book.  The winning combination for me was to first read David Kay's "Paint Shop Pro 9 for Dummies" and THEN leap into Koers' book.  Between the two books, I am doing things in my "digital darkroom" that I never thought I would be capable of.
