 I agree with most of these reviews -- this printer is an awesome value -- after years of suffering through HP's tricolor cartridge scalping, the separate ink tank solution is a godsend.  One important tip -- some reviewers will recommend that you place photo paper in the sliding paper tray (horizontal, beneath the printer) and plain paper in the vertical (top) tray.  This approach will send the coated paper through a tight print path that can lead to paper jams and cracked coatings.  Best to use plain paper in the bottom tray and only load photo paper in the vertical tray as needed.
