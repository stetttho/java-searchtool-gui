 I purchased a pair of Altec Lansing's 220 speakers for my son's computer (he is 7 years old and does not need extreme bass for games -- yet!).  Desk space was restricted, and these work very well.  BUT - since I have a pair of 2.1 speakers at my office (2 satellite speakers and one subwoofer), I need to stress that if you really want GREAT sound from computer speakers, you must seriously consider a 2.1 arrangement.  Once you listen to music & games with a quality subwoofer, no 2.0 system can match it...
