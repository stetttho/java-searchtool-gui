 What are you looking for in a guide to business dress? Nearing the end of school and needing to learn how to dress like a professional? Wanting to tweak your wardrobe to squeeze every ounce of potential out of it?  This book is a tried-and-true primer on conservative dress. The original version (1976) and this version convey essentially the same message. Go with what will make your superiors comfortable. Avoid fads and build a predictable wardrobe. If it works, don't fix it. This works.  There aren't a lot of glossy photos. This isn't GQ fad. Some sections are a bit light. So be it. A lot of what's missing in this book can be fleshed out googling for specifics, or by a few minutes flipping through another book in the book store.  While other readers are bothered by the authors "research methodology," I am not. Sure, there are times when it seems that the research is tailored to his message. However, the author has decades of experience. I have read several books on the subject, and they all essentially parrot this one. I accept that research is this author's schtick. As one or more reviewers might have complained, the research may appear flawed, but I contend the conclusions are valid.  So what if the research is meant to dazzle? When several other books on conservative style agree, then they must all be right. I was given my copy of this book by an executive friend of a major company. He chalks up some of his success to this book, and I can say that in dress he follows the advice of this book. I'm mid-career and see this merit of this book. He's at the top and swears by it.  The author hoped to convey three messages: 1) your attire is a tool, 2) the name of the game is efficiency, and 3) that the reader see that some of what is offered will add to his success. I believe all three were well-conveyed.   Finally, it's a quick read.
