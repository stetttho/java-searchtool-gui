 Before you take to heart all the positive reviews, please note the dates and style of writing. Two seperate reviews use the exact same way of quoting sources (three hyphens). I believe all the postive reviews are anonymous. That should be another warning sign.  There are other one-star reviews that also point this out. When you see this book reviewed in other books, please note what appears to be a bad faith use of the review system. The author has a place to review the book so you know it is him. I'm not saying the author is the one placing these reviews, but it would be hard to find another so motivated to tout a book.  Thus, while this might be a good book, if in order to gain prestige it is reduced to planting false reviews, then it is not worth the effort. Fruit of the poisoned tree, so to speak. Should not profit from abusing the review system.
