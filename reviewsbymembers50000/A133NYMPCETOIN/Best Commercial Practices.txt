 What do you want me to say? This book is but one of a series. It is not a panacea for all your ills. It only talks about developing quality software when you're under the gun. My colleagues agree that these guys put together the best commerical practices of the past 20 years into one adaptive methodology. The cool thing about this is that you don't have to impliment the thing en todo to get the results you want. Find what you like and start there. Overall I found this book a delightful read. The chapters are short, like XP's iteration cycle. Short is sweet when you're an over-worked programmer like me. At first I was underwhelmed by this approach, but it works! The annotated bibliography in the back of this book (and others in this series) helps understand the author better and give you context. This book offers practical advice.
