 Okay, I first happened upon this book in a book store closing--fifty  cents. Penny for penny this remains perhaps the best quality novel I've  read in the Sci Fi genre. Mind you, this was my first step into Culture.  The dry wit of much of it had me rolling and begging my friends to let me  read bits to them. I ragged my first copy and bought a second to loan to  friends who always come back asking about other novels. Out of print?!  No! But, you can't buy it in the US, it seems.  One reviewer called it a  prezel of a plot. Nope. The book starts in the middle and as it moves on to  the end it unravels the plot toward both the beginning and the end.  Granted, it did mean that things didn't make as much sense until the end,  but that's Iain's game. Play it. Read it.
