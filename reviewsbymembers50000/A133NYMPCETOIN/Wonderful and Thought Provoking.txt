 What can I say? This was a Pulitzer winner and I have to agree. He does an excellent job of presenting his thesis and exposing a different way of looking at the reason why the European cultures came to dominate our globe. As an aspiring novelist who was looking for a foundation to shape his own fictional settings I found this text provided a wealth of thoughts. Of course, some of my friends would say I'm always off in my own fictious world anyway!
