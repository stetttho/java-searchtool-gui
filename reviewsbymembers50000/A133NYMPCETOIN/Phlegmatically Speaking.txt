 I have gifted this book to two aspirant programmers. One inhaled the contents and found several nuggets of truth that were worth the reading. It's written in short blocks of text for the commuting reader, and the flow is up to the reader. Find what interests you and dig in. There is one obvious plug for Ruby--and the definitive work when this book was published was written by the authors.
