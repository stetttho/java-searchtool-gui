 I was recently asked by a peer (a senior software engineer more at home with Java than Perl) my opinion of this book. After writing it I thought it suitable enough for framing: "Hmm. Learning Perl and Programming Perl 3e both have roughtly the same information. However, the presentation in Learning Perl is a little more clear on some topics--and is more suitable for less experienced programmers. My recommendation is that you shy away from Learning Perl unless you find that Programming Perl 3e does not fulfill all your basic Perl needs." This is to say that if you are reasonably technical and able to pick up on programming, Programming Perl is more suitable than Learning Perl. I have found both invaluable in my career, but looking back I realized that Programming Perl has been most helpful. The authors of this book are the names in Perl. They are intimately familiar with the material and have had years of experience in finding the best way to present the material. I also suggest the Perl Cookbook, but it has enough recommendations on its own.
