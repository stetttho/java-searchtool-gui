 I devoured this book. As another has stated, this book gets into the minutea of Roosevelt's life. You can almost see the rocks as he climbs them. Living in DC makes some of my haunts seem so much more . . . historic. However, I think the author did a very subtle job of providing insight and interpretation than one might expect. I also found heaps of fragrant (not flagrant) historical (and histerical) perspective that fertilized my imagination. When I last covered this period of history (in school, unwilling), it seemed so dry and disjointed. This work put all the zest of life back into it. I came away from the book with real appreciation for his accomplishments, even though I may disagree with the man's politics in certain areas. One must wonder if the title "Theodore Rex" mightn't be a play on Tyrannosaurus Rex as well as an allusion to the subject's autocratic style. One thing I didn't like so much was how quickly he rambled through the last year of his Presidency in the last hundred pages. I felt like the author was trying to finish his work in time for publication. He glanced over items I would have thought he would normally have delved into. You can certainly tell the author was trying to convince you he did his homework, and he did.
