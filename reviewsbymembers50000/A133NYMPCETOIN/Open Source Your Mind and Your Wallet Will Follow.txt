 With the other review being so glowing, I find myself scratching my head for something further to add. I don't find myself out of the country or frequently travelling, my music tends to hover in three areas: work, home, and auto. The last two are covered, but getting music at work can be a bit trying. This is where this little jewel comes in handy. With as many hours of music as this wee metal box can provide, I'm never at a loss for different music to listen to. However, I'm one of those odd open-source (i.e., Linux) types, so I'm always looking for a way to integrate different hardware. Archos is very platform neutral--while they actively support Windoze and Mac, this little guy works on Linux. So, I only have to rip my CDs once and then copy them down.  The website cites a Linux USB driver link, but that proved not to be to useful. If you're sporting the right Linux kernal, you need only configure it right (my distribution had it configured by default, making this almost plug-n-play), and the rest is a cinch (edit a text file, one command line command).  I also keep a few key configuration files on my Archos so if I need to start from scratch with an install I can bring back those configurations more quickly. On other notes, it takes a little while to get used to the minimalist controls--that 'off' can also mean 'stop' doesn't register at first, so don't be afraid to experiment. The player responds to "m3u" playlists. I'm currently assuming that the USB connection also provides power to play and charge the batteries.
