 This book essentially revolves around the key social struggle of the Twentieth Century, Communism v. Capitalism. However, as I read this work I realized that the struggle, as Chambers saw it, was Modernity v. Christianity. Chambers paints himself as a man who is convinced that Modernity would reign supreme, and that the quientessential representative of Modernity is Communism. Chambers also exposes Alger Hiss and brought the infiltration of Communism in US Government to the fore. This topic is a passionate one on both sides, but the Venona Papers (declassified KGB documents) bear witness to the accuracy of Chamber's accusations. In the end, Alger Hiss was convicted of perjury for lying about being a Soviet agent. The statute of limitations for the crime of being an agent had lapsed. This is a powerful, emotional book. If a book can pursuade a lifelong Democrat to register Republican for the first time, and put him on a collision course with history, then the book is worth the read--even if you disagree with the thesis. From what I gather, this book led to Ronald Reagan running for President.
