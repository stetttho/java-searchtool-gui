 A single voice amongst so many, what can I say? Python itself is such a straight-forward, easy-to-learn language already that it requires little documentation to convey its syntax and concepts. In this respect Python meets the goals of its designer and prophet. This book wastes no time in providing the reader with this syntax and the underlying concepts. If you are a programmer of worth then picking up this book and an afternoon should teach you Python. It worked for me, and if you ask my fellow programmers my worth is subject to open and heated debate. I do a lot of my programming in some C and a lot of Perl and other scripting tools. So the foundation was there. Within a short time this book had me writing classes with automated debugging and documentation. I have yet to find another Python book that does the job as effectively in as few pages. If you're looking for a code-by-the-numbers tutorial, this isn't for you, however. Check out "Learning Python" by O'Reilly for that. The "Programming Python" explains the myriad modules that are available for Python and serves more as a cookbook. (I suppose having a book entitled "Python Cookbook" would generate misconceptions as to the content.)
