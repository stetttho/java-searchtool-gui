 First, I would like to point out that Banks is my favorite author. I think one of the least enjoyable experiences I have had in reading is when the author resorts to his power to alter the course of events so the good guys can win when normally they would have lost. Banks does this. I was really disappointed. Everything else of his was great, but he literally pulled the cavalry out of his head. I kept thinking toward the end that it was absolutely hopeless for the protagonists. I'm used to getting a good laugh or being handed a well-shrouded bit of philosophy, but I also found that lacking here. Some of the characters are cardboard cut-outs as well. However, he's trying to present an arguement for the Culture here, in a style somewhat similar to the French Romanticists of two centuries ago.
