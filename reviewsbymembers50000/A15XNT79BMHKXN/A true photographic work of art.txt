 Had the opportunity recently to see many of the pictures from this book during a Steve McCurry exhibit at the George Eastman House in Rochester.  If you are in the Rochester, NY area I highly reccommend this exhibit.  Just amazing pictures.  McCurry combines the immediacy of photojournalism with the artist's use of color and composition.  Steve McCurry's work is a must for any lover of beautiful, thought-provoking photographic art.
