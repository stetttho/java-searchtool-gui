 This used to be a great magazine.  Now it's just sad.  Lately they've started running lots of silly photos with even sillier (and not the least bit funny) captions.  A lame attempt to copy the success of men's magazines like Maxim and Stuff.  I guess this is how they fill up pages nowadays, rather than attempt any meaningful coverage of the music industry.  Recent cover stories have featured such cutting-edge music acts as Justin Timberlake, Christina Aguilera, and (dare I say?)... CLAY AIKEN.  If this is your idea of good music then by all means purchase this magazine.
