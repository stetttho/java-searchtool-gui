 First let me say that the opening few minutes of this movie blew me away - the opening credit sequence alone is almost reason enough to rent this movie.  And David Fincher definitely creates some of the most striking visual images you'll see on film. (But, as he proved in Alien 3, visual style alone doesn't make a good movie).  I especially liked when Norton was walking through the Ikea catalog that was his apartment.  Norton, Bonham-Carter, and especially Pitt give powerful perfomances. However, I found that this film amounted to less than the sum of its parts.  Get past all the violence, and the anti-consumer philosophy, and this movie is basically a satirical comedy about a depressed guy who's losing it.  And it's not very funny or entertaining.  None of the "philosophical" stuff in this movie is anything new, nor is it especially profound.  The idea of a programmed, white-collar drone who walks half-asleep through life has been addressed hundreds of times before, all the way back to "Metropolis" (or hell, even "Joe vs. the Volcano").      The messages are clear and not really very thought-provoking:  consumerism, advertising, and big business bad.  The comforts of modern society prevent us from feeling truly alive.  We become owned by the things we own.  Man has been turned into a self-help parody of himself by all the so-called "men's movements" that only aim to make man a more feminine version of himself.  Is any of this stuff really that deep or thought-provoking?  Have any of us not thought about this stuff until "The Fight Club"?      The bottom line is that this movie is trying to be more than it is - had it focused on being simply a dark comedy, maybe it would have worked.  Instead, it tries so hard to be hip and subversive that it simply doesn't end up being very entertaining. Maybe this movie will appeal to angry young people who are fed up with "the system".  But for most others, it will be a lot of sound and fury, signifying nothing.
