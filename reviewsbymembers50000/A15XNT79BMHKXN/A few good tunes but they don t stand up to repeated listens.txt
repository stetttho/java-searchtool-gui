 Kind of blah power pop, with the slower numbers "Return" and "Shortly Before the End" the best, along with the catchy "There's a Fire".  Most of the other songs are completely forgettable, especially "C-C-C-Cinnamon Lips" and "You're So Damn Hot".  The keyboards and backing vocals sound pretty good, but the lead singer's voice has very little range or personality.  I give them credit for selling this CD for a (somehwhat) reasonable price... but all in all it's just not that good.  I'd recommend any Fountains of Wayne or Superchunk CD over this if you like good catchy power pop.
