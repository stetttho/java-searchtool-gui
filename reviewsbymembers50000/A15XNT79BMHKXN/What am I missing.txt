 First off, let me say that I love old movies - and I love Hitchcock, especially "Rear Window" and "Vertigo".  But this movie simply didn't do anything for me. As a suspense film, it lacked much suspense.  The big revelation by Maxim near the end of the film had very little dramatic impact - and the expository scene with Mrs. DeWinter's doctor, where much of the plot was explained, was dull and felt tacked-on.   As a love story, it lacked chemistry - Maxim was such a boring, obnoxious cad that I couldn't believe anyone would want to marry him.  His new wife was a snivelling mouse who allowed everyone to abuse her.  And that housekeeper!!  Can you say "over the top"??  Anyone besides me wonder why she was even kept as an employee there??  I would think that trying to convince the mistress of the house to committ suicide might be grounds for dismissal!!  Every time I saw that housekeeper I kept thinking of Cloris Leachman from "Young Frankenstein".   Which, by the way, was a far superior movie to this one.
