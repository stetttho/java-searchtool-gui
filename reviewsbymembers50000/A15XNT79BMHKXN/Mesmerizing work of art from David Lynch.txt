 Trying to explain the "plot" of this film is missing the point.  Mulholland Drive is the best anyone's ever come at translating a dream (or nightmare) to film.  It perfectly captures the surreal quality, disjointed logic, and manic fright of a feverish dream.  Like Lynch's other classic Blue Velvet, this movie isn't meant to be explained so much as it's meant to be FELT.  Like all great art, Mullholand Drive will have a definite impact on you, even if you don't quite understand it - in much the same way a great painting or piece of music has a profound effect on us, even when we can't articulate the reason. This is truly a classic, a film that you'll remember long after you've seen it.  After watching Mulholland Drive, you'll have the same uneasy, disoriented feeling you get when you first wake up from a particularly frightening dream.  David Lynch is a true artist, and Mulholland Drive is his crowning achievement.
