 I had the pleasure of seeing Superchunk live recently, and they were AMAZING.  Do yourself a favor and go see this band!!!   Anyway this is the first Superchunk CD I've bought, so I can't get into the whole "old vs. new" debate - all I can say is that the songs on this CD are awesome.  "Late Century Dream" and "Phone Sex" are beautifully produced and mellow - but they also know how to rock out on songs like "Out on the Wing" and "Rainy Streets".  It's the mix of quieter songs with all-out rockers that makes this a great CD from beginning to end.  Every song is so catchy that you'll be humming them long after you turn off the CD player. Buy this CD, you won't be disappointed.  And go see Superchunk in concert - you'll become an instant fan like I did!!
