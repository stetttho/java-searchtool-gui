 Like most people I was a little skeptical about any program that promised results in only one workout a week.  I had been lifting weights (along with cardio) 3-4 times a week, and although I was in decent shape I felt like the results weren't matching my effort.  I've always been a thin guy with a thin frame, and so I wasn't trying to look like a bodybuilder or NFL linebacker.  I just wanted to stay in shape, and I felt like my workouts weren't as efficient as they could be. This very readable book outlines a sane program for busy people.  And, more important than the time savings - the results are amazing.  By giving my body time to rest and recouperate, and by following the author's very reasonable nutrition advice, my results in 2 months have been better than the last 2 years of traditional exercise.  Trust me, it works. A couple of caveats however:  while this program is only once a week, that doesn't mean its a peice of cake.  It's hard.  Most people really have no idea what it feels like to push their muscles to true exhaustion, with no momentum to help lift the weight.  I know I didn't!  After one 30-minute workout, you'll be spent.  You'll be more tired than after an hour of your old weightlifting.  But the way I see it, that just means that my old way of working out wasn't as eficient as Power of 10. Also, I'm not sure I agree with the author's total disdain for cardio.  I still do a little running or biking a couple of times a week, to supplement the weight lifting.  I feel that the stress relief and heart/lung exercise that comes with cardio can't be matched by weight lifting alone. This book is well written, nicely illustrated, and has sane advice that most normal people can follow.  Give it a try for a few months and you'll be a convert!
