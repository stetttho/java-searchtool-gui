 This movie is so bad it's HYSTERICAL... quite simply, Staying Alive is the best unintentionally funny film of all time (edging out also-rans like "Cocktail" and "Duets").  The dance sequences alone are enough to have you doubled over with laughter.  The musical finale (Satan's Alley - a "musical trip through hell") is so mind-numbingly bad it has to be seen to be believed.  I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who needs a good laugh.
