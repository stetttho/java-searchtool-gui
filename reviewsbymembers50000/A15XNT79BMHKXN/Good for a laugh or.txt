 Wow.  This movie's bad.  But it's good for a laugh if you're in the mood for some brainless fun.  Patrick Bergen gives one of the great over-the-top performances of all time as the psycho husband.  Among the many major plot holes:  Hubby smacks Julia because he thought she was checking out their new neighbor on his boat.  Then a few days later he's arranging for them both to go sailing with the same guy, on his boat!  (Wouldn't the psychotically jealous husband try to keep his wife away from the man he thinks she's lusting after?)  Also, the fact that she would fake her drowning in the OCEAN - but flush her wedding ring (halfway) down the TOILET - is not the smartest move to say the least.  Might wanna just ditch that ring in the ocean while you're faking your own death next time, Julia!  Gotta admit though, I loved that the psycho hubby would sneak into Julia's house and actually take time to rearrange the cans in the cupboard before he hides.  What a neat freak.  The final plot hole involves her new boyfriend in Iowa, who would likely be more interested in Patrick Bergen than Julia, if you know what I'm saying.
