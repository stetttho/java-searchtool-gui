 This Fuji Finepix camera is very good, especially for beginners who want a simple, "goof-proof" digital camera.  I've had the camera for about 3 weeks now, and the pictures have come out sharp, with excellent color and detail.  The flash is remarkably good for such a small and inexpensive camera. The 3x optical zoom works well, and the autofocus is a step up from some of the "focus-free" models.  The LCD screen is bright and clear, and the 20-second movie clip mode is a fun feature.  Overall a good camera and a great value - it even comes with rechargeable batteries, a charger, a 16MB smartmedia card, and a USB cable!  These are things that can cost extra with other models.  About the only thing it doesn't come with is a carrying case...  I use the Lowepro Z20 pouch and it fits the camera nicely (and it's only [$$$] bucks on Amazon). The only negatives I've found?  First, the viewfinder is positioned right on top of the LCD screen, resulting in a lot of nose-print smudges on the screen.  Secondly, this camera is geared more towards people who want true "point and shoot" photography - it gives you very little manual control over settings such as aperture, shutter speed, etc.  If you're looking for more control, you'll probably want to look elsewhere.  However, if you want an excellent camera that consistently takes good pictures, this Fuji is a great buy.
