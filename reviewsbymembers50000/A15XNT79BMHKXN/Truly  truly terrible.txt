 There's bad movies that are fun to watch because they're so unintentionally hilarious (ala "Cocktail", "St. Elmo's Fire", and "Staying Alive") - and then there's movies that are just plain painful to watch.  Duets is the latter.      Rarely does bad acting, directing, and screenwriting come together like this - in such perfect proportions to create a truly unwatchable stinker, a BOMB in the true Hollywood sense. I liked Paul Giammatti in other movies, but his character is such an annoying, whiny loser you wish Andre Braugher would just pull out his .45 and put him out of his (and the audience's) misery.  But at least he's not as lifelessly dull as the other cardboard cutouts in this movie.  I'd have rather seen a whole movie about the fat guy who sang "Copacabana".      Who'd have thunk a movie could be so bad when it's about the high-stakes, exciting, and glamorous world of - karaoke?  I bet Gwyneth still isn't speaking to daddy after he talked her into being in this turkey.
