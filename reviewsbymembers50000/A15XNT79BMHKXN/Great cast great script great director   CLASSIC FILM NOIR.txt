 LA Confidential is an utterly engrossing look into the seamy side of the 1940's "City of Dreams".  All the actors are brilliant, especially Crowe, Pearce, Spacey, and Basinger in the lead roles.  And James Cromwell is just dynamite as Captain Dudley Smith.  But the real star of this film is the fantastic screenplay, as well as the great cinematography and direction. Curtis Hanson and crew have created a modern masterpiece.  Any fan of film noir, detective movies, or just great filmmaking should see LA Confidential immediately.
