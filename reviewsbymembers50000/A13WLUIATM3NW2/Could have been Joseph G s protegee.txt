 Being European, I was interested in how this promoter of peace and understanding between the nations was judging the world at large. Alas, what I found was a racist, xenophobic, queer bashing imperialist who lacks the intelligence of Michael Moore and, more inportantly, his humanity and compassion. Her opinions about the Middle East and Europe have already been quoted by other reviewers, therefore I won't repeat them here. There can only be one conclusion as to why this woman is so full of hate: Poor thing couldn't make it in 1930's Germany, which is why she has to take out all her anger and frustation on her liberal fellow Americans as well as us commie-loving Europeans. I'm sure this bleached blonde with her Aryan good looks would have made it big within a certain party that ran my country for 12 atrocious years. Although it's not known whether Joseph Goebbels was into anorexic broads, he certainly would have appreciated Ms.Coulter's vileness and natural talent for demagoguery. This book is only for those who are unable to think for themselves and thus need a "strong hand" (or shall I say, a "good whippin'"?) to help them form a political opinion.
