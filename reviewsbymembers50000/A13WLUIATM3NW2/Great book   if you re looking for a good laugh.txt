 This book anwers the question as to why America - at least in its current incarnation! - is  so beloved the world over.  Reading this book, one actually has to wonder how the author manages to get out of bed each morning, when the whole world has conspired to make life miserable for this paranoid wingnut.  It is obvious that this "manifesto" was written for a strictly redneck audience in the U.S.  However,  what's so hilarious about it, is the fact that they actually take this drivel seriously, as evidenced by the glowing five-star-reviews this book is receiving (I especially love the more passionate ones which are predicting the end of "American Civilization"!).    This book is filled with so many humorous one-liners and anecdotes, that it can only come across as political satire. It will therefore provide many hours of laughter - not just for you, the reader, but also for the author who will be laughing all the way to the bank, if you buy this insipid trash.   Recommended for one of the greatest parodies of the stereotypical ignorant, jingoist and paranoid "Ugly American" ever put to print!!
