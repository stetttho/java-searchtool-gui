 I am enjoying other DES books, but "The English Air" deals directly with politics and the start of WWII.  It is impossible to mix the pleasant "hammock book" world of DES with discussions of concentration camps, Nazi war preparations etc. DES' world is one where the characters are already nostalgic for the good old days, and her Scotland is vaguely like LLBean's "Maine"- fun but probably remote from the place ordinary people inhabit. It is not a world of politics and military action. Once these things are brought together, I found myself facing up to the hidden politics of all the rest of DES' world: i.e. her manly young British heroes go off to various parts of the Empire to fight "bandits."  Some of these bandits may have been nationalist freedom fighters- but the point is, no one reads DES to get into these issues.  "The English Air" makes them unavoidable.
