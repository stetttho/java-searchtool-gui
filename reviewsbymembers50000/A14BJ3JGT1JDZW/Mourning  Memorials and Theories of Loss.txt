 This is a scholarly anthology of essays covering themes of mourning, memorialization and cultural changes.  Some of the essays are densely theoretical, some retrieve fascinating historical material.  The scope is very broad.  One thing missing is a contribution on the clinical research on bereavement, of which there is by now a lot.  This anthology would be suitable for an upper-level college or graduate school text.
