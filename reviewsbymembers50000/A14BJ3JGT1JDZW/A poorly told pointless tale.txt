 A half-dozen characters gradually join together, sort of, and an enormous amount of space is wasted on backchat, while the central action gets slighted. The only real drama comes from scenes of burned out massacred  villages, as if the author must keep our interest by evoking real  historical horrors, because otherwise the book's contents are so  uninteresting.  I like fantasy tales, but to work they require storytelling  skill, a sense of action and direction which this book lacks.
