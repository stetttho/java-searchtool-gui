 As a fan of this long series, I would give this installment a higher rating than the one before it.  But by now, how few women characters remain! Only Flora, after Mary the Terrorist is executed very early on.  Either women aren't active in wartime (not true) or Turtledove's fans, being mostly male, won't notice the gradual disappearance of Sylvia, Anne et al.
