 I hoped this book would offer a solid definition of "spirituality" and an attempt to survey a difficult area, already plagued by too many idiosyncratic definitions and approaches.  This is one more; the author severs "psyche" from "spirit," then has trouble placing Jung and Grof and many others clearly writing about "both," or rather, refusing to make this separation.  A more basic problem for scholars in religion, psychology and cultural studies is the author's wanting to have his cake- an intrinsic, essential, trans-cultural core of "spirituality" that is more primordial than any religion - and eat it too, by incorporating specific cultural/religious constructs into his definition of the above.  Frustrating, and the charts and diagrams to not help.
