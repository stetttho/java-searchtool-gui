 This book takes us back to the 18th century Methodists, to see how "the art of dying" gradually became "technique."  From pastors to doctors, the control and management of dying has an extensive history, with debates over "euthanasia" and painless death going back well over 100 years, and pre-dating contemporary medical technology.  The author also documents how "euthanasia" as now understood was linked to eugenics and sterilization, attempts to medicalize perceived public problems through policy shifts.  This is a thoughtful contribution,excellently researched, which is also an original interpretation of current debates.
