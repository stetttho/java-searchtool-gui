 I am a scholar, not of Tibetan Buddhism, but of North American death and dying literature.  Lopez' book is a marvelous change from the mushy-romantic "Noble Exotic" vision of Tibet that emerges in the  literature written for popular consumption on "Tibetan Book of the  Dead" and related topics. As other traditionally Buddhist countries  became heavily industrialized - particularly Japan - they became  un-idealizable, while Tibet has been given that role and continues to hold  onto it.  Lopez's book is a corrective, accessible to non-specialists, and  raises important questions about how and why we construct  "Shangri-La."
