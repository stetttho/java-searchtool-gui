 Most of the other reviewers have compared this book to Tarzan, but I'll compare it with Tanith Lee's The Birthgrave, which also has a quasi-human central character alone and isolated, searching for her true identity amid a series of decadent and violent human societies.  The difference is that The Birthgrave conveys both sadness and power; the mysterious guilt of the heroine is more interesting than the Troll-boy's innocence.
