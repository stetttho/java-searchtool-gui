 Joseph Heller's funny, lively retelling of King David's autobiography gives us recognizeably the same character as the hero of I and II Samuel: passionate, powerful, crafty and with an incredible blind spot when it came to managing his family.

David was a real person, but according to this work, not the ruler of a united kingdom.  Or, to use the language of Heller's book, he did not even turn a kingdom the size of Vermont into an empire the size of Maine.
