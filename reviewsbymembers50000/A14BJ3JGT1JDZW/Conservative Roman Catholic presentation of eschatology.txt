 This work discusses the traditional "4 last things"of death, judgment, hell and heaven from a Roman Catholic perspective, for readers without a background in theology, but willing to wade through a heavy topic.  The author draws on Catholic 20th c. poets and many other literary sources, but has no sympathy for any of the divergent theological positions even within his own tradition.  This is a good readable presentation but it has an idealogical edge that will turn off liberal Catholics, many Protestants and almost all secular readers.
