 As a long-term Reginald Hill fan, I was struck by something odd about this book, when compared with those from the 1970s and 80s: it is timeless, it is no longer social satire or "comedy of manners." It can't be, because in real time Pascoe would be over 60, his daughter Rose a university graduate, and Dalziel up in his 80s. Hill obviously knows this. So instead, it is deep into literary devices, which are intrinsic to the plot but the result is detatched not just in terms of social milieu but also in terms of character. Maybe I'm just nostalgic for "Exit Lines" and "Ruling Passion".
