 Like other reviewers, I enjoyed the setting of pre-WWI elegance on board a luxury liner. The limits are not just in the rather easily guessable mystery, but when central likeable characters reflect attitudes they would almost certainly not have held back in 1908. Anti-racism, equality for women and political power for colonized peoples are our era's values, not probably those which even very liberal persons such as the two ship detectives would have shared.  This is an endemic problem with historical mysteries, and I noticed it here because the plot isn't all that strong.
