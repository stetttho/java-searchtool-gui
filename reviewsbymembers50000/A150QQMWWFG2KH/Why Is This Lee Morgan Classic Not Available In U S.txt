 I'll say it plainly; Blue Note Records should be ashamed of themselves that this classic Lee Morgan album is not available on compact disc in the U.S. Lee Morgan was already one of the best trumpeters in jazz when he made this recording, his debut for Blue Note.  Only twenty-years-old and a veteran of the Dizzy Gillespie Orchestra, Morgan had recorded as both a sideman and a leader, but this session was his move up to the big leagues of jazz.  His trumpet style was a highly impressive mix of Gillespie and Clifford Brown, with the added feature of a gorgeous lower register that truly shone on ballads.  He was emerging as the most accomplished trumpeter of the so-called "hard bop" movement at the time of these sessions. Pairing Morgan with Pepper Adams on baritone sax might seem like an odd choice but it works.  The soulful Bobby Timmons was one of the finest pianists of the period, and would later play with Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers (as did Morgan).   The volcanic Philly Joe Jones on drums and Jymie Merrit on bass round out the band. The material here consists of four standards and two solid originals.  It takes courage for a trumpeter to lead off with Gillespie's "Tunisia" but Morgan is more than up to the challenge.  As familiar as "Lover Man" might be, Morgan finds new life in the song. This is one of the finer albums that Blue Note ever issued; what might have been a routine date is something truly wonderful.  Why was this such a special session?  Who can say.  Sometimes magic happens, and it happened here.  The greater mystery is why so much lesser Morgan is available and this is not.  If you decide to splurge and buy this import, you won't be disappointed.  This Japanese reissue comes in a miniature LP sleeve with the original notes.  The 24-bit mastering makes it sound as if you're sitting on the bandstand.  This has long been one of my favorite jazz albums, and I could not recommend it more highly.
