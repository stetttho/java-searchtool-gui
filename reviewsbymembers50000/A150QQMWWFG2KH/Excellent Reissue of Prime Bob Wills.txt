 The MGM recordings of Bob Wills finally get a decent and respectful reissue with this 2 CD set.  Many of these tracks were previously available on Polydor's 24 Greatest Hits, a shoddy package that featured perhaps the worst sound I've ever encountered on a reissue of studio recordings.  Happily, the sound is pretty good on Boot Heel Drag, and it's nice to have these important recordings available again.   Wills, of course, was the legendary creator of Western Swing, an infectious hybrid of country, jazz, and Texas fiddle music.  He led his band, the Texas Playboys for almost four decades, and his influence remains enormous even today, with such artists as Willie Nelson, George Strait, Asleep At the Wheel and BR549 all owing a debt to this innovator.  In the late Thirties and early Forties, Bob Wills & His Texas Playboys were one of the most popular live acts in the country, outdrawing big names like Artie Shaw and Glen Miller in the southwest and California. After a long and successful stay at Columbia Records, Wills and his band moved to MGM Records in 1947.  Gone was the large horn section of his early `40's bands, with a front-line of fiddles, steel guitar electric mandolin and electric guitar now dominating the music.  The songs here are first-rate and, as always, Wills' band features talented musicians and singers including long-time vocalist Tommy Duncan, steel guitarist Herb Remington, mandolinist Tiny Moore and fiddlers Joe Holley and Johnny Gimble.  Wills himself offers memorable renditions of several of the fiddle tunes he'd played since his Texas youth.  Highlights include such now-classic tunes as "Bubbles In My Beer" and "Faded Love," and Wills also offer new versions of some of his earlier hits lie " A Maiden's Prayer" and "I Ain't Got Nobody." An excellent essay by Rich Kienzle, a song by song analysis, and some wonderful photographs make this an essential acquisition for fans of Wills and Western Swing.
