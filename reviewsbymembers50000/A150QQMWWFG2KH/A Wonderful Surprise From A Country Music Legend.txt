 Merle Haggard returns to action with an astonishing first recording for the L.A. based indie, Anti Records.  "If I Could Only Fly" perhaps follows the path set by Johnny Cash in his recent work, but the result is hardly imitative.  Haggard has been much appreciated in recent years but, truth be told, its been a long while since he recorded a solid album of new material.  Haggard wrote almost everything here, and they mark a return to the plainspoken but heartfelt songs of his younger days.         The simple, rough-hewn arrangements suit the melodies well, and the blend of honky tonk and western swing has never been more infectious.  I was surprised by the energy of these songs, and the album as a whole manages to be both fun and moving.  At 63, Merle Haggard has made one of the most adventurous albums of his stellar career, and its is truly a triumph.  Unfortunately, "If I Could Only Fly" deserves to reach a wider audience than it is likely to find.  Fans of both traditional country and alt. country will enjoy this nice surprise from Haggard.
