 MCA has just issued a collection drawn from Kelly Willis' three early '90's albums for the label, which I guess partially makes up for deleting all three titles from their catalog.  "One More Time" is a solid but hardly insightful assortment that unfortunately includes no previously unreleased tracks.  The only rarity is a song that previously appeared only on the "Thelma & Louise" soundtrack.   Many people discovered Kelly through her wonderful 1999 release "What I Deserve" for Rykodisc. If you aren't familiar with her MCA recordings, this is probably the best (if not only) place to start. (If you ever see the third album, 1993's "Kelly Willis," grab it)  Willis' songwriting was still at a developmental stage, so she relied on outside writers in her early years, including John Hiatt and Marshall Crenshaw.  She began her career singing rockabilly-influenced music and there are some excellent examples of that phase on this release.  There is much excellent music here, and fans of "What I Deserve" should be very pleased. What bothers me about "One More Time" is the self-serving essay in the album notes. Within about a paragraph, the writer manages to credit MCA for Kelly's subsequent and hard-earned success.  Well, MCA deserves credit only if putting a person through hell constitutes nurturing the artist.  They straightjacketed Kelly on her first two albums, put pressure on her that led to the breakup of her band, and tried to turn into a video-ready glamour girl, the Pre-Shania, if you will.  When she left MCA in 1994 she struggled for another five years before she had a chance to record a full album.  I have no doubt that MCA invested and lost a lot of money on Kelly's early work, but for them to claim to have assisted in her rise to success is ludicrous, if not downright dishonest.  Kelly Willis owes no thanks to MCA for fumbling away her first shot at artistic and commercial success.  For this reason, and this reason alone, this release is docked one star.
