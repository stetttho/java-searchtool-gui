 The second album by the white soul duo Delaney & Bonnie has been unavailable in the U.S. for about thirty years. This is unbelievable, as this is an album of excellent r & b, recorded in with some of the best musicians in the business. Delaney & Bonnie are best known for their brief association with Eric Clapton ("On Tour"), but they recorded five other albums of excellent, convincing soul music. Their musicians went on to back Clapton, Leon Russell, Joe Cocker and others. Delaney Bramlett and then-wife Bonnie were both excellent vocalists and songwriters. Their music has help up well over the years, and "Home" is a fine acquisition to any R & B collection. If you can find it, that it. Currently, its available only as this pricey Japanese import. For fans of this type of music, though, "Home" is worth any price.
