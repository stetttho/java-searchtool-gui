 ...  "Return of Wayne Douglas" is Sham's finalstudio recording, and its the most country album of his long career.  Its an engaging mixture of originals and covers, with Dylan's "LoveMinus Zero - No Limit" and Leon Payne's "They'll Never Takeher Love From Me" two of the highlights.  Sahm also offers akiller version of A Sir Douglas Quintet song from circa 1970 entitled"Texas Me."  The new songs that Sahm premieres here are amixed bag, with a few gems and several, dare I say it, duds.
