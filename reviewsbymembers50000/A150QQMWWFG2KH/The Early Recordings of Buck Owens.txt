 Buck Owens kicked around the music business for over a decade before he became a star and one of the fathers of the so-called "Bakersfield Sound" that survives in country music to this day.  Owens worked steadily as a studio musician before turning to songwriting.  By the mid 1950's he was recording demos of his songs for other artists to hear, then began to record singles for a few tiny California labels, without much notice or success. This CD compiles those early singles and demos.  Its interesting how much of the style he rode to the top of the country charts was already in place in the mid to late Fifties.  Owens was country to the core, yet he was one of the first artists to incorporate rock & roll elements such as the driving beat and jangly electric guitar into country music.  The fact that none of these sides became hits probably means that Owens was just ahead of his time.  Several of these songs were re-recorded by Owens when he joined Capitol Records in 1959, with "Down On the Corner Of Love" becoming a major hit. There is a lot of fine music here, and fans of Owens, the Bakersfield Sound and classic country will want to own this.  Some of these tracks have been available before, but with greatly inferior sound and without the excellent booklet assembled by the Country Music Foundation.  Let's hope that the CMF continues this promising reissue series (check out their recent Jimmy Martin title), because this is the way reissues should be done.
