 Its probably a stretch to call Jimmy Martin the King of Bluegrass (Its also the title of a recent book about the singer), but he certainly qualifies as royalty.  Martin was long overdue for this type of compilation, which includes most of his greatest recording made for Decca Records in the Fifties and Sixties. Martin was, and is, one of the finest lead vocalists in bluegrass, a role he filled for two years with the great Bill Monroe before he began his solo career.  What set Martin apart from such contemporaries as Monroe, the Stanley Brothers and others is that his music was more accessible, more radio-friendly than his peers.  "Sunny Side of the Mountain" and "Grand Ole Opry Song," both included here, are still damn near irresistible.  Martin' music never seemed as old-fashioned as the others, yet he never felt the need to pander to popular tastes by recording Beatles or Chuck Berry tunes, as Jim & Jesse did, for example. The Country Music Foundation compiled this disc and did a wonderful job.  The sound is excellent, and the booklet is even better.  Fans of bluegrass and classic country will certainly want to add this set to their collections.
