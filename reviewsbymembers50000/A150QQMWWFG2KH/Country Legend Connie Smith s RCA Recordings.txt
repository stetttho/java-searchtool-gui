 For anyone who ever said "I could listen to Connie Smith sing all night," well, here's your chance.  Those wonderful obsessives at Bear Family Records have reissued the country great's complete recordings from her heyday in the mid-Sixties, when the singer was tearing up the charts. Connie Smith was a housewife with two children when she began her recording career under the patronage of singer/songwriter Bill Anderson.  Her first single, "Once A Day," was a smash hit, and for the next three years she was one of Nashville's biggest female stars.  Smith had a perfect voice for country music, with the tell-tale "sob" in her voice that made many of her songs almost heartbreakingly beautiful.  Most tellingly, Smith was even more admired by her peers than her fans.  She walked away from a successful career in the Seventies to raise her children and because she grew increasingly uncomfortable with the nature of the music business. Connie Smith fans once had to search far and wide for her RCA recordings, but they have been more accessible in recent times.  RCA released a solid one disc "best of" four years ago and her first two albums were reissued in their entirety in 2000.  "Born To Sing" is a four CD box and contains everything she recorded for the label.  Its a wonderful package, with first-class sound, and which includes Bear Family's usual comprehensive booklet.  Although there is a lot of terrific music here, this boxed set is probably best for Smith's hardcore fans; casual fans should probably stick to the single disc compilation. Still, this is a superior package. Its nice to have all of Connie's RCA classics and rarties available, and to see her receive the recognition she deserves.   Incidentally, Connie Smith is still going strong as of this writing (March 2001).  She performs regularly at the Grand Ole Opry, and she recorded a fine CD for Warner Brothers in 1998, produced by her current husband, Marty Stuart
