 Jack Guthrie was the cousin of folk music great Woody Guthrie, and the two musicians grew up together in Oklahoma.  Whereas Woody drew his inspiration from the Carter Family, Jack was obviously influenced by Jimmie Rodgers.  He also incorporated elements of Western Swing into his music, which was a pleasant mix of country, western swing, blues and jazz.  Jack Guthrie sang in a rough but serviceable voice that was much like his cousin's. Jack Guthrie died of tuberculosis only a couple of years into his professional career, but in that short time he achieved one thing his more famous cousin did not; a hit record.  "Oklahoma Hills" was an infectious and memorable tune that Jack took to the top of the charts, just as his health began to fail.  The tune may have actually been written by Woody but, at least at first, Jack received the songwriting credit. "Milk Cow Blues" is a nice surprise.  These 30 songs are radio transcriptions (songs recorded exclusively for airplay on subscribing radio outlets, sort of like the King Biscuit Flower hour of its day).  Guthrie is backed by a hot band featuring some terrific steel guitar.  Its fun listening, and also serves to show that Jack Guthrie was a much more interesting and accomplished musician than his recordings for Capitol Records would indicate.  Fans of Forties country, western swing and country boogie should appreciate this CD.  As usual, Bear Family Records has done a super job with this reissue.
