 Howlin' Wolf (a/k/a Chester Burnett) was one of the true originals of the blues.  His recordings for Chess from the 1950's until his death in 1976 are among the finest Chicago blues recordings of all time.  Few vocalists possess the power and passion of Howlin' Wolf, and he's in great form on "Live In Cambridge, MA 1966." This set, recorded live in a small club in 1966, is a treasure.  Yes, the sound is rough, very rough in spots, but the performance by Wolf and his small band (featuring guitarist Hubert Sumlin and tenor sax player Eddie Shaw) is intense and exciting.  The song selection is a mixture of Wolf's best known tunes and a few blues standards.  A highlight is "I Asked For Water (She Gave Me Gasoline), a Tommy Johnson original that Wolf recorded memorable in the '50's.   Unlike comtemporary Muddy Waters, there's not a lot of live Wolf available, but this CD will suffice for now. If you love the blues, here's my advice to you.  Don't worry about the sound.  Buy this terrific recording, crank it up and have a great time.
