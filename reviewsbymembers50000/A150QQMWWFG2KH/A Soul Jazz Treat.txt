 This 2 CD set is a real treat.  Don Wilkerson is now almost forgotten, but in the mid-1950's he was the saxophone soloist in Ray Charles' band on many of the singer's earliest and biggest hits.  Wilkerson went on to record a few jazz albums for Blue Note in the early '60's before disappearing from the scene.  This package includes all three of Wilkerson's Blue Note releases. The "soul jazz" movement of the Fifties and Sixties was an attempt to marry the energy and passion of rhythm & blues with jazz, and represented the last real attempt to market jazz as pop music.  For a few years it worked, due to such talents as Hank Mobley, Cannonball Adderley, Lee Morgan and King Curtis.  The movement broke little new ground but produced some worthwhile music, before it lost favor with both the musicians and the public. Despite his lack of fame, Wilkerson proves to be a master of the genre.  What sets him apart is a highly original sound on the tenor sax, as he possesses an unusually light and emotive voice on the instrument.  He's a solid improviser, too. Accompanying Wilkerson are some of the finest musicians in the Blue Note stable, including such favorites as pianist Sonny Clark and guitarist Grant Green.  Both Clark and Green shine here, and their rapport with Wilkerson is impressive. This set belongs in the collections of any fan of soul jazz, the Blue Note sound, and Sixties jazz in general.  Fifteen years after the saxophonist's death, this release should go far in establishing Wilkerson as one of the major talents of his era.
