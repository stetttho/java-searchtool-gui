 The amazing Steve Earle has done it again.  "Transcendental Blues" ranks with his very best work, combining Beatlesque Revolver-era rock, folk-rock, Irish folk and bluegrass.  Conspicuously  absent from this list of styles is country, and if one one did not know of  Earle's twenty-plus years in Nashville, one would never take him to be a  country artist.   Although Earle is a solid singer with terrifc  instrumental backing throughout, it is the high quality of the songwriting  that makes this so special.  "I Can Wait," to name one tune,  ranks with his best work and may be a future  classic. "Transcendental Blues" is one of the best albums of  2000.
