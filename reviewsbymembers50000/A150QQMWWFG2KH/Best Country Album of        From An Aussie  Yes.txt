 What does it say about the current state of country music that the best country CD released in the last year was recorded by an Australian woman in her early twenties?  Further, what does it mean when this wonderful album fails to find a market and disappears with hardly a trace, despite a bushel full of glowing reviews? 		Sadly, such is the case with "The Captain," the debut album from Kasey Chambers.  Chambers is the offspring of a musical family; the family group, the Dead Ringer Band, is one of Australia's finest country bands (don't laugh), and her father, Bill Chambers, is also part of the duo Bill and Audrey.  For her part, Kasey is a terrific songwriter who's blessed with a pretty, girlish voice reminiscent of Julie Miller and Mary Karlzen, with a country twang. 		"The Captain" is a wonderful album of mostly upbeat "hard country" that never falls into the retro trap.  This is not the nonsense that passes for country in Nashville these days; this is the real deal.  An album like "The Captain" would hardly seem so special if Music Row were less interested in such artistically deadening pursuits as repeating a successful musical formula over and over until its worthless (c.f., Shania, Martina, Faith, etc.) and instead focused on making great music.   		Strong melodies and creative arrangements are found everywhere on this album.  Chambers wrote or co-wrote all twelve of these intelligent and often witty songs, with "Cry Like A Baby," "The Captain," and "We're All Gonna Die Some Day" three of the highlights, but there's really not a weak track here.  Chambers sings with personality and spunk throughout.   		It almost makes me cry (I won't, though, at least not now) that this fine CD hasn't become a hit, despite being out for over six months.  If you love real country music you'll love "The Captain," and if you think hate country, this album may change your mind.  Kasey Chambers is clearly a major talent.  Here's hoping she gets another chance to record.
