 Two corrections to my earlier review of this album.  This was actually Morgan's fifth release for Blue Note, not his first.  All five were recorded within about a year.  Also, the bassist is the legendary Paul Chambers.  All of this goes to show that you should never write a review without the recording and its liner notes being in front of you.  Apologies to all.
