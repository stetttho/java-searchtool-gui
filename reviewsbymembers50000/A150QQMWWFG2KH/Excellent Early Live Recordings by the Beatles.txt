 Since they surfaced in the '70's, these live performances have surfaced every few years, with so-so sound and liner notes. The good news is that this is the best packaging of these amazing performances to date. The sound is still very rough, but its better than previous releases. The sound quality is the only thing that keeps this CD from earning a fifth star.  In any case, there is no denying that even at this early stage the Beatles were a great, great live act. The chance to hear the Beatles playing a club date is a rare and special treat. The songs are a mix of rock & roll, r & b, rockabilly and pop standards, with only a couple of originals. Still, any fan of the Beatles, or rock history in general, will want to hear these recordings.  The booklet is excellent, and those responsible have clearly gone to great lengths to put this package together. If you are interested in this, you may want to get this as soon as you see it. There has been some question with past releases of this material as to whether the record companies have a right to issue it. With this nice little package, the question may come up yet again.
