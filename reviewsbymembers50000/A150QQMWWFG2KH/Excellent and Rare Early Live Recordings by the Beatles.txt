 Since they surfaced in the '70's, these live performances have surfaced every few years, with so-so sound and liner notes. The good news is that "1962 Live at Star Club in Hamburg" is the best packaging of these amazing performances to date. The sound is still very rough, but its significantly better than previous releases. The marginal sound quality is the only thing that keeps this CD from earning a fifth star.  The booklet is excellent, with extensive liner notes and rarely seen photos, and those responsible have clearly gone to great lengths to put this package together.    In any case, there is no denying that even at this early stage the Beatles were a great, great live act. The chance to hear the Beatles playing a club date is a rare and special treat. The songs are a mix of rock & roll, r & b, rockabilly and pop standards, with only a couple of originals. Still, any fan of the Beatles, or rock history in general, will want to hear these recordings. The band was less than a year away from becoming stars in England, and one can clearly perceive that talent and originality that would make them an international sensation by early 1964.   There has been some question with past releases of this material as to whether the record companies involved have a legal right to issue it. With this nice little package, the question may come up yet again.  So, if you are a die-hard Beatles fan, you will certainly want this very special artifact, but you may want to buy it as soon as you see it, before it disppears again from the market.
