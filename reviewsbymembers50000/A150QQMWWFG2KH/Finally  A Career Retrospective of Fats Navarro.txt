 Theodore "Fats" Navarro was only 26 years old when he died in 1950, but the jazz trumpeter accomplished much in a recording career that lasted just five years.  Navarro was arguably the second great trumpeter to emerge from the bebop movement, whose controlled yet lyrical style was a marked alternative to the more flamboyant Dizzy Gillespie.   Most of Navarro's recordings have been available in the last few decades; he did the bulk of his recording for Blue Note and Savoy, both as a leader and a sideman.  But there has never been a career-spanning retrospective, at least until now.  Proper Records, an English label, has issued this fine four CD set, which features excellent sound and a terrific booklet.   What makes this set special is that it traces Navarro from his days with Billy Eckstine and His Orchestra to his early solo sides for Savoy, then on to his groundbreaking work with bandleader/composer/arranger Tadd Dameron, fiery trumpet duels with Kenny Dorham and, finally, to his final recordings with Charlie Parker, a mere week before his death from tuberculosis,apparently exacerbated by heroin use.  Seldom has the development of a musician been better traced and, in particular, his work with Dameron sounds better than ever. Also included are a few rareand seldom reissued sessions that demonstrate Navarro's flair as an accompaniest for vocalists. Fats Navarro's greatest legacy may be his influence on such later trumpeters as Clifford Brown, Lee Morgan and Freddie Hubbard; it is worth noting that these three major figures looked towrds Navarro rather than Gillespie for much of their style.  "The Fats Navarro Story" is an essential purchasr for fans of bebop, and this box set should go far in getting Navarro the recognition he deserves.
