 Faced with his own mortality, Johnny Cash is still rediscovering his artistry.  "American III: Solitary Man" is his third solid release in the last six years.  Working in collaboration with Rick Rubin, Cash has produced another thoughful and moving album.  Johnny contributes for songs, while covering the likes of Tom Petty, David Alan Coe, U2, Nick Cave, Bert Williams, Will Oldham (!) and Neil Diamond (don't laugh, its a great song).        Cash and Rubin once again take chances, and the result is wonderful.  If Cash's vocals are a little rougher than last time out (1996's "Unchained") it just adds to the emotional wallop of the music.  This man has made such great music for so many years. I've been listening to Johnny Cash for almost all my life and, even during the long period in which he was phoning it in in the recording studio, Cash was more interesting than almost any other musician.  The fact that Johnny Cash is still making great music is a marvel, and I hope everyone that reads this gets to hear this terrific album.
