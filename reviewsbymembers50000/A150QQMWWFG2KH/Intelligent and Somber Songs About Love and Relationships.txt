 The Blue Chair" is a real treat from Nashville-based singer/songwriter Kieran Kane.  Kane was a member of the duo the O'Kanes (with Jamie O'Hara), a promising country team that split in the early '90's after only a few albums.  He was one of the five musicians who set up the record company/musical collective known as Dead Reckoning Records, for whom he recorded two good but not great albums, and also shared the recent live release "11/12/13" with labelmate Kevin Welch. Kane's latest is a fine collection of intelligent and thought-provoking songs about love and relationships, and the pitfalls inherent to both.  The consistency of the songs is impressive.  Although the mood is somber throughout, each tune makes an impression that lasts.  Kane is not blessed with a great voice, but it is more than adequate for these songs, and he achieves a sense of intimacy that adds to the power of the songwriting.   This is by far Kane's finest work as a solo artist.  Although his Nashville base often relegates him to the country music ghetto, fans of both rock and folk-oriented singer/songwriters will enjoy this as well.
