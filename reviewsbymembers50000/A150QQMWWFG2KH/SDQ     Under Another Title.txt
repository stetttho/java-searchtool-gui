 This is a pretty good album from the vast Doug Sahm/Sir Douglas Quintet collection, but Sahm fans should be careful; you may already own this.  This is a German version of an album that came out in the U.S. three years ago entitled "SDQ '98."  This is exactly the same release, with a new title and cover photo.  I dock it one star for the confusion and/or deception. As for the music, Sahm fans will be happy with this CD. It is a nice mix of the familiar and obscure, Sahm's usual stew of country, blues, tex-mex and rock & roll, and it includes a nice remake of "Give Back the Key To My Heart," a '70's Sahm original that Doug re-recorded with Uncle Tupelo on their final album in 1993.  Another nice surprise is the verison of "St. Olav's Gate," a Tom Russell song. This album was recorded over a five year period, and although credited originally to Sir Douglas Quintet, SDQ is seemingly only present on some of the tracks.  SDQ organist Augie Meyers sings "The Ballad of Davey Crockett" and shares vocals with Sahm on another song. Sahm completists will want this release, and if you don't own "SDQ '98,"  you will probably enjoy this CD.  But make sure you don't own this already under its earlier title.
