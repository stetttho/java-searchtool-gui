 Ralph Stanley is one of the living masters of American music.  This release contains music apparently featured in the new Coen Brothers film "O Brother Where Art Thous?", but it also serves as an excellent career overview to Stanley's unique style of Bluegrass. Banjoist Ralph and his guitar playing brother, Carter, were the Stanley Brothers, a pioneering act in bluegrass music.  Heavily influenced by traditional string band music, the Blue Sky Boys and bluegrass creator Bill Monroe, the Carters recorded and performed together from the late '40's until Carter's premature death in 1966, creating some of the most original and lasting work in the bluegrass field.  Carter was the lead singer and showman of the group, and there were real questions whether Ralph Stanley could pursue a successful solo career. Fortunately for fans of bluegrass, Ralph Stanley was more than up to the challenge.  Raplh Stanley and the Clinch Mountain Boys have been at the forefront of bluegrass for over thirty years, recording numerous albums that combined Ralph's haunting harmony vocals with a series of fine lead vocalists, including Keith Whitley, Roy Lee Centers and Charlie Sizemore.  Even at the end of 2000, Ralph Stanley remains active, touring widely and recording frequently with a band that features son Ralph II on as lead vocalist. The material on this CD was recorded from the '70's through the '90's, and is a fine selection of Stanley's music.  It combines traditional tunes, gospel songs and originals.  Stanley and his musicians avoid the sterility that afflicts many contemporary bluegrass groups; there is a genuineness and sincerity that sets their work apart.  Like his friend, the late Bill Monroe, Stanley's otherworldly harmnonies often dominate the songs, to great effect. Although Bill Monroe remains the starting place for anyone interested in bluegrass (see "16 Gems" on Columbia/Legacy), Ralph Stanley's "Man of Constant Sorrow" is a terrific introduction to this music.
