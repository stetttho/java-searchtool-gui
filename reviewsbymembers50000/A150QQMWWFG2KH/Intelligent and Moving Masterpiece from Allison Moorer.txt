 Writing believable songs about troubled relationships is difficult enough, but writing such songs with your own family's history in mind must be nearly impossible. Singer/songwriter Allison Moorer has done so, and done a magnificent job. Moorer's "The Hardest Part," is the second album from the red-headed singer/songwriter (The first, "Alabama Song," was released in 1998).  "The Hardest Part" is an ambitious concept album loosely based on her parents' turbulent and, ultimately, violent marriage.   Regardless of the thematic link, these are strong songs that stand on their individual merits and make a strong and lasting impression.  There's not a false note or lyric on this entire album.  The album was written almost entirely written by Moorer and her husband/collaborator, Doyle Primm.  We should all pray to never experience the turmoil and pain that inspired these songs.  Most love stories do not have a happy ending, and some are far less happy than others. Moorer has observed this from close range, and she recreates a tragic relationship without resorting to sensationalism or descending to the maudlin. Allison has a gorgeous contralto voice that is tailor-made for these heartfelt songs.  Moorer is the younger sister of talented singer Shelby Lynne, and there are similarities in their voices (Reportedly, the two are not close).  At this point, Moorer's music is much more country than her sister, but it is far removed from the usual fluff that passes for country music these days. Albums both this intelligent and emotional are rare from Nashville, and Tony Brown, of all people, is the executive producer of this project.  Moorer, her husband and guitarist Kenny Greenberg are listed as the producers.  Everybody involved should be proud of what they have achieved. This is great stuff, by any standards.
