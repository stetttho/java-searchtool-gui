 As others have noted, this is not the very worthwhile 1970 release, but an identically titled shoddy hodge podge from the '90's.  The confusion is compounded by Sony's announced plans to reissue the 1970 album this year.  Wait for it, and buy that CD.  Even completists should skip this one.  As of this date, Amazon has been informed and has acknowledged that the song titles listed under this entry are incorrect but has, so far, not taken down the listing or corrected the songs.  This is disgraceful.
