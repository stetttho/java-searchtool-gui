 The Blasters emerged from Downey, California circa 1980 playing their own unique blend of rockabilly, blues, rock & roll, r & b, and every other kind of indigenous music.  Their sound became the blueprint for what would later be called roots rock, and their influence on the early `80's scene cannot be overestimated.  The Blasters were led by vocalist Phil Alvin and lead guitarist/songwriter Dave Alvin (who has gone on to a long and productive solo career).  The Alvin brothers began to quarrel and, by 1986, the group had broken up (although Phil Alvin leads a latter-day version of the Blasters today). 	After recording one obscure album in 1980, the Blasters joined Slash Records in 1981. "The Blasters" (1981) was a tremendous album that spotlighted all of the young band's strengths.  Two more full-length albums (plus a live e.p.) followed before the Blasters' original lineup went their separate ways.  The band's commercial accomplishments never matched their artistic achievements; when Warner Brothers Records picked up the distribution of their later releases, the Blasters were forced to make changes in their musical direction (such as being produced by John Cougar Mellencamp) that were not entirely of their choosing.  Still, all of the Blasters Slash/Warner releases were strong, and "Testament" gathers all of them in one package, with a nice booklet featuring insightful essays and numerous group photos. 	The three albums that the Blasters recorded for Slash have not been previously been reissued on CD, so this two CD package is a long-awaited treat.  Their live e.p. (plus extra tracks from the same London gig) is also included, and there are a handful of rare or previously unreleased tracks included.   The standout songs are "Marie, Marie," "Border Radio," So Long Baby Goodbye," Long White Cadillac," and "Red Rose," but this package rocks from beginning to end, and should do much to restore the Blasters to their rightful place in the emergence of roots rock.
