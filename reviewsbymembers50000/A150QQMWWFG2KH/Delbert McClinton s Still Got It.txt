 Delbert McClinton may never record a truly great album, but he's come close a couple of times, but he'll never make a bad one.  The sixty-year-old Texan has been making music for forty years, and if his blend of classic rhythm & blues, country, and rock & roll is not highly original, its never less than believable and sincere.  Blessed with a solid set of pipes, McClinton is still one of the finest white r&b singers of the last few decades.  He also plays a mean harmonica (He gave pointers on the instrument to a young John Lennon in 1962, prior to the recording of the Beatles' first single). "Nothing Personal" is one of the best albums of McClinton's long career.  He wrote or co-wrote all thirteen songs, with the opening "Livin' It Down," "When Rita Leaves" and "Birmingham Tonight" this listener's favorites.  There is no groundbreaking music here, but that's besides the point.  Most artists would be glad to make music this gritty, real and fun at any point in their careers. The closest that Delbert McClinton ever came to a hit single was over two decades ago, when " Givin' It Up For Your Love" almost climbed the charts.  Given current tastes, nothing here is going to change that.  Delbert has also had bad luck with record companies, as several have folded or reorganized with McClinton's latest recording barely on the streets.  He's on a new, independent label with "Nothing Personal" and I'll keep my fingers crossed for him.   Certainly McClinton's fans will want to own this, but anyone who enjoys well-crafted, soulful r&b and rock will enjoy "Nothing Personal."
