 If not for Pete Welding & his Testament label there'd be no recorded evidence of Blind Connie & what a shame that would be...fortunately Pete had the fortitude to drop a tape recorder in front of Williams &  preserve the performances on this disc for posterity.  Connie is firmly  rooted in the string tradition of his compatriot Blind Gary Davis with whom  he worked the streets of Harlem for spare change during the 30's .  But for  my money, Connie takes Gary's innovations & brings them to another  level...the instrumentation on these recordings from 61' is sparse  alternating between skittering slide guitar & battered button accordion  & Connie's command of both (especially the latter) is at times suspect;  but his vocal improvisations on the traditional folk songs &  spirtituals are truly inspired.  He moves from crooning balladry to  growling high pitched barks sometimes within the space of the same tune.   His expert command of the material is proof of the mettle he gained through  a hard life as a minstrel on the streets of Philly.
