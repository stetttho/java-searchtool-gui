 Previously the only record of Rivers' early 70's Impulse trio sessions  available on compact disc was STREAMS (now deleted?).  Through a resurgence  of re-issues & new releases & a heavy touring schedule Samuel  Cawthorne Rivers is finally receiving his due place in the jazz pantheon  after years of mainstream critical ambivalence and ignorance.  This album  is evidence of his enormous stature.  TRIO-LIVE follows the same basic  format of STREAMS, featuring a series of Rivers' improvisations on tenor  & soprano saxophones, flute, piano and primitve vocalese backed by the  able & active support of Barry Altschul (a vast improvement over the  clumsy traps-work of a pre-disco Norman Conners on STREAMS) & at  various times Cecil McBee, Arlid Anderson & Lewis Worrell on  double-bass.  Each of the tunes are lengthy improv numbers with Rivers'  punctuating his shifts among his arsenal of instruments with raucous howls  & whoops.  Rivers manages to touch upon the whole history of improvised  musical expression, from passionately simple cathartic screams, to  incredibly intricate runs of saxophonic genius that utilize all registers  of his horn.  This is a highly kinetic set that never slows down even  during the more meditative passages when Rivers blows soulfully on his  flute.  A beautiful taste of the early 70's loft jazz esthetic.
