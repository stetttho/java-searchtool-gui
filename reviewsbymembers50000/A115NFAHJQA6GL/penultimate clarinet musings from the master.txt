 This album is all the evidence necessary to secure giuffre's place as the  genius who pioneered the clarinet's place as a valid free jazz voice.  "FREE FALL" takes the massive advancements made by the  triumvirate of giuffre, bley & swallow on earlier (& equally  essential) ablums such as, "THESIS" & "FUSION" to  the nth degree of creativity.  Comprised of duos, trios & a multitude  of sublime solo clarinet reflections this disc is a pleasure from the first  plaintive strains of 'propulsion' to the closing whispers of 'let's  see'...but don't take my word for it, do your ears a favor & pick-up  this far-reaching slice of avant chamber jazz & see where everyone from  anthony braxton to perry robinson first got their chops.
