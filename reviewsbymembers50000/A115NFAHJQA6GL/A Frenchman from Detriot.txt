 Julius Watkins remains the cream of the crop among jazz french hornists  (not that there's much competition for that coveted crown) & an early  pioneer in the struggle to expand the sometimes rigid boundaries of jazz  instrumentation.  This beautifully packaged re-issue of two 10"  sessions from the mid-50's features Julius in the company of the upper  echelon of the Blue Note garrison.  Oscar Pettiford, Hank Mobley & Duke  Jordan are each given room to stretch out, and with Kenny Clarke & Art  Blakey holding down the fort on skins this disc is a guaranteed winner.     The french horn may seem an ungainly jazz voice, but in Watkin's hands it  sings with a chamber-like quality, so much so that a mellow feeling  pervades even on the more uptempo swinging numbers.  An added bonus is Rudy  Van G's expert miking of all participants with special attention to  Pettiford's nimble low-end strolls on his upright.  The only weak link is  Perez Lopez on guitar who comes up with some pretty fills, but is obviously  (and understandably) reticent in the presence of so many giants.  The disc  as a whole isn't an absolute classic, but it offers a rare opportunity to  hear Watkins at length, blowing brilliantly on his own creative  compositions.  Well worth a thoughtful listen.
