 Its too bad Amazon doesn't have a cover picture up for this one yet, 'cause the portrait of Joe, Amelia & Shortstuff in the cotton field just about perfectly captures what's in store on the disc.  Talk about a motherlode of Mississippi country blues!  The biggest wonder is why this  treasure trove stayed on the shelf so long. Sure its got some blemishes:  missed cues, loose strings, etc. & but these warts add, rather than  subtract from the end result.  Ol' Big Joe kept fine company & the raw,  unadorned sound of these sides proves it.  Highlights include Joe's  blistering acoustic slide fireworks throughout & Amelia Johnson's gutsy  blues shouts (there are also tunes fronted by idiosyncratic unknowns such  as Austen Pete, "Shortstuff" Macon & Glover Lee Conner).  A further,  but welcome mystery is Chris Stratchwitz's decision to release the disc in  Arhoolie's mid-price series.  26 tracks=77 minutes, you ain't gonna find a better bargain...an  essential purchase & one of the best blues releases of the year!
