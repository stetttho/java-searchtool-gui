 This is the genuine article and proof of why the blues is about raw emotive force over virtuosic instrumental prowess...there are plenty of cats that can play better than Kimbrough, but a paltry few who can belt out  fuzzed-out gutbucket licks with such ferocity and authority...The man was a  fixture for decades at his own Mississippi juke joint and on this release  you can almost smell the stale cigarette smoke, cheap whiskey & greasy  fatback barbecue odors that must have permeated the place.  The tracks are  lengthy excursions into crude funk-inflected boogie rhythms with Junior's  raspy garbled vocals periodically bubbling to the top of the rough gumbo  groove.  If you like your blues abrasive and painfully honest look no  farther than Kimbrough & crew.  As a side note, I was surprised to see  a lack of reviews under this & Kimbrough's other releases while his  compatriot R.L. Burnside has quite a few...not to knock Burnside, but  Kimbrough is every bit his equal; do your ears & rump a favor &  check him out.
