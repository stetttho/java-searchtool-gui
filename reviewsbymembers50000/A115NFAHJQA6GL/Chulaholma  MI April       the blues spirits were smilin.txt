 If the original members of Black Sabbath had grown up deep in the Delta swamps, cutting their musical teeth on the slide guitar wizardry of Fred McDowell they might have sounded something like Junior Kimbrough & the  Soul Blues Boys.  This collection culled from live performances at  Kimbrough's Juke Joint in 1993 offers over an hour of lengthy, grinding  blues dirges with Junior & friends churning out their signature brand  of whiskey-drenched  Mississippi grunge...the playing is the antithesis of  urban contemporary blues polish with lots of wrong notes and missed cues,  but all of the imperfections simply add to the end result, some of the most  truthful and moving blues waxed to disc.
