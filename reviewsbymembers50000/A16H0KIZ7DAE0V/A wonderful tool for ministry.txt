 Our Altar Guild meetings are about the most boring business meetings ever.  We all love the quiet ministry of Altar Guild, but need some guidance on spiritual fellowship. This little book provides a series of meditations - a short verse from scripture, prayer book, or hymnal followed by a personal story of the author's.  After reading this together, a member may feel called to share his or her own story.  By the end of the book, a Guild would be well set up to do their own meditations on scripture, hymnal, or prayer book.  With such a solid, spiritual foundation, the Altar Guild can become a fellowship ministry indeed.
