 When I was in school, we were told to write papers, but were never really taught *how* to develop one.  We were told *what* to do -- make an outline, write the paper, and revise it -- but that didn't help me figure out *how* to do any of these things. Now my daughter is in third grade and I'm trying to help her learn how to write.  Our first use of the book helped us capture and explore what she learned on a museum trip.  I was really impressed with the resulting report.  It was focused, full of real content, and had a delightful narrative style.  We even used wondering questions to help us focus further inquiry. This book is a must-have for anyone interested in life-long learning.
