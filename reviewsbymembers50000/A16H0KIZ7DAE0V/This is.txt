 Once again Madonna has captured the hypocrasy of America, this time in 2003. Of course this album seems self-absorbed -- THAT'S THE POINT! As a society, America is the most spoiled, selfish culture you could possibly imagine. As individuals we are sensitive, caring people who want to fix the insensitivity and injustice around us. This album taps into those feelings. I think this may be one of Madonna's strongest over-all albums with no one piece dominating over the others. Sometimes listening to this album makes me uncomfortable, other times it's a relief that the ideas are explicitly stated somewhere in our pop culture. This definitely has a place among the albums I listen to regularly.
