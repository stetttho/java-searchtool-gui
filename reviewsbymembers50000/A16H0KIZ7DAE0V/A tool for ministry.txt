 Since most church choristers sit separately from the rest of the congregation, it is very easy to get caught up in the insular world of the choir and to forget the role we play in the life of the church as a whole.  It is also easy to lose ourselves in the mechanics of being a choir and forget that it is a ministry that we have been called by God to do in fellowship with each other. This little book provides a series of meditations - a short verse from scripture, prayer book, or hymnal followed by a personal story of the author's.  After reading this together, a chorister may feel called to share their own story.  By the end of the book, a choir would be well set up to do their own meditations on scripture, hymnal, or prayer book.  With such a solid, spiritual foundation, the church choir can become a ministry indeed.
