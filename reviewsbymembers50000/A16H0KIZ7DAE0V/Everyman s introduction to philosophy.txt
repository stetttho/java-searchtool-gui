 We own several copies of this book because we keep lending it out.  I wish I had a secret mentor who would excite my curiosity and love of learning the way Sophie does.  Her secret mentor presents the history of philosophy in a way that anyone can understand.  And knowing the history really helps me understand what philosophy is all about.  If you are curious and love to use your mind, this is a must read.
