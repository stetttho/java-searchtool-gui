 Although quite corney in places, I cannot forget the thrill I had seeing this movie in the theater as a child.  Considering the time it was filmed, Babes In Toyland had wonderful special effects and plenty of Disney charm.  If you can stay with it up to the time the children actually enter Toyland (about half way through) you will find that the wait was worth it. I am dissappointed that this movie didn't become more popular, but with an all star cast including Ray Bolger(the scarecrow from the Wizard of Oz) as a villain this time, Tommy Kirk and Annette Funnicello of the early Disney family and timeless Christmas music from the original stage version,Babes and Toyland should be an annual tradition alongside Its a Wonderful Life and Miracle on 34th St.
