 I lived in Denver when Alan Burke (the talk show host this movie is truly based on) was alive and broadcasting. I can testify first hand, that the actor in Talk Radio had Alan Burke down to a tee.  I enjoy character driven movies more than action driven movies and it is always interesting when well written dialogue and first rate action can keep you glued to your seat. Incidently, poorly written dialogue along with over the top, overdone action scenes are the usual hallmarks of Stone's films and that makes Talk Radio a rare exception. I would love to say that I hate Oliver Stone's movies, but this particular release, along with Wall Street prevents me from saying that with 100 percent truthfulness.  Being a local radio talk show host myself, I have enjoyed the very few movies about radio hosts (Good Morning Vietnam and Play Misty For Me also come to mind. Of course in "Misty" Clint Eastwood's occupation is only background for a much different story, so this Oliver Stone vehicle and Good Morning Vietnam are the only two major movies on this subject that I know of.)  With the popularity of talk radio that has occurred in our country this last decade and a half, I am surprised that the film, Talk Radio is not more popular on DVD. But I will make an effort to change that situation. As soon as I finish writing this review, I am ordering my copy!
