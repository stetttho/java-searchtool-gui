 Never in the history of television did a show start out so good and end up so terrible. Lost in Space (in the second two seasons) drifted from science fiction to fantasy and silly fantasy at that with Dr. Smith (a once clever and sinister villian) turning into a bumbling idiot who is over used in each episode, to the detriment of the other characters (with the exception of Will and the robot who had also been transformed by this time from a real robot to to a being so laughable, it became embarressing). There were some notable exceptions, so yes, I will admit to a few good episodes in the second two seasons but for the most part, the show had lost its steam by then. The good news is that Season One is wonderful, well written, well acted and not bad in the special effects department considering when the series was made (mid-sixties)The black and white helped to make things look more realistic and occassionally shots of the moving land vehicle (called the chariot) were seen against the back drop of a real desert which gave us the feel that these people really were on a remote planet somewhere. Although Dr. Smith's silliness is established by the end of season one, the stories at least are still good and the show can still at this point be called science fiction. Perhaps the contrast between this season and the following two make Season One a special treasure to be cherished.
