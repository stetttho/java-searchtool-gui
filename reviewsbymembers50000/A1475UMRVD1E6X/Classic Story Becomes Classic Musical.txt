 Excellent acting and well written dialogue, true to the style of the original Dickens classic and filled out with pleasant musical numbers which enhance, rather than take away from the story. The style of music and street choreography may remind you of the film musical,Oliver. Added dialogue includes a more detailed look at the many paupers who owe Scrooge money and the very clever twist of Scrooge seeing himself in hell. (curtesy of the ghost of Christmas Future, of course.) I do not let a Christmas go by anymore without watching this movie. It has joined my list of classics such as It's A Wonderful LIfe and Miracle On 34th St. Although most professional reviews praised the acting and gave obligatory kudoes to the Dickens story itself, I was disappointed to see many critics unhappy with the songs. Some labeled the music as "bad to mediodcre" and I couldn't disagree more. If you have read such reviews, do yourself a favor and ignore them. Oh certainly, in any musical there will be one or two pieces that you could have done without, but most of the score is excellent. From the extremely clever and fun number, "Thank You Very Much" to the sweet melodic "Happiness", Scrooge, the Musical should take its place with the greats and perhaps will someday. Remember, there was a time when It's A Wonderful LIfe was considered a flop too.
