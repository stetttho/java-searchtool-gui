 Imogen Linny. She's too quirky, so what makes a reader invite her into the story? We accept her into the story because we think we may love her, if we just learn a little more.  Imogen becomes obsessed with a painting titled  "Jewess on a Street in Amsterdam." She desires to enter the art  completely by becoming the woman featured in the painting. DeFoe, a guard  at the museum, steals the painting for her, hoping to assuage her delusion.  Instead, Imogen enters the delusion further. She leads an unauthorized  tour, telling the museum-goers that she is the wife of the painter, making  up details of their life together, confiding her desire to return to her  painter husband. Strangely, Imogen is unconcerned that the Nazi's are about  to invade Holland and her return to her "husband" would only last until the  Nazi's arrested her. Imogen is equally unconcerned that this painter has no  idea who she is. Imogen finds help to continue in her delusion by the  people you expect to support her least. Imogen goes to Holland and the  Nazi's invade shortly after. That the story doesn't degenerate into  complete farce is due to Norman's ability to present fantastic events as if  they were commonplace.
