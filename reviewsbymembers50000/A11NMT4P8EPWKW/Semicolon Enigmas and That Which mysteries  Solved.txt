 The only book on grammar that I have read and continue to use. I've suffered through old high school grammar books and dry technical grammar books for writers and they all made me feel that understanding the rules of  grammar was like trying to pave a football field with contact  lenses--tedious and futile. The lessons in "Woe is I" are  memorable due to the quirky sentence examples and the author's sense of  humor.
