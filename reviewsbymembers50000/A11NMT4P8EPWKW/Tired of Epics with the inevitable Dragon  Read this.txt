 Fed up with those bloated "trilogies," now on book 7 or 8, when  the story died during book two? Want more than Fantasy soap opera and  Fantasy-Light? Than read this book. YesYesYes. The fox character is a  rare creation - you feel how alien he is from human ways and emotions, he's  not just a human character who gets furry now and then. The fox character  is as vivid and unusual a character as Golum was in "Lord of the  Rings." The orgy scene was weird, and I still don't know if I liked  it, but it made discovering Nyateneri's secret a delicious surprise!  I  was absolutely *mesmerized* by Beagle's handling of the fight scene between  Nyateneri and the two strange men who had trapped her inside the steam  room. And also, again, when Tikat is pursuing after his Lukassa - Beagle's  description of the starvation, delirium and exhaustion that Tikat suffered  was so convincing that I re-read the same paragraphs over and over just for  the pleasure of hearing the rhythm and cadence of Tikat's voice.
