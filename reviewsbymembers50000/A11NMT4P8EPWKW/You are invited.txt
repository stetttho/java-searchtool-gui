 I invite all you middle-aged Muggles reading this review to take a chance and read this book. I'm a grown-up (about twice over) and I loved this story, particularly the descriptions of the sport of Quidditch: Imagine  Soccer, but with the rules rewritten by the likes of Jim Carey and Adam  Sandler and you'll have some idea of how amusing this sport is.  In Harry  Potter's world, paintings become doors with the right password, men live in  wooden houses and raise fire breathing Dragons, chessmen advise you as to  their optimal deployment and eating a chocolate frog is a good thing!    Listen, Rowling is right about the world being full of fearful Muggles  who have lost their sense of magic. Fortunately, after reading this book,  you won't be one of them. And, should your children, after reading this  book, turn a mouse into a snuffbox, I suggest, in true Hogwarts Tradition,  that you award points for originality, but gravely deduct for any whiskers  left upon it.
