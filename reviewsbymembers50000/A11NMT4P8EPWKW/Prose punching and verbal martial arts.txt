 Amos walker is a heavyweight prose puncher and a verbal jujitsu master. There are so many one-liners here that you could squash a pack mule under their combined weight. But what great one-liners! The kind of lines you write down on 3 x 5 cards and study before parties. Jab and punch phrases like, "He is so rich that the amount of his property taxes alone would keep the Third World in rice and prayer rugs for the next decade." Not a direct quote, but something close; you kinda make em' your own after a while because Amos Walker is your friend and you know he won't mind. Yeah, OK. The one-liners distract a little, but they don't disguise how smart Amos is. He notices everything, and as Hard-Boiled fiction fate would have it, the smallest details hold the most significant revelations. This is a Motor City mystery and Amos details city life with quick sour sketches guaranteed to make you pucker with delight. Amos is an old-school detective: He pours his own drinks-straight, packs simple heat-concealed; he's tougher than a 99 cent steak-well done, and is never more than two phone calls away from finding out anything needing finding out. If you've gone a few rounds with the likes of Chandler, Hammett, Parker or Leonard, than at least come ringside with Estleman cuz he can go the distance.
