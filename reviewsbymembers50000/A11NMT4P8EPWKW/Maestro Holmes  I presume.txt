 The description of the Opera house is so well done that it almost becomes  a character unto itself. The powers of the ghost are convincing - how could  any human accomplish the deeds attributed to it? Has Holmes met a force  beyond the reach of his genius and logic? Original tale and yet it keeps  the charm of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle alive.   I was always facinated by  Holmes' two creative crutches - cocaine and the violin. The use of one or  the other always brought the needed solution into his mind and so I was  very pleased that Meyer showed us more about Holmes' musical abilities.  Bringing Irene Adler into the story was also a nice touch.
