 Rushdie's writing contains the joyous confusions of being claimed by two cultures. I love when Rushdie digresses a bit and lets loose a curious flood of details, such as when describing a case of noxious bad breath, or,  delivering a feast of images as he does in "At The Auction of the Ruby  Slippers." The stories are rewardingly short--you can enjoy an  11-minute vacation and come back with something to think about.
