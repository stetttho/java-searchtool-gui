 The book says in a very long and poetic way--"it's easy once you know how." Well, it's the "know how" part that stumps me. These books always have the mysterious Teacher. You know, the ancient Chinese  mystic named Chang or Yellowfeather, the Native American Indian. In this  one it's a man named Gideon. I've got a boss, several bill collectors, and  a triumvirate of bickering in-laws, and I don't think any of them are my  mysterious Gideon. If you are in the Valley of muck and mire this book  won't help you find where lies The Mountain.
