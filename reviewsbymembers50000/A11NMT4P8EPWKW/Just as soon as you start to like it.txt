 This novel reads like it was written by numerous authors, each one  piggy-backing on the material of the prior writer. Just as soon as you  start to get a feeling for scene and interest in the characters - wham! You  are off on another adventure - new scene, new characters. I found that to  be frustrating and it kept me from getting that "lost in another  world" feeling that I crave from Sci-Fi writers. That said, there is  SO much creative promise here that I will read Dorn's next installment just  to see if things don't settle down a bit.
