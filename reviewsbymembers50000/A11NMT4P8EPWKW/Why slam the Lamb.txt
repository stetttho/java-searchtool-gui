 Dolores Price narrates a depressing tale full of sad encounters, cruel  coincidences and tragic timing - it's kind of like Forrest Gump, but  without the Prozac. Many readers found Dolores' story to be overwhelming,  gave it one star and complained: "I was deceived by Oprah."                    Oh, wake up! Lamb captured the lust for self-destruction  extremely well in the charachter of Dolores Price. Lamb stands Depression  up on its feet, kicks it in front of a mirror and allows us to look back at  the reflected abyss shown in the mind, actions and body of Dolores. When  Dolores hears about whales dying in Wellfleet she heads there in a cab  which makes no sense unless you understand how depression can warp your  sanity. Severely depressed people crave self-negation and behave so ugly  that it makes you sick to love them. Depression (Dolores) is ugly - Lamb  describes it, captures it, even allows you as the reader to suffer it along  with Dolores. If you can't handle it then go back to TV's Baywatch, but  don't put the slam on the Lamb because he didn't waft soft sunshine puffs  against your teary cheeks to lighten it all up.
