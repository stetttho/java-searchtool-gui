 This is old school writing, writing from before the days of the bloated bestsellers. When writers wrote books instead of Hollywood enticements for screenplays.   Lenny carries forth on the strength of a dream, a dream  whose destruction is wrought by his own physical strength. George is  something of a Depression era Jesus; giving hope and life to Lenny and  later, destroying that life; performing an act of sacrifice and love by  taking Lenny's suffering upon himself and setting Lenny free. Steinbeck  tells a story without employing a "cast of thousands," without relying upon  exotic locations and eccentric characters for denouement, without  gratuitous violence, prolific profanity and sizzling sex scenes. Steinbeck  gives you character. Character driven by Hunger and Hope (George and  Lenny), character personifying meanness (Curly) and Loneliness (Curly's  wife). Steinbeck wrote a simple story that is character driven and plot  maintained and scarcely over one hundred pages long.   A knockout.
