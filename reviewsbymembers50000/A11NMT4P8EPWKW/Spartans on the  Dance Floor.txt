 Pressfield's narrative ruthlessly reveals the Spartan efficiency in battle. His power of description makes you feel as if you are watching a documentary filmed on location. Every reader will have a page or special  paragraph where they are compelled to give homage to these original  Hard-Core Soldiers. Mine was when Pressfield described how the front line  of Spartan soldiers bought their eight footers from the vertical to the  horizontal in one movement, as if the line was one creature, with one mind.  Men in the second and even third ranks, thrust their weapons over the  shoulders of their own men, turning the Spartan line into a piercing wall  of death. That warriors who knew this to be their last battle could  accomplish such unity and precision makes you bow your head in awe.  A  battlefield is strewn with tens of thousands of bodies. The horrible mass  appears to move because the wounded and dying in their writhing cause this  flesh mountain to look like the movements of one gigantic creature. Fear  and Death have turned the earth into a shin-deep broth of urine and blood.  What kind of steel spirit would it take to behold this battlefield and  refer to it as "The Dance Floor?" Only a warrior of Sparta! The criteria  that King Leonidas used in choosing the Three Hundred who would stand and  die at the Hot Gates is the supreme example of harsh Spartan wisdom. The  Three Hundred never knew the real reason King Leonidas selected them over  their brethren, but you will know by the end of the book. This revelation  alone is enough to challenge any ideas you had about Spartans. I had  believed the Spartans were a warrior cult without reverence for life,  something like ancient Clingons, but without honor. I now know that the  Spartans shared bonds of brotherhood as rigorous and sacred as any  religious order and that their brutality contained the raw compassion  needed for survival.
