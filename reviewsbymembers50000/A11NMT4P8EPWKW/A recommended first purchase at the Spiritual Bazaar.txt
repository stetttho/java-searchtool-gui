 I am standing at the entrance gates of a huge Spiritual Bazaar. Every vendor within this bazaar has a "Sri" before his name. Who do I approach first? Who is sincere? How can a journey begin when so many True paths  present themselves? This book by Sri Chimnoy answers: Meditation. How do  I meditate? What is the best time? Where is the best place? In what manner  should I sit? Is what I am experiencing normal? Are the experiences during  meditation taking me beyond or are they only the mind deceiving me? The  book is in question and answer format and you will find your question(s)  here because all the questions come from those who are meditating, from  those who are wondering, experiencing, doubting and celebrating the same as  you. This was of great value to know that what I experience; the sometime  bliss and the often frustration, the phantom and the concrete, have been  experienced by others, that their questions are my questions. We walk upon  the same path, bruise our heels on the same stones, marvel at the same  vistas. What a revelation and a relief to know this!
