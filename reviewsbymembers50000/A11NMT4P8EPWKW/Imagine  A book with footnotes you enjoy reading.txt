 You're never quite sure what the Vikings are up against and that makes the  story an eerie adventure into the unknown. I enjoyed the  contrasting  viewpoints between Ibn Fadlan, an Arab observer (Holy, Clean and Couth) and  the lusty crew of Vikings. (Charmingly Crude) While Ibn Fadlan clearly  would never want to be a Viking he tells their story with such honesty that  many readers will find that they too wish they could have been among  them. Crichton mixes history, folklore and epic quest together so well  that there is no way to know where history ends and Crichton begins,  especially in those wonderful footnotes.
