 The scheduled maintenance is easy to perform without much initial start-up cost for tools. I have a modest garage-based work shop, (Workbench, vice grip, electric drill, and a few common hand tools hanging on the peg board)  and I have been able to perform almost all of the maintenance routines  unassisted, right here at home. Although, a decent set of ratchets would  facilitate greatly.  Whether you jut out, stand out, stick out, poke out,  stick up, bristle up, shoot up, swell over, hang over or bend over (Severe,  but fortunately rare) you will find a perfect maintenance routine for your  Schnozzle, Honker, Gibbosity, Hump, Beak, Hooter, Bulb, Node,. . . I have  removed 30 years off my Wafter and can now flair my nostrils like a tyke of  20. Check out the chapter on "Chiseling the Dashing Profile."   Stuart shows you how you can have that Gablesque profile for less than the  cost of the book!
