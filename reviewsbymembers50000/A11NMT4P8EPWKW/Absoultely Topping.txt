 You know me as, Sir Clifford of Wragby, the gentleman who gets cuckolded by a fatuous gamekeeper in my employ named Mellors. Well, I simply won't stand for it; a man of his low breeding forgetting his place. Oh, this  Oliver Mellors is quite the cad, a Born Bounder, as are all Derbyshire men,  I'm told. Right. Now see here, Lads, I hired this Mellors chap as my  gamekeeper, but he has cultivated a taste for larger game than the rabbits,  wouldn't you say? And Lady Chatterley? My Chaste Connie? Well, I'm sure  that I don't know. How could she? Surely not! A woman of her position?   Lady Chatterley, lowering herself to surreptitious ephemeral  engagements?   Lady Chatterley, cavorting about the Wragby Estate? Lady  Chatterley, seduced by the promise of Priapic Pleasures? God, how  ghastly! I assure you, that I would take this man Mellors to task if it  weren't for the injury that has fated me to this wheelchair (a beastly  mechanical contrivance, to be sure.) Oh, blast it all, man. If it weren't  for this infernal contraption, which confines me completely, I dare say  that Mellors would never have been in a position to "press the issue," as  it were. Not much to be done for it now, is there, Lads? So bloody hard  to hire decent help these days, pity really.  Well, that said, let's have  no more of this nasty business. Right. I'm off, stiff, upper lip, always  ready for a go and all that. I shall bear it all for England, as one must.   Cheerio.
