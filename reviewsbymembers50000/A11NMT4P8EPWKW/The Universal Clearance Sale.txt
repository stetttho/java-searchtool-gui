 The planets were marching in single file, lined up and poised in united supplication before the Universal Office of Harmonic Convergences. This was going to be Planet Earth's biggest clearance sale yet. But the promised  ice deluge never came; however, we had at least hoped to see miracles on  this day or the days following:  Like a video clip of levitating  Nebraskan cattle and the farmer saying, "Nope, they ain't never done  that b'fore."   Or to have seen the bare feet of Jesus walking  across the dome of the world and the hem of his garment sweeping the  constellations from the firmament and showers of shooting stars following  in its wake! Or to have seen a satellite photo showing the swirling of  giant interlacing ocean tides whose rippling effects are forming letters in  longitude-long foamy script. The letters would be written in an Aquatic  Dialect that no one speaks, but the message is clear to all of us:  "KNOCK IT OFF!" it says in Blue-Green GAIA Script. Oh, how we  longed for the Angels to come. To have them materialize at our evening  tables in a breezy eddy of Atomic-Silver. To let them partake of Suburban  meatloaf and Southwestern cuisine. To let our children raise their glasses  of Gatorade in a playful toast. Jesus uncorks the wine from the wedding  feast and Elijah reclines before an empty plate. Buddha has happy ears,  longer and larger than ever.  The Pope addresses the masses gathered in  St. Peter's Square. He tells them in eight different languages that Jesus  has returned and sits in his office awaiting instructions. He tells them  that Salvation will begin as soon as the paper work is completed.  But,  alas, on May 5th and the days that followed, we in the Northern Hemisphere  rolled out of bed and went to work and our sister shadows in the Southern  did the same, except they stirred their coffee counterclockwise.
