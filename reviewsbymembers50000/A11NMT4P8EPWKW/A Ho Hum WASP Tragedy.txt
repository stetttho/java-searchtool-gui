 I very much liked the image of the catcher who keeps those kids from falling over a crazy cliff. But I had to wade through a lot of slag to find that gem. The problem is that Holden is such an unsympathetic character.  He's a rich, East coast WASP who has been given several opportunities for a  free education. How does he respond? Well, he can't apply himself because  everyone is too phony. Hell, Holden could find phoniness lurking in a fruit  bowl. What passes for tragedy in Holden's life? Losing his fencing team's  foils on the subway or discovering that a seedy hotel also has seedy  clientele. How can you care what happens to a character like  this? Perhaps, if Holden was freed from his parent's economic bondage he  could finally toss off those golden manacles; become homeless and head  downtown for the free eats; stand in a soup line three times a day and  finally get hit with some Freakin Real! I hate Holden, Catcher and all, I  really do.
