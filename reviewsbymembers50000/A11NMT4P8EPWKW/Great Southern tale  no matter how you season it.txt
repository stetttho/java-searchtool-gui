 Baldwin serves up a great Southern tale but lets you have some say in the seasoning. Stories are told from different angles and so you have to reason out your own version of events. It's not the least bit confusing, however; because Baldwin is too good of a story teller for that. You can believe that the Hard to Catch Mercy's (yes, that is a character's name) sister was or wasn't pregnant. You can believe that a great family treasure (buried somewhere) exists or never existed. Was the preacher's wife guilty in deed or only in thought? I enjoyed entertaining the different possibilities and the subtle flavor changes they brought to the tale.  Maum Anna is so complex and rich of a character that I can't imagine that Baldwin invented her. Instead, I choose to believe that he knows Maum Anna personally. I hope he does because I really have to know what kind of Christian, Voodoo-whammy Maum Anna unleashed upon the sheriffs poor ole dogs! I'm listening Mr. Baldwin,!  tell me another tale.
