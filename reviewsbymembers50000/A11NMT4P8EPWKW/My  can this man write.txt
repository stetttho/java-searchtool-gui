 Finally, an author who isn't trying to impress me with their Zipity-Zing  for prose or how wacked-out they can make their characters. Gaines is a  solid writer and he gives everything to the story.  Gaines reigns in his  writing so it never lets out the anger, frustration and disillusionment  that the characters carry. I wanted so much for Grant to explode, do  something brass and big and even after the fight scene, I was still waiting  for release. And that's when I realized how well crafted and artful an  author Gaines is. Gaines made me FEEL what Grant felt his whole life, what  Grant's people and community felt; a hungry anger that can never be sated.  I felt this anger so clearly that when I closed the book I felt as though I  had in some way fulfilled Grant's desire of getting out of that town and  going somewhere better.
