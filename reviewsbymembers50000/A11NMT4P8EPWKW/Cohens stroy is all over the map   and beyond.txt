 I have always hungered for an adventure that was ambigious enough that I would be forced to complete it in order to unravel the mystery. Clayton Smith left Andy Mann just such an adventure. Although Clayton Smith is a  dead character, he is the most interesting character in the book. Even at  the end, I was not convinced that he was really dead; like Elvis and Jim  Morrison, I can readily imagine folkore explanations about how he still  lives. Read Invisible World and you will find out that Inner Mongolia has  more dimensions than shown on the map.
