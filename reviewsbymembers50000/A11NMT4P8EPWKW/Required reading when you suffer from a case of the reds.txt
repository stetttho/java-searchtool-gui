 I loved the wandering, Impromptu prose! Breakfast at Tiffany's is a romp through a vapid party; advice on what to do when you've gone from blue to  red; secrets in the past that appear and stand on the street corner outside  your apartment; and finally, a pathetic act of cat dumping. What impressed  me most were the three short stories that followed Breakfast at Tiffany's.  "A House of Flowers," read like a short story influenced by  Garcia Marquez or Borges. And "The Diamond Guitar," sketches out  memorable characters with an impressive scaracity of pages that only a  master writer could make a story thrive in such a short word economy.
