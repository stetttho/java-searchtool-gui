 Imagine a black and white world lifted from an old Borgart movie. Imagine mean streets imported from a Raymond Chandler novel leading to a big city called 1950's Somewhere, USA. Imagine Pleasantville, but with smog.  Colson's world is like a coat sleeve that was inverted half way-part of  this world you readily recognize, the other half is a spooky reflection.  You know you have seen it before but can't quite place where. The  Intuitionist reads like a fable from another world that magically tells our  worlds history. The Intuitionists have committed an ideological  insurrection against the Empiricists by using the controversial  "Intuitionist" method of ascertaining elevator safety. In this  eerily familiar alternative world, elevators rarely fail, so the contention  between the two factions appears to be the proverbial "Tempest in a  Teapot." However, this is a story about vested interests and how such  interests impede progress, how they will wage a costly war over valueless  turf. This is a story about self-preservation when evolution is clearly  arguing for extinction.  Colson's prose is a skin that defines the form  of some famished and untamed beast. I have seen this creature hiding in the  type font shadows, crouched, and ready to spring up at us from the base of  every paragraph. The exact symmetry of this beast I can't say, but that it  is angry, I have no doubt.
