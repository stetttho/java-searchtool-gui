 The Road to Wellville is an amusing story of people in search of Organic Grace. These people believe that they suffer from the visceral accumulation of toxic sludge brought on by years of improper diet. Since the rigors of  eating were never mastered better than by the great Cleansed Colon himself,  Dr. Kellogg, they follow his ever command. They scour their colons, blast  out their bowels, purge their way to purity--yet, despite the daily  intrusions to their lower orifices', they still end up digging their own  graves with their teeth.  Told with unrelenting satire, The Road to  Wellville is the story of an original Health Nut and all his pampered  followers. Provides great insights into the Fad that still drains wallets  today.
