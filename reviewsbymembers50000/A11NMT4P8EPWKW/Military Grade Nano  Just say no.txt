 In an awful scene, Bear describes several bodies which were found  hooked-up to Military Grade Nano. This allowed them to be molded like clay.  The molders of these bodies were designing them for sexual pleasure. One  body had strange folds of skin attached to its cheeks and when I found out  what they were I became ill. Bear didn't go for the "Gross-Out,"  this was deeper and brutally visceral. In this scene Bear makes a chilling  observation: If man could, he would. I was ill with the Truth of that  terrible scene. Sentient machines have not aroused sympathy from me in  Sci-fi novels. Slant is a BIG exception. I cared about the Thinkers. I  marveled at the prose Bear used to make these machines alive. Bear  consistently describes their processes in cool mechanical terms and yet I  thought warmly about them. Bear's characterization of the Thinkers alone  was worth the price of the popcorn.
