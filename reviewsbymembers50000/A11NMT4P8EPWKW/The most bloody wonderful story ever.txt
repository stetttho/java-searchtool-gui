 Blantantly predictable, (I mean, you knew old Havisham was going to burn,  didn't you?) Clunky plot, inevitable morality tale, and still the most  bloody wonderful story ever! I would watch Great Expectations on the big  screen, I'd watch the mini-series, I'd pay to see it live on Broadway - and  none of that would compare with reading it again.
