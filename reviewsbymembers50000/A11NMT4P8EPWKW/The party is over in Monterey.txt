 Tortilla Flats suggests that buried under every rock, concealed within every bush, throughout the Monterey peninsula of California, lie secreted bottles of wine, and that every tree shades a Paisano ready for a swallow of said wine.  The following are the besotted knights in this tale of comic chivalry: Danny, The Portagee, Pirate and his dogs, Pilon, Jesus Maria and Pablo. You'll come to know and love each one. The Paisanos live in an economy where wine is the currency. Every action, from antics to amour, is done for a "little swallow of wine." This economy is threatened when Danny inherits two houses from his grandfather. Now he has risen in society. He sleeps with the woman next door, a fellow landowner, a triumph unthinkable prior to his fortuitous (?) inheritance.  Danny chooses to live in one home and rent out the other to his friends. Now, they live comfortably, sleep warm. Predictably, into this Eden the snake shall come. Steinbeck describes the inevitable "Fall" with enough comedy so you'll laugh, but not forget to weep when misfortune strikes.
