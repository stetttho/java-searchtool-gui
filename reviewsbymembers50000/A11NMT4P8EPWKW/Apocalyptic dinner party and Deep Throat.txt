 The American Pastoral is a widening abyss demarcated only by the incurable abscess of moral and structural decline around its ever-expanding rim. Can  one discover the exact event that caused the wrong? Futile. Suture the  abscess and drain the decay? Never. Live right? Love well? Neither provides  nor protects. The world is like a glove that has been turned inside out.  All design and color have gone underground. "Swede Levov" hits the  endangered species list and Orcutt leads the vanguard for the vigorously  vapid. Glove making and cattle raising.  Riots and neighborhood blight.   Dinner party and Deep Throat. The details in the story are mesmerizing,  the background, imposing, and the digressions, demonic. Roth attacks the  denouement with an exciting staccato touch, but he diminishes the effect by  employing too many fermatas. A conversation is interrupted while the ethos  of an entire generation is outlined before the conversation continues. The  misanthropic mystery that is Rita Cohen, who calls during the apocalyptic  dinner party and then evaporates, unsolved, can only be likened to a sudden  glottal stop that truncates the music too harshly. And finally, the grand  fermata that is Zukerman - on hold since page 89 while he "dreamed a  realistic chronicle, began gazing into his (The Swede's) life." If the  mental copulation of possibilities were an Olympic event, then Zukerman  (Roth) would be solid gold.
