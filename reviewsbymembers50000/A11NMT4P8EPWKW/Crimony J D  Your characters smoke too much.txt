 "Zooey" opens with Zooey taking a bath and for the next 68! pages he never leaves the bathroom. Denouement occurs when Zooey draws shut the shower curtain so Bessie, his mother, can enter the bathroom. Zooey and Bessie engage in a Verbal Karate match and accomplish nothing save the lighting, dragging on, and extinguishing of countless cigarettes. Oh yes - the medicine cabinet swings open incessantly, afterwhich, Zooey explains that his sister's hysteria is due to her poor choice in reading material. The entire 68 page bathroom scene is lightly punctuated by a delightful orange cuticle stick and several passive cameos from a blue bathmat. And more cigarettes: On the frosted-glass ledge and on the built-in enamel soap catch. Read "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance" by Robert M. Pirsig. It has all the Mystic Flavor of "Franny and Zooey" without the Tar and Nicotine.
