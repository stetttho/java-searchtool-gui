 I did not feel any sympathy for these jacked-up characters and when someone finally got their scalp ripped off and their spine crushed, I merely felt relief that this was one less pathetic personality I had to  keep track of. The dialog was as vapid as the intelligence of the lead  character, Sara Morgan, who has an IQ of about room temperature and  performs the expected Dumb-Damsel moves that makes for typical schlock  suspense. (Oh gosh, can Liam really, really be so bad? Golly, Gee!)  The  story concept promises something terrifying along the lines of Saul, King  or Koontz, but the terror it delivers is tame enough for Mr. Rodgers  Superstitious Neighborhood.
