 Gaiman has proven that you can write fantasy without including the duo of Dwarf and Dragon or placing the story in a "Knights of the Round Table" setting. I loved Gaimans London, (both above and below) and his  characters, while undertaking the Epic quest (of sorts), are jacked-up  enough to be wildly amusing. I read this book six months ago and I still  find myself eyeing walls for concealed openings and wondering where closed  doors on old buildings *really* lead to.
