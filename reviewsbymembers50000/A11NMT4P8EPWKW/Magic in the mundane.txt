 Tales of the working man. Waiting for your car to be repaired. Drinking in a bar. Losing your favorite sweater. Gilb is an alchemist because he can take the most mundane details and turn them into magic. Reading his stories  is like walking along a cold concrete floor and then suddenly enteing a  rose garden in full bloom inexplicably rising out of the concrete. How did  all this beauty rise through the cold reality?
