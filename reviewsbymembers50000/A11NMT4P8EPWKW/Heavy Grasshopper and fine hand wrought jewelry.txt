 Philip K. Dick captures the ethos of both the Japanese and German cultures. Taking from both peoples-- their good and the bad qualities-- he creates a future that is eerily familiar. He describes the Germans as  "driven by some desperate sub-conscience archetype....their egos  expanded psychotically so that they cannot tell where they begin and the  godhead leaves off." That succinctly sums up the Nazi thirst! The  psychological, religious and political insights surrounding the jewelry,  expressed great insight from Dick about the nature of the conquered and the  conqueror. The speculation of the U.S. being overrun by Japanese culture is  not so far removed from current reality. I read this during lunch hours at  the Sony Corporation surrounded by inscrutable and ambiguous Japanese;  always speaking in the Mother tongue so as to obscure the directives from  the Home Islands. Childen, in his relationship with Tagomi and Paul,  suffered Place-consciousness and always struggled to hear the real  conversation veiled beneath the spoken one. Childen experienced how very  low the Rice Paper ceiling is, and while it is lighter than the American  Glass variety, it is infinitely more impenetrable. Many passages in this  book read like a contemporary documentary.
