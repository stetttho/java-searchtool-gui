 The bookend stories were the best. But Salinger is certainly not the American Borges as some have claimed. John Cheever, Richard Yates, Sherwood Anderson; these were great short story writers. The attraction is to read  these stories for some hints about the Glass family. I find something  disturbing about this family or more on target, the reaction of readers to  the Glass family. Seymour could clip his toenails and readers would find in  this activity some symbolic comment on The Eight Fold Path or, perhaps, the  essence of Zen in the manner Seymour tosses the clippings into an ashtray.  Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. Sometimes you don't like a story because  it's weak and not because you missed the East-Salinger Symbolism. I found  it amusing that all nine stories repeatedly used cigarettes as plot  propellants. Was J. D. under grant from Lucky Strikes? Whenever Salinger  wants you to know he's about to be prophetic he uses a cigarette as a  harbinger of the coming epiphany. His characters handle cigarettes, smoke  them, and move ashtrays about and, on two occasions, even handle the  contents of the ashtrays. A cigarette can be a great prop, but not for nine  straight stories.
