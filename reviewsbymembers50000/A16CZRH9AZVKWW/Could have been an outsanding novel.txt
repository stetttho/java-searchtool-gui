 REMBRANDT'S WHORE takes place during the second half of Rembrandt's life, in Amsterdam.  It tells the story of Hendrickje Stoffels, a 20 year old girl who moves in from the country, in order to serve as maid in Rembrandt's household.  Rembrandt has her pose for his paintings, and soon falls in love with her.  Because of a contract he has signed, regarding not being able to marry after his former wife's death, at the expense of having to pay a sum which he does not posses, he is not able to marry her, and thus she becomes his "whore".  From a historical perspective, we are exposed to war, the plague, religious intolerance, and politics.  All of these factors play important roles as they compose the background of the story.  The second half of Rembrandt's life was characterized by bankruptcy, illness, and his downfall from Amsterdam's best known painter to his being exploited by various political figures, who took advantage of his precarious situation. Hendrickje stands by him and provides him with care, emotional support, and a child, Cornelia.  It is because of her that Rembrandt is able to live, having lost his wife Saskia and children in a tragic manner.  The plot is well conceived and interesting.  I was unpleasantly surprised by the book's form.  REMBRANDT'S WHORE is basically a monologue by Hendrickje, sometimes in first person, and others in second, as she talks directly to Rembrandt.  Quite franky, the novel is often confusing.    Also, due to the fact that  a 20 year old, practically illiterate, peasant girl narrates the story, the novel's flow is absolutely nonexistent.  This makes it difficult to read and quite franky boring.  I have read quite a few biographical novels regarding the lives and times of famous painters, and this one rank's pretty low, and cannot be compare this to other books of the same genre.  A specific example is Irving Stone's LUST FOR LIFE, about Vincent VanGogh.  Now, that's a masterpiece.....
