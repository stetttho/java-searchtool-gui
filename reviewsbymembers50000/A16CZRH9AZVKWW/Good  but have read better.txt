 This historical novel deals with the extermination of the Knights Templar and the curse that came upon the french monarchy as a result.    However interesting and easy to read, lacks a bit of character and plot depth.  The author builds up a situation or conflict, only to resolve it in very few paragraphs, and to a certain extent in very predictable ways.  If I compare it to the Alexandros Trilogy (Manfredi), I'd have to say this one is not as good and left me with a certain sense of emptiness.  This is the first of 7 volumes and based on this one, I'll go as far as one more and see what happens.
