 Together with Garcia Mrquez, Jorge Isaacs and Toms Carasquilla, Jose Eustasio Rivera is one of the great colombian and latinamerican writers. Garcia Maquez has written to the world about the "bananero" crisis and Colombia, while Rivera does the same but for the "caucho" plantations situation. This book is written with probably the same passion that Vincent van Gogh painted.  Once you start reading it you will be inmersed in a world that is probably new to you, that of the inclemencies of the south american "selvas" (jungles) and the way they devour those who defy them. This book is definitely worth reading and is written in a fast paced elegant Spanish.
