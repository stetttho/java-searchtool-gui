 WORLD SO WIDE is a pretty good book, and even though it's the first of Sinclair's novels I have read, it is understandable that he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1930.  The novel regards the life and times of Hayden Chart, a typical American living in Colorado during the post WWII years.  Chart's seemingly perfect life is suddenly shattered by the death of his wife in an automobile accident, for which cannot help but feel guilty.  When his wife passes away, Chart decides to run away to Europe, in an effort to reconstruct his life.  He winds up in Florence, where most of the novel takes place.  He has realized that all that he is, is a good architect, and apart from that his life is very empty. He had thought of himself as a well cultured person, only to realize that on the contrary, he is quite ignorant.  His circle of friends in Colorado consists of a group of superficial characters, from which he must run away. He makes up his mind to become a european history scholar, which he sees as a way to live a better life.   In his process to relive his life, he meets Olivia, a cold hearted Italian history professor, with whom he falls deeply in love with.  While in Italy, he develops a relationship with the American colony, which is also filled with a set of pretty superficial characters.  The plot flows with much ease, and the 200+ pages are both involving and easy to read.  Chart, Olivia, and a few of the secondary characters are extremely well developed, humanized and extremely believable characters.  I would not consider the book to be a page turner, but none the less, it is definitely a novel worth reading.  Chart's effort to rebuild his life, his being exposed to real love for the first time, and his effort to survive in a new world, quite different from his own, provide for a few hours of entertainment. He never becomes a historian, but he is able to turn his life around.
