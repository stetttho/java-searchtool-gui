 Overall, LYING ON THE COUCH, is a pretty good book.  Regardless of the fact that I'm not into psychological analysis, it was hard to put the book down.  I would not go as far as calling it a page-turner, though. It cannot however be compared to WHEN NIETZSCHE WEPT, also by Yalom, which is one of the best books I have read in quite some time.  The plot is well conceived, crafted and very interesting, and all the characters are neatly woven into it.  The novel evolves around the character of Dr. Ernest Lash, an analyst who based on an enconter with another analyst, Dr. Trotter, decides to experiment with his next patient.  The experiment consists of openning up to the patient and telling her nothing but the truth.  It is fair to say that even though their relationship was brief, Trotter changed Lash's life.  Yet another analyst, Dr. Marshall Streider, who happens to be Lash's senior analyst, is also heavily involved in the plot.  Streider represents the typical analyst, who is thus very critical of Lash's experiment, and is extremely concerned with practicing psychiatry in a much more conventional manner.  Even though LYING ON THE COUCH is 369 pages long, I was impressed by Yalom's character development.  All characters have depth and come to life in the book.  I cannot help but compare Yalom's writing to another contemporary and successful author, John Grisham.  One is a psychiatrist and the other is a lawyer.  Based on their experiences, they both decide to write novels based on their professions.  With all due respect for Grisham, it is my opinion that his books are quite commercial, whereas Yalom's books have more depth and quality.  This book will not change your life, or even leave you thinking about it for months (unlike WHEN NIETZSCHE WEPT!), but it is entertaining and worth the time.
