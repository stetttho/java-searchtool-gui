 LA HERENCIA DE ESZTER is yet another excellent piece of writing from Hungarian writer Sandor Marai.  Eszter, the main character and narrator, lives in a house which she inherited from her father.  She shares the house with Nunu, who has been her maid and main confident for many years.  One day, she receives a letter from and old friend, Lajos, who announces a visit after an absence of 15 years.    Lajos, a dreamer, liar, poet and mainly a con man is responsible for Eszter and her family having lost most of what they owned.  Lajos' visit proves to be everything Eszter and Nunu expected it to be, and more.  The novel's main topic is the inevitable fulfillment of destiny, beyond reason, ethics and any type of moral code.  LA HERENCIA DE ESZTER is also a love story, a story of love that never was, and a story of love that could have been.  As in other of Marai's novels, the prose is beautifully written, and the book is very hard to put down.    The main characters are profound and full of life.  The plot is well conceived and very nicely laid out.  As in EL ULTIMO ENCUENTRO , also by Marai, people rejoining after having been apart for extended periods of time, is one of the novel's main pillars.  He is able to not only understand but portray and expose human feelings that have been kept in the deepest corners of their souls for many years.  I highly recommend this novel.
