 If you're looking for a complete account of post revolutionary Europe or of Napoleon's life, this is not the right book.  If what you're looking for is a summary of major events in the life of Napoleon, then this is the right book.  It does not go into detail and leaves out particularly interesting passages of Bonaparte's carreer, such as some of the battles and in particular Auterlitz.    As can be expected, if you have read about Napoleon before, you will be left with a sense of emptiness, as some critical and crucial events are covered in a single paragraph.  The only major shortcomming of the book is that it practically ignores Napoleon's relationship with women (Josephine, Marie-Louise)which as we all know is key to understanding Napoleonic history.    The book is very well documented and overall presents a very nice introduction to Napoleon.  Also, it is easy to read....
