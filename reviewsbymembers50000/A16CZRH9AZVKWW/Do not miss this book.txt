 Having read most of what Dumas has written, I can only say that this is one of his best novels.  It is adventurous, fast paced and written in a superb manner.   This book is a true delight and it is very hard to put down.  It is one of Dumas' lesser known pieces, and has not been published anywhere in quite a few years so it was not easy to find before this new hardback edition.
