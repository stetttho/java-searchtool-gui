 I am used to the fact that whenever I pick up a book by a Nobel laureate, it's usually a pretty safe bet.  Unfortunately, this was not the case with Andre Gide's LAFCADIO'S ADVENTURES.  To be quite frank, I had a very hard time finishisng the novel.  Lafcadio, the main character, has had a very hard life.  His mother went through a series of lovers, whom she made him call "uncle" every single time.  These men marked Lafcadio's life each in a different manner.  He turns out to be a poor man, both economically and emotionally.  All of a sudden he finds out he is the [illegal] son of a very rich man, and his life suddenly changes.  Combining his new situation with wit, imagination and a few perverse ideas, provides enough for what could have been an excellent plot and novel.  Together with a close friend, he designs a scam, involving the supposed kidnapping of the Pope, to swindle rich people out of their money.  Although the book is supposed to be funny and very witty, I must admit I simply did not get it.  Boring is the first word that comes to mind.  As I mentioned before, even the not-so-good books by Nobel laureates are usually above average.  In my opinion, not the case with LAFCADIO'S ADVENTURES
