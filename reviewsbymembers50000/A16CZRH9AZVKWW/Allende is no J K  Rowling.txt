 I deeply respect allende but she really messed up with this one. To me, this is a vulgar attempt at a latinamerican Harry Potter-ish novel of adventure.  You want to know what's even worse?  There's a sequel out.  I saw it and I couldn't believe it. I guess Allende acted like those rock stars that reach their peak and then think they can sell any garbage they put out....and sometimes do.
