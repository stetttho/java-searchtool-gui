 Perez-Reverte is an extremely well known writer, and I must admit this is the first of his books I pick up....rather dissapointing.  The story deals with a mystery, based on an ancient book,  which is developed in the world of antique booksellers and bibliophiles. The plot is very interesting and well conceived, but in my opinion, the characters lack depth.    For a mystery, the book does not grasp and involve you, it's simply too easy to put it down and do something else instead.  Not worth the time to get through the almost 500 pages.....
