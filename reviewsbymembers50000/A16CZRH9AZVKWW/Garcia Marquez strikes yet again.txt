 The novel, Gabo's first in a few years, came out yesterday, and by late evening, I had devoured the 109 pages.  A love story between a 90 year old man, who has never been in love,  and a 14 year old girl.  As is customary in Gabo's novels, the characters are full of life, and the plot is very rich and well conceived.  Overall, this is a sad book, full of memories of a man who's life is ending, and evokes passages of his life and of what he thought was love.  I would have loved for it to be 900 pages more !!!!!
