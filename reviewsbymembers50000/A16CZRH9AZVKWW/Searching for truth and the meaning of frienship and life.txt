 This book was written by Sandor Marai more than 50 years ago, in Hungary, and was banned.  It was then published in 1999, and in 2004, its 23rd edition was published.  This itself made me pick it up.  A book that has been edited 23 times in 5 years must have something.....  El Ultimo Encuentro deals with a couple of old men, who were absolutely inseparable during their younger years, and are now meeting again, after not seeing or hearing from each other in more than 40 years.  The entire novel revolves around the mysterious reason why they separated.  Life, friendship, loyalty and truth are deeply explored in the meeting between these two men, who in spite of not having any type of contact in 40 years, have thought about each other every single day of their lives.  The book is beautifully written, and is very hard to put down. Two men are bearing their souls, dreams, and memories....  In some ways, El Ultimo Encuentro reminds me of Hermann Hesse's writings....  Definitely worth your time.
