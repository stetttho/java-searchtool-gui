 H.G. Wells is, without a doubt, gifted with both imagination and the abilty to write.  FIRST MEN ON THE MOON is a very good read; it is well written, fast-paced, and the plot is most definitely intriguing.  What you get out of this book, in my opinion, depends highly on your expectations of it.  If you're looking for sci-fi written in 1901, and you want to be amazed by Wells as a visionary of things to come, this is not your book.  With the exception of a lunar landing, none of the "scientific" developments or discoveries created and described by Wells exist nor in all probabilities will ever exist.  This is the main reason why Jules Verne advocates place him well above Wells.    On the other hand, if what you want is a book that's easy and fun to read, with a plot that makes it hard to put the book down, then you're in for a treat.  Even though most of what Wells has written is pretty dense and by no means considered easy to read, this novel is.  As with many other writers in Victorian England, Wells is very influenced by his world and surroundings.  You will find (both on earth and on the moon!), that society is clearly divided into social classes, and it is definitely not Well's intention to disturb this normal "order" of things.    Each of the two main characters represents a different victorian current of thought.  While Cavor is a true scientific mind, and his main concerns are truth, mankind, and a better world overall.  Bedford is more adventurous and daring, and his main concerns are himself and his own wealth.  In a way, neither ever understands the other, as they are blinded by their own view of the world.    In summary, FIRST MEN ON THE MOON is definitely worth the time it takes to cover the 180+ pages, and when you put it down you will be left with a feeling of satisfaction.....
