 One Hundred Years of Solitude is definitely my favorite book of all times.  Since I considered I had read Gabo's masterpiece, I never got to reading Love in the Times of Cholera, until now.    A few days ago, I read Memoria de mis Putas Tristes, which came out about a week ago, and when writing a review, I thought too bad the book is not 900 pages long.  Then, hungry for more divine prose and magic realism, I remembered Love in the Times of Cholera.  I suddenly had 500 more pages of Gabo.  The book turns out to be a 50+ year long love story, superbly written as most of what Gabo has written.  The prose grabs you and does not let you go until the very last line.   Every now and then, one reads a sentence in a book and wonders how much feeling, effort, expeience and luck it takes to word something so beautifully.  This does not happen too often, and sometimes you go through numerous books without finding one of these, regardless of who the author is.  Well, let me just say that there is one of theses magical sentences in just about every single page of Love in the Times of Cholera.  The novel is like a bottle of excellent wine....each sip tastes better than the last one.  This book will leave you with a sensation od deep, pleasant intoxication.  How does it compare to One Hundred Years?  It's simply different.  Even though time is probably the main character in both novels, while there's more magic in One Hundred Years, there's more love and passion in Love in the Times of Cholera.    I am left with the exact same feeling after reading every one of Gabo's boks:  how the hell does he do it every time?  Don't miss out on the pleasure produced by this novel.
