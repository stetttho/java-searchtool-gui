 This book is a pretty organized and concise biography of Napoleon.  Regarding form, it is written sort of as an outline, so it carries at least one subtitle per page, which at first as a bit annoying, but I got used to it.  Another important characteristic is that the book is packed with quotes and most of them are very adequate for what is being discussed at that moment.  A lot of research went into the bio.  Juan van den Eynde, quite a few times during his narration, takes sides against Napoleon, passing judgement too often.  It is my opinion that a good biographer lays out fact and opinion, so that it is the reader who eventually passes judgement on the subject, and forms his own opinion.  There are passages where you feel Eynde really hates Napoleon's guts.  In summary, the book is good and worth the time it takes to go through the 188 pages, but as a an introduction to Napoleon and his times.  Naturaly, the author does not provide detail about any of the important account in Napoleons life....
