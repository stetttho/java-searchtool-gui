 Sylvester Bonnard personifies good and innocence, to the point that even as an elderly scholar he is most of the time perceived as a little boy.  It is not a simple task to develop a character in such depth, in less than 200 pages.  The book is very well written.  With characters like Bonnard, it is not too complicated to understand why Anatole France was the 1921 Nobel laureate.
