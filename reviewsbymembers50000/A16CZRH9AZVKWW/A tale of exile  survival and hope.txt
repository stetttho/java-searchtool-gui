 Laura Restrepo's LA ISLA DE LA PASION is very hard to put down, as it is an excellent novel.  In the early 1900's, a Mexican soldier by the name of Ramon Arnaud is stationed at a tiny island in the Pacific, south of Acapulco.  He moves there with his wife and a few other people.  For all practical purposes, these people are stranded there, while life in Mexico goes on.   The Porfirio Daz dictatorship falls, a civil war breaks, and the country is torn apart by revolution.  LA ISLA DE LA PASION is a story of exile, with all its connotations, including the dream of returning.  Sickness, insanity and the force of nature play major roles in the novel.  Restrepo also exposes the reader to feelings such as true friendship, love, and loyalty.  Restrepo narrates the story almost 70 years after it actually happened, basically by contacting descendants of those involved.  From the perspective of form, the novel is very well written and easy to read, even as Restrepo jumps from past to present and also from city to city.  The plot is very interesting and the reader will always find himself wondering what will happen next and reading just a bit further before putting the book down.  The characters in the story are extremely well developed and you will end up understanding them, their feelings, dreams, scale of values, and fears.    Apart from being basically a tragic character, Ramon Arnaud borders with being a caricaturesque and comical typical Mexican.  Even though in esence this is a sad story, there is also always a shadow of hope of returning home.  Restrepo also throws in a few elements of magical realism, which adds to the delight of reading this book.   The only flaws I found were a series of typical Colombian expressions (Restrepo is Colombian), which Mexicans do not use or even understand, being said by the characters.  Overall, LA ISLA DE LA PASION is an excellent novel, even though in my opinion it does not reach the heights of Restrepo's DELIRIO.
