 This book is just a few pages long which makes one suspicious about the quality that Fuentes can achieve in so brief a space.  This is one of his first writngs and I also consider it one of his best novels. Together with Rulfo's Pedro Paramo, Azuela's Los de Abajo, and Allende's Como Agua Para Chocolate, one of the finest pieces of Mexican literature.
