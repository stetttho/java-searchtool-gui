 I saw a couple of reviews on this book, in a newspaper in Mexico City, and decided to pick up a copy because both reviews were very positive.  Besides, I recently became a father so this could be helpful.  In general, the book is enjoyable to read but it has one shortcoming in my opinion.  As a father of a one year old boy, I thoroughly enjoyed the pertinent chapters and could relate to what I read.  The other chapters (puberty, teens, leaving home.....) were not very interesting, for me at least.  I now think that if you want to read about being a father, you should look for a book dedicated to fathers with kids the age of yours.  In other words, the book is way too ambitious.  It has to be very difficult to describe what it is to be a father, of children of absolutely any age, and have people relate to the reading.  The book makes a few good points about kids the same age as mine and I enjoyed it, but it tries to summarize too much in just a few pages.  Still, an OK book.
