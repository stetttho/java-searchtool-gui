 Kirk does a very good job of documenting the last 50 years of Colombian history, unfortunately tainted by drugs, violence, and a generalized lack of respect for human life.  Since Colombia is "el pais del olvido", reading this can be very disturbing.   It feels strange to read the past few years' newscasts thrown together into a single volume.  It makes you realize what a horrible situation Colombia and colombians have gone through.  She sometimes goes into too much gruesome detail on masacres and killings, but the overall picture is clear.    It's a good thing that she lets you know right away that she supports leftist ideas.  Had she not done this since the beginning, her being so biased might become boring in the middle of the book.  She sometimes loses track of a story and jumps right into another one, only to leave it and jump back, which is sometimes difficult to cope with, but overall he book is prety good.  I guess if you're not colombian, as I am, and are interested in Colombia, this book provides an accurate description of he past 50 years of our "macondian" country.  However,if you want to learn about Colombia, Garcia Marquez is much more fun......  The only point she totally misses, is mentioning the age of the combatants......15 in average!
