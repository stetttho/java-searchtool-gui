 I expected this book to be a tad boring, and just another account of a concentration camp prisoner.  Boy, was I in for a treat! First of all, the main character is a 15 year old boy.  That in itself is shocking.  Imagine looking at life in a concentration camp from a young boy's perspective. Just picture this:  the day the boy is being released, his major concern is if hes going to get his bowl of soup or not. Ive read Dostoevski's Memoirs from the House of the Dead, and also Solzhenitsyn's A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, but this one is quite different and worth the time. Do not miss it.
