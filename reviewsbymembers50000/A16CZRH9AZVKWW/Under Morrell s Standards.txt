 LONG LOST is definitely a page turner.  I read it in two days.  However, as with Morrell's THE PROTECTOR, I was expecting more.  I've read most of what he has written, and his most recent books cannot be compared to his earlier ones.  LONG LOST is different from most of all his other novels, in the sense that the main character is not a bodyguard, spy or other type of super human caracter.  Brad Denning is a typical wealthy american, who is dedicated to his work and his family. He is, however  seriously affected by the fact that his kid brother was kidnapped 25 years before.  He feels responsible and has carried guilt with him practically all his life.  The plot is well laid out, and Brad Denning is a credible character.  The book is very easy to read and chapter after chapter you will simply want to go on, and find out what happens next.  The ending, which again never happened with most of his prior works, is rather predictable.   If this book is compared to others of the same genre, it will definitely come out on top, but Morrell has set very high standards with his prior novels, and fans will be left with a bit of a sense of emptiness.    Overall, the book is pretty good, and it's worth the time it takes to go through the 300+ pages.  I am starting to think that the muses of inspiration have abandoned Morrell, but since he still has to make a living, he continues to write.    Being not only an avid reader, but also a music addict, I must say if I compare books to music, I had a similar feeling with U2, right after they released RATTLE AND HUM.  In my opinion, they put out quite a few weak albums, which people continued to buy simple because it was U2.    Morrell has written so many good books, that I am willing to give him alast chance.  If his next book does not rise to my expectations, that's it for me and him.
