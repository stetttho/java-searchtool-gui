 Alain Lausard is the main character of Howard's novel, which deals with Napoleon Bonaparte's Egyptian campaign.  The novel covers about 2 years, since Napoleon left France (Toulon) and sailed for Malta and Egypt, until the invaders had been basically stranded for more than a year in Egypt.  The novel does not in any way concenrate on Napoleon himself, but on a group of soldiers, all of which were recruited after being incarcerated in Paris.  It depicts the hardships these soldiers went through as they crossed the Mediterranean, made a stop in Malta, and continued for Egypt, where they were not received as Napoleon expected, as liberators, but as invaders.  The book contains pretty gruesome descriptions af battles, massacres, rapes, all of which became common for the expeditioners.  The french army's main enemies were not the Bedouins or the Mamluks, as expected.  Hunger, desperation, mutiny, thirst and the plague were the real enemy.  It is written in a simple language, and is easy to read.  It's worth the time it takes to go through the 260+ pages.
