 Many people have written about dictatorships in latinamerica.  Suffice it to say that this is one of the better ones.  I love Garcia Marquez, but I think this book is better than his Autumn of the Patriarch. Naturally, if you have the chance to read the Spanish original version, much better.  However, the current translation is very good.
