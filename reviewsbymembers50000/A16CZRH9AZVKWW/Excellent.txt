 Surprisingly, this happens to be one of the best books I have ever read.  I say surprisingly, because most of the biographies I have read become tedious, slow, and boring at times.  Definitely not this one. I devoured the 650 pages in a couple of days.  It is superbly written, in the form of a novel, which makes it extremely easy and enjoyable to read.  I was amazed by the multitude of sources consulted and cited by Castelot, in order to make the biography as complete as possible.    It covers Napoleon Bonaparte's entire life, and chapter by chapter the reader's interest is not only captured but maintained.  It's the type of reading that just makes you want to find further readings on the subject.  It draws a clear picture of Napoleon the soldier, the statesman, the lover, but above all, the man.  You walk away with a feeling of completeness, which seldom happens when you read biographical novels, which usually concentrate on very few aspects of the character being presented.   The only criticism:  Too many times, when writing about a specific place, Castelot mentions the house/room/other place still exists, which in my opinion is irrelevant, this book being in the form of a novel.    If you get your hands on it, don't let go of it.  It's really worth it....
