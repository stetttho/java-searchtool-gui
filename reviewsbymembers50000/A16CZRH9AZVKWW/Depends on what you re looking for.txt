 If you're looking for a historical novel based on historically acurate and correct facts, this is not it. If you're looking for character depth and want to stay away from stereotypes, stay away from this book. However, if you're looking for a book that's fun to read, with a most creative and ambitious plot, you've found it. From this perspective, I must add it's too much like the Code but nontheless entertaining.
