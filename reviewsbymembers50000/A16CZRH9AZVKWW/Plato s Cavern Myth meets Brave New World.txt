 Saramago at his best! As most of what I have read from Saramago, this book is superbly written.  One would never imagine that a novel written in a sort of "stream of consciousness" form, would be plesant and absorbing.  The plot and characters are absolutely universal.  The story could have taken place anywhere in the world, in the not so distant future, where man is living the desolate life he created for himself.   Freedon is restricted, dreams are non-existent, and everything is colored in different shades of gray.  Even though at first this may seem like a very sad book, it does have its silver lining:  we still have a chance to make the world whatever we want it to be.  Finally, a comment about the main character, Cipriano Algor:  Suffice it to say he generates a very strong passion....
