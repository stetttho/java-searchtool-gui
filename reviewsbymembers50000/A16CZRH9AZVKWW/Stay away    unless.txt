 I have never seen a book that loses so much with its translation.  It's pathetic.  You MUST stay away from this book, specially if you have the chance to read the Spanish version.  Just an example of pathetic:  The value given to treasure found by the Spanish in Mexico in early 1500s, is in US Dollars !!!!!!!!! Life is way too short.  Stay away !!!!!!
