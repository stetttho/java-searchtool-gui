 This review corresponds to the spanish translation of Jelinek's book, titled:  Los Excluidos (ISBN 958-639-228-7).  The book is about four teenagers, living in post WWII Viena.  It is extremely well written and also extremely graphic and crude.  I finished it a few minutes ago, and my teeth are still clenched.  The four main characters, although all quite different, struggle to find their own identities, and resort to hatred, sex, violence, music and whatever goes against the establishment, with cruelty and a total lack of respect for everything ouside their own individual scale of values.  Although each of the characters is unique, they share the fact that they lead an absolutely meaningless exitence, and this pulls them together into a sort of a gang.    The depth of each of Jelinek's characters is absolutely amazing.  She is well able to transmit what each person not only represents, but also feels. You will feel the rage of these people, very deep in your soul.  This book really touches you.... deep inside.  It is no surprise Jelinek is now a Nobel laureate.
