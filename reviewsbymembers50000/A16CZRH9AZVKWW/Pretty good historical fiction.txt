 If what you're looking for is a profound, meaningfull novel, with extreme depth in the characters, this is not for you.  Manfredi is not (and does not try to be) Joyce, or Dickens, or Garca Mrquez.  As simply a piece of historical fiction, as is also Alexander (trilogy by Manfredi), I think this is a pretty good read.  The story is mainly narrated by a druid, who, years after the action took place, wants to leave testimony of how things happened. It is the year 476 AD and a handfull of legionaries, belonging to the last existing roman legion, accompanied by a couple of quite picturesque characters, embark in a very intense adventure.  They continuously find themselves in life threatening situations, which they sort out in diverse and imaginative ways.  This is a story full of of adventure, fraternity, honor, loyalty, love, and even magic, which is difficult to put down.  I consider it to be just fun, relaxing reading.  At the end, you are left with a warm, satisfying feeling.   You will not however, be left pondering the meaning of your own existence....  What makes this novel unique is in my opinion, the amount of research that went into it.  It ties up nicely to historical and common mythical events, which makes it worth your time.  I guess it is to the reader's advantage that Manfredi is not only an archeologist, but a highly regarded and reknown history professor.   As with other Manfredi books, the plot is interesting, and the book is very well written, even though one is to assume something is probably lost in the translation from Italian.
