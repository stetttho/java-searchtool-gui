 The first thing that called my atention about this book was its title....it seems different.  When I read that the rights have been sold to translate the book into 35 languages, I decided to give it a try.  The book, narated by a 15 year old autistic child, is unlike any other book I have ever read. The shock of being exposed to a different type of thought process and thus narrative, is absolutely overwhelming.  There are a lot of things you learn from Christopher Boone, and I went through the 250+ pages in very few hours.  If I were to describe the book in one word, it would have to be "crude".  It is really mindboggling to be exposed to autism, and to the extremely starightforward and single purposed mind of Christopher.  The book is truly one of a kind.  At times it made me angry, anxious, desperate, impatient.... A book that can transmit one of these emotions had fulfiled its purpose.  A book that generates such a turmoil of emotions and feelings is definitely worth reading.
