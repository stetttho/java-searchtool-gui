 I bought this book because of a couple of reviews I read, and in both, Delirio is compared to One Hundred Years of Solitude. To be quite frank, the first half of the book did not fulfill my expectations.  I have to admit I only read a few pages a day and did not allow for cohesiveness and continuity.   I decided to give the second half of the book a more fair chance and dug into it.  I was in for a very pleasant experience. Regardless of the fact that the book is in many passages written in a "stream of consciousness" manner, the characters have life and depth.  It is amazing the way the different stories are tightly woven together. I think a great book is one that not only conveys clear images, but also emotions.  You cannot help but feel a deep impact by the emotional situations and stress of the characters in this novel. You will find yourself devouring this book to see how the whole plot plays out and how all the character's stories tie together at the end. As another reviewer said.  It is a pleasure to know I read the first edition of a book that will become one of the timeless latinamerican novels. I thought Restrepo's "La Multitud Errante" was a very good book, but she outdid herself with this one. Hey, who knows.  Maybe we're looking at the second Literature Nobel laureate from Colombia after Gabo!
