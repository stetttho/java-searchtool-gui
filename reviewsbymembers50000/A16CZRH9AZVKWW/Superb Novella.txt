 JACQUOT SANS OREILLES was written in 1860 by Dumas, right after a trip he made to Russia.  It is a horror novella, set in mid 18th century Russia.  At this time, the nobility practically owned the country, and they represented all economic and political power.  Throughout the book, the reader is exposed to russian culture, customs, and their very particular way of life.  As in most of what Dumas has written, the narration is absolutely beautiful, and the story simply flows and captures the reader.  The story starts with Dumas paying a visit to a town by the name of Makarief, where he is interested in visiting the Grubensky castle.  Once there, he finds a portrait of a young lady, who's face has been covered with black paint.  He decides to investigate and soon enough lays his hands of a manuscript written by Ivan Andreovitch, a peasant who worked for the Grubensky family.  Andreovitch narrates the series of incidents which lead to the curious painting, and crop-eared Jacquot is the main character, first hand witness to all that happened.  Even though this is a pretty short story by Dumas' standards, the reader gets a very clear picture of what life was like in 18th century Russia.  The plot is very well laid out and developed, and will keep the reader's full attention throughout the whole book.  There is not much character development, but then again, the book is less than 200 pages long.  Overall,  JACQUOT SANS OREILLES is a magnificent piece of gothic literature
