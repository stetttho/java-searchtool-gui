 Excellent read.  Very realistic characters involved in an extremely misterious, almost surreal plot. A tribute to books, literature and the power of both to change lives.  A love story.  An ode to youth and the immortality of the soul.  Passion in its purest form.   Definitely worth your time.   Without a doubt this book will be there for a long time.
