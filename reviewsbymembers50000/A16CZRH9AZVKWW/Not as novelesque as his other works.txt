 This is one of the lesser known of Dumas' works, and it is actually the first part of his Celebrated Crimes series. Most of Dumas' writtings are characterized by historically accurate plots together with deep, maybe a bit stereotypical characters.  This book is quite different.  The characters lay lifeless in the background of the historical document.  It is well written and very entertaining but definitely different from his other very well known novels, such as the Musketeer series, Montecristo, the Black Tulip, and so on. Quite honestly, in my opinion, his novels are much better than his non-fiction works such as this one. Regarding form, I was overwhelmed by how careless the editors of this edition are.  Theres quite a few typos PER PAGE!  Once you're able to overlook this detail, this is a fine read.
