 Navarro's attempt at a historical mistery tale simply fails.  At first, the plot seems interesting and well conceived.  However, as she starts jumping around historical periods, following the trace of the sheet with which the body of Christ was covered and on which the image of Christ miraculously appears, the plot goes astray.  Too many characters, and very few of them are fully developed.  She tries to cover too much in 500+ pages....Knights Templar, a couple of french kings, Constantinople....and so on.  The book does not involve you in any way.  Definitely not a page turner.....    Not to ruin the book's ending, suffice it to say that one of the greatest misteries in history is resolved in an extremely simplistic manner.  I originally bought the book because it is a great hit in libraries in Madrid, which is usually a decent indicator of how good a book is, but in this case, big dissapointment.
