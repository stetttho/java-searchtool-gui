 When you walk into a bookstore and go to the history section, and look for latinamerican history, you will find this book there.  It is absolutely outrageous that this book is sold as if it were titled "A History of Colombia". Kidnapping is a phenomena that has plagued Colombia for some time now, as it provides the economic means for the civil war in Colombia. However, kidnapping is not the axis our major point of our history. This very well written book is an account of a kidnapping from the inside.  Gabo actually spoke to the people this happened to, and penned it nicely.  This book is sad and reflects a reality which should only exist in nightmares. Worth it.
