 This is without a doubt one of the top 20th century novels, and as such, very much has been written about it. Some clasify it as an epic, while others try and find all the symbolism and deep meaning behind the story of Macondo and the Buenda family. Let me just say that more than a great novelist, Garca Marquez is a great observer.  As a colombian, I can honestly say that the events depicted in this well written novel are not as far away from our reality as might seem at first. Things like the ones descibed here do happen in small "conteo" (from the coast) towns throughout Latinamerica in general. I am sure that for quite some time Gabo had a laugh at the expense of all who searched for the real and inner meaning of Cien Aos de Soledad, and who wrote innumerable pages full of interpretations. This book is simply the story of a town as told by a grandmother to her grandson. You either love this book or you hate it, and if you hate it, it's because your world is too small and simple and you do not have the imagination it takes to understand this as an account of my "bananero" country's reality. Do not miss this book.
