 The first adjective that comes to mind when reviewing Saramago's "Ensayo Sobre la Ceguera", is captivating.  The book deals with a nameless city (which by the way could be absolutely any western hemisphere city)in which everybody becomes blind in a matter of a very few days.  The plot is extremely well conceived and it becomes very difficult to put this book down.  A very emotionally charged story, with strong and well defined characters, all of which remain nameless throughout the novel.  You will find yourself inmersed in the devastation, horror, and chaos..... transported to this city of the blind, sharing their troubles, fears, and feelings.  Saramago's narrative is superb.  Very few authors can get away with mixing description, comment and dialogue in a sigle sentence, aided only by the use of mostly commas.  This is really a superb book, which will be enjoyed by both Saramago advocates and also by people who have not read Saramago before.
