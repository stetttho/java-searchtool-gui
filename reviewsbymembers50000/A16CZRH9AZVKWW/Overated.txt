 I have read so many positive reviews about this book and about Higgins, that I probably set my expectations up too high.    Sure, the book is good, the characters have a strong presence, and the plot is well conceived, but in summary it didn't seem more than an OK book.  Definitely not the type of book you simply can't put down.
