 I have read absolutely everything that Morrell has put out, and without a doubt this is his worst book. However, if you pick up a copy and read it, not having read Morrell before, this is a pretty decent book. This is the only one of his books, where I've been able to predict what's going to happen next, a few times throughout the book.
