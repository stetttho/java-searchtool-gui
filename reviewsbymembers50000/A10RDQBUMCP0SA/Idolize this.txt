 Billy Idol rules. I have been a diehard fan for 21 years, since I was 13. I saw him 3 times in the '80s-'90s and have been back for more 3 times in the new millenium. Billy rocks as hard as ever and his music is as fresh and exciting today as it was when it was written. This DVD is a must-own for anyone with even a passing Idol fancy. The sound is superb, the band is tight and exhilarating, and Sir William is in fine form, rocking out in excellent voice and looking terrific. He is a fantastic storyteller with a great sense of humor. You feel, watching and listening to him spin his tales, that you've gone round the pub with him for a pint. He is thoughtful, intelligent, and really funny. Although every single song on this DVD is amazing and sounds wonderful in this setting, two deserving special mention are the Gen X classics "Kiss Me Deadly" and "The Untouchables". Billy introduces "Kiss Me Deadly" by explaining how the song came to be and his heartfelt delivery is truly touching. These two songs are so dear to him (and me) and witnessing his performance of them brought a tear to my eye.  It is a testament to the man and his music that every single song sounds so vibrant in this stripped down setting. And Steve Stevens is nothing short of brilliant. Don't wait - order this via "1-click" immediately! And Billy - we want more, more, more!
