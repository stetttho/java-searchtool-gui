 It's great to have Dee Dee back, even if it is just in book form. "Legend of a Rock Star" finds our hero back on the road and cranky as ever. Dee Dee doesn't even want to do this tour, but everyone's on his back so he consents, kicking and screaming every step of the way. The promoters are a pain in the neck, the hotels are creepy, the food [is bad], but the fans still love him and he loves them. No one tells a tale quite like him and you sympathize between giggles.  In the epilogue Dee Dee writes about The Ramones' induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the chaos that ensues trying to round up the band to attend. For all his moaning, it's obvious Dee Dee loved his bandmates and their legacy.  Thunder's Mouth Press did a nice job putting the book together, including lots of photos of Dee Dee, his own handwriting, and his artwork. I read this book with an underlying sense of sadness, as Dee Dee's voice was so vibrant and alive and he wrote about loving life and having so much that he still wanted to do. I hope he realized that he'd already accomplished so much and we all owe him a debt of gratitude. Love you, Dee Dee.
