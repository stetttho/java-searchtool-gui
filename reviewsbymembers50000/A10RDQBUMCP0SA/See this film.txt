 I bought this movie without knowing too much about it because of Dee Dee Ramone and Richard Hell. I enjoyed the movie immensely. In a nutshell, a young woman winds up homeless after the aunt she lives with dies and her creepy landlord expects her to pay the rent in sexual favors. Indignant, she winds up homeless, where she hooks up with a lovable yet dimwitted partner in crime. Together they help each other survive and fall in love along the way. They meet Dee Dee Ramone, a spaced-out Vietnam vet, Richard Hell, a Good Samaritan, and Nick Zedd, a hilariously angry young man who takes our heroine in for a bit and winds up stealing the movie.  I won't spoil the ending but it's well worth seeing.
