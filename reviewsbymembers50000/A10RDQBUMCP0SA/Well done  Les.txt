 What an entertaining read! Les McKeown has been through a lot and shares it all in this book, which is at once hilarious, tragic, and eye-opening. He gives the inside scoop on his life as the frontman of the hysteria-inducing Bay City Rollers and beyond. Les shares the whole story with us - from his upbringing in Edinburgh, to his first forays into music, to teen idolatry in the Rollers, to the aftermath. His sense of humor remains intact and his take on life and his experiences is refreshing. He pulls no punches and seems like a pretty cool guy. Thanks for telling your story, Les!
