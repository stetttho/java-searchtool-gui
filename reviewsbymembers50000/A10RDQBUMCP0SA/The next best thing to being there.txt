 I first read this book a few years ago, on the recommendation of a friend. Since then I've re-read it a few times and always learn something new. It's a great book, pure and simple. It contains a wealth of information not just on the bands that were pivotal to the scene, but also lots of amusing anecdotes and gossip. The format is particularly effective. The reader actually feels like they are sitting around with all of these characters, getting the inside scoop. A must-read for anyone interested in the origins of punk.
