 HIM are the best band I've heard in a long time, thanks to my pal Fiona. I received "Razorblade Romance" as a gift and had to pick this one up to hear the rest of their history. It's the perfect introduction to the band. They have everything - amazing lyrics, rock on tunes, they are just so exciting. Since then I have purchased the rest of their albums and they're all I've been listening to. I was fortunate to see them live in SF May 2 (the show sold out in six minutes) and they did not disappoint. They have such an energy and power and were just amazing. Buy this CD - you won't be disappointed. Tell everyone you know about HIM. And the DVD, while in European format, does play on your computer so enjoy!
