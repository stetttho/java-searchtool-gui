 I found "Dogrun" hilarious. Once I started it, I couldn't put it down. Our heroine, Mary Bellanova, arrives home from work, yells at and serves dinner to her boyfriend Primo's corpse before she realizes what has happened. Can things possibly get worse or more absurd? If you've read Arthur Nersesian before, you know they absolutely can. Mary realizes she didn't know Primo as well as she thought so becomes determined to learn more about him. Hilarity ensues as she meets a more than a little bizarre cast of characters, ends up joining a band with two of Primo's exes, and secures a loathsome job at Kinko's with a man she detests. Arthur Nersesian's writing is witty, sharp, and wonderful. You are immediately sucked into his characters' lives and problems and find yourself not only going along with, but agreeing with their slapstick antics and questionable decisions. I can't wait till his next book comes out.
