 I pre-ordered "Chelsea Horror Hotel" and read the entire book the day it arrived. Dee Dee's first novel is highly entertaining. Funny, bizarre, icky, and creepy, it centers around Dee Dee's life at his apartment in the Chelsea Hotel. He thinks he is living in the room where Nancy Spungen died and things just get worse from there. He is in hell, dealing with his meanie wife Barbara, his nagging talking dog Banfield, and the other creepy residents of the hotel. Dee Dee tries to keep to himself but everyone is so annoying he tangles with them, hoping to save his sanity. That only exacerbates his problems. To top it all off, he is soon hounded by the pain in the butt ghosts of Johnny Thunders, Jerry Nolan, and Sid Vicious. Dee Dee writes in his inimitable deadpan style and his vivid imagination and graphic details make the story really come alive. He's always been a gifted storyteller. Right on, Dee Dee!
