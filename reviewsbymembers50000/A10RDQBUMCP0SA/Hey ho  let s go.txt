 What a fascinating read! Monte Melnick, the indefatigable road warrior who was at once dad, babysitter, peacekeeper, chauffeur, and tour manager extraordinaire for the entire ride, lets us into his memory bank and shares the mindblowing experience with us. The story is told by Monte and all those who were there, and reads like "Please Kill Me", with several voices sharing anecdotes. The Ramones' story is unique, harrowing, thrilling, heartbreaking, and ultimately triumphant. This book shows us the long, hard road they traveled and how tough it really was for so long. They set the standard that everyone else is still trying to measure up to, more than a quarter century on. They were the first and will always be the best. This book shows us the whys and hows of their genius. Thanks, Monte!
