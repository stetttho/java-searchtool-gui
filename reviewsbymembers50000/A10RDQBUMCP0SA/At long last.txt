 Nuclear Valdez should be huge. Their first two albums, 1989's "I Am I" and 1991's "Dream Another Dream", with their beautiful, stirring lyrics and unforgettable melodies, endeared them to a devoted following but never brought them the commercial success of which they're so deserving. So be it. We love them anyway. Flash forward to 2002 and the release of "In A Minute All Could Change". It's a perfect album. The band have lost none of their talent for gorgeous lyrics and can't-get-it-out-of-your-head music. Songs such as "Wonderland", "Still Won't Let You Go", and "Only Yesterday" perfectly showcase singer Fro Sosa's searing, beautifully expressive voice. The music is reflective of a myriad influences, from classic rock 'n roll to Latin rhythms. I've been unable to stop listening to my copy. This is a band which does not disappoint and just keeps growing stronger. Bonus: four versiones en espanol of songs. Gracias Juan, Fro, y Robert, por haber regresado cuando mas los necesitamos.
