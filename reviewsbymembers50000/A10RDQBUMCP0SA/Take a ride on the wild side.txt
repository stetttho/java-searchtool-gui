 A fascinating read...the band and various other players take us on a whirlwind tour of their lives and career as one of the most notorious bands in history. Written in diary style, each chapter features a different voice. No one is spared, least of all themselves. I couldn't put this book down. Dysfunctional families, illness, violence, sex, drugs, rock 'n roll, death... it's all here. Guaranteed to keep you reading well into the night, even if you're not a Motley Crue fan.
