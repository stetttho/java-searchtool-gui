 I adore John Cusack and have since "Sixteen Candles". I love his versatility and his choice of distinct characters. My rule of thumb is if John Cusack is in the movie, it's guaranteed I will love it. It hasn't failed me yet. However, as with loads of women who grew up in the '80s, I have a real soft spot for Lloyd Dobler, his inimitable "Say Anything" alter ego. Who didn't fall in love with this guy? So imagine my surprise when, already eager for this romantic comedy, I tuned in and got reaquainted with my old crush. Cusack's Jake, to me, is Lloyd 16 years on. Adorable, witty, goofy, insecure...in short, he was fantastic. Diane Lane shines as the ambivalent divorcee thrust into the online dating pool. Elizabeth Perkins, so perfect as the bitchy friend from "About Last Night..." is endearing as the meddling older sister. Stockard Channing is hilarious as a three-time divorcee pining for Diane's dad, played by Christopher Plummer. And Dermot Mulroney is terrific as the cad. This is an enjoyable, heartwarming film all around, but the real prize is seeing John Cusack bring Jake to life as a man not unfamiliar to us, but as lovable and charming as ever. No one can do teen angst like he did, and he's a master at the adult version, as well. Watch for the scene at the Armenian restaurant when he gazes across the table at Diane Lane with that piercing, lovestruck gaze. SWOON!
