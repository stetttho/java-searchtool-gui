 How can you not get into this movie? It is so silly and tongue-in-cheek! Three time travelers (one of whom is David Cassidy) from 2176 aim to go back in time to 1776, "the birth of our nation", to retrieve the recorded history that was lost in the magnetic storm. Those big sillies! They wind up in 1976 instead and run smack into our beloved McDonald brothers (who helm Redd Kross, one of the greatest bands ever). Hilarity ensues as the time travelers attempt to learn about the history of our country while shopping for leisure suits, driving Pacers and learning to do the Hustle. There's something for everyone: a groovy soundtrack, a love story, car chases, Leif Garrett, fabulous fashions, a science fair, even the Meathead! Liam O'Brien as Rodney Snodgrass just steals the show! Sit back, relax, enjoy, and just "BE"! See this film so you won't be stuck thinking, "Watashiwa manuki!"
