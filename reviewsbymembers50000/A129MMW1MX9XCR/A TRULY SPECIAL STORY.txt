 I just finished reading this gem for the second time and I am in awe of how Rice can pack so much into such a little story.  The voice of the young narrator, Ashmol, reminds us to look at what is important in life, not just what is right in front of us.  I highly recommend this to readers in high school and avove--this book would make a great gift.
