 Being a long time fan of Barbara Kingsolver, I have been  eagerly awaiting the release of "The Poisonwood Bible".  Advance publicity made me aware it was not set in the southwestern United States like her other  novels and I wondered if her wonderful style and use of language would  translate as well in a new setting. My concerns were unfounded.   Kingsolver writes about what she knows, and as she tells us in the author's  notes, she spent time in the Congo as a child with her health care worker  parents. "The Poisonwood Bible" is Kingsolver at her best.  Her  use of the five female characters as the alternating voices of the novel  works beautifully.  The reader experiences the events of the story through  many different perspectives, the sum of which is a insightful look at life  in a country that is effected by a harsh climate and extreme poverty  complicated by interference from foreign governments.  I highly recommend  this book to anyone who enjoys a good story accompanied by information that  is thought provoking.  It will make you appreciate the advantages we take  for granted in the United States.
