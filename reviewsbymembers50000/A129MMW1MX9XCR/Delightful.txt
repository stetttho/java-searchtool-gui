 I am so glad to have "discovered" Pure Dead Magic and it's sequel, Pure Dead Wicked by Deb Gliori.  I have been recommending them to everyone who will listen! A delightful combination of the elements of the Harry Potter books, the Lemony Snicket books and the Artemis Fowl books. Great for both children and adults who love a good fantasy story that is a bit on the irreverent side.
