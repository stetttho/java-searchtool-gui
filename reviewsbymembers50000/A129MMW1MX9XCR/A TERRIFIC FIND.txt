 A friend told me about this book and I will always be grateful--what a find!  I listened to the audio version and ran the gamut of emotional reactions during the course of this heartbreaking and hilarious novel.  I never knew the English language could be butchered in so many creative ways!  the dual narrative, one going forward in time, one going backward, was a bit confusing at times, but ultimately, it worked.  I look forward to m ore of Foer's work.
