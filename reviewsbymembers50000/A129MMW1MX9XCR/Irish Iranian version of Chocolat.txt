 For the first half of the book, I couldn't get past the startling similarities to Chocolat by Joanne Harris.  It was almost as if Mehran was trying to write the same novel with an Iranian/Irish twist.  By the end, I was able to appreciate the novel for itself, but I found it remarkably unoriginal.  The addition of recipes, although not a new idea, was welcome, and I have even tried some of them out (v. v. good). I think it was an entertaining read, a fair attempt to portray some of the issues faced by women in Iran.  The Irish portion seemed less than authentic.
