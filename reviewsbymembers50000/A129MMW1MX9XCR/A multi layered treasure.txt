 I very much enjoyed reading "The Sabbathday River" by this author a few years back, so I grabbed this book when I saw it in the store.  "The White Rose" is very different from her last novel, but just as good if not better.  This is a multilayered story that keeps the reader digging for more--just when you think you have it figured out, the plot takes a different direction.  The characters are well-drawn and believable--some likeable, some not. The descriptions of New York City society are good and the historical details a nice addition. I'll be thinking about this book for awhile.
