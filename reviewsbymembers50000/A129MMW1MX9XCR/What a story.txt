 This is such a timely topic--a troubled adolescent who committs a school shooting--that you think the story would be predictable, but it is anything but.  Shriver gives us the parents side of events in the form of letters from a wife to her husband.  The reader is given all of the facts early in the story--yet the book has unexpected and mesmerizing plot turns.  Really makes you think about the relationship between parents and their children, and our ability to delude ourselves.  Great read!
