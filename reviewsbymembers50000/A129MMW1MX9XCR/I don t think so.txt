 I bought this book hoping to get some ideas for helping my 4 year old son to sleep a bit more independently. Once I started reading it, I was torn between laughing hysterically and wanting to have the author charged with child abuse. Crowder starts out with an excellent premise, that parents should be in control and not get caught up in power struggles with their children. However,the consequences for negative behavior that Crowder recommends are just too extreme. The two examples that stand out in my mind are: 1) sending a child to school with no lunch or lunch money if they are not cooperating with making their school lunch and 2) if a child doesn't put their backpack away when arriving home from school, hide it in the trunk of your car, sending the child to school the next day with no backpack and no completed homework. Yes, I am sure those measures would make the point. Aren't there some steps in between a parent could take that would be a hair less drastic? Steps that make the point without being cruel? Crowder makes no allowances for what to do if the child doesn't kow-tow to her consequences. What if the kid doesn't care if they went to school with no homework? What if the three year old who won't stay in bed doesn't fall asleep on the floor (as Crowder says he will) and instead wanders the house at night, and ingests poisonous materials? I dread the thought of a new parent picking this book up and actually trying to implement the ideas.
