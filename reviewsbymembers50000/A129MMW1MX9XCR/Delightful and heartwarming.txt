 Esme, a former London magazine editor and now stay-at-home mom, lives in the country with her husband, Pog, her son Rory, her very crabby father-in-law, Henry and the enigmatic Granny Mac, the grandmother who has been Esme's only family since her mother committed suicide when Esme was a teenager. They live in a very unusual house--a former water tower converted to a house in the style of a dovecote, five narrow floors topped by a larger living space.  79 stairs to climb from top to bottom!  At first glance their lives appear idyllic. Esme begins each day baking her own sourdough bread and the family thrives on it.  But in reality they are all dealing, in their own dysfunctional ways, with a tradedy that befell them two years earlier.  Lynch has done a superb job of bringing the reader into this family's story and while the ending is very satisfactory, you won't want to leave the characters.
