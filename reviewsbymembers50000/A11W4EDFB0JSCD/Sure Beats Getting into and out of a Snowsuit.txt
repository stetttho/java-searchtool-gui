 Living in the cold tundra of Western NY, this product has been wonderful (especially considering we have a December baby).  It is great to be able to go in and out of places and just unzip the cover instead of getting into and out of a snowsuit or jacket.  This way, little one doesn't roast in the grocery store or wherever.  My little one loves snuggling in it.  I wold suggest, however, that before purchasing it, you go to Babies R Us and try it out on your specific infant carrier to make sure it fits well.  That might prevent dissatisfaction like one of the other reviews.
