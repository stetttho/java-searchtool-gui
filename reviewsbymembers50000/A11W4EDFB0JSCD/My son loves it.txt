 Great swing.  Two things about it make me give it 4 stars instead of 5.  First, the music is annoying, but that is true of every baby item we have that makes noise, even Baby Einstein CDs.  Second, the way that the toys are hooked to the tray makes it so that they hit on the side of the swing when you raise the tray (and of course they make noise and can wake baby up....not good if you have just worked hard to get him to sleep!)
