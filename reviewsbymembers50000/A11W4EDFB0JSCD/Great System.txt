 Great all around system, hard to tip over, latches into car easily (and into shopping carts).  I have had trouble getting the bottom of the stroller to go up and down (it gets caught on the mechanism).  I wish that the infant carrier came with a warm cover (especially for the price) instead of having to buy one separately.  Very happy overall.
