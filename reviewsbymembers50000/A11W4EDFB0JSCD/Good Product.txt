 This product has given us much peace of mind.  Our son like to be swaddled and is quite squirmy.  This keeps him on his back and keeps the blanket in place.  It is also good to be able to prop him on his side if I am worried about him spitting up.  We have washed it several times and it still looks good and performs well.
