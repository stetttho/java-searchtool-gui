 My biggest problem with this book is that the characters are all shallow and stereotyped, and none of them are at all likeable. The supposed hero, Andrew Falcon, comes across as totally self-centered and selfish and amoral, just the kind of person anyone in their right mind would avoid having as a friend or lover. I'd prefer to read a book where I can identify with the hero.  Another problem is that the book is unrealistic in its description of how top businessmen interact. There are descriptions of meetings at the Federal Reserve Bank, where the Chairman acts like a petty dictator and treats the other committee members like school children. These supposedly high-level, experienced and intelligent bankers accept the chairman's treatment submissively! This is totally crazy. Nobody gets to rise to the top of the business world with the kind of personality problems being described here.  Finally there's a major plot problem at the end of the book. The "hero" and the bad guys both have incriminating evidence on each other, so the hero is prevented from sending the bad guys to prison. But then, after we're told that the bad guys have succeeded in toppling the President of the United States and bumping off one of the hero's girlfriends, then the hero does go to the authorities and gets the bad guys sent up. There's no explanation of why he couldn't have done that six months earlier and thus saved the President and his girlfriend. (Fortunately, he has a "reserve girlfriend" that he can spend his declining years with, so the loss of one girlfriend is no major problem.)  There are some positive things in the book, for example the interesting information about how investment banking and especially a leveraged buyout work. It's also interesting to read about how the stock exchange, and Wall Street in general, functions. But this doesn't make up for the problems I've described above.  Rennie Petersen
