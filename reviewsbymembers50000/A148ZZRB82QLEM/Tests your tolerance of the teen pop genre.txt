 I like some teen pop. So I'm not reviewing this with a bias. But Emma's voice is very unrefined - and the lyrics, which seem to appeal to young people a few years even below Emma's age, really grate on grownups. The arrangements are cheesy in a bad way, too. If you are very young, you might enjoy this - but most others should avoid.
