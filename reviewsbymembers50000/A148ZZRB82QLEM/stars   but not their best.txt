 I seem to love everything the Corrs do. This CD is a nice mixture of In Blue and Forgiven, Not Forgotten. "Angel" and "Long Night" rank among their best, and the slinky "Confidence For Quiet" is as addictive as In Blue hits. Andrea sounds lovely as always. I just thought the production was more monotonous than on any album they've done. They can do better!
