 I was a Bo fan and thought Carrie is just a decent talent, but Some Hearts is better than I thought it would be. This IS middle of the road pop/country, but the lyrics are not fluffy or pro-tooled, and the songs allow Carrie to show her interpretive skills. The arrangements also have a restrained feel, adding to the charm. The only clunker on here is "Inside Your Heaven." It has three great songs: "Wasted," "Some Hearts," and "Before He Cheats." If you don't like "Jesus Take The Wheel," most of the songs are better than that one IMO. So give the album a try.
