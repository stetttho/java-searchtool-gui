 Thankful was decent, if often uninspiring - but on Breakaway, Kelly truly does break away from the American Idol stigma. Her voice is more controlled, and the ballads, especially "Because of You," are very affecting. She shows she can rock out, too. It's an album that could get you through tough times romantically, and you can't say that about many pop albums nowadays. Celine Dion, Christina Aguilera, and Mariah Carey should be given a lesson from this album.
