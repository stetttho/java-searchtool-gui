 Even though Morningwood's self-titled CD will likely not end up on my Best Albums of 2006 list, it's a CD that I will definitely keep playing. Because these songs are well constructed and because of Chantal's very charismatic vocals and lyrics, there's no reason to feel guilty while listening. Those who want the energy hardly ever ebbing will be happy.
