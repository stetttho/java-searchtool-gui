 Her countriest-sounding album since her debut, Jasper County ranks up there with the greatest Trisha Yearwood albums. The album is the perfect mix of heartache, introspection, and just plain fun. But it is not some jarring departure: the best of the more adult contemporary Trisha shows up in "Standing Out In A Crowd." Those craving Trisha ballads in general will not be disappointed. Highly recommended.
