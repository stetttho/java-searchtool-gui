 Hilary Duff's self-titled CD has slightly more mature (though not very enlightening) lyrics than on Metamorphosis, but she still does not sound convincing as a rocker. Some of the slower songs like the Avril-esque on the chorus "Who's That Girl," "Fly," "Hideaway," "The Getaway," "Someone's Watching Over Me," and "Jericho" are palatable. But Lindsay Lohan is the way to go for pure pop-rock.
