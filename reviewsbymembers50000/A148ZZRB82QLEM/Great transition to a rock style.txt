 Unlike the one reviewer of Marion's new album, Here I Am, I don't hear forced anything. She keeps her melodic abilities while creating a rockier style. "Little By Little" is quite the creative folk-pop song, and "Heads Will Roll" is creative hard rock. On "Let Me Introduce Yourself," you hear some of the M2M style. All the rest is great meat and potatoes rock. For example, "End Of The Day" is a pretty duet with the lead singer of Everclear. Marion isn't necessarily better than ever (except for her vocals,) but the change suits her.
