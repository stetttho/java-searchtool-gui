 I'm a PJ fan who thinks that Binaural and especially Riot Act are good albums - Riot Act mostly succeeds in the curve balls it throws - but I think this CD is as good as Ten, Yield, and Vitalogy. While Ten had more memorable individual songs, the self-titled album is very memorable as a whole. You'll come away thinking, yeah - that rocked! The ballads, which are in the classic rock vein, don't interrupt the momentum. If you're concerned that Pearl Jam is just a poor carbon copy of their past selves, it is a return to basics - but there's somewhat of a '00s touch. I'd rather they didn't go with some of the modern rock sounds of today that I find boring. And I don't think most fans want a lot of experimentation. This is another strong best of 2006 candidate.
