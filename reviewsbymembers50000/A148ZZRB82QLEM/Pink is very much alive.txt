 In my opinion, Pink keeps getting better with each CD. "Stupid Girls" is not indicitive of the whole CD at all. The song has fine lyrics, but a shopworn style. My favorite songs are "Dear Mr. President," "Leave Me Alone (I'm Lonely)", "Who Knew," and "The One That Got Away." If you love power pop, "Leave Me Alone (I'm Lonely)" is a real treat. "Who Knew" is driving rock that has a folky touch. Pink does pure folk/pop on "Dear Mr. President." The rest of the faster songs are an R&B, rock, and dance combo. Understated ballads end the album, and they are Pink's most soulful songs yet. There really were no songs I didn't like! One of the best CDs of 2006 so far.
