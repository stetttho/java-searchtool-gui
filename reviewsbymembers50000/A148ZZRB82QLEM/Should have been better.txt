 I have two other Goo Goo Dolls CDs - Dizzy Up The Girl and Gutterflower - and I don't think Let Love In measures up to those. It is pleasant soft rock, and if you have enjoyed their music like I have, I'd take a listen and decide for yourself whether or not to buy. I think the best songs are "Stay With You," "Better Days," "Give A Little Bit," and "Can't Let It Go." Three of those are somewhat upbeat. "Listen" is one of Robbie's strongest and is also good. But to me, nothing matches the punch of a song like "January Friend" from Dizzy Up The Girl or the creativity of "Truth Is A Whisper" from Gutterflower. They're better off with their signature power pop - here they seem to fit in too much.
