 Liz took poppy elements from the self-titled CD and expertly added to them all the styles of music she enjoys. People shouldn't expect Liz to be doing the same type of music she did when she did Exile In Guyville. Somebody's Miracle is the type of CD I can see her making at this stage. For those who say her voice isn't suited for this stuff, it does have a way of surging on choruses. Plus, she differentiates herself vocally from the crowd. I don't care what other reviewers say - I loved this CD.
