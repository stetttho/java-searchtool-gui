 After the disappointing (to me at least - it's an acquired taste) 0304, Jewel has come back with a very good album that sounds more like her.  Jewel is not exactly the same Jewel she was on Pieces Of You, though - it is an edgier effort. While she sounds forced on "Satellite," "Only One Too" and "Words Get In The Way" are excellent rockers. I think the additional production on the album makes Jewel sound less precious. "Stephenville, TX" goes beyond her coffeehouse folk - it's definitely a favorite. As for the album's lyrics, if you've liked Jewel's lyrics before, you should like these. She tackled politics a little on "America" from 0304, and while I liked that song, I think world affairs are best tackled by artists like Pearl Jam and Pink. Overall, GBAIW continues the maturity shown on This Way.
