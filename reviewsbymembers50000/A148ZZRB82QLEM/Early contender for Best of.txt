 When listening to Cat Power's The Greatest, you don't feel like this is an overt effort to re-create the Memphis soul sound. It feels as real and as natural as when Dusty Springfield did it. Her voice sounds better than ever in my opinion, and she expands lyrically. You Are Free was also great, but it's nice to hear her do a different kind of album. It might even inspire new creativity for her next album.
