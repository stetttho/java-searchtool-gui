 Comparisons to Avril will be made, and there is some Avril in Skye's style. We shouldn't lose sight of the fact that this isn't a big, manufactured production, though. The garage-y playing is enjoyable. And her vocals match the energy of the songs. Some lyrics are immature, like on the otherwise appealingly catchy "Billy S." An anti-school song is fine, but it sounds like how a younger girl would put it. But other songs like "Fallen Through" are very well written. I'm anxious to hear what Skye comes up with next.
