 Ashlee Simpson's CD Autobiography is somewhat of a bubblegum grunge style, which makes her sound a little different from her peers - but the style doesn't work very well. There are only three songs that stand out - "Pieces Of Me," "Love Makes The World Go Round," and "Nothing New." And "Love Makes The World Go Round" has a melody that's a lot like Jimmy Eat World's "The Middle." The song "Surrender" sounds like Hole for youngsters who aren't ready for Hole's music. "La La" has a good beat, but sounds forced lyrically. And "Shadow" doesn't really make me emotional. Ashlee's father had a role in making Ashlee famous. At least Ashlee's CD isn't as boring as Jessica's CDs, though. And her vocals are versatile and go against the girly vocals trend. I bought this CD based on "Pieces Of Me," and while I now know I could have gotten something better, there are songs that might make me listen again.
