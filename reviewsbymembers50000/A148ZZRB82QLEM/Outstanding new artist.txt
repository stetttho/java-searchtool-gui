 On Wreck Of The Day, Anna Nalick sounds like she has the potential to be thought of as a classic artist. The melodies are often dreamy, and her strong voice and more upbeat songs prevent things from getting too sleepy. There is a bit more polish in the arrangements than needed sometimes, but I have an ear for pop/rock, so it didn't bother me. Compare her production to much of the pop out today, and you'll notice a difference. There are still soft hits of the drums and acoustic guitar. The lyrics present detailed portraits that come from a songwriter with a lot of vision. Wreck Of The Day is sure to be on my best of 2005 list!
