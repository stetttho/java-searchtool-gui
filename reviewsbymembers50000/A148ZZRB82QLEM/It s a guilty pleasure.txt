 I really wanted Speak to be like the Freaky Friday soundtrack, which had some rockers that really stood out from the pop/rock pack. But Speak is more like a combo of Avril, Britney, and Michelle Branch with as a previous reviewer said, some 80s sounds. At least the mix makes for powerful dynamics on the album that get you dancing and rocking at the same time. Lyrically, some songs seemed pieced together, but the lyrics are assertive in a different, celeb way which some might find vain but others like me will find  revealing. This album won't change the world, but give it a chance.
