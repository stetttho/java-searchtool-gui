 Brie Larson's Finally Out Of P.E., like other pop albums made by teens, has some lyrics that will primarily appeal to youngsters. But they are all well written, and some, like "Falling Into History," have universal appeal. The music shows that Brie has an artistic vision that can be enjoyed by youngsters and adults alike. I am glad I bought it!
