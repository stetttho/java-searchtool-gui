 This is a good album.  It's good to hear 'lip again.  But the forever-long wait for it is baffling.  I listen to the CD now... the best few songs on it were available years ago, and the very best one (What's Up Fatlip?) was a single five years ago.  What have they been doing?  Slapping together the one-too-many filler tracks that are all over the disc (you'll know them... they all run about a minute and a half and don't have any rapping on them)?  Eh.  I sound a bit harsh I guess.  It's a very enjoyable disc regardless, but after all this time I suppose I was expecting something closer to greatness.  It's definitely better than anything the Pharcyde has done since Labcabin... I can't even listen to those guys any more.
