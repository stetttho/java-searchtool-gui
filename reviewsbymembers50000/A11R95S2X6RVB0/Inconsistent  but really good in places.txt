 This is a multi-headed beast of an album.  The jumping off point is California skate punk like NOFX... but the singing is defiantly British, and a lot of the guitar parts are thrash metal-heavy.  It's a blend that  sounds horrible on paper, but often quite good on the album. The best  songs here are at the beginning and the end.  "Hello" is an odd  opener with crunching, bottom-heavy guitar and soaring harmonies.   "She Said" sets the band's formula-- mid-tempo punk with hummable  melodies and barely sensical lyrics.  "Polythene" is an early  highlight; the only songs as good are "The Smoking Song,"  "Roots Americana," and the lovely closer "Lucy."
