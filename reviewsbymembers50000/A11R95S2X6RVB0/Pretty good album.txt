 This album would seem like pure genius if A. I didn't own their first one, "Growing Up," which is better; and B. they trimmed about four songs off of it.   "Making the Road" finds the band playing  with genuine hardcore ("Making the Road Blues" and "Just  Rock"), instrumentals ("Tinkerbell..."), and of course  sustaining their melodic Fat Wreck punk style as well.  The songs are  generally a little darker than on previous albums, and a few are among the  band's best.  About the only problems are the lags in quality.  Tracks 8  and 9 aren't great, and are followed by the novelty cover of "Green  Acres."  And then tracks 14-16 are all very slight, either weird  instrumentals ("Tinkerbell") or just kind of short and  uneventful.  Cut most of those 5 songs, and you'd have a much stronger and  more cohesive album.   All in all, it's definitely worth buying, but go  for "Growing Up" first.  It remains Hi Standard's best work.
