 Of the three Hi Standard albums currently available, this is the weakest.  Which is not to say that it's not enjoyable-- there are a number of good songs, and listeners who are new to the band will get a kick out of it.   But it can't compare to the fire and depth of their newer album,  "Making the Road," or the poppy high-speed bliss of "Growing  Up." For one thing, interesting verses are routinely followed by  silly choruses ("Pathetic Man's Song," "My Heart Feels so  Free").  "Secret Minds" is the worst casualty, because it  has a very cool chord progression on the verse.  There are more covers here  than on other albums, and they're not as good (nothing can top  "Saturday Night" from their first album, or the single-only  "California Dreaming").   In short-- start with "Growing  Up," move to "Making the Road" next.  If you like those  you'll find a lot to like here, but it's probably a record for fans only.
