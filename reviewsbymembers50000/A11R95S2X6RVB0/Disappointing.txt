 There are worthy moments on this CD, but mostly it's a disappointment.   Godspeed You Black Emporer is more interesting, both texturally and  structurally; this music tends too often towards pure minimalism, and in a  very tedious way (straight 4/4 meter and descending minor scales).  Also,  the tracks with singing are very ill-advised; the vocalist sounds like he's  trying for Wayne Coyne's goofy fragility, but with this music it just  doesn't work.
