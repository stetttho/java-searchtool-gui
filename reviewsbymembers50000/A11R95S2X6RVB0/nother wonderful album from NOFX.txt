 NOFX seemed to take a misstep, a couple of albums back.  They were trying too hard to change their sound-- every 2nd or 3rd track seemed to come out of left field.  Lack of focus, you might say.  "So Long and Thanks for  all the Shoes" was better in that regard, and had some good songs, but  still seemed to lack an idea at its core that held it together. Now, NOFX  have found themselves again.  "Pump up the Valium" (which is how  is should be spelled, I'm pretty sure) is a return to form, of sorts.  It  blazes along from the opening riff of track 1, through the tremendous  closer "Herojuana."  ("Theme From a NOFX Album" is  funny, but basically just a post-script to the album.)  The pace is as  relentless as ever-- as fast and tight as "Punk in Drublic" even.    Songs throughout are very listenable.  If there's a weak point, it's  that NOFX have passed their songwriting prime.  The really fast punk songs  tend to blend together lately, and some of the ones here sound like  excerpts from "The Decline."  But nothing is bad; there's less  filler than on any of their previous albums except "Punk in  Drublic."   The album hits a high point midway through with the  goofy "Thank God it's Monday," the hilarious "Clams Have  Feelings too," and "Louise," a descent into pure  pornographic lesbianism.  Also good: "Bottles to the Ground" and  "Take Two Placebos" (despite the Offspring-esque backing vocals).   "Dinosaurs Will Die" is a letdown-- cool title, but really  obvious lyrics.  "My Vagina" is gross and hilarious, like the  best parts of "There's Something About Mary." Nothing to really  complain about; they have delivered the goods again.  Even if the opening  track says it all ("And Now for Something Completely Similar"),  it's a formula that the band does better than anyone else.
