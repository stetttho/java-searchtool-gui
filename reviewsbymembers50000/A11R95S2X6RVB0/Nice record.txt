 In truth I'd give it 4.5, but we're rounding up.  If you like the Lootpack, this is just about as good.  It's a little cleaner, a little less totally-blunted-and-messed-up.  Not much, but a little.  Well worth picking up.    (And in answer to a previous review: yes, I'm sick of Dilated, J5, and some others.  But I'm not sick of Madlib or Wildchild... these guys will continue to get my money.)
