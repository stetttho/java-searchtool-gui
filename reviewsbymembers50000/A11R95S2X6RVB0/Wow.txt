 I'm not a Rancid fan as such.  I do own "Let's Go" and "...And Out Come the Wolves," but only listen to them very occasionally.  I didn't expect to buy any other albums by them, and only  decided to do so after reading some very positive reviews in here. Boy,  am I glad I did.  This album has a lot of variety.  Rancid has honed the  punk I enjoyed on their previous albums, making it more abrasive and more  groove-oriented at the same time.  The ska here sounds more soulful that  before, esp. the ones that are practically dub-- with the odd minor keys  and echo vocals.  And the use of instruments like organ, piano, etc. is an  integral part of the music, rather than dress-up like most bands.   Good,  good stuff.  Derivative or not, this is well worth buying.
