 This is an unbelievably good album.  I like most of Sizzla's releases to varying degrees, but I've been especially interested in his experimental stuff the last few years - "Rise to the Occasion" and "Life" are both terrific.  This one is maybe the slickest, most consistent release in this vein that Sizzla's had.  It's overall a pretty mellow disc, actually, with a lot of gorgeous melodies and rhythms that ride the line between dancehall and modern R&B.  And even though I don't like modern R&B that much, it really works here.  Favorites include "Good Morning" (great opener), "Why," "Push & Shove," and "Where Are You Running To."  Actually picking favorites is tough because all the tracks are good and as each one is playing, it sounds like a favorite to me.  Unlike a lot of Sizzla's albums this doesn't start strong and end weak; it's good all the way through, and the last three songs are three of the best - also more aggressive than the first half of the album.  I would say, though, that fans of Sizzla's more righteous, rootsier releases may not like this one.  Not much "Jah Rastafari" or "King Selassie I" on this one, and only a couple of songs are even a bit rootsy (track 2 is beautiful and kinda rootsy, though).
