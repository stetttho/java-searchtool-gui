 Melt-Banana is great, and this album is the greatest.  Read the other reviews if you want descriptions of this frantic craziness.  This is by far their best album; they pushed things to a new level with more interesting, catchy songs that actually sort of resemble songs, and yet are more frantic and fast than ever.  It's the sound of uncompromising compromise.  "Shield For Your Eyes," by itself, makes my face crack wide open with demented glee every time I hear it.  You should get this CD.
