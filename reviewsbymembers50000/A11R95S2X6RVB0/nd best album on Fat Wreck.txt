 Better than the two albums that followed it-- although the new one, "Making the Road," is almost as good.  After Lagwagon's "Let's Talk About Feelings," this is the best album Fat Wreck has  to offer, and well worth the money you pay for it.  Lyrics are  incomprehensible throughout (even with the lyric sheet, a lot of times),  but that's part of the charm.  Buy it, buy it, buy it.
