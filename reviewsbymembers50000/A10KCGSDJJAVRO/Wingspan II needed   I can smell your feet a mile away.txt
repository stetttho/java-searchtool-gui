 MIA: Sally G   / Letting Go   / I've Had Enough   / Smile Away   / Mockberry Moon Delight   /  Beware My Love   / London Town   / Getting Closer   / Arrow Thru My Heart   / Morse Moose Grey Goose   / Deliver Your Children   / I'm Carrying   / Old Siam SIr   / Here Today   / My Brave Face   / Girls's School   / Give Ireland Back to the Irish   /    Mary Had a Little Lamb   / To be sure, these were U.S. charted singles and B-Sides or my brave choices, but I'd bet every one would have liked to have had SMILE AWAY, SALLY G or BEWARE MY LOVE on this Double CD.  It's hard to belive with so much great music there is so much ordinaty drival on a 2-CD set.  Is this a Paul CD, Wing's, both? And what's the deal with "C MOON" anyways.  This is a very, very average moment in Paul's career but it must hold a special place from Paul's Wing's memories? Weak...throw away.  Anyways, there are still many joys on here, but don't let artists select their own favs, they don't have objectiveness.
