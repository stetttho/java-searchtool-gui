 Great singer. I'd also like to recommend John Berry's "Blessed Assurance" from the very fine AMAZING GRACE CD (Sparrow Records) from  1995.  I'm no bible thumper, but that's about a fine a recording of that  old church chestnut I've ever put my ear to. On the other hand, Trout  Mask Replica by Captain Beefheart is pretty lame LP
