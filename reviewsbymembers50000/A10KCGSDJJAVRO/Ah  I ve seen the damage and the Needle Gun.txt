 A buddy of mine in Austin told me this guy is hot right now(Summer 2005) in TX, like the temperature.  So I searched out a couple of CDs.  This is deffinetly blues, although I'd say this Guy has more in common with Tom Waits than B.B. King.  Most of it is interesting music, his lyrics are inciteful and to the point.  His guitar work and the occational harp break get notice, but I wanted the melodies to hit me up side the head, the way Muddy Waters hits you, or Jimmy Reed, or Elmore James. That's my kind of blues.  If this is indeed white boy blues, and there are many good players out there, I need a hook.  That said I enjoyed these songs in particular (in sequence)  4)  Needle Gun 6)  Sweet Alice Blues 9)  This is Hip 14) Hometown Boy
