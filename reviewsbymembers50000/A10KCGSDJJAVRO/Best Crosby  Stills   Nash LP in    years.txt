 I don't find this CD dull. It is mellow, from time to time, but chugs along a a nice clip throughout. The three principals -Matthew Sweet, Pete Droge, Shawn Mullins- have all earned their stripes in AOR and Alt-Country acts over the past decade or so, with vaerying degres of success. GIRLFRIEND by Sweet, was a watermark of the early '90s, Droge's "If You Don't Love Me, I'll Kill Myself" surfaced circa 1994, and "Lullaby" was the radio friendly lament of '98 by Mullins.    There are several ear-friendly tunes straight out of the singer-songwriter school of thought on this trio's offering as well.  In particular, "THINK IT OVER", which may remind you somewhat as a cross between CSNs "Teach Your Children" and "Wasted on the Way", is the real charmer.  The cover of The Jayhawks "BLUE" is also fine but does not distinguish itself from the original.  If you like CSN&Y and can get this on he cheap, it is worth the price of admission. Matthew Sweet has rarely let me down.
