 The first thing I noticed was that these guys are having fun on this record. The band is tight as a guitar string.  The horns wail, the vocals are whiskey smooth, not a mis-step in the song selection. I saw Marcia Ball recently, and it was a PAR-TAY, so maybe it is "sumfin'in da watah down der", but this was as much fun as blues record gets.  All songs are good, most are way above average.  The novelty of "Flip Flop Jack" and whistling sing-song intro on "Nobody Knows" made it a blast to listen to listen right down to the last chord...  With nods to 1940's jump-swing, 50's style steet corner crooning (Sufferin with the Blues), plus a modern production, made for a throughly solid listen.  Next road trip or pary I throw, I'll know where to start, and just keep on rockin'.
