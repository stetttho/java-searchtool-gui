 Easily one of the best releases I've listened to in a long while. Outdistances any thing she has released previous to this. More confident vocals than she shared on say, "Picture" with Kid Rock overshadowing her.  No question she channels Neil Young and Crazy Horse: "I AIN"T GIVING UP ON YOU" (Down by the River), "BABY DREAMER" (Helpless) and "WHEN WILL YOU EVER COME DOWN" (When the Morning Comes) are dead ringers. Not that that's a bad thing. And as the Judds once sang; if you like girls with guitars, this is the stop on the musical map you want to visit.  As many have mentioned "ALL ABOARD" is the hottest track.  It rocks and the chorus should have you tapping your toes and humming along, even if the subject matter is dead serious.    I have been a bit critical of Ms. Moorer in the past for her hit-or-miss MISS FORTUNE album. But this effort hits on all cylinders.  The lyrics of the title track "THE DUAL" are so well thought thru and so sad, you feel like the punch-drunk boxer portrayed in the song.  The title track leads into the closers which bring The Dual into the final rounds of slower ballads.  I've listened to it constantly since getting it. Usually I'll spin something once, make a decision on which cuts I like, and move on, but I instead want my colleagues to try it and buy it.  Lucinda or Kathleen Edwards are contemporaries, so if you like alt-country this should be in your collection.
