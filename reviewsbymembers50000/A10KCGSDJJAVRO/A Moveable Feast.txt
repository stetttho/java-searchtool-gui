 The most successful recording duo of all time have produced dozens of stellar hits, but this album recorded in around 1975 is an absolute gem.  Far different than their power eighties mega-sellers, the stripped back approach employed on this ofering is resplendent in beautiful vocal harmonies.  The tasteful non-electric play is really a watershed moment for the young Hall & Oates. The band and choice of instrument, including the more traditional banjo and strings, show how grounded they were in the post singer-songwriter hey day of early 1970s.  Some songs even lean toward the country-rock that was popular at the time. Sweet and innocent sounding, they were earning their way in the world of music. Like a first novel by a green artist, these are the exciting results.  . Not a duff track in the bunch, centered around the super-single "SHE'S GONE", which evently charted but only after the success of the equally brilliant "Sarah Smile" (from the follow up album).   . Daryl and John are in fine voice; expressive nuances spring forth on "WHEN THE MORNING COMES", "HAD I KNOWN YOU BETTER".  The stories songs like "LAS VEGAS TURNAROUND" & "LAUGHING BOY" are equally fine and well developed dramatic numbers. . This is a down to earth offering.  Even the cover art, which features...well...an abandoned luncheonette, takes us back to a time almost forgotten.  They may well have had more popular songs and albums, but in my opinion Daryl Hall and John Oates never recorded a better album.  Desert Island Classic.
