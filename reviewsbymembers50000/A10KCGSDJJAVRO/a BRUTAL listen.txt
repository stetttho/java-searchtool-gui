 I enjoy "HUMAN BEHAVIOR", and after listening to the complete collection, found "BACHELOETTTE" to be border line a passable ok.  The rest of this is painful to tolerate. Scary bad.  I'm sure there are coffee-house types with black rimmed glasses and fashionable hair-dos in London / New York / Warsaw that enjoy this type of stuff, but next to YOKO (oh, nooooo!) this was the worst think i've tryed to listen to since horrific "TROUT MASK REPLICA" by CrAPTAIN BEEFHEART.  Boy, I'd hate to listen to the stuff that ain't a "HIT"  Ouch!
