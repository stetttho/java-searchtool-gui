 Not every cut is a must have but I agree with others, I have heard many inferior copies of these tunes and the sound is about as good as it gets, even surpassing Rhino's excellant 9-volume British Invasion Box Set, which also contains a very high quality version of Lulu - "To Sir With Love", for example. This topped that.  The Monkees have been repackeded umpteen times, but the pristeen version of "Daydream Beliver" is so crisp, you can hear the 6 a.m. alarm clock ringing behind Davey Jones vocals for the whole verse.  The joy of Dion & the Belmonts (Donna the Prima Donna), Jay & the American's neo-operatic masterpiece, "Cara Mia"  amoung others, are in great company on board this trip down memory lane.  In addition, songs that don't make run of the mill 60s soundtracks, such as "Theme from A Summer Place" (Percy Faith), or the girl-group one-hit wonders: The Toys - A  Lover's Concerto [a classical finger minuet by Bach put to a Motown bassline]are welcome inclusions here.  Well worth seeking out for back yard parties and hard core rock and roll oldies enthusiasts.
