 I'd be hard pressed to confes this is not Jim's best, but certainly it compares for top honours with "Pretty Close to the Truth" as a solid 1-2 punch, right out of the gate.  I own most all of Jim's CDs and collaberations (Ralph Stanley / Donna the Buffalo)and go back this warm debut over and over.  His vocal emotion and keen ability to turn a clever phrase, bolstered by convincing melody and guest collaberations throughout, make this an indispensable addition to your alt-country / trad-country collections.   Having the ever-reliable Emmylou Harris on board never hurts (in my opinion, no greater harmony vocalist outthere).  To me Jim Lauderdale, Buddy Miller and Dwight Yoakam are the holy trilogy in the C&W section of my extensive CD library.   Not a duff track on the CD and many classic country rockers and ballads.    Spend some time with Jim Lauderdae, you too will want to return to the Planet of Love.
