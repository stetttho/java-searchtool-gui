 Like Jonny Lang & Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Ian Moore pretty much came storming out of the blues starting blocks around the same time, and rocked about as hard. And like Jonny & Kenny, Ian's latest release takes him far, far away from the steamy bar blues of yesteryear's debuts.  I was expecting blues, actually hoping for something akin to his first CD, which I really dug.  This is NOTHING like that. But what a treat. Hard to pin down, it rarely rocks...hard. It's actually pretty chilled out. I can imagine Ian Moore crafting these marvelous songs as Brian Wilson might have sat and wrote one great song set after another in Beach Boy Brian's Good Vibration salad days. Or comfortably numb Pink Floyd, or spellbinding Audience, or the way Beatesque pop like "She's Leaving Home" type songs would inspire and evolve into a band as poppy as the great Jelly Fish. It's like none of those things and all of them.     I don't know, I just think this was an unexpected knock out. I can not stop playing this CD. That hasn't happened to me this year, except with Patty Griffin's dreamy new release (Imposible Dream).  This is a very special CD.  Not one dud in the bunch and most every song is a revelation.  I rarely take the time to confess my love for an artist or album, I have a blues kinship to many of these young cats so I pull for them to do well, but this CD blew me out of the water. I hope it does the same for you.  I'm buying another copy of this instant classic for a desert island.
