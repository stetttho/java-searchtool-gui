 I've listened to the SMB, in it's various incarnation and phases, and enjoyed most of what he has done.  I went back and listend to this CD last night and, first off, the sound is better than anything out there.  Songs like "Swing Town" or "The Joker", which are well produced jump out of the speaker, like hearing then for the first time.  The level of consistancy on these is pretty darn staggering and the versions included, for the most part, are album lenghth, full cuts (including intros to "Jet Airliner", and "Fly Like an Eagle").  One could argee that a cut here or there is missing ("Gangster of Love", got spins a plenty in Chicago in the 1970's), but by and large, every essential Stevie Miller cut is here.  And it is no 10 song cheappie either.  A full 20 songs (22 if you include the 2 intros).  With Miles Davis entering the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, GULP! Steve Miller deserves a spin on your player.  This is a great CD.
