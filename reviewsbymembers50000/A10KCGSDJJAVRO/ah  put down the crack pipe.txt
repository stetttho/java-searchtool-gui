 . I've had an easier time sifting thru gate-fold record albums looking for a bong hit than I did finding smokin' tunes on this weak set. . Aside from trusty IAN MOORE, who honours MUDDY WATERS with the Old Tradion-meets-New Tradition Blues of "CHAMPAGNE & REEFER", there weren't many buzzworthy cuts on this pro-canibus compilation. . Besides, EZ Wider breath, simply contributing a song with the word "HIGH" or "SMOKE" in the title shouldn't constitute reefer madness. . With fairly big name "on-the-record" grass-acts on board such as BLACK CROWES, GOVERNMENT MULE, BLUES TRAVELER, honorary Allman Brother WARREN HAYNES, DRIVIN' & CRYIN', WIDE SPREAD PANIC and SCREAMIN' CHEETAH WHEELIES, a good time should have been had by all, but none of this really set my soul on fire. . Many of the bands -known or unknown- try to take on FM Staples such as "AND IT STONED ME" and "HIGH TIME WE MET". "SWEET LEAF" sounds like karaoke Sabbath so what's the point of taking on the master of reality. It's like trying and scrape ressin off the pipe the morning after? Tastes bad. . A few moments light up such as the reggae anthem "LEGALIZE IT". Here SUBLIME do not steer far off the Jamaican Roadside in feting legendary ganja unicyclist, Peter Tosh.  But it works. . Other than that, it's mostly stems & seeds that you don't need. Fool's Gold is bad indeed. Bottom line, if this CD were bought weed, I'd have felt like I'd been ripped off. . Dave's not home, man.... .
