 There are some decent oldies strewn around here, but they can be found in  better suuroundings or original oldies compilations.  The covers by  contemporary artists such as Blink 182, Semisonic, and Blues Boy King may  be of curious interest to completests.  The best of the "new"  cuts made for this Made for TV mock-u-mentory, the sweet, sweet, Chante  Moore vocal with the Emeralds on "WALL AROUND MY HEART", beats  all. That cut is as strong as anything on the Tom Hanks produced film THAT  THING YOU DO.    Honestly, if your heart is into remarks of oldies but  goodies or you just can't pull your self away from your stratchy 45's, try  the briliantly right-on GRACE OF MY HEART soundtrack (movie was ok too), or  even the campy guest-fest by Shudder To Think, "First Love, Last  Rites" (soundtrack).  ...on the other hand, it's better than Trout  Mask Replica by Captain Beefheart.
