 At first glance I was impressed with the wide spectrum of songs included.  Maybe Stevie deserves more that just a quartet of discs.  (As an example, upon opening up his vast back-log of unreleased material in boxed set form,  Springsteen ended up rush-releasing his "TRACKS" album, to  collect ommitted trax).   None the less, as I read the reviews from  AMAZON customers I could not help but note the number of gross ommisions.   Granted, you can't please everyone, but over the course of 4 discs, you'd  think you could hit the mark on every major cut. My Personal Plee was for  the extended 12" mix of FRONTLINE that I own in album form, but I  would have settled for a single version.  With its riveting groove and  strong lyrical message, you would have thot its unclusion a  no-brainer. It is a bit unfair to dock the 312 minute marathon a star for  one left out song but as I add up the number of complaints, I think there  are some missing moments here (DON'T DRIVE DRUNK, ALFIE, and so  on). Maybe a live, rarities and B-sides disc is in the works, but the  great, great early to mid-sixties Moptown cuts are so, so wonderful, it's a  shame Little Stevie does not think as much about his past (he had Motown  pull the 3-LP LOOKING BACK anthology from disctribution). I wish those  would come back once more...
