 Wish I could cuddle up to this one like the rest of the 13 year olds and grown ups, but I gotta throw this one back.  I'm going to spin it again, just to make sure I wasn't on bad drugs the last two times.  I still don't get it.  I'm more about music than anti-music, so maybe that's my short coming, but I own thousands upon thousands of recordings  -from Abba to Zappa-  and without a doubt this is the most unlistneable item in my collection.  1 Star for making me go back to prove myself wrong.
