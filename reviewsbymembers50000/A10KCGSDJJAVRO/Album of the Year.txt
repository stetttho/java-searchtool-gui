 Along with Mindy Smith and Julie Roberts amoung the best music I listened to last year. A set of vocal pipes to would have made a young Aretha take notice. Favorite guests on board (guitar chameleon Buddy Miller and his wife,Julie. Of course, the always classy, Ms. Emmylou Harris).  If you like  that sort of alt-counry, atmospheric female, jangle rock, like Emmylou, Lucinda, Sarah Harmer, Kathleen Edwards, Alice Peacock, Kim Richey, Julie Miller, you can't go wrong.....  Best 5 STAR moment: "USELESS DESIRES"  *****
