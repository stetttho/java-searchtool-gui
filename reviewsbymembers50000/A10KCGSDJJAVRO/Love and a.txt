 Solid set from lesser none acts (to me at least although JET and WILLIAM ORBIT I knew).  I don't watch the show, but borrowed the CD.  I'd heard good things about JEM (supposedly a Dido clone?). I felt the melodies, while often wan we're, for the most part, enjoyable, and the CD overall was buoyed by strong music.  If this is what the 13-25 years old are listending too, the future is in better hands than I thought.   More accoustic in nature than over the top hard rockin or heavily alternative, the songs have a peaceful and tranquell feel for the most part, like watching the rain fall on a fall afternoon. A couple of tunes reminded me of Pink Moon, off of a Nike Drake record album.   No rap, so that was a good thing.  No real load screaming or load guitars (DANDY WARHOLS, one band I know, is about as driving as this gets).  It sets a mellower pace and follows thru most of the listen. Higly recommoeded, if you are in mid-life and want to hear what your kids are tuning in.  I'm 45 and found this very listenable.
