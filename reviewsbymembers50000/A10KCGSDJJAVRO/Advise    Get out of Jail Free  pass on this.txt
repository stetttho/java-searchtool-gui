 This is horrible. I enjoy oldies and Sun Records-era cuts as much as the next guy, but this is very pedestrian. Yuck! His voice is grading and unfriendly. You may say he is uncompromising but you still have to put good tunes to tape and not much here is interesting. . The 6th song, a surf style inst., "Nephretite" is passable (no vocals, phew!), but even there it is repetitive and not spectacular.   . He rocks out some on "309" but the voice is so poor it takes any enjoyment from the song. Yuck!  . The non-vocal ditty|"Nabonga" was an Al-right listen, but I'm not racing to Sam Phillips speed dial on this one either. . "Prison Called Life" was a perfectly titled closer, because I couldn't wait for this CD to end. It was a keeper. . Makes the Stray Cats sounds like innovators. . Easily the worst 'rock' record I've sampled since  "Drive By Truckers" this year. . Take this low-flying saucer rock & droll and ... el Paso.
