 Looking over the song list, this is a fine CD capturing most of her high points in one place. It would be nice to get some early demos, outtakes, rarities, for those of us that have been with her from the outset.    Had the producers decided to include the cover of the Big Mama Thornton standard "HOUND DOG", from Tedeschi's 1995 debut, it would have shown her lineage and earliest debt to the blues.  Blues women have pioneered the sound for decades getting little notice, in a male dominated industry and genre.    They might have included "Alone"(live)off the Japanese release of WAIT FOR ME disc as a Bonus Track.   Or the ex-SRV backing band DOUBLE TROUBLE's version of "In the Garden" for a change of pace to the mellower take found on her solo CD.   How about the slinky & smokin' duet she performs with her one-time producer Tom Hambridge off his BALDERDASH album, "Opposites Attrack" Yousah!!!  It is not a knock on Susan, she probably didn't have control over this release anyways and the music is top notch. There are often licensing issues to untangle as well.   But with 80 minutes on a CD, how about treating long time fans to a few extras for being there over the years.   For newbies just looking to catch a glimpse of blues-rock in the vain of Bonnie Raitt or maybe Janis, this will be a nice pick up.
