 I can't wait to hear: * Heart of Stone * Out of Time * the Last Time * Play with Fire Oh wait a minute these great Rolling Stones songs are not included. Well at least they didn't try to slam some new crap on us to make the 2-CD set seem "essential".  Oh wait, there are some crappy new songs on this.  Hey why not drop the three new songs!   Noboby gives a rat's butt about the Stones after 1980 anyways.
