 Great flippin' mid-eighties album here.  6 classics and 3 other strong to very strong songs.  From the handful of Chuck Berry-inspired rockers to the sweet, sweet twin ballads, this CD packs a super punch.  K&tW were never close to this consistant or catchy again, but for one moment they were...walking on sunshine.  "Sunshine" has been played to death in movies and on radio stations, but is a fine cut.  From the opening harmonies of "Red Wine & Whiskey", to the Bangles-covered "Goin Down to Liverpool", to the Stone-sy licks on "Game of Love" that closes this rockfest, this recording should be part of your collection.  Amazingly solid.  Perfect for driving down the highway on a summer day.   *** Get these songs on the "ANTHOLOGY", where he SOUND QUALITY is far superior.  All the cuts are on on that Best of, plus some other good moments.  A wiser purchase ***
