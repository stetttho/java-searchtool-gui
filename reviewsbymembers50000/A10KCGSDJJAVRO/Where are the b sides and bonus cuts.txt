 For years Petty fought the estabishment over price increases on the old vinyl. The Releasing of remastered versions of his CDs was an opportunity to right a wrong.  Most of Petty's records run under 40 minutes.  It would have been nice, as long as he was cleaning up the sound, to throw in a few varities.  The Box set is way, way too bloated to buy into. None the less, this is a 4-5 star CD.  Right up there with Full Moon Fever, as his best work.
