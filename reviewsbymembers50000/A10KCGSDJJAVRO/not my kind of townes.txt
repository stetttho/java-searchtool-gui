 I wish I could agree with the herd, but I was very disappointed by this CD overall.  There was very little special-ness about the arranagements and I found her voice to be less than spectacular.  She reminded more of Carol King or Laura Nyro -both songwriters first, singers second- than say Janis, (who someone compared her to) but this was no "Tapestry" not even a "Stone Soul Picnic".  Remember the Saturday Night Live skit where Phil Hartman plays SINATRA and they are making Frank's Duets album and SINATRA is running thru the singing partners in one take, no matter how bad it sounds.  In comes Bono...PUNCH...out goes Bono.    That is how this left, like she had two hours of studio time and had a plane to catch. To my ears this CD was lacking in any kind of emotion. Even the usually reliable Delbert McClinton, who helps out on the most recognizable song on this CD, "If You Needed me" sound like he had saddle soars thru the production.      Listen to Don Gibson & Emmylou Harris version of "If I Needed You" is quite beautiful and quite different. Holds up well some twenty years later.  I can't recommend one song as standing out on the disc, none of it was horrible.   If this is one of country rock's answers to Janis Joplin, then  someone just took anything little piece of my heart.  Sorry.
