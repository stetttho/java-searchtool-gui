 Note to DeepBlueReview: I believe (Doyle) Bramhall ll , who recorded "Jellycream" and played with Double Trouble in The Arc Angels is actually the son of this texas singer/drummer, Doyle Bramhall. This LP sounded good to me.  I love the standards, and I think he hits high notes on all these covers, plus his own classic.  His son is a fine GTR player in backing band as well.   If anyone ever gets a chance to see Bramhall II on Austin City Limits, their version of "Shape I'm In" that opens up the show, is about as good a song as this Blues Fan has ever heard.
