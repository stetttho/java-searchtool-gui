 If your idea of the "Greatest Hits of All Time" includes SLIM WHITMAN crooning the George Baker selection "UNA PALOMA BLANCA" then this dutch treat is for you.  Or if OK re-makes of classics like DEL SHANNON's "Runaway" is your bag, then pull the trigger on tis lot. DEL is found here in a late sixites alternative take titled "RUNAWAY '67". It is always a dangerous sign when the gas is low and former teen idols are re-making their own all-time golden chestnuts.  The sound quality is no better or worse than you find on most of these type of comps. But there are a smattering of neat tracks that don't make your average sack of mostly charted hits.  Also on the plus side, there are a full 24 tracks on this disc, and some of them, while certainly not the "Greatest" of hits are not the type of song commonly found on compilations of the 1960's: CRICKETS, FIVE KEYS, VICKY CARR & MARV JOHNSON, as examples.    Newbies to oldies collections will probably be quite startled to find folk bands like the HIGHWAYMEN actually hit the Top 40  with what may be known today as a children's ditty (MICHAEL ROW THE BOAT ASHORE).  And VICKY CARR's name assuredly doesn't get mentioned in the same sentance as EDDIE COCHRAN, but probably would share air time on the same oldies station that play BOBBY GOLDSBORO's sugary ode to a deceased girl "HONEY".    You do get some of the best from the biggest: POOR LITTLE FOOL, CARA MIA, but if you lke little RICKY NELSON or JAY's AMERICANs or early ISLEYS you'd be better served to own their best ofs anyway.  As a dusty set it does not have enough rock or roll, mostly an odd ball collection of spotty hits and misses.  There are better mines to search for Old Gold.
