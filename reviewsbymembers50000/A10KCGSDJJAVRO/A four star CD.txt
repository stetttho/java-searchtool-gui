 You're darn right I got this blues CD.   But I totally agree. I got off the ship on the last few CDs from him.  I'm a huge blues fan, and I shout out my props to the old delta guys, but that style of sparse picking is not my forte.   I like guys like Luther Allison, and Magic Sam before him, who define the electric Chicago blues style, as an example.   That said, the All Music Guide (my music bible) dissed the new CD somewhat, for Guy reaching for the stars "Buddy's buddies"; naming Santana, Keith Richard, John Mayer, and a few odd luminaries who grace several tracks.   That didn't stop me from enjoying this.   The first 3 cuts knocked me out. Guy does a stellar Curtis Mayfield falsetto on the opener, takes on "Wicked" Wilson Pickett's' "99 & a 1/2 Just Won't Do" with gusto, and sings a winner of his own on the 3rd cut. I liked them all very much, and e-mailed my posse immediately to tell them to stop what they were doing and get a copy.   I'd rate the next 5 or 6 cuts with a litle less excitement but they all sounded good. The AMG knocks Carlos Santana's involvement on the CD because it sounds like...wait for it... a Santana song. Fair enough. John Fogerty was unsuccessfully sued for sounding like CCR once too. Fogerty won the case, mind you.   I like the CD. Many folks would like to see Buddy just record a CD with his touring band and get back to what he did on the late 80's thru the mid 90's (Feels Like Rain, Damn Right, etc.), but the trend these days (i.e. Santana, B.B. King 80th B-Day, Les Paul & Friends, Herbie Hancock's new one) is to load up a legend with a star studded arsenal of guests. By the way, Clapton is omnipresent these days, isn't he?   I also liked: Somebody's Sleeping in my Bed On a Saturday Night Cut You Loose  Treat your self to this CD, I give it to opposable thumbs up!!!
