 Rock Candy is right up there with Zep's "Kashmir" or The Nuge's "Stranglehold" as greatest hard rock song of all time.    The songs are as good a collection as has ever been assembled.  And whether on his own or with Van Halen, Hager never matched the powerful singing on this LP, in my opinion.  His voice is way up in the CD mix.  Which brings me to the main problem with the CD I own.  The sound is poor.  It sounds like the four guys are standing in a phone booth, the sound is so condensed.  I'd loove to see this Top 10 All Time Hard Rock album gets REMASETED with better sound and separation.  The drums on Rock Candy should blow out your speakers, and Ronnie's guitar assualt on "Space Station" should seer thru your speakers.  Here's hoping a great, great album gets it's just reward.  It's a 10 Star album with improved sound.  The recent Best of Montross does improve on the sound, includes arguably the top four cuts from the LP, but you've enjoyed the sequencing on this album for years as is, it is meant to be heard in this order and LOUD.  Of what a time we had....
