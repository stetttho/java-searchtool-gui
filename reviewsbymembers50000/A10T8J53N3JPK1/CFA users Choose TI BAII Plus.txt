 This review is directed toward those taking the CFA exams.  The TI BA II plus calculator is more straight forward than the HP 12C for the range of questions asked on the CFA.  The BA II Plus calculates faster than the HP, and is less expensive.    If you need the button quality and durablity of the HP 12C unit, upgrade and buy the TI BA II Plus "professional" - this unit has a brushed aluminum case and buttons similar to a HP 12C and costs around $50 - similar to a HP 12C.  When doing uneven cash flow problems the registers to the TI are all labeled so you can quickly enter data giving greater confidence with improved speed to your answers for NPV and IRR calculations.  I still have two or three HP 12C's around, but they aren't as intuitive as the TI for the CFA Exam.  If you are taking the exam - the TI is the way to go.
