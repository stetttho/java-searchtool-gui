 This mower really surprised me.  I bought the mower because it was subsidized (I paid $75 and turned in my gas mower)by a local air quality group. I didn't have high expectations and was very pleasantly surprised by the excellent performance of the mower.   Pros:  The mower is very quiet allowing you to cut the grass early on a weekend morning without offending the neighbors.  Mower does an excellent job.  It is light and easy to manuever and move around, especially if you have to lift it - my 5.5 hp gas mower was about 90lbs, this is about 30lbs.  No exhaust pollution, always starts on the first try (no pulling or breaking a starting cord).  No Gas, No oil.  A good feeling about not using fossil fuel.    Cons:  Avoiding the extension cord takes a little getting used to. The electric mower would be more of a challenge if I had a bigger yard (I have a 1/3 acre lot).   Overall I was very surprised by the excellent quality and performance of this product.  The positive attributes far outweigh having to get used to having a extension cord to run the mower.
