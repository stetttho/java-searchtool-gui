 The WG511T is a great networking card.  Pros are that it has Super G (108 Mbs) capability and that it installs easily with exisiting networks.  Cons - none so far.  I bought the card to replace the Netgear MA401 802 11b card (11 Mbs) that was good, but doesn't have the speed or range that this card has.  If you are thinking of having a wireless network 802 11g is the minimum speed you should consider (54 Mbs) - this is up to 5 times faster than the original 802 11b networks and allows you to stream music and photo files quickly.  If you are considering playing wireless music stored on a hard drive this is the minimum speed to consider.    Buying the Super G WG511T card allows you the benefits of faster networking where it is available by paying a $10 to $15 dollar premium for the card over 802 11G cards.  This card works well and has better range than other cards.
