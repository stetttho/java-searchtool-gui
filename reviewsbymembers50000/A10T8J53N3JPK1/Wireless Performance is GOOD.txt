 This unit is not perfect, but for $90 what did you think you were going to get.  As other posts have indicated you need to get the upgraded software from the Netgear Website.  It helps to have a fast router (802 11G or better).  It also helps if all parts are made by Netgear - they make a super G 108 mbs router that will likely enhance performance.  If you are going wireless it helps to have ripped MP3 files on a local hard drive (server) that is physically attached to the router (this allows the router to send songs to the stereo most efficiently, If you have songs stored on another computer (laptop) you will use additional bandwidth retrieving them from the laptop to the router and then sending them to the stereo - when on a local hard drive you only have 1 way transmission of wireless data.    I was able to get the unit to work wirelessly and had good results.  I had a few 'dropouts' when sending files from my laptop to my router equiped desktop and then on to my stereo, but the sound was still pretty good.    The other posts on this product must be using 802 11B routers which only have 11 mbs throughput.  802 11G is up to 54 mbs, and the best case would be a super G router at 108 mbs.    Adding this product to your existing setup is like adding a print server - it takes a couple of tries but when you are done it is worth the effort.  the MP101 is solid, and works well enough - I get a lot more utility out of this at $90 then I would out of an I-pod at $429.  It does require some effort to get going, but given the right wireless setup you will enjoy the results ...
