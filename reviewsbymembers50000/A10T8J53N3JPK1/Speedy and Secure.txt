 The WGR614 v.5 router is the current 'standard of measure' for simple home wireless networks.  As with all electronics, get the latest drivers! Go to the Netgear website - find the product and download version 1.7 (it replaces 1.3 shipping with the product).  Once you have the new version on your computer type 192.168.1.1 into your browser enter the user id 'admin' and password, 'password' and upgrade the firmware.  Select upgrade and specify the file you downloaded.  This is my second wireless network and it performs very well.  I had an older MR314 but this was an 802 11B (11 MBS vs 54 MBS for the WR614) I bought the WGR614 at Comp USA for $14.95 (with rebates) and have been enjoying the higher speed.  Part of the reason I upgraded was to take advantage of the WEP security that was not available for the older MR314.  If you want more robust security the unit also supports WPA, but this is harder to set up and slows the transfer speeds.  I have been using the router for about three months and it has performed well.  It isn't as sturdy as the MR314 (blue metal case was a lot more durable than the white plastic) but it is good enough.  Currently 802 11G is the slowest speed you should consider when purchasing a router  - this will provide good service for the next year when Super G routers (108 MBS) will be very common.  For now though this is a great router especially at the low price point.
