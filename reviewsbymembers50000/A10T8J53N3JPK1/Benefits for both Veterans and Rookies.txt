 As a rookie, I first checked out the second edition Zinn from the local public library - it taught me the basics of adjusting the limit screws on my derailleur and how to replace spokes on my rigid frame mountain bike.    After 10 years of riding in Marin CA, I now have a dual suspension mountain bike.  These bikes are expensive and  complicated with a lot more things to break and adjust.  I now own a third edition copy of Zinn and am glad to have it.  It is a good owners manual.  The book provides guidance for things I can do and things I am better off not doing.  Even when I can't do something I like to know how it works.  The book provides an added level of safety in getting riders familiar with their bikes and providing guidelines for evaluating if things are worn out and what a good replacement schedule is for parts.  Unavoidable things in life include death and taxes, mountain biking adds a concept 'everything will break at some point' and when it does you want to be able to consult Zinn.     The book is nicely indexed and is set-up in easily understood sections that will allow you to handle specific problems you are having with your bike.  Explanations are concise and there are a lot of pictures and figures of various models of equipment.  Fun to read even if you don't work on your own bike, and allows you to save some $ if you do.
