 In early 2003 I purchased a Netgear MR314 wireless hub and a MA401 card for my laptop.  This router and card are built to the slower 802 11b standard.  Recently I purchased a second laptop and wanted an additional card for the second laptop.  Rather than buy an additional slower card I purchased the new WG511 wireless networking card (faster 802 11G standard) to be used with the slower hub.   The new card is 'backward compatible' to the slower wireless router and has noticeably stronger reception than the MA401 card.  The newer WG511 card allows me to take advantage of faster 802 11G wireless networks when travelling,and to use the card on my existing network when at home.  Setup was seamless, and the price with the rebate is about good - other 802 11G cards are selling for around $20 more.  Netgear products have proven to be consistently reliable and a good value for the $.
