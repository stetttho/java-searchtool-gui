 After laoding XP Pro this laptop has a lot of functionality in a light machine with a manageable footprint.  When travelling the 15.4 inch screen is as large as you want to go for a tray table on a plane.  At 6lbs this is 1/3 less heavy than my Dell inspiron 4000.  The four USB ports and built in WiFi allow me to do a wide variety of tasks.  The screen is great - Its brighter, and it allows me to enlarge fonts without losing information and look at large spreadsheets.  My only con point is that the keyboard has a lighter feel than my Dell that I am slowly getting used to. Otherwise a well conceived and executed laptop.  So far, so good ...
