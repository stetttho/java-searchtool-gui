 It was time to replace my HP Laserjet III, and after some looking around it became apparent that Samsung and Brother are more competitive than HP in the low end personal laser market.  I chose the Samsung and am very pleased with the choice.  The Samsung provides great output (1200 x 1200 DPI), is fast, is networkable, and you can expand the memory to do complex printing.  I miss the heavy construction of the HP, but the Samsung is a good product for the money...
