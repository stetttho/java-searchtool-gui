 This software allows you to easily transfer names and telephone numbers to a V series (V60, V70 etc.) phone.  I initially was tempted to go with a Handspring Treo combination phone PDA but worried that someone would steal it and have ALL my information.  Additionally, I worried that if I broke the Treo it would be expensive to fix.   This software allows you to purchase the cheaper Motorola phones and sync your numbers and names similar to a PDA.  It is not as slick as a combo PDA, but is also cheaper and allows you to keep your PDA as a backup in case you break the phone.
