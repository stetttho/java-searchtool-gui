 Office Depot ran a special over the weekend selling these for $999 ($150 office depot rebate, $150 intel, $50 toshiba).  The bay area sold out in a matter of days as this is a screaming deal ... A pentium 4 chip with hyper threading allows plenty of power for all the digital applications you can throw at it.  The 15.4 screen allows a lot of viewable space.  For the price you get a nice if heavy destop replacement with very nice keyboard and 3 USB ports and a parallel port.  Heat seems to be an issue, and you really need to work at a desk to allow circulation below the computer.  A good all around entry in the low cost lap top category.
