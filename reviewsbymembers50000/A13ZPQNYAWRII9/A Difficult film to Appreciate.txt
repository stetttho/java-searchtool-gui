 The main obstacle in the way of my enjoying this film is the disconcerting elements of surrealism and irrationality inserted into a film that is in  every other way naturalistic. I must say I had some difficulty coming to  terms with this aspect of the film which at first glance made no sense at  all. I was irritated by it. Taken at face value this aspect of the film was  ludicrous. It goes like this: We have an grotesquely obese teenager who  has a homosexual encounter. He is caught in the act by his grandmother and  as a result is taken by his mother to see a young woman who's forte is  sexual initiation. Either this, his previous experience or his obesity  depresses him so much that he commits suicide. And we know he succeeds  because all the flowers in the garden die with him. But, and this is where  the madness and contradictions start, he comes back from the dead ten years  later metamorphosed into a handsome, slim young man! And he finds his  doppelganger still hanging from the tree in the garden. Now a  doppelganger is a figment of someone's imagination, a wraith that doesn't  really exist; and if it had remained as such, say a symbolic representation  of his earlier life, I would have had little  difficulty  in going along  with it. But no. He touches it and his dad hugs it and he then  buries it  and his dad tries to dig it up. Well, you can't bury a doppelganger, so it  must be a real body, a body that's been hanging from a tree for ten years  without any sign of decomposition. And if it is a real dead body and it's  his real dead body, how come he's still alive? Now if you can accept all  this as not being real behaviour but as some elaborate metaphor for his  wish to be free of his past and his dad's wish to cling onto it, then you  might just enjoy the film. It has as lot of good things going for it.
