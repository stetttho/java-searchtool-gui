 The  only way in which this film is better than the TV version is in the casting of Gwyneth Paltrow as Emma. Emma is an exceptional character and an exceptional actress was needed to play her. But,   apart from her, the film suffers from a whole series of deplorable miscastings and whoever was responsible for the casting can surely not have read the novel. Mark Strong as Mr Knightley in the TV version is  infinitely to be preferred to Jeremy Northam. Mr Knightley is a responsible, serious-minded, authoritative figure and is described by Jane Austen as having a "downright, decided, commanding sort of manner.", a world away from the light-weight charmer as portrayed by Jeremy Northam, who, good actor though he is, had not the height or physical presence the role calls for. Ewan MacGregor is also badly miscast in the role of Frank Churchill, who is supposed to be suave and sophisticated. Ewan MacGregor is anything but that.  However, the worst piece of miscasting  by far is that of Toni Collette in the role of Harriet; she is too physically large for the role. Jane Austen refers to the character as "little Harriet" and describes her as a "humble, grateful  little girl". And I must say Samantha Morton, who took the role in the TV adaption, was absolutely perfect in the part. But the film as a whole was too romanticised and idealised. I am not willing to believe that people  ever lived like that. Whereas the authenticity of the TV adaption was remarkable. It was like looking through a window into the 19th century. I felt - this is the way it must have been.
