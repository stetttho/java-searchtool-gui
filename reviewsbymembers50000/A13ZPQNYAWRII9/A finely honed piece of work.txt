 (...)  This film is a finely honed piece of work, correct in every possible detail. A lot of careful work must have gone into the casting and I can't imagine a cast more perfect. But I must just mention the brilliance of the late Denhom Elliot, who makes his Mr Emerson so very lovable, with his simple wisdom and his permanently pained and anxious expression.  What a loss he is to the profession. And within its limitations this film is so marvelously true to the book. You just have to turn a blind eye to the many coincidences.
