 This film is not as funny as it thinks it is. The script is lacking in wit  and there is no coherent plot. Instead, in Almodovar's usual complex style,  we have a series of interrelated visual jokes hung loosely on one dramatic  thread: an abandoned pregnant woman's frantic search for the man who has  dumped her. This woman, Pepa, played with her usual skill by Almodovar  regular Carmen Maura, is a second-rate actress who performs in TV soap  commercials. We are shown her playing the part of a serial killer's wife  faced with the task, each time he comes home, of washing his blood-stained  shirts. What kind of visual joke is that? We have a blond, eccentric  taxi-driver, who has his colourful "Mambo" taxi stuffed with magazines,  drinks and every possible Medicare product, who, by coincidence, just  happens to be there on the three occasions Pepa needs him.                                                                    And then we have her  friend, Candella (Maria Barranco), a tall, slender girl, who, thinking she  is being pursued by the police because of  her involvement with a Shiite  terrorist, comes to Pepa's apartment for advise and succour and failing to  get either tries to throw herself off the balcony. She is saved by Pepa's  ex-lover's son, Carlos (Antonio Banderas), and his ugly girl-friend,  Marisa( Rossy de Palma). Pepa has not met Carlos before; he has come, by  coincidence, to view the apartment which Pepa now wants to let. Whilst the  others talk, Marisa drinks some Gazpacho, prepared earlier by Pepa with a   near lethal dose of barbiturates for her ex-lover, Ivan. She then spends  the rest of the film in a deep sleep thus giving Carlos and Candella time  and opportunity to fall in love. Towards the end, Pepa, in a wild chase  scene, follows her ex-lover's pyschotic  wife, Lucia             (Julieta  Serrano), who is on a motor bike with her hair flying, to the air-port and  arrives just in time to prevent her shooting her husband, Ivan (Fernando  Guillen). The latter is so grateful that he wants Pepa back but she will  have none of it. Despite its underlying theme of despair and occasional  descent into sick humour, this is, paradoxically, a happy film - bright,  colourful, fast-moving, with hardly a dull moment, the sort of film you  might turn to to help raise your spirits on a rainy afternoon.
