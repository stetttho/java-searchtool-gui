 Another fascinating film from Almodovar, with kinky characters, bright colours and superb performances. This one is about Manuela (Cecilia Roth), a single mother, and how she strives to come to terms with the death of her beloved eighteen year old son who, before her very eyes, is run over and killed instantly by a passing car. Her screech of horror is blood curdling. They have just been to see a production of "A Streetcar Named Desire." to           celebrate her son's birthday and are waiting outside the theatre in the pouring rain to get the autograph of Huma Roja (Marisa Paredes), the star of the play. But she comes out of the theatre too quickly, getting into the taxi, with her drug-addicted lover Nina (Candela Pina), and driving off before he can reach her. It is when he is chasing after her taxi in desperation that the tragic accident happens.  When Manuela is able to pull herself together, she decides to go back to Barcelona to give news of the death to her son's father who knows nothing of his son's existence. She left him all those years ago because he was HIV-positive, a transsexual and a prostitute. Twenty years later she finds him near to death with     an Aids related illness, having sometime before passed on the virus to sister Rosa (Penelope Cruz), a beautiful nun social-worker who shortly afterwards dies giving birth to his son (A beautiful nun going to bed with a transsexual prostitute? I suppose anything's possible. But what does it say about him?). Manuela has only known Rosa for a short time but shows what a stunningly good person she is by spending every moment taking care of her in her last illness; and afterwards adopting her son and taking him back with her to Madrid.  On the way to the hospital Rosa asks for the taxi to stop while she takes one last look at Barcelona's beautiful main square. A moving moment.             Manuela was introduced to Rosa by Agrado (Antonia San Juan) an old friend who is also a transsexual and a prostitute and who when we first see her is about to be raped.  Manuela leaps to her rescue, whacking her assailant over the head with a heavy piece of wood. Agrado then takes her in search of her son's father to a prostitute's work station, where, in the  middle of a great field, a drove of cars  drives around in circles Almodovar always peoples his films with an array of oddball outsiders - usually women, or men wanting to be women - viewing them habitually through benevolent  eyes. He obviously loves women. He thinks they are much better than men, that they make better friends, that they are  better able to confide in each other, to share their feelings and emotions and talk about things that really matter. And this film is a paean to that belief. The warmth and friendship these women show to each other is something to behold.  And so a film containing three tragic deaths and which should  by every expectation be sombre and depressing, is turned into a heart-warming, uplifting ode to the strength of the  human spirit. It contains at least one  memorable  quote. Huma Roja says at one point, " I have always depended on the kindness of strangers."
