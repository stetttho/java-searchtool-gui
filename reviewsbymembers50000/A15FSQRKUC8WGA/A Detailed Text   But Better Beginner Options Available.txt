 Recognize that Alif Baa is a college textbook designed as part of a three-year Arabic program.  It is very detailed, but includes a lot of linguistic information that a beginner doesn't want.  Al-Batal designed this as the definitive text on the Arabic Alphabet, and it is, but if you just want to learn how to read and pronounce Arabic in order to start studying, then you should go for a simpler text.  Awde's "The Arabic Alphabet" is the one to choose. Alif Baa will tell you all the different regional pronunciations of each letter, different handwriting variations, etc.  IMHO, that is too distracting for the beginner who just wants to unscramble the script and distinguish k from m, and so forth.  The problem is that this book doesn't identify what is essential and what is nice to know, so people come out confused about three different regional pronunciations of one letter, rather than learning jiim = j, etc.  These differences don't become important until you have progressed well into Arabic. Also, the Al-Batal series seems to guard the answer keys to their textbooks like state secrets, one of the biggest student complaints. And of course, $40 is a lot to plunk down if you can get what you want out of an $8 book (like Awde's).
