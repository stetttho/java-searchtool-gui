 The title is only half true.  Yes, this will give you your first 100 words in Arabic, with neat flashcards and some good exercises.  For the price it is reasonable, although 100 words is really not much (even if you've never studied French or Spanish, for example, you probably know well over 100 words in each). On the other side, this book will not teach you the Arabic script.  That is OK, since it provides both Arabic and transliterated Arabic on the flashcards.  It gives you a chart of Arabic letters and a page with general principles of joining letters.  You cannot reasonably go from that to unraveling the Arabic writing.  That part of the title should be cut out.  You need a book like Awde's "The Arabic Alphabet" a cheap and useful guide for learning the alphabet.
