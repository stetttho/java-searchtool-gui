 This is the best choice for learning the Arabic Script, which is essential to starting any Arabic study.  BTW - You need a book like this to learn the script; the texts that just give you a chart of letters and equivalents will not work, even though they claim to teach the alphabet as well (First 100 words in Arabic, for example).  Arabic letters combine in unexpected ways that you could never figure out by inference.  Awde teaches the alphabet clearly, but with the minimum of extraneous information.  The other choice - Mahmoud al-Batal's "Alif Baa", used by virtually every college Arabic program is good, but includes too many linguistic details for the beginner, unless you're planning to do a Master's Thesis on the variations of Arabic pronunciation.   If you're a beginning hoping to unlock the Arabic script, you want it simple and easy.  Rather than read about the three different regional pronunciations of jiim, you need someone to tell you jiim = j.   You have to practice the letters on your own, but this is the best start for understanding what they mean.
