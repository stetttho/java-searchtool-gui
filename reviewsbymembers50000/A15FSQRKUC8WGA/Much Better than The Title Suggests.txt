 "Teach Yourself Arabic" sounds like a hokey tourist phrase book or something.  Indeed, the "Teach Yourself" series varies a lot, some of the languages are poorly treated, some better.  This one is a gem.  It is not trivial tourist phrases, but actually goes into grammar, provides good reading comprehension exercises and a fairly well-developed vocabulary.  Includes some very useful points like word shapes, a key tool for learning Arabic with its root and measure system. If you are studying Arabic in school, this makes a great supplement.  Some of the confusion in textbooks is cleared up here.  You need a seperate book to learn the Arabic script, and Awde's "The Arabic Alphabet" is the best.
