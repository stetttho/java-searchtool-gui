 My 8 year old had some birthday money left over and suggested we do some research on the internet for spy gear.  After an exhaustive search he decided on the micro kit.  He was not disappointed.  Everything worked right out of the box with the exception of the motion detector which needs 4 triple A batteries and a small phillips head screwdriver.  The best tool is the night spyer as the magnification works very well and the red spotlight is cool looking.  The motion detector is a little too sensitive as it went off without much (and sometimes nil) motion.  But better to be too sensitive then not to work at all.  The spy listener worked well also as my son stood in his room and whispered and I could hear him perfectly.  Without the spy ear I could not make out a word he said.  The voice scrambler was very cool also.  Although the sound is tinny it doesn't really matter as you use it to alter your voice anyhow (it also alters the speed of what you say).  The belt holds everything conveniently and clips securely.  Is it durable?  If you throw it around or step on it, it won't last long.  But with some care it should last.  I didn't feel that it was shoddily made. If you consider that you get 4 really great spy tools it is definitely worth the money.  Your child will not be unhappy.
