 I had this when I was a child.  I remember my sister and I having hours of fun playing with it.  My 6 year old son just recived it as a present from my sister.  Unlike other reviewers we found that the pieces all fit and none were warped.   However, the plastic rings do feel kind of flimsy and there are just two rings that you can use as a guide (and only on the inside).  Overall I think they should bring back the quality of the old version and skip the wiz bang loops and other things that don't really add value to the set.  Plus on our box the manufacturers age is 8 and up.  My son was having a little trouble keeping the gears in place and I don't know if I should attribute that to the cheap gears or his age.  Better for older kids who have more control.
