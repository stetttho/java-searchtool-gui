 I bought this camera case for my Sony H1 zoom camera.  The camera fits great, there is no wobble, it fits securely.  It will also hold your lens hood and adapter ring, spare batteries and extra memory.  But it won't hold your battery charger or manual.  It will also be a tight fit to get your AV and USB cables in.  They might go in but I think it would harm my memory sticks so I'm leaving them out.  This is the bag for you for day trips or an overnight journey, especially if you only want the bare essentials.  But if you're leaving for a week and want to take everything with you (as I usually do) you'd be better off with a small camcorder bag instead.  The case is very sturdy but its not waterproof so forget about those flume rides.
