 I bought the high speed 1 gig duo pro memory sticks from both Sony and Sandisk.  I saw no difference between the two in terms of shot to shot times or flash recovery in my H1 camera.  Some photography sites said that the sandisk is faster.  They measure it in terms of hundreds or sometimes thousands of a second.  Who can really tell?  I know my brain didn't register a difference.  With that said there is really no reason to go for the higher priced Sony stick when this one will work fine.
