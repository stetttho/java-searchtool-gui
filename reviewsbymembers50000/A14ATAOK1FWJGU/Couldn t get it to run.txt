 I bought this game because so many were saying how great it is. Well I had problems right off with sound and the computer freezing. Now this was weird as I have a new Dell 8100 pentium 4. So I went to Dreamcatchers site on the web only to find out that my processor was too fast. I had to turn the graphics capability down so low that it was impossible for me to see anything but grainy shots and it still froze (although I  did fix the sound problem). Probably a great game but not for the super fast computer.
