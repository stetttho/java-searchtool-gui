 I bought this for a Sony H1 camera.  This camera has a LCD size of 2.5 inches so none of the presized lines on the back could help me.  Where others could get 12 films out of it I can only get three.  My first one got a piece of dirt on it and it ruined my field of sight.  The second is not sticking to the bottom.  I have a very snug camera bag and everytime I pull the camera out or place it in it rubs the film.  I've only had it on a couple of hours and the bottom is already curling off.  I've taped it for now but needless to say I'm still in the market for some type of protection for the LCD screen.  It's inexpensive but you get what you pay for.
