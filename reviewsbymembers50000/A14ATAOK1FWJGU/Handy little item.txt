 This is a handy item.  My camera case is crammed pretty tight as I have stuffed my lens hood and adapter ring into it.  Not wanting to have my memory sticks get squashed and possibly not work I invested a little bit of money to insure that it wouldn't happen.  This case will hold 4 sticks together which is more than I'll have for a while (especially at 1 gig and 2 gig media memory).  However, this picutre is wrong.  It is not flat like this at all.  If you look under Velbon DMSP-SM4, that is what the case looks like.  I acutally like that one better anyhow.  But if you are looking for a very flat, long case this is not the one.  If you want one a little thicker and with the chain-order this one-you will not be dissappointed.
