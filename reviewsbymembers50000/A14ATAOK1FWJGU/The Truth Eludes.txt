 The watch works great and its fun for kids to see the different times in 24 cities around the world.  If you are buying it for the truth detector beware because you are bound to be disappointed.  It couldn't even detect the truth on the simplest of questions (like what is your name).  It seems fairly durable and well made and even suggests having the battery replaced by a jeweler.  I gave it high marks for educational value only because you can take out a map and show the kids where the 24 other cities are located.  But I guess it is more imagination driven for kids than technology driven.  Buy it for fun, not for accuracy.
