 When I first heard Muireann on Danu's "The Road Less Travelled" CD, she instantly became my favorite female vocalist (well maybe a tie with Blossom Dearie). I have been unsuccessful at obtaining a copy of her self-produced first CD, which I have seen fetch exorbitant prices on eBay. I was thus very excited to hear that she was releasing this CD. My high expectations were not disappointed.  This CD has a wide range of material which should please almost anyone. For the aficionado of traditional Irish folk music, her whistling on tracks 4 and 10 is fast, lively, energetic,and brilliantly ornamented. Like the rest of the CD, these tracks are enriched tastefully by the accompaniment -- in this case by Tony Byrne. Other tracks are also complemented by top artists such as Oisin McAuley and John Doyle. Tracks 1 and 5 have more of a pop sound than trad, and should have appeal beyond the traditionalists. Track 12 is a very powerful and emotive rendition of this well known song -- well worth the price of the CD by itself (the same can be said about County Down and especially Farewell Farewell on the Road Less Travelled). Other tracks are lively and fun, such as "Free and Easy". Track 3 is a traditional Gaelic lullaby, every bit as lovely and moving as Maura O'Connell's rendition of Dun Do Shuil. I can't imagine anyone being disappointed with this CD. Hopefully she will still be sharing her voice and instrumentals with us into her seventies (like Blossom).
