 Subtitled Lemegeton Clavicula Salomonis, this is the most complete version of this classic grimoire available. All five books are included (Goetia, Theurgia Goetia, Pauline Art, Ars Almadel, and Ars Notoria). All the original drawings are included from the best manuscript. I have also included complete critical apparatus, introduction, preface from Harley manuscript 6483 ("The definition of magic"), index, and four appendices. Appendix 1: Addenda found in Sloane 2731 and 3648 relating to some of the magical diagrams; Appendix 2: Johann Weyer's Pseudomonarchia daemonum (complete Latin text with English translation); Appendix 3: Comparison of Goetia with Weyer; Appendix 4: Other examples of some of the drawings (including notae) from other manuscripts and printed sources. The publisher, Red Wheel/Weiser, did a fantastic job on this edition, with high quality embossed binding and alkaline paper.
