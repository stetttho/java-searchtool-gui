 I deeply admire this new critical edition of Liber Iuratus, but you must be aware that this is the Latin text only (along with the material in "mystical" languages).  There is a fair amount more text than is represented in the English translation found in Royal MS 17Axlii.  Included is an excellent introduction which summarizes the text in some detail, as well as an analysis of the relationship between manuscripts. He also discusses LIH's relationship to other grimoires.  Dr. Hedegrd informs me that he is working on an English translation, but it may be a couple of years before it is available. This volume is a very valuable contribution to understanding the relationship between the many confusing manuscripts of magic.
