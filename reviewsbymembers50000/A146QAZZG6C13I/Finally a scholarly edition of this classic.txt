 This book should be at the top of the reading list for anyone interested in Western occultism or magic. The original Latin text of Agrippa's classic is presented along with critical apparatus clearly showing variant readings in the editions.  Includes a great introduction (in English) with a detailed analysis of Agrippa's sources and as well as an insightful and in-depth analysis of Agrippa's extensive 1533 expansion and revision of the text.  Complete with helpful bibliographies and indices. The only disappointment I had was the fact that this edition does not include Agrippa's lengthy recantation, which was included in the 1533 edition. This is one of the most expensive books I've ever bought, but worth the price, especially for those with a command of Renaissance Latin.
