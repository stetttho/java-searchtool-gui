 I asked my co-worker (and friend) to lend me any of the Depeche Mode cds he had and he brought me 6 cds (2 of them were Depeche Mode cds).  I heard this cd version in my car and I loved it!  Especially the "It's No Good" because It's Very Good!  I love the strangely enigmatic beat, melody, and the lyric.  Now this is "the song" that's on Repeat mode in my car at the moment.  I think it'll take a little longer than I expected to return this cd to my friend.
