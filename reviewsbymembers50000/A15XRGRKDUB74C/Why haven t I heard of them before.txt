 I'm the Josh Groban, Celine Dion, and Marc Antoine type of listener and for me to switch to an extreme type of music such as this says a lot about this group.  I just LOVE this CD and I can't get over song #1, 2, 3, 4, 5, & 9.  I used to hate hard rock, heavy metal type of songs because my secular friends stamped a no-no by playing these kinds of songs in front of me which made me hate it more...because they made me feel frustrated, confused & depressed whenever I heard those secular songs.  But I looked for an alternative hard rock/heavy metal and voila!  I found KUTLESS!!!  The lyrics speak a million words and the melody is awesomely awesome!  Funny how Kutless' songs don't make you feel depressed...like the other secular songs.  I wonder why!...Whenever I go through a little "crisis" in my life, I start whistling or singing their songs wherever I'm at (working) and I feel much better.  Thank You God for Kutless!
