 Nobody beats Josh Groban's voice.  First I was laughing my heart out and later, realized that it seems like some of the songs were purposely sung in the ugliest way ever thought possible.  Or maybe the singers sang that way to show how awesome and wonderful Josh's (strong, beautiful and controlled) voice is comparing to theirs.  "Si Volvieras a Mi" was poorly sung & pronounced with sometimes French or English accent and I think it's a shame that this is actually out there in the open for people to purchase it.  People, please buy the ones that were sung by the one and only Josh Groban.  Thank you very much.  ...Insulted and confused...
