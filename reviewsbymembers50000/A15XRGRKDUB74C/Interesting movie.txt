 I'm not going to write what the movie was about but certainly this is a very interesting way to sort of visualize the future.  I enjoyed seeing a different version of Chris Tucker in this movie, Bruce Willis looks handsome & is charming as always, and Milla Jovovich is prettier than ever!  Why can't we all have a nice lean body like she does?  I love it how they made a little grain transform to a whole meal/bird.  Voila!  Pop the seed in the "microwave" and there comes out your lunch/dinner.  Cool!
