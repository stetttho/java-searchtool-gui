 Wow!  I fell in love with this song even though I didn't know the meaning until I read the translated version online from a guy and I was shocked because it's kind of what I'm going through...what a coincidence!  And as for me, words can have a thousand meanings but melody is what touches someone's heart so translation is not important...but if you insist on reading the translated version, please visit this very cool website:  www.bluesdubuisnessman.de/celnews/dw/int_pqtme.htm    Enjoy! Bon appetit!
