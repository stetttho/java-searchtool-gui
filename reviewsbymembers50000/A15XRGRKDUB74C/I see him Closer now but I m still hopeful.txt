 Well, maybe he did sound like he was congested or nasal and maybe he did have faltering voice & vibrato here and there, and maybe he is trying to expand his talent to another side/level, but remember, he's still Josh Groban and he has all the right to change however he feels right about it. The problem is will his fans adjust to his change? We need to understand that David Foster was not involved in this 2nd DVD and maybe a different management can be blamed...and yes, who knows, his voice IS changing...I hope not because he really did sound nasal. Oceano was the first song on the Closer CD as well as the "Live At The Greek" DVD...he shouldn't have done that! Oceano is one of my favorite songs! He sang "Remember" beautifully and "Canto Alla Vita" was great..."Never Let Go" sounded excellent too and the rest of the songs...well, don't need to repeat what I've mentioned before. And whatever happened to "Confession"? How come he didn't sing that song? Hope ANOTHER and BETTER Live recording comes out next year. Maybe they can put a medley of different shows with songs that he sang beautifully (without the faults) in one dvd!...and with "Confession" in it too! Well, all I can say is good luck to you Josh Groban (if you're reading this) and good luck to us, the hopeful fans.
