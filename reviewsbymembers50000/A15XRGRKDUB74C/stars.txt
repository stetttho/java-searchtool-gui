 Josh Groban, HAPPY BELATED BIRTHDAY!!! (His b-day is Feb. 27) I initially bought this without the bonus tracks, but when I was browsing at a store I spotted the Limited Edition and I ended up purchasing it...loving Mi Morena (love the melody, the beat, the lyrics, and the voice!!!) as well as every song in it including My Confession, Remember When It Rained, Oceano, When You Say You Love Me, Si Volvieras a Mi, Never Let Go, and more!!!   Then it went to lending my CD to a friend, waiting for her to return it, and fighting to get it back. I later bought one more Limited Edition to a friend as a birthday gift.  I'm a fan because he CAN sing!  Lovelovelove!  Buy it and enjoy!
