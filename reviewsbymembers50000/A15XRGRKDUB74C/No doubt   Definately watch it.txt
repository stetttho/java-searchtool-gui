 "As filhas de Dr. March" (The daughters of Dr. March - translated in Portuguese) was the very first book I got a hold of.  I fell in love with it and tried the video version starring June Allyson (in English of course)...loved it too!  Yes, everything, from Jo to Laurie and even the set and the music.  This version is much (a thousand times) better than the recent version of "Little Women" starring Winona Ryder (because Winona Ryder was too "soft" for a character like Jo...not to mention that it is annoying to hear Winona speak.)  Yes, I think the real Josephine March (Louisa May Alcott) would have been much happier and satisfied with this one...No doubt about it!
