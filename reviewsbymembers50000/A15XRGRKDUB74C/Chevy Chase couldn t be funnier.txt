 I first watched this movie about 7 years ago on TV and never got to catch the title of this movie.  And then again, I got to watch parts of the movie here and there on tv and I finally found out the name of the movie.  I was so relieved that I had to buy it.  I love the comical way Andy Farmer tries hard to adjust to the country life style when he was so used to city life & I also love it when most of the town people are gathered in his living room singing Christmas carols and Andy sings "Joy!..." but is abruptly interrupted by someone in the crowd giving a quick ovation and can't finish the song.  Hahaha!  He was so ready to go on with that song "Joy to the world..." L.o.l.
