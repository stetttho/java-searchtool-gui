 Some people told me not to watch this kind of movie because it has a lot of witchcraft.  Well, I saw a part of the movie at a friend's house and was intrigued.  I bought the DVD and to be honest, I thought it was a nice little movie full of little surprises here and there.  I love the part when Harry talks to Ron for the first time in the train and they feast on the delicious & very yummy sweets.  Tempting, isn't it?  If only we could eat all of those candies without worrying about diabetes, our teeth, & sugar intake.  Sigh!
