 I've always loved Depeche Mode and I still do.  I thought that I'd get tired of listening to them...I thought wrong.  I got this as a birthday gift and too bad that "Strangelove" is not in this cd.  Well, I guess I'll have to buy a cd with that song.  "World in My Eyes" is intriguing, enigmatic, and explosive.  Love the "Policy of Truth"...love his deep voice...how can you deny Depeche Mode? Lovelovelove!  Thank you Depeche Mode for creating awesome music.
