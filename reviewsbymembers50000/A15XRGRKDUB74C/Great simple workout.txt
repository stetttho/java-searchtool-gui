 I love this workout video but I was wondering if Amazon.com carried it in DVD version.  My tape is worn out for playing it so much and I don't wanna buy another VHS copy when I have a DVD player...and don't want to worry about rewinding the tape over and over again after I'm done with the workout or when I'm ready to workout (will surely waste my time and/or waste my motivation).  This workout program makes me feel and look good.  Anyone, please, help me with getting this workout video in DVD version!!!
