 That's right!  Mazda got it, I got it, and how about you?  Mazda's commercials always play their theme song using one of the songs in this movie.  Who would have known that one of Mazda's personnel would find the beginning of "the song" so intriguing and so perfect to use it during their commercials?  Capoeira is one of Brazil's main identities not to mention soccer, Formula One, good old Brazilian coffee, and so on.  I personally bought this because I wanted to keep it in my collection as well as to enjoy their moves and awesome music.  If you want, you can zoom zoom through this dvd until chapter 13 to hear the music.  It's a school bus scene, taking the students to a field trip and in the morning, they are awakened to a beautiful surprise and the song begins, "Zoom zoom zoom capoeira mata um!" which in Portuguese means "Capoeira kills one" and the zoom zoom zoom is translated to the sound of the wind when you move your legs so fast that you can almost hear the zoom zoom zoom.
