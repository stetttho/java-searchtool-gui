 I still like the first Harry Potter better than the second and the third.  In this 3rd DVD, it's good that the story has some twists and turns.  I kept asking myself, "How in the world did Hermione appear in the classroom when she wasn't there a second ago?" But in the end of the story everything is cleared up (as most of the stories are cleared up).  Funny how there's a magical continuity from 1, 2, & 3 when at the end of each story, the mystery/problem is always solved.  There's no, "That's the end?" kind of reaction.
