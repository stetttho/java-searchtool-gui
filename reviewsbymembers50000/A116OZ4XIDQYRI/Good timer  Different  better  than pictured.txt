 A very good timer.  We needed to be able to time multiple things in the kitchen.  This timer has three separate settings, plus a clock and a count-up timer (stopwatch).  Has different beeps for each of the three timers, so you can tell which is going ringing. It's different than pictured, and I think better.  No slides to move, just a "mode" button to switch between the timers. Has a magnet on the back, so sticks nicely to the refridgerator.  Battery included!
