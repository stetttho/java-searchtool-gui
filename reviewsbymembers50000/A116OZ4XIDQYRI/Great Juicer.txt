 This juicer has been great.  It juices anything we throw at it.  Very powerful motor.  Very little vibration.  Super high quality! We've made all kinds of juices, but especially like vegetable (beets, carrots, etc.) and fruit (cherries, strawberries, etc.) mixes. The only drawback I've found is that the basket that holds the pulp is a little hard to clean.  It's not as bad as it could be, but does require a bit of time to get all the pulp out.  We've found that a vegetable (stiff bristled) brush makes this go a lot faster. I didn't rate it 5 stars because of that (somewhat hard to clean) and also that the capacity of juicing is smaller than what some people might need.  I suspect you could get about 2, maybe 3 cups of juice before having to remove the pulp.  If you wanted more you could just start over.  I can imagine for some people (or commercial operations) this would be a drawback. If I were to get another juicer, I'd definitely buy an Omega.  The quality surpasses others I have seen.
