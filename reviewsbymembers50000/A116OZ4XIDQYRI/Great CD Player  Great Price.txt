 Amazing, such a great CD player for a hundred dollars! A couple of notes:  This unit does not have a remote, nor does it have a headphone jack.  The next model up, the CDP CE375 has both of those, but otherwise these two models are exactly the same. Has a neat disc exchange function so you can change disks while a CD is playing. Has all the expected displays (time on a track, time left on a track, time left on the disk, which disk playing, songs left on CD) It's great, if you're looking for a CD player, and aren't an audiophile perfectionist (read: don't want to spend [a lot of money] for a CD player), then buy this one!
