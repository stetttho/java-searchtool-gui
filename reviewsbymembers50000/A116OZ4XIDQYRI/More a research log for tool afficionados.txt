 The book was not what I expected.  Turns out that it's mostly about the author's exploration to find out where the screw came from.  But that's only about 30% of the book.  The rest is investigations into other tools, and the author's discussion of his investigation. I'd definitely recommend this book for someone who was interested in tools, especially old tools, and for someone who is interested in the history of tools. It is not, however, a technical book on screws, or even tools for that matter.  Light easy reading.
