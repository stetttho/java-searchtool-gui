 I set up these speakers in a home theater.  the price was right, but the sound wasn't.  While they were certainly passable, and allowed you to hear the movie in surround sound, or listen to music, in comparison to other speakers they just aren't good enough. The sound from the main speakers was "muddy", lacked clarity and brightness. The subwoofer was distracting: not transparent and was clearly audible as a different speaker. ...  I would only consider these if you were on an extremely tight budget and this was all you could spend.
