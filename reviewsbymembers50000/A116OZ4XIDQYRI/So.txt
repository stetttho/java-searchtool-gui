 Yeah, RCW puts forth a good hypothesis about life, consciuousness and communication.  But, when I finished the last page and put the book down, I said "So?". The book really didn't leave me with anything to think about. The characters were shallow (probably have to be in a book this thin).  I never really got to know anyone, even the protagonist. A short book. An easy read.  Read it if you're into RCW's books, or if you want a short, planetary exploration diversion. But don't expect too much.
