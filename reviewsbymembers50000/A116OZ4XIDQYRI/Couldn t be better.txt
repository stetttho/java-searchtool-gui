 This cable modem couldn't have been easier or better.  I have had it for almost a year, and it was worked every day with not one glitch. Speeds are fantastic.  I check the speed using broadband measuring tools (like at 2wire.com), frequently, and the modem has performed consistently above the level I expect with my contract.  (of course speeds are mostly determined by the cable company and the number of people on my part of the system). A quality piece of equipment!
