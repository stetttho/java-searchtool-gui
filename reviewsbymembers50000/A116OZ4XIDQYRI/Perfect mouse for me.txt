 I like a slightly larger mouse, and one that is shaped for my hand.  This mouse really fits that bill! I tried the Logitech MX500, and it just didn't fit my hand right, and gave me wrist strain.  This one is a dream, with no problems at all. I've used a Microsoft Intellimouse (original ones) for years, and they were great.  But one died and I had to replace it.  So I got one of these (after trying the Logitech) and liked it so much I bought two!  It's even better than the original. The wireless feature is nice, but not essential. Buttons are very customizable, even being able to make a button do an arbitrary keystroke. Wheel is just right with no problems of accidentally clicking it when scrolling with it. I use the side buttons less than I thought I would, but I guess they may take some getting used to. I have had no problems with responsiveness, and find the software makes it easy to tune the mouse's reactions. If this mouse broke, I'd immediately get another one just like it.
