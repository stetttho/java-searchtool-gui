 I looked at all the different cases for my new iPod with video, and the reviews kept pointing me back to this case.  So I bought it.  it exceeds my expectations.  It's fantastic.  My ipod is now completely contained and scratchproof.  This helps when down the road I might want to sell it.  The screen cover is perfectly clear and seems very durable.  I like the fact that it's held off of the ipod's screen so it won't scratch.    The clickwheel is easily usable, actually more so because of the circle around it.  I bought the case on Amazon from SonicSwap and am astounded at how fast I got it.  2 days! Amazing.  This case is for the 60GB iPod with Video.  It clearly says that in the title; not sure how that one reviewer got confused about that.  Don't hesitate.  This is THE case!
