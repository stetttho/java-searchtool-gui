 King of Snake is a beautiful song from the Underworld. The original version of the song is long and very well layered. The remixes on this disc have a more upbeat feel. The Barking mix is by far the stand out track on this disc. It is loaded with a bunch of samples that aren't in the original version and it gives the song a silly feeling. Plus this disc has the video for the Barking Mix. The video is great. It is three different videos in one. The best part is watching the guy dressed as snake in his daily routine. Plus the live clips are sweet. If your an Underworld fan, this disk is a must have.
