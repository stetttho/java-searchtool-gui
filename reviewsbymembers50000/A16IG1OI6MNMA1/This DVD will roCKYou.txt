 This DVD is the absolute best Band DVD ever made. This is every CKY fan's dream. The DVD contains videos for all 10 tracks off of CKY's IDR album. And each video has a "Making of Documentary" as well as optional commentary from the band. And there are several Easter Eggs hidden throughout the DVD. You also get videos for 96 Quite Bitter Beings and Disengage the Simulator off of Volume 1. Each video is well crafted and all fit the song their for perfectly. My Favorite videos are Escape from Hellview, Sink into the Underground, Shock & Terror, and Sporadic Movement.  But all are good. And all are in beautiful Dolby 5.1 sound.   The bonus DVD or disc 2 is called Chopped & Sliced. It is really a 3-hour montage of the whole CKY crew doing what they do. There is no real structure to this DVD. There is a ton of live footage from CKY's last tours as well as some stuff from the Boom Boom Huck Jam. Plus there is stuff in the studio, backstage, hanging with fans, hotel rooms, on the tour bus, there are even a few fan interviews. If you've been to a CKY show within the past year, chances are you'll see footage from that show on this DVD. There are also some funny random scenes of just crazy stuff. Bam, Bran, Raab, Dunn, Rake, Jenn, Phil and Ape all make appearances through out.  This is the best band DVD I have ever seen. This DVD was made for their fans, The Alliance. Buy it Now! Watch it often. Spread the word and remember the mission: Infiltrate, Destroy, Rebuild.
