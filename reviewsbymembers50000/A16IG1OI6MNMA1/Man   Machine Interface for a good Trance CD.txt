 This is a great trance/electronic chill album. All of the songs are pretty good. All have a very melodic vibe to them. Even if you didn't know that this was a tribute to Ghost in the Shell, you'd still probably pick up on the electronic organic theme to the music. It does give you a sense of machines producing beautiful, natural trance-like sounds. Track 4, Dave Angel's Latin Lover is hands down one of the most incredible songs I have ever heard. It is so rich with sound, eerie samples and a great beat. I wish it were longer than 4 & a half minutes. If you dig some of the other electronic Ghost in the Shell soundtracks, then definitely get this one. If you dig electronic/trance/organic vibe music, this is a good buy.
