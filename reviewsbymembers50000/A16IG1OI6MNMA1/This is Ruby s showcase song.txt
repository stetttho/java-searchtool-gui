 This CD single is not too bad. Paraffin is my favorite song off of Ruby's first full length album, Salt Peter. The remixes on this CD are pretty good, except track 3.         Track 1 is good, but has a much slower beat than the original. Track 2 is just a radio edit. Nice and short but still good stuff. Track 3 I didn't care for. It is purposely off beat, feels too trippy and has way too much reverb. Track 4 is awesome. It has a very southern blues acoustic riff. It is a very nice departure from the normal Ruby sound. This song is the standout track of this CD. Track 5 is the same version that appears on the album for the song Heidi. If you dig Ruby, buy this CD for track 4 if nothing else. It's worth it.
