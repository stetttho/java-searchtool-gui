 My Favorites of the New Jedi Order are the first 3, Vector Prime, Onslaught Ruin, and this one, Traitor. The first 3 are great Star Wars novels, action packed with a darker theme to them. This book, Traitor, is the best Novel out of all of the New Jedi Order books so far. This is a Novel. By far it is the best written Star Wars book. And for a Star Wars book, it is very bleak and harsh. 	The book is about Jacen Solo. And it is not just a story about events that happen to him, but an in depth look into the psyche of his character as well as a journey that will define who he is and who he is to become. Vergere is his guide/teacher along the way. She is the bird-like old school Jedi from Rouge Planet. Vergere's intent, friend or foe, is never really made clear until almost the end. She is crueler to Jacen than any Yuuzhan Vong torture could be. But she is also more caring to him than any Yuuzhan Vong is capable. She teaches Jacen through deception, pain & desolation what the true meaning of the Force is. Through her cruel lessons and heartfelt help, Jacen learns what being a real Jedi is all about. But once he comes to grips with his newfound insight into the Force and the Yuuzhan Vong, what side will he choose to fight for: The Yuuzhan Vong, who have taught him to embrace pain and give in to their will. Or will he choose to be a Jedi and fight to repel the Vong from the galaxy? 	 Through out the NJO series, Jacen has been subdued. In this book, contrary to his ideals, Jacen opens up a big can of Jedi whoop-[butt]. He proves that he can fight and fight well. The only other Jedi in this book is Ganner. Ganner has one of the best action sequences in this entire series. And Ganner literally becomes a legend to the Vong and the Jedi because of his prowess with a lightsaber.  	I enjoy this book so much because it is unlike all of the other NJO books. If you enjoy Star Wars, this is a MUST READ.
