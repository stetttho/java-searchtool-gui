 X the TV show is a wonderful, well thought out anime that is both intelligent and action packed.      This is the pivotal DVD in the X series. Kamui chooses what side he is going to fight for. This makes Fuma's choice for him. And once that happens, Fuma wastes no time. The actions he takes will forever alter Kamui's life. And certainly alter the future of the world.        X, up to this point has been beautiful and surreal. The episodes on this DVD change the mood of the show. And sets a new darker tone for the remainder of the series. The events that occur in this one are harsh and cruel. But then again this show is about the end of the world.
