 I love this CD Anthology. It showcases some of the Underworld's best songs. It also has some very hard to find tracks like the 12 minute plus Spikee, the beautifully sad & mellow 8 ball, an unreleased extended version of Push Upstairs and the harmonica driven Big Mouth. All of the songs on this 2 CD set are wonderful. If you are curious about the Underworld or you are a die hard, buy this Anthology.                      But do not buy it for the DVD if you live in North America. The DVD is region 2 encoded. That is the only reason I give this version 4 out of 5 stars. Without a region free DVD player, chances are you won't be able to watch it. Which is really too bad because it contains the Videos for Jumbo and Push Upstairs. Both are excellent videos and both are hard to come by. If you can view region 2 encoded DVDs, then buy this version of the Anthology. The DVD is worth the extra money. If you can't view region 2 stuff, I would recommend getting the regular version of this Anthology set. It is significantly cheaper. 	If you enjoy the Underworld, this is a great way to experience their music. This is a wonderful sample of the music they have made over the past decade. Put this CD in, sit back and let it take you where it takes you. The Underworld doesn't create songs so much as they create beautiful art that you can listen to.
