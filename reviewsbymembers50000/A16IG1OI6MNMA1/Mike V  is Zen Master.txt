 This is one of the best sk8 videos I ever. Mike V is truly a deep, thoughtful, talented, dedicated, tough, sk8er. This video drives that home. It follows Mike on a criss-cross journey around the USA and other countries, on a mission to "promote skating as a positive form of creative Self expression". The skating is great. Mike V does some sick tricks. He has one of the most unique styles around. Nobody does the stuff he does. But he also is one of the most thoughtful and insightful sk8ers around. All of the scenes are voiced over with his thoughts and perceptions about sk8ing and life in general. He takes the time to drive down to Florida to visit a fan with cancer. He drives his own car 1000+ miles to go meet & hang out with a child that may not live long enough to ever sk8 again. And he does it simply because he wanted the kid to have a positive experience about sk8ing and a chance to make one day in his life better.	Mike V. is dedicated to his beliefs on a level that few people can even perceive let alone achieve.  The cinematography is gorgeous. The music is good. The sk8ing is rad. Buy this DVD if you like Mike V. Buy this DVD if you like Sk8ing. Buy this DVD if you simply want to watch something that makes you want to deepen your convictions, whatever they may be.
