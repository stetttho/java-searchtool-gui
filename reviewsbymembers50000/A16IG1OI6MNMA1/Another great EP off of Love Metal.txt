 This is a great CD single/EP. There are a few different Buried Alive by Love singles out there, but this is the one you want. It has tracks you won't find anywhere else. Track 1 is great. It is a Radio edit that works. It is not chopped and sliced into a 3 minute format, but nicely shortened into a Radio friendly version. Track 2 sounds great. The live guitar is very powerful. Track 3 is what sells the CD. It is a cover of Daniel Lioneye's The Lonely Road. (Daniel Lioneye is the solo project of the guitarist from HIM.) HIM does quite a different version the song, but it sounds great thanks to Valo's dramatic vocals. Track 4, well this isn't my favorite cover HIM has ever done. It just kind of drags on for too long. 	As a bonus, you also get the video which has Juliet Lewis playing the pretty girl. The video was directed by HIM's number one fan, Bam Margera. This CD is a must for any hardcore HIM fan. If you haven't heard a lot of HIM, this CD is a great way to hear what they can do live. Buy this Buried Alive by Love single and you won't need the other  singles of this song.
