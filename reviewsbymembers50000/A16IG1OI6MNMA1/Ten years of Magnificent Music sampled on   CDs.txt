 I love this CD Anthology. It showcases some of the Underworld's best songs. It also has some very hard to find tracks like the 12 minute plus Spikee, the beautifully sad & mellow 8 ball, the original version of Dirty and the harmonica driven Big Mouth. It also has classic Underworld tunes like King of Snake, Jumbo, Born Slippy Nuxx, Dirty Epic, Dark Train, and Mmm Skyscraper I love you.  Moaner, Born Slippy Nuxx & Push Upstairs are all unique versions. Each is slightly different than the album/single versions. This makes another reason to buy this CD set. All of the songs on this 2 CD set are wonderful. If you are curious about the Underworld, buy this Anthology.  	If you enjoy the Underworld, this is a great way to experience their music. This is a wonderful sample of the music they have made over the past decade. Put this CD in, sit back and let it take you where it takes you. The Underworld doesn't create songs so much as they create beautiful art that you can listen to.
