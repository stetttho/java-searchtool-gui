 This is one crazy DVD. It is hands down one of the funniest things I have ever seen. If you haven't seen any of the CKYs before, this one is a good way to start.  It has clips and skits from the previous 3 CKYs and Jackass. But it has tons of new skits too. One of the funniest new skits is the "Skeletor & Beastman" video. There is also a Trailer for Bam's Haggard. The music in this one is great. Lot's of HIM and Lots of CKY(The Band). Plus there is a whole segment with CKY doing a G.G. Allen cover live and Chad going to G.G.'s grave. There are a ton of Easter Eggs hidden in it also. If you like Bam Margera and the rest of the CKY crew, You must buy this. Buy it now. Watch it often. It keeps getting better ever time I see it.
