 This video is from Ministry's 1990-1991 tour. This video is basically exactly what it says. "Just in case you didn't feel like showing up", this video was made to give you the Ministry Live experience in the safety of your own home. I have seen Ministry live a few times and this video does them justice in capturing the raw energy of their live shows. Standout songs on this include Burning Inside, Thieves, The Land of Rape and Honey with Jello Biafra, Breathe and Stigmata. Chris Connelly from Revco & Nivek Oger from Skinny Puppy are both on this video. Al Jourgensen Live, well let's just say he is a commando hill-billy ready to rock your [butt] off and scare the [stuff] out of you along the way. If you like Ministry, you already own this. If you want to see how a real Rock/Metal/Industrial band rocks out live, then buy this.
