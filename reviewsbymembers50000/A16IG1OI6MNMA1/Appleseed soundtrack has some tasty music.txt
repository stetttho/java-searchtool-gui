 This is a great Anime Soundtrack. This is a killer anime itself, but the soundtrack really drives across the whole man/machine theme of the movie with tons of great electronic music. All of the major songs you here in the movie are on CD 1. Disk 2 is your basic movie score. Disc 2 to be honest, kind of bored me. There is really nothing there that stands out. It is fairly run of the mill orchestra music. On Disk 1, the stand out track is hands down the Boom Boom Satellites "Dive for You." But really all the songs here by Boom Boom Satellites rock. Paul Oakenfold's Burn Attack is a nice DJ style techno song & Basement Jaxx's Good Luck is a house/dance anthem you can picture being blared in a underground dance club in New York. Atom's White car has a nice combination of crazy beats overlaid with each other very subtly. All in All, Disc 1 is a great electronica/techno/trance/house/dance CD. Disk 2 is bland but necessary because you can't get Disk 1 without it. You could always use it as a coaster while you chill listening to the good sounds of the First Disk. If you dig electronic music or this Anime, by this. But buy the US version. The Import Version costs a ton more and you get them same music.
