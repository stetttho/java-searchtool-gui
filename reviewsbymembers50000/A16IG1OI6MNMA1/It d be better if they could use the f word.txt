 Jackass is what it is. Funny stupid stunts where someone always gets hurt. MTV took Bam Margera's CKYs and Big Brother's skate videos and turned it into mainstream chaos. It is great exposure for Bam, Johnny Knoxville, Steve-o, Random Hero and the rest of the gang. The stunts and pranks are all real. And all are really funny. This is a good DVD. The only downer is the censorship. It is the exact same as the TV show. Bleeped curse words and fuzzed out nudity.      All the crazy stuff they don'y show on TV, they don't show on here either. It is still worth it. If you want movies with real crazy funny stuff that will leave you shocked and in stiches check out CKY 1-4. And Big Brother's Poop.
