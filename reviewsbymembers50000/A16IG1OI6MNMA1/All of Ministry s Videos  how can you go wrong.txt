 This is a really cool compilation of Ministry videos. It has all of the great ones: Stigmata, Burning Inside, N.W.O., and Just One Fix. It also has some pretty rare and older Ministry videos like Over the Shoulder and The Land of Rape and Honey (Live).  Plus the Reload video is funny. Al Jourgesen dressed up like Jackie O recreating the Kennedy assassination is just bizarre.  If you're a Ministry fan and don't already own this, buy it now. You will not be disappointed.
