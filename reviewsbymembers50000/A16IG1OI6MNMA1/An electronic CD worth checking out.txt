 To keep this short and sweet: This CD is good. It is a great example of what can be done with Electronic music when a real artist puts their mind to it. Put this CD in and chill. Sit back and let it take you where it takes you. Sasha is great at expressing moods through his music. This CD is no exception to that. My favorite track is "Immortal". Good stuff.
