 This is a beautiful CD. It is a Limited Edition Tour CD from the Underworld's 2002 Australia tour. This CD has 2 discs. The first disc is A Hundred Days Off. The underworld's newest release. Also their first CD without Darren Emerson. This is the exact same album as the standard version. Nothing fancy added on this disc. But that doesn't mean it isn't good. A hundred days off is a beautiful CD. It doesn't have the same pace as other Underworld CD's, but it is still a beautiful album and certainly worthy of praise. Disc 2 has all the cool little extras. It contains the Live version of "CowGirl" from the Everything, Everything experience. It also has some cool, mellow, remixes of the first 2 singles off the new album. 2 Months Off and Dinosaur Adventure 3D. The remixes aren't the best I've heard, but still good. You can get them from other CD singles, but it is cheaper getting them on this disc. What makes this CD worth it is the CD-ROM videos. Underworld Videos, since Born Slippy, are just so crazy good. The video for 2 Months Off is beautiful. Karl dancing in the rain in some weird pool in the middle of a forest. Dinosaur 3D is crazy. It tracks a bee that flies all over a city, causing hellish wind storms with its wings.  Both videos are hard to come by in the States. This CD has both. And that added feature makes this 2 disc set a must have for all die hard Underworld Fans.
