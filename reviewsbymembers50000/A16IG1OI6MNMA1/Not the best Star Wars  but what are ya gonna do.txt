 I'm not going to go off about the cardboard acting, the bland script, the lack of any real continuity or even the over use of special effects. I'm going to tell you that the best way to view this is to turn off the adult portion of your brain and let that kid inside you come out and take over. If you don't, you'll go insane.                  This is the most action packed Star Wars yet. Tons of Jedi lightsaber action. Cool space battles and if you haven't heard yet, Yoda kicks some serious butt. The beginning is a little thrown together. And it takes a little too long to get going, but once it does, it really gets going. The action scenes are fast paced and look very cool.                 The DVD is packed with extras. The extras alone are worth the price of the DVD. If you are a die hard Star Wars fan, you already own this. If you are considering buying this, do it. You get your money's worth. But don't look for any Oscars to be awarded for acting. And don't look for deep plot. Just sit back and enjoy the show as you would have when you were a kid!
