 This CD single/Ep is pretty good. There are really only 2 songs here. The Sacrament edit is a good shortened radio version. Buried Alive by Love live is good, although it does sound rough. The Sacrament acoustic is a good song. But I feel the song sounds better the regular way. But Valo does a good job doing it acoustically. The Buried Alive by Love Deliverance mix track is quite different than the original. It has a very gruff southern blues feel to it. The Sacrament disrhythm re-mix is a very grand & dramatic version of the song.  	As a bonus, you get the video as a CD enhanced extra. The video is filled with wonderful cinematography. It was directed by HIM's number 1 fan, Bam Margera. If you are a hardcore HIM fan, than this CD is a great buy. If you haven't heard much by HIM, this CD is a great way to check out some alternate versions of songs off of their newest album, Love Metal.
