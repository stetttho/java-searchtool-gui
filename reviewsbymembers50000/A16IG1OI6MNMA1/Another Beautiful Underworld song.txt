 This is a great Underworld CD single. I feel this is the best song off of their newest album. Karl's voice and lyrics really shine on this song. This single contains the radio edit version (4 minutes long instead of 9). It has a couple of Remixes which are good and solid. I Like the Vocal mix more if I had to choose between the 2. This also has the Album version. This is nice because you can enjoy the remixes and the original on the same disc. If you are an Underworld Fan, buy this CD.
