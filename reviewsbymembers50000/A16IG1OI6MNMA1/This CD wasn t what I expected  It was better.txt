 To get to the point, this is a really good CD. I expected a gothic sounding band like 69 Eyes, HIM or even The Sisters of Mercy, all of which I rather enjoy. While the CD does have a gothic feel to it, it would be a hindrance to label this as a goth CD. It is in fact so diverse in feeling that I wouldn't label it anything other than just plain good. 	 It gives off a very cool, jazzy, melancholy vibe. This CD is great mood music. To me, it has a very stylish feeling that creates both despondent and sublime moods. Each track is very well crafted. The Weeping Willows have a very unique robust sound, which is saying something in this day and age of pop star crap. The tracks I like best are Touch me and Falling. If I ever wanted to go to a Rat Pack styled gin joint and drink my woes away, this is the band I would want playing there. They would bring me down and yet make me realize that everything is copasetic in the end.
