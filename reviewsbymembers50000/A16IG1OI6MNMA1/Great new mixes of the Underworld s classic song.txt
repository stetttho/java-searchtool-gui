 This CD is great. It is only 3 songs long, but each track is wonderful. The Rick Smith remix is funky. It uses a lot of actual piano sampled and looped. It gives the song a very melodic vibe without losing the pounding drum beats. The Atomic Hooligan mix is trippy. It feels like listening to Born Slippy on headphones while floating in outer space. Good Stuff. Paul Oakenfold's mix is very dark and moody. It has incredible sounds and a very vivid beat. This is a great CD for Underworld fans or for anyone who likes Born Slippy.
