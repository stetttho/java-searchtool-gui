 This is the funniest movie I have seen in years. This is Bam Margera's first "Real" Movie (CKYs 1-4 rock). He co-wrote, directed, filmed, starred, and bankrolled the whole thing. That's what makes this movie so great. It was done by real people. The whole CKY crew stars in it, plus tons of cameos from the skate world. 	The movie is based off of Ryan (Random Hero) Dunn's real life love life. He plays the main character that has just been dumped by his girlfriend, "Glauren" (Jenn Rivell). He thinks she is the best woman in the world but everyone else knows she is the town jezebel. Ryan can't get over her and starts to freak out when he finds out she is dating a guy named "Hellboy" (Rake Yohn). His friends Valo (Bam) and Falcone (Bran DiCamillo) are there to vandalize, spy and plot against Glauren and Hellboy while Ryan goes nuts pining away for her. Tony Hawk plays a cop who busts Ryan. Jason Ellis plays a crazed record store employee who tries to annihilate Hellboy. Bucky Lasek, Brandon Novak, Tosh Townsend, Hoofbite, and even Bam's grandfather all have cameo roles in it.  	The cinematography is really cool. The dialogue is so twisted funny. The music is great. Lots of -HIM-, CKY and good old fashioned death metal. Plus the bonus stuff is just as good as the movie. If you are a Bam fan, a CKY fan, even a HIM fan, buy this movie! Buy 2 copies incase you break one from laughing to hard. -roCK You-
