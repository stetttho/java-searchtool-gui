 This is a pretty cool anime. I went in with low expectations. The story isn't that original at first: Vampire Hunter who is a Vampire? Sound familiar? But after watching this first DVD, I was really impressed. So Impressed that I got the other 3 DVDs.        The main character, Alucard (That's Dracula backwards) is very cool and stylish. He is a ruthless killer and his methods of execution are very distinct. He works for the Hellsing organization. A group dedicated to keeping England Vampire free except for Alucard of course. He takes a cop and makes her a Vampire, really for his own amusement. The two become partners so to speak and work together for the rest of the show.         The animation is top notch. The action is good but brief. Very Alfred Hitchcock. The music is also quite good. I had a chance to meet the voice actor who does the voice work for Alucard, Crispin Freeman. He is a terrific voice actor.  If you like his work here, check out these titles X, Chobits, Read or Die and The Big O.  Hellsing is a great Anime. I would buy this one first. If you dig it, go out and get the other 3 right away.
