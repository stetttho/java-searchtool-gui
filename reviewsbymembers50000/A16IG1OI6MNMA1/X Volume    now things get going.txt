 X is a beautiful, well thought out anime. The imagery can be dark but it can also be very serene. This anime offers a very interesting view about the end of the world and the notions of preordained fate. It is like watching a true gothic masterpiece unfold over a 24-episode time span. X is a perfect balance of heart pounding intense action and very smart intellectual drama. The previous 4 volumes are great. But so far, this one is my favorite. All the events in the previous 4 volumes lead to the events in this volume. This DVD is the turning point of the saga. Both Kamui and Fuma have made their choice of who to fight for. Now the real battle for the fate of the world and all of mankind can truly begin. If you like X, buy this DVD.
