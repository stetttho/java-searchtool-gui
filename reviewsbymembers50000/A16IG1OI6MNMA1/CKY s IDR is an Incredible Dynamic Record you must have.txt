 This CD is one of the best CD's I've heard in a long time. The music is so well put together. This is a band that really puts effort into their work. The 10 tracks are great. Each song is a masterpiece. Not a single one is filler or thrown together slop used just to fill space. Each song has a different vibe to it but they all mesh together to form a sonic event. Deron and Chad's guitar work is so expressive and unique. Jess' drumming is solid and stylish. And Vern live is a trip! Standout tracks like 'Escape From Hellview', 'Flesh Into Gear' & 'Plastic Plan' are just damn great. Get this album now and if you don't have it, get Vol. 1 too. Then go see them live. Support the Mission!
