 To the point: This was the last great film that Joan made before those really forgettable 'B' films. Joan was pushing it when she came back as a younger version of Lucy. But her campy character somehow pulls it off so that you can't help but be mesmerized by her. There are many faults in the plot, but who cares when you see Joan acting so hard for all her fans.It's funny when Bette Davis said : 'Joan was accused of using a Baby Hudson Doll in promoting 'Whatever Happened to Baby Jane,' and now she is touring the god dammed country with her axe!! You can see Straight Jacket over and over again and it continues to bring a wicked smile to your face.God bless you, Joan!
