 From an honest audience point of view : I can't believe how rough the story line is and that it still got away from the critics. I wouldn't classify this as a musical, it is simply a film with a few great old songs thrown between the scenes. Nicole looks great and posseses a passable singing voice. The same can be said about Ewan who is well chosen for his part, but his high note became a bit irritating after awhile. But inspite of all this negative criticism, I found the film is visually exciting. I will definitely see it again and again.
