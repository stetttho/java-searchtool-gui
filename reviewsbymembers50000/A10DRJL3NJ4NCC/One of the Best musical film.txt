 Pity this fantastic film didn't get any Oscars that it deserves. The songs, the acting, the production are just flawless. In the specail features Susan Stroman's commentary is the best by far, it is so detailed and well planned unlike other's who made comments as they go along.The deleted scenes are not to miss!
