 to the point - It's a long, long time since I heard a score in which every single song is a gem. Mr Brooks (The King of Broadway 2001 ) your work is great and I hope you listen to your wife and write more musicals. Every cast, song,and production can be summed up in one word : classic. Hope we Brits will see the original cast with Matthew Broderick, Nathan Lane in London.
