 Why haven't the Disney people learned to improve the storyline of all their sequels? Even though it is not a long featured cartoon demanding drawing that is not very detailed, that we can tolerate. But Cinderella doesn't look like the original classic at all! If Peter Pan II is going follow its example, I am never going to believe the Disney's people again!! Fans over the world have paid their price and it's time for sequels writers to get their act together.
