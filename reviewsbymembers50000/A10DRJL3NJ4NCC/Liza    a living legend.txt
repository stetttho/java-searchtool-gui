 To the point : A classic collaboration between Liza and the composer Kander and Ebb. Two extra songs - Money, Money and Maybe This Time - were written for the film version. But eight songs were cut out from the show that I urged you to hear either in the original Broadway show or the recent revival which is equally good. Cabaret is also avalible in DVD, so not only can you hear Liza's fantastic singing but see her Oscar performance in Cabaret. Liza is a legend on her own , every show she's done is to perfection . Just hope Amazon.com will carry more of her CD's like Liza live from the Radio City Music Hall, Minnelli on Minnelli etc.
