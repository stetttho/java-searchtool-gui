 The Rescuers is Disney's most underrated work! It was the last great feature film before what became a strings of forgettable works like The Black Cauldron, The Great Detective, Oliver and Company in which the Disney studio was trying to break into new ground but somehow was unable to find the right formula.It wasn't until The Little Mermaid that Disney Studio has reclaimed it's number one position as the world's greatest cartoon creator.Having said that, The Rescuers Down Under- produced after The Little Mermaid - is a thorough disappointment, both in its story and in its style of drawing. This always seems to be the curse of sequels! The Rescuers, however, has all of the Disney's magic! Medusa is possibly one of the greatest of Disney's villains, yet somehow she doesn't catch on as did the others.T he only criticism I would make is the opening of The Rescuers. It seemed that the studio had run out of money when they were doing the opening scene, for all we have is a collage of storybook sketches from an artist's impression.
