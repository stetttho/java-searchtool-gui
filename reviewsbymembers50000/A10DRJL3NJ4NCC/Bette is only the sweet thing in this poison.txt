 To the point : There is no doubt that Bette Davis is the greatest actress in the world. She was at the right time and the right place, and above all she was talented. Meryl Streep have the same kind of success that Bette had,unfortunately we don't have too many great roles today for great actress like Streep. For you fans, I think you won't find any meat to sink your teeth in Another Man's Posion. If you really want to see Bette's best performance apart from the obvious like All about Eve, Dark Victory, Now Voyager, etc Maybe you should see Mr Skeffington, Dead Ringer, The Anniversary or even Beyond Forest Bette's last film with Warner which she thought was really bad.But, apart form miscasting Joseph Cotten, Bette can turned a bad film to a watch-able one. ...
