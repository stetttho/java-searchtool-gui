 The Kander and Ebb songs shine in this film album and the film was very enjoyable - like meeting an old friend. Barbra looks so sexy in the 'Great Day' number. Who else could sing 'More Than You Know' and 'How Lucky Can You Get' as well as Barbra. But the music and words of  'If I Should Love Again' are tops! Thank you, Kander and Ebb.
