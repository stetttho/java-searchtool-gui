 To the point - I was lucky enough to be there on this once-in-a-life-time event. Tina Arena did the most difficult task by opening the show. But what a spotless performance!! To hear and see Donny Osmond and Antonio Banderas was another treat! Michael Ball really put gusto into the songs'Vaults of Heaven'and 'Gethsemane'. But when Glenn Close appeared, her presence filled the entire Albert Hall and apart from Andrew LLyod Webber the night belongs to her!
