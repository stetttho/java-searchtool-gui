 To the point: Bea Arthur - the living legend of TV and stage. Bea has also got a very distintive, magentic alto voice that has been overshadowed by her comic and acting gifts. But finally you can listen to this cd which she sings some songs from the Broadway tunes like Bosom Buddies ( which she created the role of Vera Charles in Mame ), Some People ( which she would be great as Mama Rose ), And Then There's Maude ( The title song from one of her hit tv series ).For the unlucky few like me who didn't catch her show on Broadway at least we can visualize from listening to the cd how great the show must have been and pray that a DVD of the show will eventually be produced.
