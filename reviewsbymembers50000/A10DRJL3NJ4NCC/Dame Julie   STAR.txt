 To the point - Not a lot of musical will make it form film to stage or visa versa. But Victor Victoria made it on film and on stage. I don't travel as much nowadays but for this show I flew to Broadway to see it and it was worth it. I am glad it's on DVD now and the production is so good, the camera angles is done so well that you can see all the things you missed the first time round. Only Julie can do this part so well.Great book from Blake Edwards,wonderful lyrics by Leslie Bricusse and great songs by Henry Mancini.
