 from an audience point of view To the point - Don't be fooled by the cover, Joan's part in this film is only that of a supporting role. The film was ok and so were the three other girls. (Diane Baker had made another film with Joan in 1964 called Strait Jacket in which she had a better part ).Privately Joan lost her husband during this period so she was still in recovery, but that didn't affect her acting, after all she was a real pro.
