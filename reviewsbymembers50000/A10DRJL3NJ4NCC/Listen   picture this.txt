 Ebay + cheap Golden Girls copies = disappointment.A Golden Girl's fan warned me - Careful of the vcd copies especially the one made in Asia.It looks like the real ones with packaging and everything but the vcd jumps and some doesn't even play.Better stick and buy the great Golden Girls second season from Amazon. www.tanphotos.co.uk/londonupdate.htm
