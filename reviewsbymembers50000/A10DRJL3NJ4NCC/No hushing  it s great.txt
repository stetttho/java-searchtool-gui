 I nearly didn't buy this dvd because I have a vhs copy. But I am gald I did just the commentary by film historian Glenn Erickson is worth getting this dvd ( but correct me if I am wrong Mr Erickson it was 'Hotel' the tv pilot that Ms Davis was in and not the other tv series that you mentioned in your commentary ) .Great acting by Ms Davis as usual what a pity Ms Crawford turned down this film.
