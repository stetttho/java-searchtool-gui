 To the point: There is music, dance, comedy! What more could you want from this Blake  Edward's classic! The more I see this film, the more I appreciate how cleverly the Broadway team changed this film into a Broadway show or how certain lines or scenes were fit into the Broadway musical like a seamless work of art. In addition to Julie, in this film there was Robert Preston and James Gardner, Lesley Ann Warren, all of whom contribute to this film's successful chemistry.Oh how I love this crazy film!! And Robert Preston! What an actor! What a voice! We will so miss you!! Check out Robert Preston in The Music Man.
