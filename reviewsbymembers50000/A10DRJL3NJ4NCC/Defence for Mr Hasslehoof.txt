 To the point - After reading most of Amazon's unfavorable reviews of Jekyll and Hyde, I decide to buy a copy and judge for myself. Even though I am not a Hasselhoff fan, I must admit his performance is not bad at all. As for his singing I think he does all right. In fact, he does very well for all the songs. There is only one exception: the spine tinkling forever-classic song, 'This is The Moment,' during which Hasselhoof is disappointing. This is a pity for most people will judge him on that number alone. The score by Leslie Bricusse and Frank Wildhorn is beyond words. I am so grateful that this DVD has been filmed so that less unfortunate audiences outside of the US will have a chance to see how wonderful this production is. As for the cynicals: if you were the investors, I am sure you would do the same and bank on Hasslehoof's name. To be honest, I really think he has proven that he can do it. I only wish he stopped reminding us about Bay Watch and move on.
