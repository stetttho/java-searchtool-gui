 To the point : Hollywood thought the film Mommie Dearest might embellish Joan's reputation, but after seeing the film I have more respect for this legendary actress than ever. If the story was true, then one can only say that there was only miscommunication between the actress and the daughter and that Joan was too busy as an actress to be a good mother. From the film Joan came across as: (1) a professional actress who cared for work and fans. This should teach some now-a-day actresses a thing or two.  (2) a disciplinary mother (with some of the kids you see these days, you would agree with giving them an old fashion spank on the behind). (3) a cleaning freak - a bit of Harriet Craig at times, but that's no big deal.   The coat hangers scene was very scary especially with the Baby Jane mask on, but any lover of clothes would agreed that one should respect his or her clothes and have proper hangers for them. Faye Dunaway has done a great job for this under rated film and deserves another Oscar for her performance.
