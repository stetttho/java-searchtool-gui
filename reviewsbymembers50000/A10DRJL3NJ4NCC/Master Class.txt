 To the point : For all the would-be-actress, this is a tape you MUST have. Just study how Liza performs, her timing in everything is so perfect! As one of the reviewers observed: Liza is 'the perfect definition' of what a diva should be. Everything she does in this show is so well rehearsed; yet it appears so effortless! This is the true mark of a legend. I never liked the song 'Imagine' until I heard Liza's rendition of it.
