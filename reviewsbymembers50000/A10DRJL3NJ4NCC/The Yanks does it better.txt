 I saw the London's show but the cast of this US production is way better.Apart from the cast, special praise to the director, Editor, Camera man who captured the show so brillantly at different angles. Just watch the number ' I wanna Be A Dancin' Man' and you will know what I mean. I am sure Ms Gwen Verdon will be so proud about this production. What a way to show what a great talent Fosse is.
