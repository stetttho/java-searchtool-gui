 I was introduced to this tea through my mother-in-law, a retired nurse/devotee who swears by its purported powers in aiding digestion (and settling stomachs).  While I can't say that I experienced any particular benefits in that area, I fell in love with its warm, spicy taste. If you like ginger, this tea is simple, singular, and delicious, a brew that begs the wind to howl and the snow to fall while you cozy up with it.  Add a little honey and you almost won't mind having a sore throat as an excuse to drink it.  It's strong if you steep as long as the manufacturer suggests, but that is up to you.  I love that it's ingredients are so pure, and though I'm not sure that it actually HEALS the body, it FEELS like it does, and that's half the fun.
