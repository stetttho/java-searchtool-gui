 This is a great idea, no mess, no hassle, and your kid is a perfect artist every time.  My 3 year old gets frustrated when she can't color in the lines or draw perfectly, but she feels pretty special when beautiful flowers and designs come to life beneath her water marker.  The 4 sheets and single marker are small, perfect for travel, and they dry pretty quickly, clearing portions of the picture to be refilled again.  My only complaint is that the sheets aren't a little thicker and connected together--I think they will crumple, though not tear, with time.  But all in all, I plan to order more in other designs.  Clever.
