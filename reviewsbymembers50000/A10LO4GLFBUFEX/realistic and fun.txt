 This is a cute and entertaining little phone that my 3.5 year old LOVES.  It looks like my Nokia, only it's pink with changing holographic pictures in place of the screen.  Depending on how you tilt the phone, our version (there are 2) has Hello Kitty dressed as a Steve Erwin type figure standing next to a crocodile; a cowboy in front of a cactus and a cow; and in a sailor suit with a leaping dolphin behind her.  I had no idea Kitty got around so much.    The numbers on the phone all make a realistic tone sound, and the scroll, hang up, and call buttons ring or say little messages like, "Hello, leave a message at the sound of the beep."  These messages have become my husband's and my favorite feature of the phone, because it is quite obvious that they were recorded in Kitty's home country by someone with a strong accent.  The one I mentioned, for example, sounds more like a monotone, "Herrow, reeve message afta da sound a da beep.  Ba-bye."     My daughter has been playing with this pretty consistently for almost a year now, carting it around with its phone book in a really cute Hello Kitty face purse (also available on Amazon) with a matching wallet and plenty of Kitty jewelry.  This has proved to be her favorite toy set his year by far.   After all this play though, the phone is beginning to lag.  The batteries are replaceable, but it's also a little banged up, so I will probably just buy her a new one.  All in all, well worth it.
