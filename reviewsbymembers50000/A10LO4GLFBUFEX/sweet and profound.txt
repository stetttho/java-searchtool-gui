 Because "A Snoodle's Tale" is different in character and appearance to other VeggieTales productions, I was a little reluctant to try it.  But it has actually turned out to be a favorite of both my daughter's and mine.  Softer colors and a rhyming dialogue makes this gentle and appealing to younger Veggie fans (think Dr. Seuss) without excluding the older ones, and the message, far from being a modern clich of "just like yourself," is both sweet and profound.  The little snoodle who is the hero of the tale is weighed down heavily by the demeaning pictures other snoodles have paint of him, so much so, in fact, that he is unable to fly.  But eventually he learns that letting go of other's opinions and carrying only his creator's portrait of him makes him so light he can not only fly, but soar.  He, in turn, gives his creator a picture he has painted, and the creator is so pleased, he puts it on his fridge.  I actually got a little teary at one point.    My daughter and her friends of various ages love this story, as they do the rhyming Veggie version of the Good Samaritan, which is also included on this DVD.  Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde is amusing, too, though not, I think, as much as the special feature home movie footage included of Mike Nawrocki practicing the gourd dance all alone in his living room.         All in all a creative, solid, amusing, touching venture.  A better experiment than Larry Boy, in my opinion, and I hope they produce other Snoodle tales.
