 We bought this for my daughter when she was 18 months old, and now, almost a year later, I can see that it was one of the best investments we have made in toys.  This set has grown with her, from interesting noise and music maker to inspiring genuine make-believe play.  As she has discovered and explored different aspects of daily life in our home-the phone, computer, washing machine, etc, she has transferred them to her dollhouse.  The most recent and handy, in my opinion, has been her teaching the daddy and mama figures to "go potty" in the little bathroom that comes complete with a flush sound affect when you put the lid down.  I don't find the sound effects annoying, and though we leave it on all the time I have never had to replace the batteries.  Word to the wise: the "play center" they advertise is actually a little walker type chair (I thought it was a playpen or something), but my daughter loves it because she uses it as a highchair, so the whole family can sit around the table together.  And the rumors are true-adults like it, too.  A couple of my single friends came over right after we got it, and I walked in the living room to find both of them cross legged on the floor, pushing buttons, opening doors, and making various assorted comments about how much better today's toys are then when they were kids.  My daughter, by the way, was taking a nap at the time.  (:  This is one of the few toddler games I can enjoy for more than a few minutes with my little girl.  She also has the minivan and I have just purchased the playground as well.  I love that there are no small parts to worry about with these sets, but they are nevertheless detailed and complete.  All in all, cozy, durable, enduring fun.  Highly recommended.
