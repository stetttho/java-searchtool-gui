 This is a great addition to a Clifford collection, with nothing remotely scary or questionable.  The episodes include  Camping it up Hooray for Cleo Home is Where the Fun Is Lights Out    Which all emphasize enjoying nature, and  Clifford's Charm School Best Paw Forward Clifford's Hiccoughs An Itchy Patch  Which generally emphases manners and being yourself.  All in all, sweet, neutral entertainment for my 3 year old, though older kids would enjoy it too.
