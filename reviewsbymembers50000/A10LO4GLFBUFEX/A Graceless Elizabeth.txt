 I wanted to like this movie, and I was prepared to accept a less than strict adaptation of the book, but I couldn't forgive the ridiculously indecorous little additions to a work based so heavily on the complexities of manner and conduct in Austenian society.  I didn't mind the family's poorness being enhanced to bring understanding to a modern audience of the wide breach between Bennett and Darcy, but I thought Knightly's coarse, greasy banged version of the subtle and witty Elizabeth went beyond the boundaries of "youthful" or "exuberant" and marched straight into the realms of the just plain inelegant.  For example, who thought it would be cute for Knightly to smack her food and lick her fingers at the breakfast table?  That kind of thing has nothing to do with youth or a modern adaptation--it's rude even today.  A main part of the original story was that Elizabeth and Jane had manners far superior to their family's, and were not themselves the objectionable ones.  Darcy even says as much at one point, a comment which was included in the movie's dialogue but hardly demonstrated in its acting.   Elizabeth Bennett is one of my favorite literary characters, but all the things I like the most about her, her careful cleverness, her grace under fire, her classy superiority to the huffy rudeness dealt out to her by the upper class, were all but lost in this 'sassy farm girl meets stuck up rich dude' version of Austen's infinitely more subtle work.  In truth, this movie had a lot to live up to given the success of the BBC version (a fact which can be seen in its complete omission of that now famous scene where a dripping Darcy meets a shocked Elizabeth at his estate), but in my opinion, in its effort to do so, it simply overplayed its hand.
