 I am a big fan of Richard Scary's and we have a broad collection of his "Best Ever" books and videos, but this is the single item that I feel isn't done well. First of all, it is so large it's unwieldy with even one small child in your lap. But the real problem is in the layout. There are 2 kinds of pages: a single large picture that contains small items, like a large house with characters and activities within it, or a big white sheet with 40 or 50 small individual pictures crammed in. The house type are great, but regrettably few. The majority are the second, and so cluttered that it is very difficult for younger preschoolers--much less babies--to differentiate between images. The effect is a wild cacophony of confusing colors, cars, cutlery, and emotional little pigs cluttering the pages.     My family much prefers Scary's "Best Storybook Ever." Smaller (at about 10" by 7" instead of 12" by 10") but much thicker, this book is easier to manage in size and matter. I disagree with its recommendation for only slightly older children, because it still contains colors, numbers, shapes, animals, counting, manners, emotions, activities, months of the year, and the alphabet, but this time with more spacing and order. I think all it is missing from "First Book" is body parts. A collection of little storybooks about the above subjects, it has fewer and clearer concepts per page. In addition, "Storybook" also contains 82 actual character stories for the older preschooler/younger grade-schooler, as well as a good collection of Mother Goose rhymes. "Best Storybook Ever" will grow with your child, teach your child, and entertain your child much better than "Best First Book Ever" will.
