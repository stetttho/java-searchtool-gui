 This is a truly delightful little set for the baby-preschool crowd.  There are 6 tiny, different colored board books in a box, each measuring only about 2.5" by 3".  They are eye catching and intriguing, and little fingers virtually itch to get to them.  These scaled down versions of Milne's stories, each with 5 pages of text each set across from one of Shephard's original illustrations, have been perfectly simplified for my 2.5 year olds' attention span without loosing the feeling of being real little stories. The set includes; Pooh and Some Bees, Tigger Has Breakfast, Eeyore Has a Birthday, Playing Poohsticks, Pooh Goes Visiting, and Piglet's Rescue.  A typical page reads something like this:  	Pooh pushed his way through the hole, and at last got in.  Pooh always liked a little smackerel.                         "Honey or condensed milk?" asked Rabbit. 	"Both." said Pooh.  Besides being a darling set of books, it is also a matching game, of sorts.  The reasonably sturdy box has a little nestling place for each very sturdy book, with an illustration beneath so the child can match book to character.  It's all very enchanting for a little Pooh devotee, and I feel like I stumbled onto something truly wonderful here.   This would make a perfect gift or even travel toy, as the individual books slip so easily into a purse or bag.  I also love that these are the original illustrations and stories, versus the more modern, commercialized ones.   All in all, this was a treasured find.
