 This is sweet, innocent fare, with universally good themes without being preachy.  My 3 year old is following stories now, and has added Clifford and Little Bear to her repertoire of Elmo and Blue's Clues, but her 6 and 7 year old friends still like this series. This particular DVD is one of the better ones, I think, since instead of the usual 8 episodes it has 10.  In addition to the usual lessons about friendship and good manners, there is also a story about when Clifford first gets his doghouse.  Nothing scary, nothing objectionable, just wholesome fun.   Highly recommended.
