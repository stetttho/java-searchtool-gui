 I'm pretty picky, and looked a long time before I settled on this children's bible for my 3yo.  I am so happy with my decision!  The rhythms are smooth, the stories a good length, the details just right, and the illustrations a nice balance between fun and attractive.    I feel like a lot of children's bibles either strive for too much unnecessary detail or stray too far from the original text, but I was surprised at the level of scriptural accuracy this book maintained in simple verse form (for example, the three wise men don't show up at the manger, but later when Jesus is a toddler).  I'm also pleased that difficult subject matter is handled well.  I was always upset when I was little that the pharaoh's horses drowned in the Red Sea, too, but in this version there is an underwater illustration with a horse and chariot sinking, and the horse is looking at the reader with a sort of "D'oh!" expression that makes the situation seem less intense for younger readers.  My daughter loves this book and asks me to read it for her, which is exactly what I was looking for.  I don't want to inflict religion on my daughter; I want my daughter, instead, to find and fall in love with Jesus.  This fun, well written, and well thought out children's bible is a wonderful introduction.
