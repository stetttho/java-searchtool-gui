 Susan Vreeland is fast becoming one of my favorite living authors.  Her ability to draw you quickly and seamlessly into a living moment is one of the best I have come across, and I was impressed and relieved to find that the details I found the most poignant in her historical fiction sketches were the ones she gave bibliographic references for at the end of the book.  In addition, I found her web sight containing the art pieces referenced in her stories at the beginning of my reading, and it greatly enhanced my overall experience:   http://www.svreeland.com/ls-paintings.html  In general, I found this book absorbing and vivid, but educated and relatively free from sentimentality.  She is able to change voices well from character to character, but not so abruptly and obviously that the book loses fluidity.  These chapters, each dedicated to a human life affected by a particular work of art, were saturated with reality and living detail.  Really beautifully done; I was sorry to see it end.
