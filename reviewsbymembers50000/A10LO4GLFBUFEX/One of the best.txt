 I have been waiting for this set about music to come out on DVD, and I am happy that the bonus episodes they added do not include any of the scarier Little Bear stories.  Not that Little Bear is at all frightening for the kindergarten crowd, but my preschooler does not need to be introduced to new fears (like the wind with a spooky face in "Good Night Little Bear').    This DVD contains 12 episodes that play on a loop, 4 about music, 4 about kisses, and 4 about friendship.  There is one almost irritating story where Chicken squawks a lot (it's actually pretty funny) and one particularly endearing story where Mother Bear kisses a skunk and he is overwhelmed with joy that someone would kiss his smelly self.  They are all happy and sweet and my 3 year old loves them, but I was surprised when a friend's 8 and 10 year olds came over the other day exclaimed over the DVD, "Little Bear!  He's great!"     All in all, highly recommended.
