 My daughter absolutely loved this phone.  But, like some other reviewers, we had problems with its durability.  After only a few months of gentle baby play only on car trips and in restaurants, first the green button started to stick, and then all the others stopped responding to touch.  She was crushed, and I admit I was disappointed that my magic solution to public grumpiness had abandoned me.      So now it's time for baby number 2, and, believe it or not, since it was one of the best baby toys I've seen, I am going to buy another one, fingers crossed.  I hope this one lasts longer.
