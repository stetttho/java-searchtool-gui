 I've read SF and Fantasy for over twenty years and I've watched every episode of Farscape.  There are so many discrepancies the book should be made of Swiss cheese!  I read the author's apology but really, to actually have to pay for this book is unbelievable.  I read the first 100 pages, then began to skim along through page after page of tripe.  The characterizations were iconic in their extremes.  I got really tired of all of the Crichton-isms that NEVER stopped.  D'Argo was portrayed as a mindless bloodthirsty savage, etc...  Did the author watch the show...ever?  I hope the publishers read these reviews, which have all been negative, and get a good SF writer to write the next one.  I've read so many good Star Trek novels...what about David Gerrold?  Bottom line to you other non-believers like me who thought the book couldn't be THAT bad...it is.
