 I liked Bischoff's solo material well enough to look forward to the new Farscape book, Ship of Ghosts.   What happened after I started reading was a different tale.  The book is hideous.  I had just finished reading House Harkonnen by Brian Herbert, which was a fantastic book.  Going from that to this was like going from Bugs Bunny to the Teletubbies.  Horrible and shocking.  The characterization was very off, the mannerisms of our favorite characters were over the top when they were at all accurate.  The story was boring, and I put it down a few chapters shy of the end.  I couldn't bring myself to finish it.  The previous FS book was horrid as well.   Come on, Keepers of the Farscape Franchise, let's do better next time!  They're already fleecing us by releasing only 2 episodes per DVD, this latest insult is almost too much to bear.
