 It seems strange that only Brando didn't get an award from his performance in this movie.  He was fantastic, and also in TOP shape.  He looks better than any male movie star today in this movie.  Plus his acting is great.  I  totally disagree with the guy who bought the DVD version and didn't like  it. The picture was superb.  Buy it now and thank me later.
