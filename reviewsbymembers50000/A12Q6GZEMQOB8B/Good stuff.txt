 Finally a book that has examples that WORK!!!!!!  Unlike a well known red-bound competitor, it seems that a little more QA was involved in this book.  It reads well, has concrete examples, and is written in C#.  It goes into excruciating detail on late and early binding of controls and the use of grids.   If you're a web programmer who churns out reports that draw on data from SQL Server (like the majority of us poor slobs who work for a website rather than owning one), then this book will be quite helpful.  Dot net is cool.
