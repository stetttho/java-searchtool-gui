 this is awesome that they decided to put this series on DVD so future fantasy fans can enjoy it and current ones who missed this hidden gem can see it, too.  i was so caught up with this series when it came out that i couldn't wait until the next ep came out.  none of the reviewers have commented on the fact that the star of the show, daniel goddard, is HOT.  all of you female fantasy fans out there (there are more of us than you think) will appreciate every episode of bare-chested dan.  pass the plate 'cause it is mmmmmmmm mmmmmmm good.
