 first of all, i must rebut the reviewer who wrote about this album being something that drug-using-satan-worshipping-gay-lovers would proudly chant at their club meetings.  he is  wrong!  if this is the worst your child listens to count yourselves lucky he doesn't listen to slayer or the like.  there is NOTHING on the cd about promoting a homosexual lifestyle, either.  where did he get that from?  did you LOOK at the cover with the chick on it?    this is an innovative product that is representative of the synergy that can be achieved when people of talent work together.  weiland is a RECOVERING EX-addict who looked and sounded GREAT at the dallas show.  the songs on the album talk about the issues of today rather than trying to gloss them over.  every teenage kid should run out and buy this album.
