 I bought this camera for my mother, and I was afraid that she wouldn't use it because it would be too complicated.  I have an older Olympus digital camera that is complicated to use and the software is weird, too.  My mother was emailing me Christmas pictures within an hour of unwrapping the thing!  She loves it, and I enjoy all of the photos she sends.  I only have one detraction from my review and that is the flash: it is too powerful.  I think you can set it to be lighter, though my mom hasn't read that far yet.
