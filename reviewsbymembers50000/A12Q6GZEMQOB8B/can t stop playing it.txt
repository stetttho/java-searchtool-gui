 rush has gone through a renaissance.  there are 3 phases of rush: classic, experimental/modern, and nouveau.  the latter category is a slight paradox in that their new sound heralds back to their heyday in regards to energy and replay value.  'vapor trails' and 'feedback' have a level of energy not seen since 'counterparts', a great album in its own right.   this particular album, 'feedback' are covers of timeless songs every classic rock fan will instantly recognize, and for newbie listeners it should entice them to listen to the originals.  i absolutely love alex's playing on 'summertime blues', 'the seeker', 'crossroads', and 'mr. soul'.  it is raw - full of energy and style.  any of these songs could have easily come off of the 'fly by night album' save that geddy's voice is lower these days than the banshee keening lovingly heard on the older albums.  the bottom line is that even a casual rush fan will love this album.  i thanked myself many times over when i bought it immediately.
