 I got this game for Christmas and eagerly installed it over the weekend.  I played through Chapters 1 and 2 without incident and had a GREAT time.  When I got to Chapter 3, I had no problem until after I defeated the biggest baddie in the dungeon and then saved my game.  Every time I tried to load the saved game the program would crash and my Windows desktop stared at me, mocking my frustration.  I gave a big sigh and loaded a saved game prior to the one that was obviously corrupted.   I played for about another hour, saving all the way, until I had a huge army massed (still in Chapter 3) and was leading them into battle against a horde of enemies.  As soon as both armies were on the screen, the game crashed and again the desktop was shown.  I refuse to play this game again until another patch is produced.  I have a top of the line system with a 2.6 GHz processor, 1GB of RAM, and an NVIDIA GeForce 5200 Ultra 128MB video card.  I also have no problem playing many other games, including some other Atari ones!   Avoid this game until the next patch is released.
