 i'm a madonna fan and really enjoyed her last album.  there's nothing on this one to compare to "love profusion" off of american life.  it's all shallow disco with a 16/16 beat.  the music is uninspired, dull, and repetitive.  at least the producers decided to lose the annoying pitch-shifter they have been using on vocals since cher's album "believe".  it's time to hang your pumps and ho outfit up, madonna, cause you jumped the shark with this album for me.
