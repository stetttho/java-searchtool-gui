 is the one source really the Energizer bunny?  it would seem so.  i found myself skimming through many pages of boring drivel trying to get to the next important passage that would represent an advancement of the plot.   does RJ read these reviews?  i hope so.  after 300 pages, the only time i've noticed the source used was to iron the skirts of an aes sedai.  how terribly boring.  most of the book seems to focus on neurotic women and their power struggles.  i'm skipping the next books which will also be about nothing, and i'll buy the conclusion, which will be in about 20 years.
