 i'm not a rabid maynard fan, but i will give credit where credit is due.  i disagree with a previous reviewer who said that 'nothing stands out on the cd in my opinion'.   the songs "weak and powerless," and "the noose" are wonderful songs that rival anything else out there this year.  what else do we have to choose from?  most "rock" or - and i hesitate to even use this term - "metal" bands these days cannot marry the two concepts of musical talent and meaningful lyrics to save their lives!  be honest with yourself and you will find you agree with me.  this album rocks.   buy it with confidence.   probably the most original stuff this year, albeit a little darker than britney.
