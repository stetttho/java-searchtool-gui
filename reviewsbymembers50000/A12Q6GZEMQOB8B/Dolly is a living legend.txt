 How many people can you say that about?  If you can catch any of her live shows left on her current tour, GO!!  I saw her in Dallas and she sang several songs off of this album one of which was "Halos and Horns".  Her backup band on this album is awsome, the Bluniques (sp?).  Every one of them is super-talented, only to be eclipsed by the versatile and wonderfully gifted Dolly Parton.  She plays dulcimer, accoustic guitar, electric guitar, banjo and even a harmonica!  Her voice charms and lifts you soul up.  Go Dolly!
