 I eagerly awaited the next novel from Lois set in the Barrayar world with Admiral Naismith and company only to be saddled with this load of guff.  It is worse than her last one.  I read page after page with nothing happening except to hear from Miles telling his wife how lovely she looked and how lucky he was, blah blah blah, yata yata yata.  End the series Lois, because it is going nowhere fast because it ain't moving.
