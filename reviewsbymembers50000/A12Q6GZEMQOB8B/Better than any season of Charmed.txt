 Some of the reviews are harsh for S4 of SV. I was very entertained this season and rewatched all of the season I had recorded again leading up to the next season which debuts next week.  The great sound that is in these DVDs, the clarity of the picture and of course no commercials or channel branding (fresh episode, wb, etc) is a good reason to buy these and I'm going to, but I'm waiting until the price drops.   There's hardly any special features on these DVDs.  I know Tom Welling is a busy guy, but COME ON...not a single commentary on any of the episodes from any season since the beginning of the series.  It's not like he's Elvis.
