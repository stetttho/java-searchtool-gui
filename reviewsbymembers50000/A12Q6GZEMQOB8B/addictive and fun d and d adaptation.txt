 i can sympathize with some of the reviewers here who have experienced problems with the game on their systems.  i installed it on a machine that met the requirements but quickly uninstalled it because gameplay was unbearably slow. unbelievably slow.  i shelved the game and then when i got a new system last month (2.8 hyperthreaded gigahertz, 1GB of DDR memory) installed it and i've been playing it ever since.  my new system doesn't even blink even when the screen is filled with a dozen enemies with spell effects going off right and left.   so, buy this game if you have a brand new system.   the minimum requirements should be at least a 2 gig processor and lots of memory on a new system.  old systems are dog slow.   performance aside, i love the game.   i wish there were more battles, like pool of radience.  the quests are fun and entertaining, but it seems like the game designers had a Baldur's Gate (for the consoles, not the pc) type of template for the game in mind and wanted more quests than fights.  oh well.  i also hope they come out with a sequel that lets you import old chars.   another great thing about the game is that you can play the game multiple times with differently aligned characters.  i can't wait to replay the game with a chaotic evil party.   pillage and destroy!
