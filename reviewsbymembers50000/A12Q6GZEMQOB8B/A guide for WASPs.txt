 I ended my subscription with Men's Health (MH) last month with difficulty.  They required you to write in a letter stating you resign your subscription, even though I paid by check..??!!  The articles are now mediocre and every issue seems more and more concerned with getting women in bed than focusing on health.  Who cares that Prada has a new line of casual slip-ons?  Not me.  I'm not interested in Cartier wristwatches, either.
