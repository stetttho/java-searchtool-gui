 I bought this album with some trepidation because the last couple of Rush albums...Counterparts was at least listenable, but Presto, Test for Echo, Roll the Bones all...Anyway, this album rocks from start to finish with fresh melodic lines, great bass playing and of course, superb lyrics and percussion.  The only thing that bothered me is that there are NO solos.  Not one.  This is perplexing since Alex is a fabulous guitarist (put on Hemispheres or 2112).  Other than that, they all sound superb.  BUY IT!
