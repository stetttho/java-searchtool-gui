 It has been years, YEARS, since I stayed up on a weeknight until 2:00am reading a book because I couldn't stand not knowing what would happen next.  It conjures nostalgia I have for my favorite writers such as Zelazny, Jack Chalker, and Phillip Jose Farmer.  Nobody writes like they did / do.  I would put George Martin right beside those greats.  His latest book is fantasic.  There isn't a boring chapter in it, or boring characters.  Watch out for plot twists galore as well as superb characterization.  You feel as if you know The Imp, Jaime, and the rest.  I was appalled at "The Red Wedding" scene because it came as such a surprise.  The ending was fabulous as well!  I can't wait until the next one.
