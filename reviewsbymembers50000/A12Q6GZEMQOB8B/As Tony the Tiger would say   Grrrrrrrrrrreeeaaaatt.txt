 The quality of this DVD is fantastic.  It looks like you're watching a computer screen.  I recently had a friend over and he hadn't seen Farscape before, so I put it in and he was glued for 2 hours to the screen.  The first episode has Ben Browder commenting and the second has Anthony Simcoe; both are entertaining and give great background information on the show's production and behind the scenes information.  If for no other reason, you should buy this DVD because Ben Browder is SO HOT.
