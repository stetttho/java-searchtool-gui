 There have been many books written that discuss the "merits" and "faults" of Bible translations, but none to my knowledge that have done so "outside the box." Previous authors have brought the full weight of their criticisms from the viewpoint of conservative Protestant Christianity, and as such, ended up being more apologetics than a scientific analysis. The end results were that Bibles such as the New World Translation, and those perceived to be "Liberal" translation bore the brunt of a dogmatic and partial world-view. BeDuhn however is not confined by the fetters of a restrictive religious system, and instead gives us a refreshing, and objective study. *Just the Facts Ma'am*, and it is about time!
