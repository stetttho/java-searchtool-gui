 This book has been the topic of conversation lately amongst my friends. This is an angle that not many have proposed previously, though the book, *God, Guilt, and Death* had alluded to it: "Without noticing it, Freud has undermined his project of discrediting religion. For if God is a heavenly father to whom we transfer the longing and admiration we feel for our earthly fathers, he will also be the object of our fear and, as we shall see, hatred. If belief can be seen as a wish-fulfilling illusion grounded in our longing for protection and help, disbelief can just as easily be seen as a wish-fulfilling illusion expressing our rebellion against the father's supremacy. We might say that the illusion of lingering childhood and the illusion of lingering adolescence cancel each other out . .  . As Dostoyevsky pointedly remarks during the trial scene in the Brothers Karamazov, the psychological argument cuts both ways. We are left with no way of using the notion of wish-motivated beliefs to test whether religious beliefs are true or not." (Westphal, Merold. _God, Guilt and Death: An Existential Phenomenology of Religion_. Page 58-59) I hope this book gets the recognition it deserves.
