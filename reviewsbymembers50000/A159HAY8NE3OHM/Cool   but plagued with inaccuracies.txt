 This book has a cool layout that might be appealling to younger people, but even a quick glance highlighted some errors and a religious bias. For instance, groups like the Mormons are not "cults", unless of course you are of the Evangelical mindset and anyone that does not think like you is an abberrant group. The term is so over-used, it has completely lost its power. According Larson's New Book of Cults, their definition of a cultist would include five American presidents. In the section under Jehovah's Witnesses, on the practise of "Disfellowshipping [excommunication]" Etue adds, "Infractions could be things like talking to a former Witness or reading your Bible without the aid of the Watchtower." Nothing could be further from the truth, and this kind of info is indigenous of the apathy and misinformation that spreads regarding groups we do not like. That is what keeps certain ones labelled as "cults."
