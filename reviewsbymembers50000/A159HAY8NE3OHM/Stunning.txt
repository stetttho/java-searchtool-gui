 I find in Russell Watson a deep, rich voice that, unlike many others, will stand the test of time. Watson deserves a place amongst the greats. Especially inspiring is his local boy makes good/rags to riches story that fills our hearts as his music fills our minds with awe. My only regret is not having heard of him sooner. I am especially happy that someone of this talent is keeping this style of song alive in a world that is experiencing the rape of music.
