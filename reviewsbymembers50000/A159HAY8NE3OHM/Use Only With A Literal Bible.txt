 The CEV is another version amongst a recent spate of "meaning-based" or "Dynamic Equivalent" Bibles, like the New Living Translation, International English Bible, TEV, etc. The language does seem clearer, and Bibles like the CEV are easier to understand, but at what cost? In Acts 8:20, the American Standard Version (ASV) has the word "perish", but the CEV has "Hell." In Luke 16:23, the CEV translates the word "hades" as Hell, but the next time the word "hades" pops up, it is translated as "grave." (Acts 2:27, 31).  In 2 Chron 28:3, the place name "Hinnom Valley" is translated properly, but the same place in the Greek "Gehenna" is translated as "Hell." (Matt 5:22) This is a common problem with proper names, as even Tartarus is translated as "hell." (2 Pet. 2:4)  Basically put, the meaning-based translator (in this case, Barclay Newman for the most part) has interpreted the text for you. This type of translator does not think that YOU are smart enough to interpret for yourself, so you are being spoon-fed his theology. For instance, the CEV in Ps. 97:7 translates Elohim as "false gods." But the LXX and the Vulgate understood this to refer to angels, just as they did of Elohim at Ps. 138:1, but there the CEV translates it as "angels." Are angels false gods?  The bottom line is, use the CEV as it can clear up some difficultly worded passages, but never use it without a more literal Bible.
