 Reviewer Trevor Jenkins seems to condemn Robert Martin as a proponent of Formal Equivalency, as if being a proponent of Dynamic Equivalency sets you on a higher plateau in regards to translation philosophy. The theme of Martin's book can best be summed in his sentence, "The dynamic equivalence translator tends to be relatively unrestrained in his theologizing. What a formal equivalence translator generally does only as a matter of necessity, the dynamic equivalence translator often does as a matter of choice." Consider an example. Proper names should be translated formally. No one thinks of substituting Jerusalem for Washington. Yet where Gehenna shows up in the NT (a Greek equivalent of the Hinnom Valley in the OT), the NIV translates it as *Hell*. This is interpreting the text, not translating it. (The same can be for Hades and Tartarus.) There are about 11 words used in the English Bible for *Lord*, but the NIV translators refuse to translate the proper name Jehovah/Yahweh, and the reason given in a private letter was a profit motive. So accuracy (and integrity to the source text) is indeed lacking in the NIV, and other "Dynamic Equivalent/Paraphrased" Bibles that have followed suit. Use the NIV, or any other DE translation, but only  with a FE/Literal translation close by.
