 This masterpiece should grace the shelves of any Christian, no matter what stripe. I am not Catholic, but I am constantly referring to my edition of this Bible, as I find it more accurate than many others. A little known fact is that this Bible has retained some of the original readings prior to the changes made by the Sopherim (out of a misguided reverence). Compare Habakkuk 1:12 in the NJB with that in the New American Standard Bible to see what I mean. Restoring the Divine Name Yahweh to the OT text is a definite plus, and few Bible versions have had the courage to do this, but this again goes back to a misguided reverence, and perhaps an unhealthy fear of a sagging bottom line. Thank you for providing this majestic piece of work.
