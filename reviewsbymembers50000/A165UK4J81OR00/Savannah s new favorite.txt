 My 12 month old daughter absolutely loves Elmo.  The Best of Elmo was her favorite from about 9 months, but now Kid's Favorite Songs 2 has knocked it out of the top spot.  I have to admit the first couple of times she watched it she got a little bored so I didn't know how it would go over ultimately.  Then she warmed up to it about the 3rd time we watched it and has become the one that makes her smile, laugh, and point (so cute!) the most.  She loves listening to and watching the kids Elmo interviews about the songs and of course all the great parts with Elmo.  Wheels on the Bus which is on this video has been her favorite song from about 3 months when I would change her diaper and run through the songs and actions to keep her entertained.  It's a hit at our house.
