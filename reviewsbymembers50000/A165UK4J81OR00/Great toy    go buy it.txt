 This is a GREAT toy.  My daughter is 23 months and loves playing with this toy.  It's great that it's in the kitchen too so I can cook or clean while she plays.  She has pulled it off the fridge and banged it a few times and it still works great.  I love that she is learning the alphabet so early.  She now recognizes letters and points them out to me.  We had foam letters for the tub too, but this is the best and most fun.  We love Leap Frog!
