 I was estatic at the thought of having a portable kitchen to take to Grandma's or wherever.  It's a great size.  The overall design is good, but "push down and pull" to open the appliances?  Are they kidding?  Yeah, let's get out the medicine bottles next and try push down and turn.  This is not for a 2 year old to do as it frustrates my daughter that she needs my help to open the appliances.  I even have trouble with the oven.  You have to really push down hard and then pull (on ours).  I don't think she will be able to do that one before she outgrows it.  Great idea -- needs work.
