 We have a two year old and we got this when she was 18 months.  Not only does she love it, but it has made her very popular in our neighborhood.  We find that kids from 1 year up to 8 love playing in this sandbox.  It's big enough for 4 small kids, but I think 3 is ideal.  She is learning concepts such as volume and working on her motor skills by scooping and pouring.  We bought a little sifter that she puts sand in a cone at the top which as it works it way through spins wheels in the middle and comes out at the bottom.  That's her favorite.  Just remember to keep the cover on if you have any cats roaming in your neighborhood.  We forgot one time and it wasn't pretty.  It's no fun dumping out the sand, cleaning it, and pouring new in so just try preventive maintenance on that one!
