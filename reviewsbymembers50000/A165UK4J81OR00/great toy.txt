 Babies love to see babies.  My daughter has loved this mirror since we got it (when she was 6 weeks and now is 8 months). It was a great purchase.  We love the fact it rotates to different angles.  You can use it on the floor for tummy time or put it straight up on top of something when the pull up so they can see themselves (even though she doesn't know it's her yet which ties into the educational value - she will learn it is eventually!).
