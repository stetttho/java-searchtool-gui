 Everyone said this was the best carrier and it's true!  It was so easy to put together and use.  There are pictorial instructions on it and you can follow them exactly.  It's easy to adjust the straps.  The only concern I have is that unlike the lady in the photo on the box, I don't have a neck like a giraffe so the top of the head is close to my chin.  I'm a bit concerned about my baby knocking me in the teeth with a sudden head jerk when she gets bigger.  This could be invalid as she may weigh it down so much more then that it's not an issue.  Overall, it's a great convenience which I think will be great for my baby and me.  I will love having her close while maintaining my freedom of movement.
