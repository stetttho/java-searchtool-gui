 This was a waste of $60 for me personally.  I ended up having to get the Pump in Style from Medela.  First of all, I had rented a pump from the hospital which everyone should do the first month anyway because you never know how nursing will work out for you.  I've had so many friends quit.  I kept at it, but I wouldn't have if left with this useless pump.  It took me 40 minutes to pump what I could get 10 with my Medela.  When you work, that's an issue.  I don't think I could have told my boss I'd be unavailable for an hour and twenty every day.  Plus, the milk for your baby is based on supply and demand so I don't think you could keep up your supply very easily with this as I was never able to get as much out as with the Medela.  You could also do both sides at once with the Pump in Style which is a big deal when you do it for a year.  Maybe if you stayed at home and left once a month briefly this pump could be suitable for you, but not for a mom going back to work.  I wish I could say something better, but maybe you won't waste your money like I did.  Remember, you can't return these!
