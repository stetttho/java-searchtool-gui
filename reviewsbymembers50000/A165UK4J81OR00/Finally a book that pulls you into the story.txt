 I've read some of the reviews and want to keep this a bit short so there's still time to read the book.  I haven't felt this drawn into a story in a long time.  I don't know much about art, but as an avid reader it's such a good feeling to read a book you don't want to end and keeps getting more interesting.  She's a wonderful writer and really knows how to build the characters.  Try not to read too many reviews because of all the spoilers.  The mystique of this book is what makes it so interesting and combined with her character development you just don't want it to end!
