 because nothing else does! Not that we want her to park in front of the tv and watch it non stop, but it is nice to see her attention span is longer than the 5 minutes she puts into most of her toys and other videos. I don't know what it is about Elmo, but he seems universally loved by little kids. I have to admit he is very cute. There are some great cameos by Julia Roberts and Whoopi Goldberg that parents will enjoy. Our daughter is only 9 1/2 months old and cruises along the coffee table while watching this and will stand on her own and dance at the end when Elmo sings his adorable trademark song "Elmo's Song". She really loves it and Mom and Dad love to watch her get into it and enjoy herself.
