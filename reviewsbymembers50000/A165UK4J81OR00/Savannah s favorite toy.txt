 My daughter loves this toy and it is the only one she will play with for an extended period of time. She started playing with it at only 6 weeks. We lay her on the floor under her Gymini and she looks in the mirror and kicks her feet on this toy (while we hold it securely). She loves the noises it makes and laughs and smiles. We noticed that when the toy is accidentally triggered even when she isn't playing with it that she starts kicking her feet (teaching cause and effect). Since she is never in her crib we haven't tried it there. If you play with it outside the crib you really have to hold it securely or it will fall on the baby (the crying that ensues kind of takes the fun out of it :) I can't wait to see how she plays with it when she is a little older (if she does) and can lift up to see the lights a little. We tried propping her up on the Boppy so she could see, but she didn't like that. I know it's durable because we had a big 2 1/2 year old over and he kept stepping/jumping on top of it and it still works. I just wanted to add that now the baby is sleeping in the crib and we still don't use it in there.  We took all the noise making crib toys out of the crib as they tend to get triggered during sleep movement or when you accidentally hit them yourself putting the baby in the crib.  It's still a great toy out of the crib and the kick start activity gym will be a hit if your child likes this.
