 and they can spell too so that's one up on the people that gave Nemo bad reviews here.  This is a great movie.  My daughter is two and it is the ONLY movie she will sit still for so that means a lot to us.  As adults we enjoy the movie too which is well written and beautifully animated.  I can't say enough about how entertaining this movie is and the dvd has some great bonus material.  There is an incredible documentary where you and your children can learn much more about the ocean.  As with all Disney films there are some dark undertones and you really have to pay attention if your children scare easily.  Just reassure them and they will be fine.  Stop reading these reviews and go get this dvd!
