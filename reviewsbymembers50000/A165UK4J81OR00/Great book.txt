 With little time to read these days we found this book easy to get through quickly.  It's broken down in age ranges so you can read as far as you need to at the time.  We got some great ideas from it.  My daughter loves the songs and games.  You really forget all those little things from childhood and need a refresher.  The thing I love most is that it uses things you have around the house.  Batteries are not necessary!
