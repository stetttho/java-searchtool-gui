 From a kid's perspective my daughter (2) likes this cd (and video) quite a bit.  I would have to say her favorite is Yummy Yummy, but this ranks up there and she does dance to a lot of the songs.  I don't really agree that this is "slow" as others have said.  It does have SOME slow songs, but who can take 40 minutes of constant jumping around and dancing?  If you have seen these guys in concert they sweat more than Richard Simmons or Jane Fonda ever thought about.  It looks like a serious workout.  When you think about it, that's a lot of stimulation for a kid too so why not mix in a FEW slower songs with the get up and dance tunes as well?  My husband really can't tolerate the Wiggles, but I like them from the perspective that my daughter is interacting (doing hand motions they have with some songs) or dancing and not just vegging in front of the TV.  My husband agrees these are by far the most tolerable songs they have out.  It was GREAT to hear Tim Finn formerly of Crowded House (I'm big fan) on a kid's cd/video.  Mom stops folding laundry to join in the fun for "Six Months in a Leaky Boat" every time.  This was a good find for us and I'm glad we added it to our collection.
