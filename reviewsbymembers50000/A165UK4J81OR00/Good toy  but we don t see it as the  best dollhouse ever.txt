 We have SEVERAL dollhouses with which to compare this one.  Dora's has the bilingual factor of course which is good if you live where we do -- in Texas.  I'm beginning to think it will become the primary language especially when you go into TRU and all the sale circulars are in Spanish.  From a pretend play standpoint this one is the worst we have.  Nothing opens and closes except the front door and fridge door?  It would be nice if the oven actually opened.  Just a word of warning to the wise since I tried to pry ours open and almost broke it in complete disbelief they would make an oven that didn't open.  Moving on, for the money it needs to come with more stuff.  I feel like the Loving Family and Barbie houses come with much more accessories.  My daughter is 3 and plays with this for about 5 minutes tops.  She takes the Dora figures and puts them in her Loving Family townhome or Barbie castle which she plays with ALL the time.
