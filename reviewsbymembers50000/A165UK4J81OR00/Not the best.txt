 The content of this dvd is not that bad (it's not that great either).  The thing that really ticks me off is that there is no menu or extra features like the other dvds: Let's Play School, More Barney Songs and our favorite is the Circus one.  The Circus one even has segments of videos from other Barney shows giving you more bang for your buck.  Our neighbor heard that Barney fired their old dvd production company - the one that put out good dvds with the extra features, coloring books, games, read alongs, etc..  Big mistake Barney!
