 Let me start by saying that this wasn't the easiest toy to put together.  The tab and slot slide fittings never really seemed to go together as they should for the slide, but it stays together fairly well with normal play.  My daughter loves racing the dolls down the slide.  We had to take off their rubbery swimsuits and just have them wear the ones painted on so they would slide down though.  The swings are neat too.  I put the whole thing in the bathtub (while it's empty) and give her a pitcher of water.  She loves to sit in there and play with it and water doesn't get everywhere.  The waterfall doesn't really function great, but it's ok and doesn't detract from the overall use of the toy.  It's a big hit for us especially based on the cost.
