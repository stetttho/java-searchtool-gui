 My daughter is 11 months and about the only things she watches are Elmo and Barney (and we don't let her watch a lot of either because we want her to do other things while we still have some input).  Her favorite tapes/dvds are The Best of Elmo, Elmo Says Boo, and Kids Favorite Songs II in the Sesame Street/Elmo series.  She gets bored with Elmo's World series as it gets a little too serious for her and she seems to get bored.  This tape is great and she doesn't seem to get scared at all.  Maybe that will come later, but I don't see how a kid could really get scared at this tape.  It's a stitch to me, but I'm not 2 either.
