 We got this when my daughter was about 14 months old.  She loves it and needed help at first, but now that she is 22 months she is all over it and does everything by herself and then some.  I can see that all the climbing she did on this put her ahead of most kids her age in that respect, but that can make some things more challenging for us parents too like when they try the skill inside and climb the bookcase (lol).  Kids in our neighborhood from 1 to 8 love this and it gets a lot of use.  Between this, the Little Tikes dinosaur sandbox, and the water slide pool (INTEX) our house looked like Toddler Disneyland this summer.
