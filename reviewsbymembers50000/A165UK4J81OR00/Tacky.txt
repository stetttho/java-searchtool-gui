 This is really tacky and the netting looks like a purple fishing net.  We are selling ours or taking it back.  We ended up getting one of the circular hanging canopies which you can access on Amazon -- do a search on bed canopies and look at the ones from wild things.  It's really, really cute.  They used to have them at Target too and I've seen them at the store although no longer online.  Pass on this one unless you just don't really care what it looks like.  If you're one that could care less about decor and just want to get something your kids like then it could be a good option for you.
