 We tried several carriers and this was by far the best.  I agree with other reviews stating it's better for older babies maybe starting around 6 weeks.  Before that, use a sling type carrier because newborns usually prefer to be wrapped up tightly in a sling to feel secure.  Our baby had colic and we had to carry her constantly until about 3 months.  This carrier saved our backs.  It's the only one we found easy to adjust while you had it on and the best part is how easy it is to take the baby out and lay them down once they are asleep.  Our daughter was too big (wide) for it by about 6 months though.
