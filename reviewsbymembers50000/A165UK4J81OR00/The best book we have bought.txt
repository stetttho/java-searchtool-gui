 You put so much thought into which books to introduce to your children and when.  We gave this book to our daughter at 10 months and she loves it.  Most babies love peekaboo as she does and she really enjoys lifting the flaps to see the familiar (she loves Sesame Street) character faces.  She gets so excited at the end where you open the doors to see all the characters.  She's a bit tough on books, but this one has held up.  She would probably rip some of the flaps off if we just handed it to her, but since we are reading it with her she does fine with it.  It is her favorite and we read it multiple times per day.  It's fun and she's learning too.
