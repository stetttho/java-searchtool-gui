 This is my big problem with a lot of Barbie stuff now which makes it unrealistic and frustrating for my daughter -- hardly anything opens!  The fridge, two cubbies, and the dishwasher open.  The oven (biggie for us), the drawers and cabinets do NOT open.  My daughter was very upset about this and at the point when we found out it was too difficult to put it all up and try to return it.  There have been better kitchens.  Surprisingly I think the Barbie stuff I played with in the seventies was better than this!
