 I disagree with other reviewers that do not rate this high on educational value.  We make a game of hiding the characters in the towers and dungeon of this castle.  We hide them and then ask our her (starting from about 10 - 12 months and still fun now at 15 months of age) to find "Barney" or one of the other characters and she finds them.  Plus, it helped to teach her object permanence since even though she can't see the characters she knows they are there.  Just because it's not a book does not mean it's not educational.  It is a very sturdy toy and stays on the tub for the most part (you have to occasionally reattach the suction cups, but far better than any toy we have had).  I wish the characters were rubbery because she likes to chew on them and they aren't very chewy, but if they were rubbery they would not slide down the slide very well so it's a trade off.  My only gripe is that the characters do not fit in the boat very well.  We don't even use that though because she was using it as a cup to drink the bath water.  You have to use a lot of soap to get the 'foaming' action, but we don't use that and it's still the most loved bath toy she has so far.  I also recommend the Sesame Street bath shape sorter and the Sassy counting fishing net for more bath time fun.
