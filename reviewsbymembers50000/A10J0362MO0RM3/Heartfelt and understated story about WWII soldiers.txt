 "Best Years of our Lives" was made in 1946, and is an excellent film about three returning veterans. One lost his hands during a naval battle, another had a distinguished war record but no job skills, the  third, played by Fredric March, was thoroughly changed by the war, but  immediately went back to his former life. The script did not soft-pedal  anything. By respecting the traumas involved, it also brought out the  honor, faithfulness, and dignity of the principal characters. It captured  my heart and didn't let go until the credits started rolling.
