 "Mi Vida Loca (My Crazy Life)" is an HBO movie about Hispanic girls growing up in Echo Park. Each main character was allowed to tell his or her story and the director effectively blended these lives into a tale  about real people facing death on the streets. It shows what it means to  belong to a neighborhood, how the neighborhood gangs provide support, and  how people, especially women, cope with the deaths around them. There were  no "bad" people here, just nice kids who accept murder as an  effective way to solve problems in a dangerous environment. I highly  recommend the film to anyone who has seen "Kids" for a more  mundane but believable take on poor urban teens.
