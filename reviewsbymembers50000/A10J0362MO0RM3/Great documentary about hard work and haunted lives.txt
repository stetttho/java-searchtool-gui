 "On The Ropes" is a documentary about three boxers and their trainer in a poor city neighborhood. The film shows how success is a constant goal for the young boxers, but also how failure loss and betrayal  haunt every move they make. Each of the four is tough enough to train and  fight hard, get knocked down, and then get back up again. Each of them,  however, has been wounded by circumstances to the point that every  achievement is clouded by fear that everything will be taken away from  them. It is the best of several new documentaries I have seen recently.
