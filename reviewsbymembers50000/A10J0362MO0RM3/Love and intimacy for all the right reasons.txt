 "Nelly & Monsieur Arnaud" is a profound and enriching drama about love, independence, sharing, and separation. It follows a beautiful young woman on the point of separating from her depressed and non-working spouse. She encounters a rich and perceptive older man who offers her a job transcribing his memoirs. Though he emphatically tells her that he wants nothing from her, they grow to love and depend on each other in a non-sexual relationship that brightens their lives. There are many types of sharing and intimacy and the plot takes them both through friends and personal contacts that mean a lot to them, but do not direct their lives. This is an intelligent and rich portrait of human intimacy.
