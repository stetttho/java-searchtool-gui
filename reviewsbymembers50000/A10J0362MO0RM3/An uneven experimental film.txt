 "Poison" was an early film by Todd Haynes and contains three stories about bizarre lives, namely: a doctor who ingested a deadly sex hormone that left him disfigured and highly contagious, a suburban  nightmare about a masochistic/saintly child who killed his father, and a  prison story by Genet. The prison story was the least experimental and most  successful of the three. Haynes explored the power games, sexual needs, and  embittered lives of the inmates and the strange way love was defined by  those involved. The doctor's story was extremely melodramatic and the  suburban story was mainly about the strange personalities inhabiting the  neighborhood. All things considered it was, and probably was intended to  be, an exploration of just how abnormal normal can be in some  circumstances. Not an enjoyable picture, but it was thought provoking.
