 The main documentary provides a shallow survey of homosexual characters in cinema. I am not sure why it is so highly regarded. There are not very many clips nor are there any truly informative interviews. It mainly serves as a self-congratulatory tour by liberal thespians and writers.  The best interviews, 55 additional minutes in all, come in a special features section on the DVD where writers and performers discuss the heart of their work and their experiences.
