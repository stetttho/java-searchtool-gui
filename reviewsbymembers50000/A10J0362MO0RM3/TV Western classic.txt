 Once you get beyond the kitschy intro and the occasional schmaltz, you get some outstanding early work by Sam Peckinpah and other western writers. Three or four out of the five episodes in this first series were written and in some cases directed by Peckinpah. None are simple good guy/bad guy stories, and the acting as well as the scripts are above average.
