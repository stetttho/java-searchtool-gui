 "Strike!" [All I wanna do](1998) has had a hard life, but is a good teen comedy about a girl's school from the perspective of fairly sophisticated girls and deserves a larger audience.  The original title for  this film was "The Hairy Bird." Miramax purchased distribution  rights, changed the name to "Strike!," failed to advertise it,  and then gave it a very short run in a limited U.S. release before moving  on to other countries. The movie, under the new but equally unhelpful title  "All I wanna do," was rereleased this year in New York and went  on sale last week as a new DVD. The story follows students combating a  threatened merger with a boy's school. What makes it worthwhile is the  principal cast (Lyn Redgrave, Kirsten Dunst, Rachel Leigh Cook, Gaby  Hoffman), some of the dialogue, and the point of view. Sarah Kernochan  received full support from her team of actresses for a warm heartfelt  comedy about smart independent women keeping control over their own lives.  Insofar as she kept to the conversations between the girls and the  headmistress, it all rang true.  The portrayal of teenage male townies in  the film, however, is excruciatingly bad, and Kernochan made Redgrave's  headmistress too ineffectual for my taste. Excepting these two elements, it  all worked well. "All I wanna do" offers a unique comic take on  women who make their own way in the world and don't take compromise for  granted.
