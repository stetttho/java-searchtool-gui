 The true story behind "Boys don't Cry" tells about crimes committed, lousy judgment, and bad company.  Kimberly Pierce includes it all but still manages to show a loving courageous person who mixed  practicality and sensitivity with a stubborn desire to live a full life on  his terms. Hilary Swank deserved the Oscar for her affecting performance as  a transsexual trapped by lies and circumstances but never giving up on his  dreams. The film was deep and honest and I loved it.
