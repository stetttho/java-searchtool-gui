 "Priest" (SPOILERS AHEAD) was about a young idealistic priest who could not ignore his own sexual needs or his inner conflicts over the demands of his position. It was most successful in showing the interactions  within a small poor urban Catholic community. The way the congregants  reacted to things mirrored what I had seen in protestant congregations as a  child, and helped me to understand more about how the modern Catholic  church operates. The young priest, who had a homosexual lover and was  caught by the police on a morals charge, seemed a little too dense at  times. I got tired of his deer-in-the-headlights behavior, and could not  believe that consensual sex between two men would generate a 40-point  headline in a local tabloid. I gave it an A for the church story and a D  for plot development.
