 "La Vida Segn Muriel [Life According to Muriel]" is a delightful story about women and children and the men who walk in and out of their lives. Muriel is the eight-year-old daughter of a troubled woman described by previous mates as crazy and combative. Her Mother wants to leave Buenos Aires and go back to the mountains but doesn't trust herself to make good decisions so she always lets Muriel determine what is best for them. As they near their destination, they stop at a mountain overlook, put a camera on the roof of their car for a time delay photo, and watch in horror as the car begins to roll forward and fall off the cliff into the sea with all their money and possessions. They beg a place to stay out of a woman in the burned out remains of a hotel, and eventually move in with her and her two kids. Both women miss the men in their lives but made compromises that did not work out and the story follows both their healing process and their developing strength in the face of tragedy and old and new lovers. The only possible drawback is that the subtitles are in white cartoon lettering on a full screen DVD presentation and are sometimes lost in the background colors, but the dialogue is easy to follow if you have any Spanish at all.
