 The Turkish Delight in the title is devoured quickly by the handful near the end of the film and reflects a delirious but short marriage between a reckless young sculptor and a beautiful childish and free spirited young rich girl. The sculptor accepts no boundaries for his appetites and takes an impish delight in upsetting the norm, but his love and kindness are boundless as well. His young bride is alternately captivated and rebellious, as his consuming passions leave no room for other plans, and sudden blackouts leave her confused and angry. The film, more than anything else, is about an uncompromising man who will not bow to fate, propriety, or to maudlin sentimentality but still loves more faithfully than most. Verhoeven does an excellent job defining the artist's moods and the loving relationship in flashbacks and with a singular angry fantasy that brackets much of the story. It is an altogether well crafted and intelligent work by an accomplished director.
