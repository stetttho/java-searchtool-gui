 "Meantime" is a fascinating honest portrayal of a lower class family and their relatives and friends. All three men in the household are out of work and drive each other crazy when they aren't nursing their wounded pride with drink or petty criticisms. One son in the household, Colin, has built a life out of keeping his head down because he lacks the wit to compete intellectually. His brother Mark loves him but is jealous of any attention his brother receives so he alternates between bucking him up and tearing him down. Most of the acting is excellent and there is no denouement, sentimental focus, or social argument in it. It is just a humorous and tragic slice of life exalted by honesty.
