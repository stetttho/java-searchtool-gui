 "The Visit" is an outstanding expanded view of a prison inmate dying of AIDS. His world is defined by visits from family members and an old girl friend, and by his meetings with a prison psychologist and the parole board. Each encounter is followed by dream sequences where he imagines an intimacy with them that is impossible across the physical and mental barriers defining their short time together. The story paints a larger picture of anger, love, and forgiveness that reaches beyond the unsentimental and unvarnished prison drama to a universal redemption unbound by prison walls. Say amen somebody; this is true religion at its best, sans God or Bible, but rich in human love.
