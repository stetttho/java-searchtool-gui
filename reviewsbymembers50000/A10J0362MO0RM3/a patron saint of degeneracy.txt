 "Comdia de Deus, A  [God's Comedy]" follows a cadaverous, laconic, and self righteous degenerate named Joo de Deus whose sensual universe revolves around the exotic ice creams he makes and the girls he seduces. His boss, a former prostitute, who knows his proclivities but depends on his unique and exotic ices for her business success, rescued him from the gutter to manage her shop. He, however, despises all official points of view, collects and annotates samples of pubic hair, and pursues ever-younger conquests, hovering over them like a vulture flapping its wings. At best the dark comedy endorses a kind of sainthood of perversity in a disjointed and hypocritical world; at worst it has no heart or meaning at all beyond defiance of all judgment.
