 "Le Dernier Combat" takes place in a grim post-apocalyptic future and is Luc Besson's first feature. Even though it won a lot of praise from critics, it has rarely if ever been available in the U.S. If you like Besson, read the history of this outstanding film and buy it. (Columbia will also be releasing a new edition of "Subway.")
