 John Piper continues his audacious project of "Christian Hedonism" (see Desiring God) by offering us with a short introductory medley specifically aimed at younger people. With the plethora of books aimed at younger evangelicals, weather it be postmodern or purpose-driven, Piper gives us a unique look into his grandfatherly heart imploring younger people live for what really matters.   Piper is a master of bridging the academic theological world with the everyday of faith that works itself out in monotonous areas of life. His plea is essentially live to prove God is more precious than anything else in the created order by boasting only in the cross of Christ and making others glad in Christ.   At times the book is repetitive and linguistically awkward in that Piper tends to meld an academic prose with poetry which can be cumbersome and tiresome. Nevertheless, it gives a solid volume in the unnamed category of books that could be called "How should we then live?"
