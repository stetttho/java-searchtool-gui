 Controversial pastor/theologian Gregory A. Boyd known for his strong and honest opinions in theology reveals his true pastoral heart for a non-judgmental vision of the Church. With the passion of an evangelist and the conviction of a prophet Boyd claims that "the Christian religion has to a significant extent become the defender of and promoter of the Fall rather than the proclaimer of the Good News that alone can free us from the Fall." This is because the Church eats from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil and therefore stands in God's place of judging rather than loving others. Boyd offers some very keen incites from Jonathan Edward's Triune Creationism, Dietrich Bonhoeffer's theology of the fall, and about the nature of the human heart's longing for self-righteousness.   However, at times Boyd falls on his sword by unashamedly making the same kind of judgments of Christians he seeks to condemn them for; probably born out of response to his legion of critics. He becomes very ambiguous at times when trying to distinguish loving intervention with judging others, which leaves him more or less against the practice of Church Discipline. He also blurs a distinction between the sin of gluttony and being overweight, and then awkwardly tries to contrast them with homosexuality.   Nevertheless, Boyd makes his case for a clarion call for believers to repent from judgmentalism and practice love and mercy towards not only other believers, but sinners as Jesus would.
