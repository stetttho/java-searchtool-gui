 The most important things in a Christian's life are hardly ever considered important. Maryland-based preacher and Sovereign Grace Ministries founder C.J. Mahaney extends a call to Christians-old and new-to radically focus their lives on the cross of Christ. This, he contends, will free us from legalism, show us the depths of sin, and the love of God in that he reconciled us by death of his Son.   In many ways the book is a breath of fresh air in that it is more than just a solemn reminder, but a proclamation, that the substance of Christian life is one that is cross-centered; not one that is confused and bewildered by the secondary issues of spiritual disciplines. The best part of the book is that it lays a solid foundation for spiritual growth: we begin with the gospel and we end with the gospel. Everything in between our initial moment of forgiveness to our eventual resurrection is a grace-based, cross-centered motivation towards new life.   The weakness of the book is that it equates the gospel with the death of Christ. Thus, it could be more aptly titled "The Atonement-Centered Life." There is nary a hint of the resurrection and little more on the victory of God through Christ. Hence, it can possibly leave one with an incomplete picture of the gospel.   Nevertheless, I recommend this book to everyone who is seeking to grow spiritually and overcome sin. I also give it as a gift to the men who graduate from the faith-based drug rehab center I work for, because it truly does highlight the most important things a Christian needs to know.
