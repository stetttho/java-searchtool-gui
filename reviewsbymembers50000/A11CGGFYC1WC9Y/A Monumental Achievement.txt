 Truett Seminary professor Roger E. Olson has given us a monumental achievement in his 600 page magnum opus, The Story Of Christian Theology (Story, hereafter). Story is the result of Olson's 20 plus years of teaching historical theology in the classroom, and it shows. The book covers the theological moorings of the early church Fathers to the modern period covering the leading theological figures of Christianity.   Olson displays a remarkable knowledge of ancient, medieval, Reformed, and modern writings and has an uncanny ability to summarize complex beliefs in a charitable and irenic fashion without too much distortion. At the same time, he makes you aware of his evangelical roots as he offers criticism of various movements. The books most interesting feature is that it ably contrasts the differences between orthodoxy and heresy, and thoroughly covers both.   There are few drawbacks, but one perhaps would be Olson's tendency to move quickly over complex subjects. However, Olson is careful to cite more comprehensive works in the endnotes for the curious reader. Story is a book I heartily recommend to anyone interested in the Church's intellectual history!
