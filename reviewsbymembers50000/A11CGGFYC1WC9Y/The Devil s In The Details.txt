 Gregory A. Boyd's first book in his magnum opus "Evil Series" (Satan And The Problem Of Evil and the forthcoming Myth Of The Blueprint) is a fascinating and stimulating read. Boyd believes that the fundamental landscape of the cosmos is a spiritual war between God and Satan that he carefully exegetes from Old and New Testaments. His chapters on the ministry of Jesus and the atonement are especially enlightening and helpful in understanding a "Warfare Worldview" the New Testament perceived in its writings.   However, Boyd's thesis is part of the larger scope of proving Open Theism, which is unfortunate. Being a classical Calvinist, I was not impressed by the overall structure of the argument that demands that God be partly open to future possibilities and never involved with evil in the world. Also Boyd mishandles a number of prooftexts in certain areas that leave much to be desired.  Nevertheless, anyone from an Evangelical background, being fully aware of Boyd's biases, can still gain a good understanding of the Spiritual world the New Testament testifies to, and heed the call to "enter into battle" against evil instead of resigning piously to its woes.
