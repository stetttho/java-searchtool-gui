 Leading Evangelical theologian Wayne Grudem continues his mission of defining and defending the "complimentarian position" with his very fluent pen. It is no secret that Grudem finds the controversy over the role of women in the home and in the church to be the most important issue Evangelicals face today. He warns that there is a connection between evangelical feminism (egalitarianism) and liberalism, and believes the current state of evangelicalism regarding manhood and womanhood is in need of desperate revision. Grudem amplifies his polemicist skills by interacting with over 100 egalitarian arguments and stops short of denouncing them as heretical.   Yet, despite 800 poised pages to the contrary, I still am not able to see the logic in Grudem's positions. Doug Groothuis illuminates (see his review of Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood), 1) the Bible is true in all that it teaches, 2) Men and women are equal in value as human beings and essential human capacity, and 3) God ordains men to be in authority over women cross-culturally and perpetually. These three propositions cannot all be true, because if (2) is true (3) cannot be true, since (3) restricts women and confirms that they are not equal to men. If the Bible teaches both (2) and (3) to be true, the Bible itself teaches errors, thus contradicting (1).   Nevertheless, Grudem takes 25 years of scholarship and packages it neatly into one volume that is readable and accessible.
