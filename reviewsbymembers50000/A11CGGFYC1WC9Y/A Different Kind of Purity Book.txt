 Most books on purity operate on the assumption that men are sex crazed animals and that women dont struggle with lust at all. Such pigeonholing is all too typical in these types of studies, which makes Not Even A Hint a different kind of book.   Instead of being solely directed at men, it delineates lust as a human problem, not just a male problem, and poignantly tells the feminine side of the story. Instead of plunging you into meaningless psychobabble or a list of dos and donts, it elevates the gospel as the means of overcoming the issue and living in the freedom of grace.   Harris touches on a number of issues with brevity and even gingerly deals with the subject of masturbation in a surprisingly approachable and readable way. He also reflects on the thorny issues of mens and womens differences and similarities, clothing, common temptations, accountability, and even a "game plan." This is the kind of book I wouldn't mind reading again. Most books on this subject are a bear, and I usually cant wait to be done with them.  Though at times he seems a bit prudish (a la I Kissed Dating Goodbye) the "Josh-Harris-boogeyman" that allegedly exhorts men not to talk to women, and encourages women to wear burlap sacks wherever they go is quickly dispelled after only a few pages of very humble and honest writing about a rather touchy subject.
