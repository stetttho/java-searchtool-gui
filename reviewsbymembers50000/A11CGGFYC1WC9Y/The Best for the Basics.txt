 Bible Doctrine is one of the textbooks I have assigned reading from in a doctrine/theology small group I lead at my church. Edited by Jeff Purswell, Waynge Grudem's 1,200 page Systematic Theology is neatly trimmed down to a mere 450 pages, yet retains the overall force of Grudem's argument. Written in a clear and concise didactic form, Grudem exposits hundreds of Scripture passages that supports his Calvinist/Baptist theology mixed with a dash of Pentecostalism.   The sub-title says "Essentials Teachings of the Christian Faith" which is for the most part true. However, Grudem/Purswell include a chapter called "Male and Female" that simply is a chapter devoted to the subordination of women-something that is hardly "essential."   nevertheless, this is a great book for anyone wanting to learn the basic doctrines of the Christian faith or Calvinistic doctrine. At the end of every chapter there are some review questions for mastering the material and application questions for making the material relevant to real life.
