 This is the best critique of Open Theism on the market today. Frame confronts the idea that God does not know the future exhaustively with a thorough biblical overview on relevant passages pertaining to God's sovereignty. Making his case from the Bible he avoids the pitfalls of name-calling, stereotyping, and alarmism by simply showing the ideas put forth by open theists to be contrary to well established biblical doctrines.   However, the book is different in that it does not deal extensively with issues within the realm of omniscience, but more or less refutes libertarian free will. Thus, it acknowledges at least in practice that the watershed issue in the debate is over free will, not omniscience. John Sanders would at least feel some vindication in this regard.   Nevertheless, the book is accessible and thoughtful and helped convert this reader from open theist to classical Augustinianism.
