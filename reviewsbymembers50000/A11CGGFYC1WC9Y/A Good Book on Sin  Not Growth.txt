 Anyone seeking to understand the basics of Puritan theology via John Owen on the subject of sanctification (growth in Christ) will love this book. It is easy to read, clearly written, and easy to apply. Lundgaard has thoughtfully given us a volume on the difficulty of sin in a believer's life that should be understood with the utmost precision.   However, the book is repetitive and at times overbearing. The theme that kept reoccurring was that believers, at their core have an indubitable force living in them that hates God. There is little to no mention of the Holy Spirit except for the obvious doctrine of regeneration that leads us to accept the truth of the gospel.   This is, no doubt, a great book if you want to learn about sin. However, you will be left with the picture that true godliness is to be hopelessly left in the quagmire of an inner, unending war with the flesh. If you are looking for hope in defeating sin, this book is not the best, but it will give you good knowledge of what you are up against.
