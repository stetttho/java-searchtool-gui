 Dallas Willard follows up themes outlined in his groundbreaking book The Divine Conspiracy where he delineates the idea of "spiritual formation" which is nothing more than "putting on the character of Christ." Willard excels in teaching Sanctification (growth in Christ likeness) by drawing upon historic doctrine and classic theology and putting it into Twenty-First century language. Reading Renovation is informative in that it offers a holistic approach to growth from everything to our bodies and social context to our heart and spirit. This approach is well founded in that it demolishes the false antithesis between body and soul so many spiritual formation books make. Renovation is also inspiring in that it unabashedly proclaims that followers of Christ can actually change and be like him.   However, the book is at times long and tedious in its argumentation. One can finish a chapter and sometimes forget about what it began with, because of the barrage of points Willard attempts to make in a short space.   Instead of regurgitating the Puritanical norm that true godliness is hopelessly struggling with an ever dominating inward force of depravity, Willard offers a real, non-perfectionist hope that by transforming our vision, intent, and means lasting change of the "soul" ( thoughts, feelings, will, body, social context) is obtainable.
