 If you like Mike Moore you should read this book, if you don't like Mike Moore you should definitely read this book.  I have enjoyed Mr. Moore's movies but was leery of his honesty.  I came to find out I had good reason.  Mike Moore doesn't hold up to will under cross-examination, and his "interview" with Heston is a prime example.  I'll spare you the details but disgust is the only logical conclusion.   I suspect that many people will be divided about this book on political lines, but the bottom line is editing is everything and Moore is an example of a talented man who takes his political agenda too far and the first casualty is the truth.
