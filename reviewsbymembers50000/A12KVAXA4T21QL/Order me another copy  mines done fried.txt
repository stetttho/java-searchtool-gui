 I love this album.  I've played it so many time my roommates threaten to hide it from me.  I liked this one better than 'songs for the dead' which I tired of quickly (a friend called it music to strangle cats by).  Queens are evolving and I like the direction better this time around.  I was afraid that this album would be more 'songs for the deaf' slick but sort of soulless.  This is still sort of slick but edgy and pointed.  The album itself is all very good music not hit and miss like their other albums.  Pick it up.
