 This album is amazing.  I was in some dive of a record shop and the owner saw me pawing through Queens (my copies had been stolen) and turned me onto this album.  I was reluctant to buy it but he swore it was a must have (unliike the other deserts sessions apparently).  I was never into PJ Harvey or Ween for that matter but they rock!  PJ especially.  This is a little corner of flip side heaven...except for the 'In my head' which is a-side and a hit but it sounds like the rest of this surprise great album.  Take the plunge!
