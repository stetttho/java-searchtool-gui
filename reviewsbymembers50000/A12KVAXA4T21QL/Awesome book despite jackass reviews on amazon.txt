 This book is one of the best books I have read about the military experience.  This book is funny, in a world that is not funny.  I laughed out loud but that isn't what I'm going to remember about this book.  Swofford is a deeply psychological writer and his insight into himself and other marines is fascinating, engaging,  troubling, and sublime.  His pain and ambivalance is on every page but its not like watching a trainwreck, or a whining political grandstander.  His book is real and his conclusions are not what I wanted to hear but I found I was deeply touched by this book and was forced to respect them and even found myself swayed.  Don't let the bad reviewers kid you.  This book is all that.
