 Throw away every other Nirvana album you own.  This is better than all of then combined.  I'm a big flipside Nirvana fan and this is grunge heaven.  Nirvana was my favorite band in the day and this box set reminds me why they were the greatest band of their time.  This album has everything and more.  I listened to this album and nothing else for a month.  It's that good.  Beware: it's the real deal not for pop lite fans. Played at top volume this will wake the dead and start a mosh pit.  Your kids might even think you're cool.
