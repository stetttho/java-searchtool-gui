 I couldn't put this book down.  Not only was this a very interesting book, well researched, and at times horrifing, it spoke to me the way only a philosopher can.  After enduring years of PC bullsh#t at universities Sam Harris cuts through to the trouble with the Abrahamic religions (none of my professors could) and why 'Faith' kills.  Sam Harris has turned the field of philosophy, what was for me dead letter into vibrant postmodern philosophy and a new look at spritual life.  I can't recommend this book enough.
