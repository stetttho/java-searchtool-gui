 I had seen so many cults on campus at the schools I have attended I think this should be required reading.  Singer takes the disaster that is cult involvement and shows the telltail signs of this plague that is eating away at the fabric of societies vulnerable populations.  Don't be confused though it could happen to anyone and does.  This book could save you or someone you love alot of trouble.  I was never in a cult but had been on the fringes of a couple and could only say I thought the people trying to recuit me were vaguely obnoxious, and manipulative but couldn't really put my finger on what it was because I couldn't identify them as cult members.  This is no longer a problem.  This book is engaging and very important.  Read it for the people in your life and yourself.
