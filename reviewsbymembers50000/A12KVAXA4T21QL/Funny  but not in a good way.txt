 The CIA  has been falling apart for years.  Probably not news after the 9/11 report.  Baer after 20 plus years in the Agency has a tale to tell which is really interesting but not good news.  If you at all interested in the CIA or the beginnings of the war on terror this book is for you.  Bad personel and piss poor policy make this a real eye opener even if you don't lean right.
