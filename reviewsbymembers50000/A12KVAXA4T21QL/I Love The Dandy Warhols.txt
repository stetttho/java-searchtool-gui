 I lived in Portland for three years before moving to Hawaii and when I jones for Portland (which is frequently) I always think of going back to catch a Dandy Warhols show.  They are one of my favorites live but to the point this is probably my favorite album period.  Its definately my favorite Dandy's album.  Maybe I will get those plane tickets they are playing soon......
