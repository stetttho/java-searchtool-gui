 I'd like to say that the author Mary Roach is not my kind of person.  I think she's insensitve and well, really insensitive!!! BUT, I literally couldn't put this book down. My misgivings steming from a post bac certificate in biomedical ethics, and prolife thinking are valid but books aren't really about politics, here anyway.  I don't write long review but if you have ever wondered what China does with all those aborted fetuses, Mary Roach has the answer!  This book at its best, simply horrifing, or at other times transcednent.  Stiff has won so many awards you should read it on that merit alone, but I'm here to tell you its awesome, you won't be disappointed.
