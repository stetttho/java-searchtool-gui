 I moved from Oregon to Hawaii and the lingo is way different.  In fact pidgin is totally undecyperable (if you haolie, bra).  Its all Hawaiian, Fillapino, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, etc spoken so quickly even when the odd English word pops up you aren't sure you know what was said.  Enough about the practical its funny too.  Required reading if you move in the islands if you want to be a local haolie, and not a haolie haolie.
