 I'm in love with Sheryl Crow... not in a creepy stalker way but in that there is no substitute for her music.  This is my favorite of her albums.  If I had a nickel for every time I played this album I'd have several thousand dollars and I'm still tried of it yet.  I have bought so many copies of this album due to theft, breakage, etc. but I'd still by another copy today if it happened again.  You can't go wrong with this one.
