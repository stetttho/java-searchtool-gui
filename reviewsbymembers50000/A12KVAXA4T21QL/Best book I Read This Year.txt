 This may be a stretch for some but worth the effort.  Elshtain upends the moral universe by suggesting the obvious.  Those outside the academic/seminary world may not see the significance but this is a great book.  It seems like a college education can erase some common sense with regard to public policy for reasons understandable given the cynical world we live in but they are often wrong and deadly so.  This book acts as an antidote to a boat load of gibberish from the looney left.
