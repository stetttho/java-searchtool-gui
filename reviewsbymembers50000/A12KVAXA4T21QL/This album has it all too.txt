 I only write reviews about the best of the things I find on amazon.com but to say that '13 tales of ubran bohemia' is the only awesome album put out by the Dandy's is in short blasphemy.  While 13 is the apex so far this album is everything so many artists never achieve even for one song.  The poppy hit is 'not if you were the last junkie on earth' but not the albums best song (I'll let you decide which is).  I'll admit I'm a Portlander but this is too good to miss.
