 I've been quasirepublican since I started voting almost twenty years ago and this is far and away the most damaging book I have read about the far right.  This book is amazingly persuasive, and sharply delineates the direction the new robber barons will take the religious right to accomplish their goals.  I'd recommend reading this book with 'Where the Right went Wrong' by Pat Buchanan.  Frank explains the history of Kansas with regard to populism and how it has changed 180 degrees to the detriment of the working class.  I can't recommend it enough.
