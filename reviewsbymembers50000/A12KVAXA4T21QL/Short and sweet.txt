 My only trouble with this book is that it is short.  Freud shows that atheism isn't necessarily negative.  On the way to that he points out the nature of belief and how it comes up short psycologically even if religion is sort of useful.  I prefer Freud to Nietzsche for his socially positive atheism.  You may too.
