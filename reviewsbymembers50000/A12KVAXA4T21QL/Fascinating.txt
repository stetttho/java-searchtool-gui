 People reviewing this book keep saying that it doesn't contain the phrase 'banality of evil'...  it does right before the epilogue page 252.  Do people ever really read the books they review?  Anyway, this seems like dry mayerial but isn't.  Eichmann seems like joe any guy who goes from mildly stupid underachiver and useless to a mass murderer who never fires a shot.  How is this possible?  Well, it seems that human nature and a group dynamic contribute to the banality of evil that killed so many.  There is a wealth of information about not only the successes of the Reich but what stopped them dead in their tracks.  FYI it wasn't that hard.  I'll never see human nature the same way again..
