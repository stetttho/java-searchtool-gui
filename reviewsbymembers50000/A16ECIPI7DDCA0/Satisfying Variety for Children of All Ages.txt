 Until "Counting Sheep," I had never heard of Collin Raye.  I was leery of buying a children's album and feared that a country artist would put a twang into every song.  That's what I was delighted to discover that  the "children's" and "country" labels unfairly limit  the appeal of this outstanding album.   Each song has a color and style  all its own, and Raye has the power, tenderness, and versatility to handle  all this variety in a fresh and pleasing way.  "Cool Cat" swings.   The upbeat "I'm Gonna Love You" is reminiscent of Hank Williams.   "A Mother and Father's Prayer," written by duet partner Melissa  Manchester, is an uplifting power ballad.  "Too Ra Loo Ra Loo  Ral"'s Irish folk-flavored arrangement shines an arresting, new light  on this familiar tune.  Equally moving is the use of back-up singers on the  Disney classic, "When You Wish Upon a Star."  Raye turns in an  awesome cover of the Beatles' "Blackbird," with drums and layered  organ adding a rich touch.  Even the title track achieves a "Penny  Lane"-esque texture, especially on the horns.   In the liner notes,  Raye expresses his hope that these songs will appeal to kids.  But  shouldn't adults deserve songs filled with happiness, inspiration, comfort,  and hope, too?
