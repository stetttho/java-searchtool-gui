 The "easy listening" label which has stuck to Andy Williams doesn't do justice to his power, expansive range, and impeccable control.  This is particularly evident on his blockbuster 1972 "Godfather" album, featuring his Top 40 hit single of the same title that he ends on a note somewhere in the stratosphere.  Other highlights include a compelling version of Legrand & Bergman's "Theme from 'Summer of '42,'" which Columbia should have released as a single, and a brassy, knockout reading of Jimmy Webb's "MacArthur Park," which Andy still performs in concert today.  Williams' husky falsetto and pop sensibility enables him to pull off three soft-rock hits of the era -- "Precious and Few," "Imagine," and a multi-tracked "Everything I Own" -- with sensitivity and aplomb. "The Way We Were," released in 1974, features more '70s pop covers, including "You're the Best Thing That Ever Happened to Me," "Killing Me Softly with Her Song," and "The Most Beautiful Girl in the World."  Andy's powerful tenor soars on "If I Could Only Go Back Again," a ballad co-written by the album's producer, Mike Curb, and Alan Osmond of the Osmond Brothers.  Although the arrangements were supervised by Don Costa (veteran of many of Sinatra's later sessions), they sometimes get a little string-heavy and are more conservative than the Artie Butler and Al Capps charts on "Godfather."  Two cool exceptions are the covers of the Love Unlimited Orchestra's instrumental hit, "Love's Theme," and Diana Ross' "Touch Me in the Morning."  Through it all, Williams shines with his usual thoughtful and pleasing tones.
