 As this intriguing 2-on-1 pairing shows, Andy Williams is more than an easy-listening balladeer. "Days of Wine and Roses and Other TV Requests" finds Williams adroitly tackling an array of musical styles showcased on his '60s NBC variety series. He captures jazzy, big band exuberance on splashy charts like "Falling in Love with Love" and "It's a Most Unusual Day." There's a frenetic, death-defyingly complex version of "You Are My Sunshine," featuring Williams in triple-tracked vocal harmony. The melancholy title cut, number two hit single "Can't Get Used to Losing You," and sentimental TV show closer, "May Each Day," all became Williams standards. This album sailed the charts for more than a year, perched at the number one spot for four months in 1963. "In the Arms of Love" is an exceptional 1966 release. The first half features romantic ballads (including the Henry Mancini-penned title track) set against lush, string-filled backdrops -- perfect for the Williams purr. But the real gems of this album are the last six tracks, which get delightful bossa nova and samba treatments that compliment Andy's ultra-cool vocals perfectly. The congas on "A Man and a Woman" are a knockout, as is Dave Grusin's chic, uptempo arrangement of "All Through the Night." Because Williams' light touch is so well suited to this material, it is unfortunate that he did not devote an entire album to Brazilian-influenced material, as Sinatra did with Antonio Carlos Jobim (Williams and Jobim did record two Jobim tunes for Andy's 1966 "The Shadow of Your Smile" LP).
