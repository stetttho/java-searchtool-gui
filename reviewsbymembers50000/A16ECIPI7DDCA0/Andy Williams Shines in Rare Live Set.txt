 Live albums are typically full of imperfections, and Andy Williams has always been a recording studio perfectionist.  Thus, for him to record his first American live album (his only other live album was recorded in Japan  in 1974) meant venturing outside his comfort zone.  But he needn't have  worried, for his performances were top-notch for this soundtrack of a 1994  PBS special from his Branson, Missouri theater.   With his unmistakable  voice still in excellent form, it's hard to believe that he originally  recorded most of these songs more than 30 and 40 years ago.  Yet the  arrangements are fresh and satisfying.  His range and control are very much  intact on the demanding themes from "Love Story" and "The  Godfather."  His signature song, "Moon River," ends more  dramatically than his 1962 original, thanks to a sweeping chart that  composer Henry Mancini gave him in the late '60s.  There's a big, brassy  version of "Our Love Is Here to Stay" that Andy obviously enjoys  belting out.  Unlike his 1972 studio version of "MacArthur Park,"  the live version here also includes the first movement of the Jimmy Webb  classic, with its soaring chorus.  Another rare treat is a peppy medley  ("medley" is misleading, for he performs each song in its  entirety) of his 1950s Cadence hits, including his number one rockabilly  single, "Butterfly."   This is a great introduction to perhaps  the most underrecognized singer of his generation.  Perhaps I should  mention another reason for enjoying this album so much: I penned the liner  notes.
