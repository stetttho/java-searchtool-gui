 These two classic Columbia LPs offer interesting snapshots of the changing pop music scene in the mid-'60s, as well as Andy Williams' ability to adapt to it.  "Dear Heart" (1965) largely contains ballad standards,  warmly executed in the traditional pop style.  Highlights include the  tender "Emily," "Almost There" (from Williams' only  film, "I'd Rather Be Rich," co-starring Sandra Dee), and Andy's  hit version of the Henry Mancini title track. The more interesting album  is "The Shadow of Your Smile" (1966), which finds Andy  experimenting with songs of the Beatles, including "Michelle," in  which the lilting, lush orchestration is well-suited to Andy's cool reading  of the song's French lyrics.  In contrast is a hot, swinging cover of  "A Taste of Honey."  Williams' guest on this album is bossa nova  godfather Antonio Carlos Jobim, who sits in on guitar on two of his  compositions, "Meditation" and "How  Insensitive."   Andy's right at home with Jobim, using orchestrations which borrow heavily  from the Claus Ogerman charts used on Jobim's own albums.  But how  insensitive, indeed, that Jobim (who guested a number of times on Andy's  NBC-TV variety series) is not credited on this reissue, even though his  name and photo appeared on the back of the original LP jacket.
