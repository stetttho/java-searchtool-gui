 I came of age musically in the 1970s, which is when I first became acquainted with Frank Sinatra.  By this time, his voice had long been in decline, and he was experimenting with questionable contemporary material  like "It's Not Easy Being Green" and that hideous disco version  of "Night and Day."  I did like him then, but he sounded tired  bellowing his way through latter-day concert versions of his 1950s-era  hits.  Yes, he sang as if he had lived his songs, but I still wondered why  his longtime fans consistently used superlatives to describe  him. Acquiring this CD and listening to The Voice upclose and personal  finally awakened me to the genius that everybody has been applauding for  generations.  The Capitol-era Sinatra possessed a rare combination of  subtlety, control, spontaneity, and swagger that are evident on these  classic '50s sides.  I can feel the lilt in his step on "I've Got the  World on a String" and the fragility and heartbreak in "One for  My Baby."  His phrasing of "Come Dance with Me" and "I  Get a Kick Out of You" ("It would bore me terriFFFFFFFF - ic'ly  too") is delightfully playful and inspired.  It is now obvious to me  why so many regard Sinatra as the quintessential American pop singer. If  you're new to Sinatra and overwhelmed by the avalanche of CDs to choose  from, you'll have no regrets buying this one first.
