 Somewhere beneath the avalanche of accolades for Sinatra and Bennett, Andy Williams remains one of America's most underrecognized pop vocalists.  In addition to the sheer beauty of his smokey high baritone, husky falsetto,  power, diction, and superb control, Williams is one of the few from the old  school who remained open to the changing musical scene that emerged in the  1960s.  Eventually, in addition to singing the great standards, he branched  out to embrace country, pop, rock, gospel, Christmas, and even disco  tunes. In the late '60s and early '70s, Williams covered many of the hits  of the period.  "Love Story" illustrates his ability to present  these songs in ways comfortable for him, while retaining their contemporary  feeling.  Where other vocalists might have sounded awkward, Andy pulled it  off, because he really got into the spirit of these tunes, as well as the  contemporary style in which they were written. Highlights include  intimate versions of Elton John's "Your Song," George Harrison's  "Something," and James Taylor's "Fire and Rain."   There's a gospel-tinged reading of "My Sweet Lord."  Andy even  tackles unlikely teen ditties like "Candida" and "I Think I  Love You" and turns them into his own.  Artie Butler lends his modern  horn- and guitar-dominated touches to the arrangements, as he did on charts  for Mark Lindsay ("Silverbird," "Arizona") and Helen  Reddy ("I Am Woman"). Although concentrating on covers during  this period, Williams continued to break his own hits.  As the title track  proves, he never abandoned the great standards.  His sweeping version of  the vocally demanding theme from "Love Story" became a top ten  hit in 1971 and remains one of his most requested songs.  Notably, this  album peaked at number three, achieving gold and platinum status in a year  when the other top ten slots were occupied by the likes of Janis Joplin,  Santana, Jimi Hendrix, and Chicago.
