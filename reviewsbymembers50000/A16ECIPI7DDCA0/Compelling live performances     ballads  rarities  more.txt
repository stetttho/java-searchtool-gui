 ANDY WILLIAMS LIVE: TREASURES FROM HIS PERSONAL COLLECTION captures previously unreleased live performances by this enduring prince of American pop. The 31 tracks from the '60s and early '70s find Williams in his prime, his straight-ahead, smooth style gracing not only his trademark ballads, but a wide array of classic pop tunes, from Ellington and Mancini to Bacharach and the Beatles.  Highlights include an exuberant, sophisticated arrangement of "Call Me," a belt-out, big band version of "Charade," sensitive ballad interpretations of "Can't Help Falling in Love" and the bossa nova "Corcovado," and a rocking cool reading of "Can't Take My Eyes Off You."  With his smoky-toned tenor and impeccable musicianship, Williams could adroitly tackle any style. There are rarities that have never appeared on a Williams album or single before: "The Summer Wind," "Do Nothing Till You Hear from Me," "What the World Needs Now," "Call Me," and a haunting Johnny Mercer tune, "Autumn." Andy's signature hits are here, too, often with attractive arrangements that differ from the original Columbia studio versions. Here is a great way for longtime Andy-fans to enjoy him in a rarely available, new light. New fans of the great pop singers will discover why Andy Williams ruled the '60s as America's leading crooner, and why he now deserves a long overdue second look.
