 The "easy listening" label which has stuck to Andy Williams doesn't do justice to his power, wide range, and impeccable control.  This CD focuses on vocally and stylistically challenging singles that he  recorded in the late '60s and early '70s. "(Where Do I Begin) Love  Story" had a tricky melody and demanding range that Williams executed  smoothly and dramatically, earning him a 1971 Top 10 hit.  His cover of  Jimmy Webb's classic "MacArthur Park" displayed a vocal  virtuosity that Richard Harris' more familiar version never pretended to  have.  And he ended his 1972 hit "Love Theme from 'The  Godfather'" on a note somewhere in the stratosphere. With go-go  beat, blazing electric guitars, and double-tracked vocals, "Music to  Watch Girls By" was Andy's unlikely version of a 1967 TV commercial  theme for Diet Pepsi.  In 1999, thanks to its use in a British commercial  for Fiat, the re-released record entered the British charts at number 9 and  spawned a huge Andy Williams revival in England. Williams' tragic version  of Leon Russell's "A Song for You," a 1971 forerunner to the  modern power ballad, was the first single of this song to chart.  It would  be covered by the Carpenters in 1974 and Ray Charles in 1990 (the latter  even borrowed the piano intro from Andy's version). Williams' relaxed  sense of style is evident in the 1973 cover pic, which finds him jumping  through a collage of photos of himself, donned in an all-black outfit.
