 The four Columbia LPs comprising this boxed set illustrate Andy Williams' uncanny ability to adapt to the evolving pop music scene of the '60s.  "Dear Heart" (1965) consists of ballad standards (including  Andy's hit version of the Henry Mancini title track), warmly executed in  the traditional pop style.  "The Shadow of Your Smile" (1966)  finds Andy experimenting with hits of the Beatles, including a pleasingly  lush "Michelle" and a hot, swinging "A Taste of Honey."   Sitting in on guitar is Antonio Carlos Jobim, the godfather of bossa nova,  on his compositions, "Meditation" and "How  Insensitive."  Ironically, how insensitive that Jobim is not credited  on this reissue, since his name and photo appeared on the back of the  original LP jacket. Starting with "Born Free" (1967), Andy  began focusing on covers of Top 40 hits.  New producer/arranger Nick DeCaro  emphasized the rhythm section, creating a younger sound especially evident  on "Music to Watch Girls By," a vocal version of a Diet Pepsi  instrumental theme.  Complete with go-go beat, blazing electric guitars,  and double-tracked vocals, "Girls" made it into the Top 40 in  1967; but thanks to its recent use in a Fiat TV ad in England, the reissued  single climbed to no. 9 on the British charts in 1999, launching an Andy  Williams U.K. revival. Perhaps the best album of the four is the richly  textured "Love, Andy" (1967), also produced by DeCaro.  The  rhythm and horn sections are hot, while Andy's vocals are ultra-cool.   Highlights include Burt Bacharach's "The Look of Love" and a  far-out "Kisses Sweeter Than Wine," with its arresting beat and  Andy's triple-tracked vocals.  There's a hip, sophisticated treatment of  "Can't Take My Eyes Off You" (revived in a 1998 British ad for  Peugeot).  Also noteworthy is an innovative classical arrangement of Brian  Wilson's "God Only Knows," featuring Lincoln Mayorga on piano.
