 I purchased this book to further my self-study of Physics. Simply put, this is the best written book I have read on any math subject (although Spivak's Calculus is also very good, but is on a different topic). A wonderful feature of this book is the problems - and complete solutions - provided throughout. The problems are not so extensive that you will skip them (there about 10-20 per chapter, as opposed to many other texts which have fifty or more) nor so difficult that you will give up in frustration. Indeed, for self study, the simple fact that there are answers is key; the fact that they are not of the sort where you are asked to derive new math or otherwise are treated as if you are a "student who believes he is to become the next Einstein" is a refreshing change. This book covers vectors (of course), various vector integrals (line, surface, and volume integrals), and gradient, divergence and curl (if you ever wondered what that odd upside down triangle symbol is, you will learn), before moving into more advanced topics. It briefly covers "suffix notation" and tensors, as well as transformations into different coordinate systems. In sum, about half the book is wonderful and immediately useful, and the other half will become more useful as I encounter it in the course of learning physics. That said, I wish it went into more detail in the "suffix notation" section, which is quite confusing (although several readings helps) as well as more on tensors, which extensively employs the suffix notation. I have been told, without confirmation, that Springer is known for it's clarity; this book certainly is extremely clear, well written, and has allowed me to finally begin to understand many parts of mathematical physics which were previously Greek to me.
