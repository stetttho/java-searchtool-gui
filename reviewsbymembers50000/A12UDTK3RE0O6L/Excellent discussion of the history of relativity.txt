 Kip Thorne, a noted Caltech relativist (physicist specializing in Relativity), writes about the history of Special and General relativity, specifically focusing on the concept of Black Holes. He not only manages to describe, verbally, the meaning of Relativity, but also gives an engaging account of 100 years of history (until about 1993). He begins with the foundations which Einstein built upon with his 1905 and 1915 theories of Special and General Relativity. After that he discusses various discoveries about these theories and their predictions. Perhaps the most interesting thing that one learns is how often the same thing is discovered independently by different researchers in different fields - often decades apart - before realizing it's all the same thing, or that a solution 30 years ago is applicable to a problem today. His style is engaging, and there was never - in over 500 pages of prose - a point where I was left thinking that I wanted to skip the rest of the page, chapter, or book. The pictures are almost all uniformly excellent and add a lot of value. Furthermore, he has an excellent glossary of terms, timeline, brief bios of the main people discussed in the text, and an excellent index.  I read this book at the same time as working through Taylor and Wheeler's "Spacetime Physics" (before reading their sequel "Exploring Black Holes"). Believe me, if you're interested in relativity, black holes, astronomy/astrophysics, from either a lay person point of view, or as an independent self-studier (as am I), this book will enlighten and help you understand many of the trickier, less intuitive parts of relativity. Highly recommended.
