 When first learning bridge almost a decade ago, I had Sheinwold's classic book (Five Weeks to Winning Bridge) and this one. This book was by and far the better; furthermore, it has remained a book that is constantly re-readable. Each time through I pick up another fascet of the game from Goren and his editors (since he died). The bidding system used is what is commonly known as a "two over one game force" which, in my opinion, is a very powerful system. It does take a little bit more study than a purely natural system, but not much. Although I well recommend this book for any serious beginner, even a complete beginner, my wife found the "Bridge for Dummies" (Eddie Kantar) book more accessible. Of course, she was only learning Bridge because I asked her to play with me... After all, what good is a wife if not a permanent Bridge partner? In any event, I highly recommend the Kantar work as well. A final word: despite the book's age, it is not at all dated.
