 I tend to read much more non-fiction than fiction these days, especially science non-fiction from a layman's perspective. This book was quite enjoyable because it touches on so many facets of mathematics all due to one number. If you have ever wondered about the types of numbers (integers, rationals, transcendentals), or the famous equation e ^ (pi * i) + 1 = 0, then this explains it all in an enjoyable fashion. The author discusses the history of the number, which makes it much more accessible; you almost feel as if you were learning about it along with the original researchers.
