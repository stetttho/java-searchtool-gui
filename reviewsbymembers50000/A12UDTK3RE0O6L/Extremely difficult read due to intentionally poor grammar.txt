 The author adopts a very unusual convention in the prose of this entire book: he regularly begins sentences with conjunctions. In my opinion, and after making quite a few attempts to read more than a few pages, this book is nigh unreadable because of it...The author makes no secret of this convention; indeed, he discusses this choice in the beginning of the "notes" section of the book. Unfortunately, his justification is hollow, as most of his sentences and paragraphs would stand perfectly well without the ubiquitous beginning "buts," "fors," "yets," and "ands." Paragraphs with every sentence beginning with a conjunction - including even the first - regularly make an appearance. I highly recommend avoiding this book if you are the type of person who is in the least bit troubled by poor grammar, typos, poor sentence flow, or awkward sentence structure. Being of this sort myself, I found my train of thought interrupted regularly,   unable to absorb any of the material due to this unorthodox style. Eventually I found myself simply scanning the words, without comprehension, hoping to avoid the constantly jarring leading conjunctions. At that point, after quite a few tries over several days in attempting to read this book, I set it aside.  Hopefully a second edition will come out with orthodox grammar, but it is unlikely, as the author seems to take a relatively egoistic tone throughout. Read the first chapter of the "notes" when you browse the book in a store to get a feel for this egoism, or the preface to get a feel for his grammar. I apologize for not providing a decent review of the content of the book (as in my typical reviews), but the presentation problems prevented me from absorbing any of the content anyway.
