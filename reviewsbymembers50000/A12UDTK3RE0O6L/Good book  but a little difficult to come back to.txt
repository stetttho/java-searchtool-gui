 This series is very interesting, engrossing, and full of interesting characters, technology, and philosopies, all set in a very plausible future for humankind only 700 years off. This book is very similar in structure to Red Storm Rising, by Tom Clancy, in the large number of overlapping story lines going on. Unfortunately, after the long hiatus from the preceeding four books in the series (technically, he calls them two books in two volumes each) coming back to it was a little challenging. Fortunately, though, he includes a full six page cast of characters in the front of the book, as well as a "timeline" in the rear, which helped during the first 50-100 pages until the rest came back to me. Another very good book set in the same universe is "A Second Chance at Eden." This is a book of short stories, and was a very enjoyable read while waiting for this book to be published. As with his other books, don't expect to put this down until you finish it - and it will take a while, with his detailed story, engrossing style, and 600+ pages of goodness.
