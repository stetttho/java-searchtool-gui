 ....I found this book to be relatively well written, but tediously boring. This book should probably be considered "Recreational Mathematics" and is jammed with math; very little prose accompanies it. Indeed, if you do not love math, or do not love math for the sake of math (rather than, say, a physicist who merely loves math for the sake of his primary interest in physics) then you will probably not enjoy this book. The prose that the book contains seems to attempt to relate the various math that Gazale demonstrates to practical problems, especially in electrical engineering. I found these analogies to be difficult to follow and did not create much understanding of the material. For example, he discusses resonant LCR circuits and power transmission lines, and his descriptions pale in comparison to those I found in Feynman's "Lectures on Physics." Now,... this book has a number of useful things in it which is why I say it's "well written." It does include mathematical summaries in the end of every chapter. In my opinion, this was the best part of the book. By reading only the summaries, the reader "takes away" most of what the author is trying to say, without having to suffer through the rest of it. If the summary is not self-evident, the reader can always go back to the chapter to divine how one of the entries in the summary was derived. All in all, I would not recommend this book to those interested in anything other than math for math's sake. If your interest lies elsewhere, or even only obliquely in math (such as in learning math for a specific use), then avoid this book. However, if you do enjoy a mathematical romp, then this book could well be the one for you.
