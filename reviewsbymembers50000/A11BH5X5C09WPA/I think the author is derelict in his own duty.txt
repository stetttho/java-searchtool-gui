 People that kiss and tell are despicable.   Whatever your thoughts on the Clinton Presidency, you'd think that a professional military officer, even a retired officer, would have a little more going for him than to turn to muck raking after he retired.   If the author was so disgusted with the leadership, he should have requested reassignment or resigned.  I suppose he was just looking for his next paycheck.  How sad.
