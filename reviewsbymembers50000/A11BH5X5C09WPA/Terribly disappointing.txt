 It has been a long time since I have been this disappointed by an author whose work I used to love. In DEAD HAND, Mr Coyle produced an indifferent plot, paper thin characters, no focal point, and an awful ending.   There appeared to be no particular main character, the combat scenes were nowhere nearly as descriptive as they have been in his other novels, and he ended the book leaving numerous loose ends. No need for me to go on, other than to say that I recommend passing on this book.  It was awful.
