 Anyone that has  heard this album will tell you that it is difficult to hear without feeling the need to move.  Tap your feet, clap, dance, whatever... just don't sit still!  Seven Nations has produced some fine music in the past, but their live performances, from large venues right down to smaller clubs, never disappoint, and with "Palace Theater" you feel like you are right there with them. This is a fine album, and will probably be remembered as their best.
