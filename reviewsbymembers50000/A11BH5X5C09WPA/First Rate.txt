 Michael McDonald has done good service to those artists whose songs he covered in this collection.  I think the comparisons to Michael Bolton that I have seen in other reviews is unfair. McDonald has a strong soulful quality to his voice, and delivers song after song with clarity and sincerity. If you liked the original standards that he covers here, I think you will truly enjoy the breath of fresh air that McDonald injects into them. You won't be disappointed.
