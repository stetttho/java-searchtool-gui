 This is an excellent "Near Future" trilogy.  The author does a nice job of wrapping up the series while setting us up for another series at the same time.  This trilogy was well worth the read, and I plan to read it again.  If you are a fan of military science fiction, Mr Douglas will not disappoint you.
