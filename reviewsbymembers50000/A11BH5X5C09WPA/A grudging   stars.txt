 I have greatly enjoyed Kent's Bolitho Novels, mainly because I had read Hornblower as well as the Aubrey/Maturin novels, and was infected with the love of the genre. I'll not compare Bolitho to those other worthies as he is not them nor they him, however I do think that Mr Kent should have killed off our more-than-maudlin Admiral in book 17 or 18. I found this book a nice way to spend my reading time for a day or so, but in truth, I can't recommend it as one of Kent's best.
