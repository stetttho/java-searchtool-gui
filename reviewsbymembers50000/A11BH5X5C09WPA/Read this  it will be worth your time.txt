 I finally picked up "Sharpe's Rifles" months after having the series recommended to me by a friend.  I wish I hadn't waited.  Although I read a lot of military fiction, I have never read anything about the Napoleonic wars.  Cornwell actually brings the battles to life, from the cries of the dying and wounded to the smell of the smoke of the battlefield.  All of the cahracters come to life, and are exemplary of the kind of lives lived by the soldiers and officers of the era.  It is obvious that Cornwell did his homework here. Richard Sharpe is a well developed character, an everyman that developed not only into a super warrior, but also into a superb leader of warriors. In this novel the author gets right down to the story, and wastes no time getting to the heart of the story.  The writing is straightforward and clean. Highly recommended
