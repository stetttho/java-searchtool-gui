 I don't know what else to say that hasn't been said, so I'll be brief. Turtledove is a great storyteller, and I usually feel sympathetic towards his characters, and these characters are no different.  I enjoyed the beginning of the book that set up the story, and I enjoyed the plot device in which the beginnings of the crumbling of the Reich paralelled that of the crumbling of the Soviet Union. All of the other stuff in between left me fairly cold. Not Turtledove's best... but lets be honest, even this guy's so-so stuff is better than most of what is out there.
