 Mr Clancy, this was a bitter disappointment. I had hoped that after the disaster that was "Rainbow Six" you would have made a little more effort this time around.  * You have turned your main character, Jack Ryan, into a know-nothing Buchananite Libertarian that has nothing for disdain for the people that serve their country by working in government (except for soldiers and cops). Not to mention that he swears entirely too much.  * You have shown an apalling lack of attention to detail regarding the geography of the DC area, which is a shame as you live so nearby. NOTE: A north-bound ship, heading for the Washington Navy Yard needn't pass under the John Phillip Sousa bridge... You meant the South Capitol Street bridge... which isn't a drawbridge. * Your plots are thinner and thinner. * Your addition of gratuitous sex scenes is an indicator of a lack of imagination or immaturity * Your combat scenes are ludicrous * Your overuse of Secret Service codenames was silly. * People (even us awful slackers in government) rarely refer to the President as POTUS, and even more rarely do they refer to the First Lady as FLOTUS. In closing, your work was overwrought, over-written, and just plain ol' poor. It is obvious that you didn't do much research for this novel, and that you REALLY do need to reunite with Larry Bond.
