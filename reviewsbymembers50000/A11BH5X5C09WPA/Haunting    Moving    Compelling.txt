 ...these are some of the words that come to mind when hearing this CD for the first time.  These words are magnified with each subsequent listening. Like many of the reviewers of this CD, I am not a long-time Johnny Cash fan, but I know greatness whn I hear it.  To keep this brief, let me just say that the songs on this CD are wonderful.  "The Man Comes Around " is a great start, and it only gets better after that.  The late Mr Cash added several covers to his own songs, but added gravitas to recordings of "Bridge Over Troubled Waters", "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face" and others, that the original artists couldn't hope to match. Cash lends the authority of his long life to this collection of  songs, and I don't mind telling you that this is one of the best CD's we have ever purchased. Highly recommended.
