 Varley has done good work here.  Simply said, he had a story to tell and did it in fine style.   This story is a reminder of the early days of science fiction space opera.  There is a solid cast of colorful characters, each with their own personalities, and not one of them a cardboard cut-out. If you like space opera, read this book.  If you like well-told tales, read this book.  If you want to spend some enjoyable time while you are on vacation, or are taking a long drive or a flight, if you just want something to read, if you want something that is uplifting, then just go ahead and read this book.
