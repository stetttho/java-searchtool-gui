  ...some of the tough things that we, as black Americans, should have been saying for many many years.  Ms Dickerson deserves full marks for having the courage to skewer many of the sacred cows that we have been praying to for so many years.  Further, she doesn't shrink from taking stab at today's almost-useless civil rights leaders.  It is time, and past time for us to be proud of who we are for what we are and what we have done in this country.  Not because white people will acknowledge it... some will, some won't, but so what?  The acknowledgement of others shouldn't be the goal of ethnic pride.  That said, it should also be said that ethnic pride shouldn't be a bar to the pride that comes from being an American.   It is time, and past time for us to stop seeing ourselves only in comparison to how we are treated by white people... or any other people, including other black people.  Black Americans have done remarkable things.  We are inseparably woven into the fabric of American history and society.  It is time, and past time for us to stop pretending that we exist outside of American society.  We don't.  This is our country, we are full citizens... let's act like it.  We should walk tall, be proud, look others in the eye and smile, or not..., but not because of hostility, but because we are sure of ourselves and our great role in the building, and the success of this country.  We ought not wait for the approval of other people to feel good about ourselves.  This is childish behavior.  This book could have been written better, and I don't agree with every word that is printed here, but what Dickerson wrote needed to be said.  Dickerson is right... the mind truly is the last plantation, and all we need do is walk out through the open gate and decide to opt in.
