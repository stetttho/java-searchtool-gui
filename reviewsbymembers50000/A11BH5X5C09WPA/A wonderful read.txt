 I read this book in 1988, when I was a young Marine stationed in Washington, DC.  In the 16 years since, I have read it four more times.  This book isn't literature, and it isn't high art, but it is damned good.    Grimwood tells a tight story, with just a few central characters... he isn't trying to paint broad vistas, so don't expect that.  The story is at times romantic, and at times rather grim, but it is entertaining throughout.  When you get right down to it, this is a story about the self-examined life... wouldn't we all like to experience just a little of what Pamela and Jeff did?  To be able to do some things different in our lives, or at least re-enjoy the special things from our old memories?  If you are looking for hard science fiction, this isn't it, but I think that if you have the slightest bit of wonder in you, you will enjoy this book.
