 ...and so are most of the usual suspects in Griffin's excellent "Corps" series. I enjoyed this novel a great deal and am heartened by the fact that it appears that Griffin is planning to continue it.  The story is good, and well written. My only criticism is that the editing could have been tighter. I caught more than a few spelling errors.  If you are a fan of military fiction, you will enjoy this book. I highly recommend it.  (think that there is any chance that McCoy & company will encounter Craig Lowell or "Mouse" Felter in Korea?)
