 I won't rehash the story... if you are reading this, you have seen enough of that already from other reviewers.  What I will tell you, is that Judson has given us a "future history" unlike any most of us have ever seen.  The scope of the story is wide without being to wide to take it all in.  The characters are developed well enough to see the things that drive them.  The descriptions of wholesale slaughter in battle are done well enough to make you nearly feel as if you were there, without getting wrapped up in techno-war speak or gratuitous desriptions.  The main characters, of Fitz, Buck, Hood, and Robert are well done, and I hope that Judson will again, someday give us a glimpse into the world of the Yukon Confederacy.  Full marks!
