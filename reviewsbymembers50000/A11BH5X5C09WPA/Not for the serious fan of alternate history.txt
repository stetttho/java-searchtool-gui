 I believe that the writers had a good, if fanciful, idea when they came up with the premise for this book.  Even the unlikely separate peace with the Soviets was an interesting take.   The problem with this book is in the  writing.  The authors are proffessional game designers which, I am sure  helped in working out the fictional tactics and strategies used by the  combatants, but, they should have employed a writer to at least help them  with their style and substance.  I found the characters to be flat and in  some cases cartoonish.  The authors use of German was poor at best, ham  fisted at worst.   Read this book if you have a few hours to kill, but if  you have anything better to do, like trim your toenails, take a pass.
