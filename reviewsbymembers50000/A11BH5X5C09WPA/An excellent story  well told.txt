 I enjoyed this book.  It was different, exciting in most places, and fun to read.  I think that Stirling has a great imagination and, if the previous reviews indicate anything, he makes the reader think.  Many previous reviewers have strong opinions, of one sort or another, about the morality of the scenario/author/characters, but it should be remembered that this is a story.  Did you hear what I said?  A story.  It isn't about the author's opinions or his politics.  Having said that, I will say that Stirling has never let me down, and I enjoy his work immensely.  Well done!
