 Once again Stirling shows that he ranks right alongside Turtledove in the alternate history genre.  If you are reading this you probably already read the book, but if you haven't, stop reading this and go out and get it.  No  need for me to synopsize, as that has already been done, but I must say  that Stirling knows how to write a combat scene and shows, throughout the  series, that he knows a great deal about the brotherhood of arms.  Further,  Stirling seems to know from whence he speaks regarding firearms... The fact  that the armed forces of The Repubic of Nantucket are using copies of the  Colt Python as their standard sidearm speaks well for Stirling, as the  Python is the finest revolver ever produced.  I look forward to the next  installment.
