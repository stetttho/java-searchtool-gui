 Despite the opening of the book, I settled in to enjoy it.  Birmingham seems to have been successful at, what I am certain is, the intentional tail-twisting of some American conservatives by naming a ship after the fictional President H. Clinton, but that isn't the sum of this book's parts.  Like many, I didn't care for the language of some of the female characters... but, this is a novel, so I took it for what it was worth.  I think his one big glaring flaw comes from his lack of study done about the U.S. Marine Corps.  There are no Doctors in the Corps... medical personnel are supplied by the navy.  Naturally, as a USMC veteran, I would notice that.  The author, being Australian, is completely forgiven.  Birmingham tells a story that is fun to read, and will be enjoyed by people who are fans of the genre.  As a military fiction fan, I would have enjoyed more detailed descriptions for the weapons, but hey, you can't have everything.  This book is fun to read.  Don't take things too seriously and enjoy yourself with it.
