 I received my copy of Rugby for Dummies this past friday, and have learned a great deal already.  I have recently become interested in learning about Rugby, and finding this book was a godsend.  The authors talk about the game and equipment in terms that someone with no prior knowledge can easily digest.  They resist the over-usage of jargon and where they do use jargon, they explain what they are talking about in a way that doesn't leave the reader sitting there scratching his/her head.  I plan to continue my exploration of the world of Rugby, and Rugby For Dummies has become my chief reference.   Kudos to the authors!
