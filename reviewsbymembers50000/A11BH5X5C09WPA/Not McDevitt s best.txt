 ...but still a very good read. Maybe I'm just not very bright, as some other reviews might suggest, but I enjoyed McDevitt's story mainly because the "Goompah" characters were as human as they were (no, I don't enjoy Barney). McDevitt left most of the "wonder" of discovery out of this story, deciding instead to tell the tale of a race about to face the Omegas rather than repeat the story of finding planets and remnants of civilisations that have already fought and lost their battle with the clouds. I thought it was well done, and will continue to enjoy McDevitt's future work.
