 Jeff Fallow does good work here.  He takes the complex world of Scottish history with all of it's twists, turns, and outrages and makes enjoyable reading for the newly interested. I read this book over a year ago, and still refer to it from time to time. If you are interested in Scottish history, and don't know where to begin your studying, try this.  At the very least, you will have an instant reference guide and a good place to start.
