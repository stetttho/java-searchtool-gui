 I won't rehash the novel, but I'll tell you that if you have ANY interest in alternate history, read Harry Turtledove's books. Dr. Turtledove has never disappointed me, and if you have reading tastes anything like mine, I am certain that he won't disappoint you, either. This novel is no different. Turtledove tells a fine story. Read the first books in the series, and then read "The Center Cannot Hold". You'll be glad you did.
