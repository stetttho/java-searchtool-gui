 Alternate history is a funny thing... when it is good, it can be some of the most compelling fiction ever printed, but when it is bad it can well and truly stink up an entire room.   Alternate Generals 2 falls somewhere in the middle.   Some of the stories are interesting, particularly the one based on the premise of a Buonaparte empire in the new world.  Others weren't nearly as good. Spend a short time with this book and you will have spent a tolerable afternoon, but only if you didn't plunk down 25 dollars for it.
