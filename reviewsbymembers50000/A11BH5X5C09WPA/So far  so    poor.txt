 I bought this book at lunch time yesterday, anxious to see what Clancy has  been up to since the release of Rainbow Six.  Naturally I don't know what  he has been up to, but it hasn't been paying attention to deatil.  Pardon  me for nitpicking, but I feel that I must.   In the first chapter, Clancy  refers to a character as a National Intelligence Officer.  In beltwayspeak,  this person would be referred to as a NIO (rhymes with Geo).  A NIO is an  intelligence officer that gathers collected intelligence data and prepares,  then delivers daily intelligence summaries for The President.  He goes on  to describe this NIO as being at CIA HQ in Langley, Virginia, preparing a  briefing, then DRIVING (during the DC rush hour!) to the White House and  going to his office.  On the next page, this NIO is revealed to be the  National Security Advisor. Again, this may be overly picky, but please!   The National Security Advisor to the President of The United States doesn't  drive to CIA HQ, then drive to the White House.  Further, the National  Security Advisor doesn't normally present the daily intelligence  summary For someone as clued in as Clancy was always purported to be,  this seems quite shoddy.  One wonders if all of his good ideas went out the  window when Larry Bond went off to write on his own. I'll have more when  I am finished
