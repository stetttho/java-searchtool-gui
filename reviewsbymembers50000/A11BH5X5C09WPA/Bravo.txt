 Urban does fine work here.  Like many other reviewers, I have come to this work by way of several different fiction series' about the Napoleonic period.  My particular interests in the famed Riflemen of the 95th comes directly from my exposure to Cornwell's "Richard Sharpe" novels.  My wife gave this book to me as a Christmas gift, and amply demonstrated just one of the many reasons I love her so much.  This book was a great read!  Plain and simple.  It has it all... cowardice, humor, bravery under fire, soldierly comradeship, human failings, honorable (and despicable) behavior, and plenty of action.  Best of all, it's all true!  If you have an interst in the period, particularly about the penninsular campaign, you will be doing yourself a favor by reading this book.
