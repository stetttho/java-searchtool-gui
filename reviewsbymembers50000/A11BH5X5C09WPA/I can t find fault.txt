 I have had this CD for about two years now, and I must say that I truly enjoy it.  The musicianship is very sound the music itself is quite engaging. All of the songs of this CD are of great quality, but my favorite is "The Call To Dance".  You aren't likely to sit still while listening to it... even if you aren't a step dance (and I'm not, by any means). Highly recommended.
