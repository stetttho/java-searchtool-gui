  Interesting enough, albeit very standard CIA-assassin-hell-bent-on-revenge stuff.   Basically, the hero, Mitch Rapp, is a CIA assassin... um, "counter-terrorism operative" whose exposure by a rogue politician has led to the murder of his pregnant wife in what was meant as as an assassination attempt against him.   Rapp is as unconsolable as you might expect, and proceeds to kill everyone that had anything to do with the murder.   Not a challenging read... but you wouldn't read Vince Flynn's stuff if that is what you wanted.   This was Flynn's fifth or sixth novel, all of which have Mitch Rapp as the central character.  Fortunately Rapp has FINALLY gotten rid of, or at least isn't using his usual Beretta pistol, even though the FN Five-Seven is equally impractical as a concealed carry pistol  If you like shoot 'em ups with clearly defined good guys and bad guys, you might find this a pleasant way to spend a few hours.   Not for the squeamish.
