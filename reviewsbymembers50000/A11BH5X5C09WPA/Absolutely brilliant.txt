 I read this book several years ago and I must tell you that to date, it is the best alternate history of the civil war I have ever read. I suppose this won't surprise any of you that read this that are already fans of Dr Turtledove.  For you that don't know much of Harry's work, I recommend that you start with this book.  You'll love it.
