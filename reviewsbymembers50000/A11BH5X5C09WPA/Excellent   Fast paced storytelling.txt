 I devoured this novel.  The author has done fine work here.  In a genre that almost never fails to typify "operators" as blood lusting Rambo-types, Mr Flynn has  taken the right path with Mitch Rapp.  No undue  gunplay.  No gratuitous sex scenes. Not too much hokey dialogue. I look  forward to FFlynn's next offering.
