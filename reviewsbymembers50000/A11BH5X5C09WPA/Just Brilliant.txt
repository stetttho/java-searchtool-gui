 Pay no attention to the people the denigrate this CD.  Cowboy Troy, with his collaborators, has crossed not only the country-rap line, they have also included salsa and rock riffs throughout the CD.  To the reviewer that suggesetd that no self-respecting black American could enjoy this CD:  I say that you should be ashamed of yourself for suggesting that we, as black Americans, shouldn't cheer for one of our own that has found success in a genre that has been a whites-only club for so long.  This is great stuff.  I could go on and on, but I won't.  Suffice it to say that Cowboy Troy is going tomake it big with this CD.  We haven't seen the last of him and to that, I say amen.  Cowboy Troy rocks!
