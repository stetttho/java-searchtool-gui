 Mr Flynn's third outing was a good one.  I enjoyed this book a great deal, particularly because he was a bit less preachy in this one than he was in his first. The main character, Mitch Rapp, is rather enigmatic, but then looking at what he does for a living, that would be appropriate.  The characters were good, the scenery was described well, and this time Mr Flynn didn't make everyone that was a non-conservative, a cross between the devil and a child molester. Mr Flynn does a good job with the local geography as well.  Many authors tend to make things up as they go along when describing Washington, DC (Clancy comes to mind here), but Flynn gets it all down just right.  From George Washington University Hospital (where my daughter was born) and campus, to the State Department and Naval Bureau of Medicine on 23rd street that I drive past every morning and afternoon This isn't high art, and it isn't literature, but if you are looking for a fast paced novel about political intrigue, assassins, and tradecraft this is your book. As a personal aside, I think Mitch Rapp should ditch that Beretta he uses and get something a bit more practical for his line of work.
