 ...and I still think it is a great book. Gould does a great job with the young characters in all of his books, but he does a particularly good job in this one. Jumper satisfies on all levels, and the author isn't afraid to go for the occaisional laugh. You get it all, here, science fiction, terrorists, bad guys, good(?) guys, questionable government spooks, a few laughs, and an apparently pretty girl. Read it, trust me... you'll like it.
