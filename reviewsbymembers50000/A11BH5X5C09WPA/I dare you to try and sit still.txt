 I saw these folks perform at the Richmond (Va) Highland Games this past weekend... After hearing them play "Scream" and "All You People" I was hooked.  I bought this CD without knowing anything else about this music.  I was not disapointed.  Trust me when I tell ou that a fiddle and the bagpipes fit in perfectly with rock and roll.  If you like quality music that will stir your soul, listen to this.
