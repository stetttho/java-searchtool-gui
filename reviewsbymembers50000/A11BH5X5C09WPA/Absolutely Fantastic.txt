 If I could give this book 10 stars, I would gladly do so.  Dr Slade has hit a historical homerun with this well-told tale of the birth of our republic. Told from the viewpoints of Benjamin York, a pressed British seaman that deserts in 1775 Boston, and Genevieve, the Massachussetts farm girl he marries, this story takes us from the beginning of our war of independence at Lexington & Concord, to it's end at the Battle of Yorktown.   Not only does Slade tell the story well, he does something that will truly shock some people:  He teaches you as well!  This is no dry historical tome that will send you off to sleep after the first few pages.  No, indeed.  When you put this book down, you will have a real feeling and understanding about the American Revoultion that so few people ever get. When you read this book, Breed's Hill and Bunker's Hill will become real places and real battles, not just dry factoids from high school.  Not only will you see the battles as real, but the pople as well.  From the hunger of the foot soldier, to the real moral and tactical dilemma's facing the various commanders. Slade makes people like George Washington, and Nathaniel Greene real flesh-and-blood men, not the cardboard heroes we often read about.  The fact that he makes them human makes them all the more heroic. Another point in Slade's favor is that he doesn't fail to discuss the southern theater of operations. Many Americans don't realize that some of the bloodiest fighting of the war took place in the Carolinas, and that the most militarily significant battle of the war was that of Guilford Courthouse, in North Carolina. Slade has done nothing short of brilliant work here. Buy this book.  You won't be disappointed.
