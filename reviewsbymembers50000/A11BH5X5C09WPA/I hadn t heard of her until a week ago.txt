 ...but as soon as I heard her sing, while I was flipping the channels on DirectTV, I was hooked.  I bought this CD straight away and I am very happy with it.  As a matter of fact, I like it so much, I put it on my ipod today.  This young woman is very talented, and not just because of her soulful voice.  She is a talented songwriter as well.   I think that anyone that listens to this cd will come away satisfied, having heard genuinely good music.  Well-written, well-sung, and well played, without any hint of being over engineered.  Buy it.  You'll be glad that you did.
