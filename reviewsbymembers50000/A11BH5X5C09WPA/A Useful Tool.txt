 ...for discussion!  We recently used this book as a study guide for an adult education class at my church.  While Rossing clearly has her own agenda, and her own worldview (don't we all?), she has done great work here in exposing "Rapture theology" for what it is: mythology based on 170 year-old writings based on misinterpreted scripture, taken completely out of context.  Rossing has very little time for the ridiculously badly written "Left Behind" series (and if you don't believe her, or me...read at least the first book yourself... what garbage!).  She is, however, very concerned at the impact that these novels have had in popular culture.    At the end of the day, Rossing exposes rature theology for the heresy that it is.  For this, I thank her.
