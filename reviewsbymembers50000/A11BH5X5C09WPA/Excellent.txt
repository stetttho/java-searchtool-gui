 I am a big enough man to be able to say the I was wrong. I reviewed this CD when it was first released, and I didn't like it very much because it was such a departure from what Seven NAtions usally plays. Having not given up on it, I have listened to it enough to get a better appreciation of the direction that the band is travelling in. Start with "Wonderful" or "Waiting For Midnight" You won't be disappointed. Seven Nations fans, if you thought that you had been let down, come back and give this one another listen. Change can be good.
