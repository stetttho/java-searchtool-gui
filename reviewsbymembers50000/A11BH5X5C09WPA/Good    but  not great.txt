 Unfortunately, this seems to be heard more and more about Dr. Turtledove's work.  I wish my take on this book was different.  The premise is a good one.  The Japanese take Hawaii... ok, but with only one division?  I realize that American airpower was not a factor after the opening of the campaign, but air superiority or no, The available American forces should have been able to better than that.  Alright, I understand the suspension of disbelief, so I'll move on.  I just don't see that this series, for I am certain that there will be more, is going to do it for me.  Oh, I'll read it alright, but I suspect it will be more of the same pro forma stuff.  C'mon Harry!, show us the brilliance that we know you possess!
