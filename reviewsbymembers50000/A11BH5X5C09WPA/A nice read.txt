 Griffin rarely disappoints, and this most recent offering is the reason why.   Once again, the author tells a well-told story about the officer corps of the U.S. armed forces in wartime.  He illustrates the unfortunate fact that politicians aren't the only people that practice the arcane, dark art of politics, but that our military leaders did it (and still do it) every bit as much. Reading about Ken McCoy and the others is a comfort, to be sure.  It is sort of like a visit from old friends, but I would like to see some of the supporting characters fleshed out a bit more.   Having made the criticism above, I will end by saying that despite a few very minor things, I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone.
