 Once again, Gould doesn't disappoint. If you liked Jumper, you'll love Wildside. If you didn't read Jumper, by all means do so, but don't worry, these are stand-alone stories so you don't need to read them in a particular order. Gould does fine work here, particularly in describing the details that our young protagonist engages in to conduct his business. The author certainly has a handle on the young and writes about them very well. Enough people have described what the book is about, so you don't need a rehash from me. Just read it. You'll be glad that you did.
