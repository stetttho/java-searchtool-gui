 I am glad that I read Flynn's second novel first, because this one was certainly not as good.  Mr Flynn makes a fine entry into the genre with this piece of work but could have really used some better editing.  I  realize I may be nitpicking a bit but Mr Flynn has nearly every major  character in this boook, all educated people, using some fractured  english. Further, Mr Flynn repeatedly (as many as 5 times on a single  page) referred to American military personnel as "commandos".   With the greatest respect to the author, I must say that  "commando" is a word seldom, if ever, used in the American  miliary lexicon.  Special Forces personnel are usually referred to just  that way, or as "special operators" or "spec-ops"  etc... His main character, Michael O'Rourke, fits the typical description  of today's so-called "angry white male"... He is a 32 year old member of  the House of Representatives who lives in Georgetown (an area of Washington, DC that is home to some of it's wealthiest citizens) and carries around a .45 caliber pistol in fear of  "roving youth gangs"  (Mr Flynn  must be writing about a different Georgetown than the one a five minute  drive from my office).  O'Rourke actually advocates the murder of politicians that are no good (I wonder why this novel didn't have a Strom Thurmond or Jesse Helms counterpart).  No wonder this book is so well reviewed by so many self-described Rpublicans and Conservatives. I realize that this was his first time out of the gate, but I would suggest to Mr Flynn that not all of the people in the world are not either Irish, Swedish, or from Minnesota. This book was a good read, but incredibly  preachy.  Read it, you may have some fun.
