 ...until two days ago.  I was browsing at the local Border's book store with my wife and daughter this weekend, when I heard this great soulful music playing, and I knew I had to have it.   The store only had one copy beside the one that was in the cd player, so I headed to the pop/rock section (and what was it doing THERE?) and snagged it.  I bought it and played it through twice when we got home.  Mr Broussard has a very mature and soulful style reminiscent of the heyday of the R&B music era.  You can easily hear elements many musical influences, but Broussard's music is all his own.  If you like R&B, buy this cd.  If you like soul, buy this cd.  If you like the blues, buy this cd.  If you like good music, buy this cd.  Buy this cd, get it?
