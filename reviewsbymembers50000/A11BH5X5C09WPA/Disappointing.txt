 I like reading Turtledove's work, but this piece was a mercy in that it put an end (hopefully) to this series.  I think it could have ended much more conclusively, not for the Human-Race conflict, but for the series itself.  It seems to me that Turtledove has left the door open for another book in this series... something that I fervently hope that he doesn't do  This book was dull.  I wish I could say something better about it.  I only gave it three stars because of past work by the author, and because we were finally wrapping up a nice string of novels.  Harry, please do better next time.
