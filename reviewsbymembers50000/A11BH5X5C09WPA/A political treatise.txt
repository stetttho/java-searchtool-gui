 I found Mr Blanchard's book to read more like a political treatise than a manual for responsible gun ownership. Indeed, I found the book to be more of an NRA recruiting pamphlet than anything else. In his book, Blanchard makes some inflammatory statements about race and religion that he puts forth as fact, when indeed they are opinions.  Advocating that gun ownership is fine and good is one thing (and I agree with it). Suggesting that black people are only free if we own guns is one of the stupidest things I have ever heard.
