 This is perhaps the richest and most moving cd I have ever heard. Oddly enough, I was first exposed to this music at Disney World's EPCOT theme park last summer. Having heard Con te partiro one time, I was hooked. I believe that it is the most haunting and moving pieces of music that I have ever heard... and I don't even speak Imuch talian. Bocelli has an an amazing voice. Strong, clear, delicate, and evocative. I have never heard anyone sing with more emotion or feeling. I reccomend this record for anyone that is really interested in good music and isn't afrraid to step outside of the bounds of their normal likes.
