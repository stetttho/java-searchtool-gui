 Ms. Kress turns out a competent work of mystery here.  The story is good, and we don't find out "whodunit" until the very end.  My only complaint is that the characters were a bit cliche.  Dr. Melanie Anderson was just about the angriest character I have ever seen.  In my own humble opinion, I don't see how she could possibly have risen to a position of responsibility within the CDC with some of the know-nothing convictions she holds. Agent Cavanaugh is the quintessential "man afraid of commitment" Read this book and be entertained for a few hours.
