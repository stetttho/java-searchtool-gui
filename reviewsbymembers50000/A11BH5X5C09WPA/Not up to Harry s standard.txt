 Mr Harry ususally writes well crafted stories, but, this one seems just a little rushed, and much more implausible than his other stories. I realize that you have to suspend belief to a certain degree to enjoy technothrillers, but this is quite a stretch.  The reason that the best technothirllers are so good, is because they have some degree of believability.  This story just didn't have that.  Many other reviewers have made the same comments that I would make, so I won't repeat them.   I hope Harry's next offering is better
