 That is what you get with this Disney guide. Rita Aero isn't a paid mouthpiece for the Disney company, and therefore has no reason to grind their axe. The author is clear, concise, and not afraid to tell you what she likes and what she doesn't. Further, the Aero guide has the best maps of any guidebook currently on the market. I am an avid Disney vacationer... we go at least twice per year, and Ms. Aero's guide is the very best of a very large field. I get new Disney guide books every year and I enjoy them all for their own particualr merits, but of them all, The Aero guide is the best there is. I highly recommend it.
