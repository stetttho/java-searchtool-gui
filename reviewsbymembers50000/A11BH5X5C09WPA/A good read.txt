 Considering many of the reviews submitted by readers, I am pleased that Redcoat was my first Cornwell novel. I enjoyed the story well enough, but what really caught my attention is that Cornwell told such a detailed story of the assault at Paoli's Tavern and the Battle of Germantown, that I could practically smell the smoke of the cannon and hear the rattle of musketry. It was also nice to read a story about the American Revolution told from a different perspective. Cornwell deserves full marks for this effort. If half of what I hear about the "Sharpe's" series is true, I am in for quite a treat.
