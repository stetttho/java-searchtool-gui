 Enough reviewers have gone on at length to talk about the merits of this book, so I shall be brief. This is a good story.  The characters are interesting.  The action is plentiful, and well written. Ramage is no Aubrey, nor is he a copy of Bolitho or Hornblower.  He is a fine character in his own right. Full marks for Dudley Pope! On to Ramage & The Drumbeat!
