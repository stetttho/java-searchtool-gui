 I must say at the outset, that Turtledove's latest installment was good, not perfect, but good.  He slowed the pace a bit for character development which is always a good thing.  Concerning the political/military situation  in the world, Turtledove has set up some scenarios that touch enough modern  issues (such as middle eastern tensions) to interest readers that don't  have a particular interest in history from the WW2 era and its aftermath,  as well as many things that will speak forcefully to anyone that has a  great interest in that time period as well.   I heartily disagree with  one of the reviewers that suggested that the America depicted in this book  is a happier place than the one we know from OTL (our time line).  The  America depicted here seems to be tottering on the edge of becoming a  police state... then again, there are many Americans that wouldn't seem to  mind this. I look forward to the next installment with great  anticipation. So nice to hear from Stirling.
