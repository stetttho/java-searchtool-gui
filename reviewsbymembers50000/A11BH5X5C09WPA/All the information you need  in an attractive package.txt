 The authors manage to tell the story of Prince Charles Edward Stuart's flight from the disaster that was the Battle of Culloden in vivid detail without including so much detail as to become tedious.  Coupled with the inclusion of wonderful photography and maps, this book leaves the reader with a full grasp of what the pleasant Prince and his various protectors, guides and benefactors went through during his five months as a fugitive in the Scottish countryside. The authors also gave great detail, without undue romanticism,  of young Flora MacDonald's role in the Prince's escape. People interested in the history of Great Britain in general, and Scottish history in particular will greatly enjoy this book.
