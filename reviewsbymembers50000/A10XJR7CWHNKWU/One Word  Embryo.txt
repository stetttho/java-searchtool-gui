 "Works" is a collection of early Pink Floyd tracks from 1967 to 1973, and although the material chosen for the disc is all excellent---from the rare Syd Barrett-era singles "Arnold Layne" and "See Emily Play," to "Dark Side Of The Moon" favorites "Brain Damage" and "Eclipse"---the main reason for adding "Works" to your Floyd collection is the rare song, "Embryo," not available anywhere else but here (unlike the Syd Barrett singles, which you can also find on the CD, "Relics"). "Embryo" is a truly gorgeous song, a great Floyd buried treasure. Strangely enough, though, the band has always claimed that this song was never actually finished, a claim which seems to be proven true by the live bootleg recording of it I've heard. On record, "Embryo" is a soft, tranquil number. Live in concert, it was a powerful, amped-up rocker, featuring some awesome electric guitar by David Gilmour. Even so, this "embryonic" studio version of "Embryo" remains a hauntingly beautiful song, and one that demands to be added to your Floyd collection right now. "Works" isn't really an essential purchase for the casual Pink Floyd listener, but for the diehard fan, "Embryo" alone makes this CD a definite must-have.
