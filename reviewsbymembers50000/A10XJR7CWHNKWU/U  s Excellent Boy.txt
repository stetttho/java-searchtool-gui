 With their classic opening rocker, "I Will Follow," U2 began their glorious journey into the rock music history books with their 1980 debut, "Boy." This first album from Dublin's favorite sons is U2 in the raw, without the bigger studio productions of the band's later work. What comes through the most on "Boy" is the urgency & power of U2's musical attack: The Edge's unique, wailing guitar-work, the towering sound from the rhythm section of bassist Adam Clayton and drummer Larry Mullen Jr., and, of course, the soaring, magnificent voice of lead singer Bono. The band rock with everything they got on great songs like "I Will Follow," "An Cat Dubh," "Stories For Boys," "Another Time Another Place," and "The Electric Co.", but they also take time for some great moments of beauty, like "The Ocean" and "Shadows And Tall Trees." Though there was certainly room for musical growth, and most U2 fans agree that the band's best music was yet to come (and opinions vary greatly on this subject---"War," "The Joshua Tree" and "Achtung Baby" appear to be the top fan favorites), there's no question that "Boy" is an excellent debut album for Bono & company. Get ready, world---U2 have arrived!
