 Traffic's live album from 1973, "On The Road," is an excellent, smokin' hot document of the band live in Germany during their tour for "Shootout At The Fantasy Factory." There's only six tracks on it, but Steve Winwood, Jim Capaldi, Chris Wood & the gang stretch this little batch of classic Traffic tunes into jamming heaven, such as the 20-minute workout of "Glad" and "Freedom Rider," and the supercool 18-minute treatment of "The Low Spark Of High Heeled Boys." Everybody in the band gets to strut their stuff, the performances simply electrifying. The only debit is that the album leaves you hungry---certainly Traffic played more tunes in concert than just these. Nevertheless, "On The Road" is a great live album, and proof positive that Traffic were a mighty force on the concert stage.
