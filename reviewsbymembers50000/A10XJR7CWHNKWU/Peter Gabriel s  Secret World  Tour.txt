 Recorded live on his "Secret World Tour" in support of his 1992 album, "US," "Secret World Live" is an excellent live document of this most gifted musical genius. With a brilliant backing band including guitarist David Rhoades, bassist Tony Levin, and an up-and-coming backup singer named Paula Cole, Gabriel is simply on fire. The bulk of the material is from the "US" and "SO" albums, but they're brilliantly performed, including "Come Talk To Me," "Blood Of Eden," "Digging In The Dirt," "Red Rain," "Sledgehammer" and "In Your Eyes," as well as a rare Gabriel gem, "Across The River" (only ever released as a B-side). Gabriel & company are simply marvelous in concert, with passionate performances and superior sound.The only debit is that a few songs from the tour were cut from the live album---no "San Jacinto" or "Family Snapshot," for instance. But otherwise, this is a great live album from a most-great artist. Peter Gabriel's "Secret World Live" is a wonderful live set.
