 As Paul Hardcastle himself admits in the album's liner notes, "Cover To Cover" isn't so much a "Greatest Hits" package as it is a study, if you like, of the man's music and his musical personality. Disc One is a mixture of hits, rare tracks and previously unreleased songs from Paul's archives, while Disc Two is entirely made up of cover songs, some of them re-mixed, while others are previously unreleased. Disc One has such Hardcastle favorites as "Rainforest," "19" (though with a different mix), "King Tut," and "Jokers Wild" (also re-mixed), as well as some rare goodies like the wonderful song, "Could It Be Forever" (featuring vocalist Helen Rogers), which had only been previously available on Japanese import, and great new tracks like "Urban Vibes," "Paradise Cove" and "Crystal Seas." Paul is no slouch at cover songs either, and Disc Two shows off his skills in this department, with such cool covers as "Walk In The Night," Steely Dan's "Do It Again" (with a slower re-mix), Barry White's "Love Theme," Pink Floyd's "Money" (also re-mixed a bit), "Green Onions," and Stevie Wonder's "Superstition." Great, sparkling music all the way from the King Of Smooth Jazz. If you're a big Paul Hardcastle buff like I am, then purchasing "Cover To Cover" is a total no-brainer. Groove on, Brother Paul!
