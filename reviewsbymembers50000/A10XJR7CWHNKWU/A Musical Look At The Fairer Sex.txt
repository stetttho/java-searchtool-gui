 The Alan Parsons Project take a look at the female gender with their 1979 album, appropriately titled "Eve." Although not one of the group's more popular albums, it's a very strong Project album all the same. It's catchy, melodic, well-written by Alan Parsons & Eric Woolfson, with sharp musical performances all around, great orchestrations by Andrew Powell, and fine vocals by such singers as Lenny Zakatek and Chris Rainbow. And what Project album would be complete without an excellent instrumental or two? "Lucifer" is a classic piece (and it's still used on many TV sports programs to this day), and "Secret Garden" is bouncy & spacious.However, "Eve" has always been a controversial album, as some female listeners think that some of the songs are degrading to women. This is totally not true. Songs like "You Lie Down With Dogs," "I'd Rather Be A Man," and "Winding Me Up" are not about ALL women in general---goodness, no. The male character of these songs is only singing about *one particular woman* that he's had a personal falling out with, and that's all. Some may find it hard to believe, but men can get hurt in broken relationships, too, which is all these particular songs are saying.Furthermore, lest we forget, "Eve" contains a couple of positive songs sung by women: the self-powering "Don't Hold Back," and the lovely album-closer, "If I Could Change Your Mind." Clare Torry & Leslie Duncan, who both were featured on the classic Pink Floyd album, "Dark Side Of The Moon" (which Parsons engineered), sing these songs very nicely, and I highly doubt that they would've taken part if they thought the album was sexist in any way. Nevermind the silly controversy: "Eve" is a fine entry in the Alan Parsons Project's catalog. Definitely pick it up.
