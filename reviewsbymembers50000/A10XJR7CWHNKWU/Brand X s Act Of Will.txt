 Brand X's 1980 release, "Do They Hurt?", is technically the band's last album featuring all of the major players in the group, such as keyboardists Robin Lumley and Peter Robinson, and, of course, drummer extraordinaire Phil Collins (though he only appears on one track---the drummer on the remaining six tracks I do not know, as my CD booklet doesn't say. Whoever he is, though, he's very good). And while "Do They Hurt?" isn't the greatest thing the band has ever recorded, it's still an excellent Brand X album. Personal faves include the quirky fun of "Noddy Goes To Sweden" (with bassist Percy Jones' magic fingers just *flyin'* all over his instrument), and the great pop-rock of "Act Of Will," one of Brand X's few attempts at an actual song with lyrics. Mind you, I don't know if it was a good idea for guitarist John Goodsall to distort his lead vocal on "Act Of Will" by singing through a vocoder, 'cause, admittedly, it's hard to dicipher what he's actually singing! BUT, I still think that "Act Of Will" is a very catchy, enjoyable tune (and pay no mind to the reviewer who dismissed the song---I don't understand why he has a problem with it). Also worth mentioning are the extended jams of "Triumphant Limp" (featuring Phil Collins on the skins) and "D.M.Z.", both very classy, powerful instrumental workouts. After "Do They Hurt?", the guys in Brand X decided that they had taken the band as far as it could go (or so they thought at the time), and they stopped working together for 12 years, apart from the 1982 collection, "Is There Anything About?", a sparse, hastily tossed-together rarities album (though it's nowhere near as bad as it's been reputed to be). But come 1992, John Goodsall and Percy Jones would revive Brand X (with Frank Katz on drums) with their outstanding comeback album, "X-Communication." But, in the meantime, "Do They Hurt?" is a very strong, solid album for Brand X to end their first phase of work together with. It's good stuff!
