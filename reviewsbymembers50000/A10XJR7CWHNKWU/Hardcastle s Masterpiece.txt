 I really dig Paul Hardcastle. The multi-instrumentalist best known for the hit song "19" is a master blender of smooth jazz, pop, and soul. It's perfect music to cruise down the highway with or chill out at home to. "Hardcastle 2" is my personal favorite from Paul. Song for song it is irrisistibly catchy. With guest vocalists like Helen Rogers, Paul weaves a smooth aural tapestry in groovy songs like "Livin' In The Shadows," "Got To Be Love," "Star Of The Story," and "You Are The One." Paul also serves up cool instrumentals like "Bird Island," "Peace On Earth," "Jokers Wild," and "Warm Glow." "Look To The Future" is a truly special song about...well, looking to the future, featuring Paul's young daughter Maxine on spoken-word lead vocals. In light of the 9/11 tragedy, this song certainly takes on a whole new meaning. And, for the coup de grace, Paul includes his brilliant, smooth-jazz interpretation of the Pink Floyd classic, "Money," featuring cameos by Sir Laurence Olivier & Bob Hoskins! It's wonderful.When I need music to chill out to, there's nobody better in the world to listen to than Paul Hardcastle. The man's a musical genius. I strongly recommend that you buy his *entire* catalog of excellent albums, but you can't go wrong by beginning with "Hardcastle 2," arguably his greatest work to date. Paul, you are hip! :-)
