 Coming off the success of their 1991 megasmash album, "Nevermind," Nirvana released "Incesticide" at the end of 1992. It's a collection of rare tracks: demos, rare singles and B-sides, and BBC Sessions. While a few tracks are a little TOO wild and ragged-sounding, such as "Beeswax" and "Hairspray Queen," most of it is awesome, powerful garage rock (and NO band on the face of the earth did garage rock better than Nirvana). My personal faves include the thunderous rock of "Dive," the catchy "Sliver" (the best-known track on the album), "Been A Son," the clever cover of Devo's "Turnaround," the rip-roaring "Mexican Seafood," the big, swaggering rock of "Big Long Now," and the all-time Nirvana classic, "Aneurysm." However, the liner notes on the inside of the CD by Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain are, admittedly, a little disturbing, as Kurt makes it perfectly clear to the reader that he was NOT enjoying his newfound success all that much, a fact confirmed by his tragic suicide less than two years later. Still, don't let this stop you from checking out this excellent Nirvana CD. If you're a diehard Nirvana fan, then "Incesticide" is truly a must-have.
