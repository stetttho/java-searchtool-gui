 This is a towering, trandescent live acoustic performance that Kurt Cobain & the gang recorded for MTV in November 1993, just five months prior to Cobain's untimely demise. The band perform eight originals including "Come As You Are" and "All Apologies," as well as six cover songs, including David Bowie's "The Man Who Sold The World" & three songs by the Meat Puppets (who guest perform on the songs). Anyone who never heard the talent in Cobain's singing, songwriting, and guitar-playing on Nirvana's full-throttle studio records before, OR the talent of Cobain's bandmates Krist Novelselic & Dave Grohl, absolutely MUST give "MTV Unplugged In New York" a listen. The band's stripped-down approach to the material brings out the beauty in the songs for ALL to hear. Heck, you can even play this Nirvana album for your grandmother, and chances are she'll love it. It's a gorgeous live performance, and a powerful final testament to the talent & genius of Kurt Cobain & his band.
