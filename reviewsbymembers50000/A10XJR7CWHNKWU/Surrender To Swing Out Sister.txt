 A marvelous British jazz-pop group from the 80's, Swing Out Sister, led by sultry singer Corinne Drewery, are best known for the bouncy US Top Ten hit, "Breakout." But there's a lot more great songs where that came from, as this Best-Of collection proves. Of course "Breakout" kicks off the disc, but there's many more tasty treats that follow, including "Surrender," "Twilight World," "Waiting Game," "Am I The Same Girl" (SOS's clever re-working of the old Young-Holt Unlimited hit, "Soulful Strut"), "Better Make It Better," and "Who's Been Sleeping." Drewery's voice is smooth & silky, and so is the group's music. Great smooth grooves & snappy tunes from start to finish. Even though their latest albums are only available on Japanese import, I'm glad that Swing Out Sister are still together to this day, 'cause they are GOOD. "The Best Of Swing Out Sister" is a terrific sampling from this classy group.
