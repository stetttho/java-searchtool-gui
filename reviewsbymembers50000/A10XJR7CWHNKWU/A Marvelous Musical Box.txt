 1971's "Nursery Cryme" was Genesis' third album, and the first album featuring the "classic" line-up of the band: singer Peter Gabriel, keyboardist Tony Banks, bassist Mike Rutherford, and, making their debuts, guitarist Steve Hackett & drummer Phil Collins. It's a wonderful, majestic Genesis album featuring several of the band's classic, storytelling art-rockers, such as "The Musical Box," "The Return Of The Giant Hogweed," "Seven Stones," and "The Fountain Of Salmacis." "Harold The Barrel" shows off the band's humorous side, telling a very amusing tale about a guy who's about to jump off a window ledge. "Harlequin" is a lovely acoustic number, and Phil Collins makes his fine lead vocal debut on the short but very-sweet, "For Absent Friends." The Genesis men play the material with passion & ferocity, and Peter Gabriel sings with great emotion (and he's also an excellent flute player, t'boot). For some fans, Genesis started with "Nursery Cryme." While this is totally not true (don't disregard "From Genesis To Revelation" or "Trespass," guys), "Nursery Cryme" DOES mark the first time the band started to get seriously noticed as a musical force to be reckoned with, and with darn good reason. "Nursery Cryme" is classic Genesis all the way. :-)
