 It's a shame that Paula Cole's 1999 release "Amen" did not get the same attention that her hit previous album, "This Fire," did, because this album is Paula's best work to date. Her songwriting, singing and playing on "Amen" are outstanding, the songs real heartfelt stuff that immediately grabs your attention. "I Believe In Love" is an instant winner, with a catchy groove that recalls McFadden & Whitehead's "Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now." The title song is a shimmering & spirited tune. "La Tonya" has a great sway & beauty to it, while "Rhythm Of Life" sees Paula turning in a soulful rap against a late-night, strolling beat, and the chant-like "Suwannee Jo" is simply entrancing. It may not have sold as well as it's predecessor, but Paula Cole's "Amen" is a stunning album. Paula is definitely one of the most talented ladies in music today, and I eagerly look forward to her return.
