 GREAT artists on this CD....Mythos, Enigma, Delerium, Sarah McLachlan, Eva Cassidy, Moby, George Winston, B-Tribe, Afro Celt Sound System (w/ Peter Gabriel)....heavenly. Admittedly, I was mainly hooked to buy this CD by the inclusion of the Delerium/Sarah McLachlan classic, "Silence," and the wonderful collaboration by Afro Celt Sound System & Peter Gabriel, "When You're Falling," but all the way around, "Pure Moods IV" is a terrific collection of some truly dreamy music, combining new age, ambient, and some easy listening. All of these excellent tracks blend together so seamlessly, it's as if they were made to be featured together on one disc. Together, they form a soothing, atmospheric platter of music guaranteed to literally bring you "peace of mind." Not a bad track among them---even Yanni's contribution is pleasant (and that's really saying something). Probably the biggest surprise of all is the song "Purify" by a group named Balligomingo. This song is so amazingly sensual that I am now looking into getting the group's album. "Pure Moods IV" is an outstanding collection that will have you floating away in no time.
