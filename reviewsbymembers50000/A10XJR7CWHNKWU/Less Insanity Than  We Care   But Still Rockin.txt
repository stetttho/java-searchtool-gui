 Whale's second--and presumably final--album, 1998's "All Disco Dance Must End In Broken Bones," finds the wonderfully nutty Swedish group playing it safer this time around. While the band went completely *bug-wild* on their outstanding debut disc, "We Care," they keep things more or less straightforward on "All Disco Dance," with only the awesome track "Losing CTRL" showing any signs of Whale's outrageous rock from their first album. Otherwise, there's less shouting, very little or no trace of sexual wordplay in the lyrics, and a much more rounded feel to the tracks. Still, Whale are/were an amazingly talented band, and they still whip up some pretty cool tunes on this disc, like "Crying At Airports," the funky "Smoke," the fun "Puma Gym," and the catchy "2 Cord Song." Cia Soro (formerly Cia Berg) still knows how to get your attention with her seductive voice, the band still rock out, and the production & studio effects are impressive. As I said in my review of "We Care," I'm profoundly disappointed that Whale appear to be no more, 'cause they were just plain sensational, a major shining light in the modern rock genre. But I'm happy that they made two excellent albums, and, maybe one day, they'll do the right thing and come back! "We Care" is definitely my favorite of the two Whale albums, but "All Disco Dance Must End In Broken Bones" is also great, and if you're gonna get "We Care," then you gotta get this one, too. Long live Whale!
