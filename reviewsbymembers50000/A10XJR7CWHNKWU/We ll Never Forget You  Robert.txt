 Robert Palmer was a fabulous singer, with a super-cool, super soulful voice (and, lest we forget, he was also a very snappy dresser). His untimely passing earlier this year from a heart attack was a major shock. While it's unfortunate that it took Palmer's death to get this compilation CD, "The Very Best Of Robert Palmer," re-issued after being out-of-print for some time, it is indeed very good to have it available to the masses once again. A very generous 17 tracks long, this CD contains EVERY single hit song Palmer ever had, whether solo or with his side band, The Power Station. They're ALL here: "Addicted To Love" (both the classic original & the 1997 re-recording), "Bad Case Of Loving You," "Some Like It Hot," "Simply Irresistible," "Looking For Clues," "Every Kinda People," and a whole lot more, showcasing Palmer's powerful pipes and his great flair for catchy pop-rock. The only reason I'm not giving this collection 5 stars is because my favorite Robert Palmer song of all-time, "You Are In My System," is included here with a re-recorded vocal from Palmer. Reportedly, Palmer wasn't happy with his original vocal on the song (originally from his album, "Pride"), thinking that his performance was too rushed, so he re-recorded it several years later. While I respect Palmer's decision, and his second go at the song is fine, his original performance on "You Are In My System" was perfect, and didn't need to be re-done. Oh well, at least I have the "Pride" album on LP if I want to hear how Robert originally sang it....*Other* than that one personal gripe, "The Very Best Of Robert Palmer" is a superb collection and tribute to this great singer. Farewell Robert, we will never forget you.
