 Message to James Rotondi: "Selling England" came out in 1973, Phil Collins' first lead vocal for the band was on the 1971 tune, "For Absent Friends," and "Abacab" is a CUTE Genesis song??? (*major rolling of the eyes*) Please!Now that I've said that....1973's "Selling England By The Pound" is a much-loved Genesis album, featuring many great favorites from the band's Peter Gabriel era, such as the dramatic "Dancing With The Moonlit Knight," the whimsical "I Know What I Like" (the band's first hit single on the British charts), the glorious "Firth Of Fifth" (featuring THE greatest guitar solo that Steve Hackett ever recorded with the group), the epic "Battle Of Epping Forest," the lovely "More Fool Me" (with vocals by drummer Phil Collins), and the endearing Genesis staple, "Cinema Show." All throughout the album, Peter Gabriel's lead vocals and flute-playing are supreme, Tony Banks serves up some of his best keyboard work ever, Phil Collins' drumming & Mike Rutherford's bass-playing make a fantastic rhythm section, and guitarist Steve Hackett lays down what is arguably his most exquisite fretwork with the band (it's no wonder that Hackett names "Selling England" as his favorite Genesis album)."Selling England By The Pound" also marks a pinnacle of sorts for Genesis, as it represents the last time that Peter Gabriel thoroughly enjoyed himself as the band's frontman. The seeds of discontent between Gabriel & the rest of the band would be sown on the next album, 1974's "The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway." "The Lamb" is, without question, a great Genesis classic, but it ultimately signaled Gabriel's departure from the group soon afterwards. "Selling England By The Pound," however, represents Gabriel-era Genesis in happier times, and the lovely, majestic quality of the album reflects that. "Selling England" is not only one of Genesis' very best works, but it also stands today as one of the very best albums from the 70's progressive rock era. "Selling England By The Pound" is an outstanding, must-have Genesis album. :-)
