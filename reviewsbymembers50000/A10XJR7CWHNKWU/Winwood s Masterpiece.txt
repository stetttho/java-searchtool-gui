 1990's "Refugees Of The Heart" was the album that made me a Steve Winwood fan. I'd heard some of Steve's hit songs from "Arc Of A Diver," "Back In The High Life" & "Roll With It," and I liked them, but "Refugees Of The Heart" completely blew me away. That this wonderful album was NOT a hit and is now out-of-print is a very sad thing, for this is Steve's best solo album by far. I enjoy all of Steve's albums, of course, but "Refugees" has a very special maturity & musical richness to it, and Steve generously adds a taste of good ol' progressive rock to some of the album's pop proceedings, which, for any fan who knows the man's work with Traffic, is greatly appreciated. Most of the songs are at least five minutes in length, allowing Winwood to really stretch out. Not a bad song among the bunch, with highlights such as the spiritual "You'll Keep On Searching," the rockin' "One And Only Man," the lovely "I Will Be Here," the bluesy "Another Deal Goes Down," the fun of "Come Out And Dance," and, what is quite possibly Steve's greatest solo composition EVER, the hypnotic 9 1/2 minute "In The Light Of Day," a dreamy, breathtaking masterwork. Steve's soulful voice, songwriting & playing are magnificent, and the album *sounds* terrific, being digitally recorded, mixed & and mastered.It's so very disappointing that the music-buying public missed the boat on "Refugees Of The Heart." As another reviewer pointed out, perhaps they had gotten a bit tired of Winwood by this time, after he had back-to-back hit albums and was such a big presence on the radio in the late 80's. But make no mistake, "Refugees Of The Heart" is undoubtedly Steve Winwood's greatest solo album to date. It is an astonishing disc from beginning to end, and should not be ignored. Pick it up!
