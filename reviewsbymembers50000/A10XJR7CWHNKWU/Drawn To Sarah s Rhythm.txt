 Hooking up with producer Pierre Marchand, who has remained her record producer ever since, Sarah McLachlan took a giant step forward with her second album, 1991's "Solace." This is an outstanding album, practically the sister album of "Fumbling Towards Ecstasy," and one of Sarah's very best works. In fact, I'd rank "Solace" at #2 right behind "Fumbling" as Sarah's masterpiece. The songs, production & arrangements are more sophisticated this time out, and Sarah's gifted soprano voice, which was already very lovely on her debut, "Touch," has matured and become even more beautiful-sounding. Every song on "Solace" is a brilliant one, from the dreamy acoustic melodies of "Drawn To The Rhythm," to the funk-pop of "Into The Fire," to the angelic atmospheres of "Path Of Thorns," to the sparkling balladry of "I Will Not Forget You." "Back Door Man" (no relation to the Doors classic) is a strong pop-rocker, "Black" has a marvelous spookiness to it that reminds me of Peter Gabriel (one of Sarah's favorite artists, and mine, too), and "Mercy" is a powerful acapella track that allows Sarah's voice to work it's magic over your senses. Sarah also does a charming cover of Donovan's "Wear Your Love Like Heaven" to finish off the album in style. I can never say enough good things about Sarah McLachlan. She's without a doubt my favorite lady in the music business right now, with a voice and musical talent that's truly unique. "Solace" is a fantastic album, one of Sarah's very best offerings, and is a definite must-buy.
