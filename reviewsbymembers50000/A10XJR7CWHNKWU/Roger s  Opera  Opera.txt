 I definitely enjoy classical music, and I do appreciate the opera genre, but I didn't own any classical operas on CD. Until now: I've just bought "Ca Ira" by former Pink Floyd bassist/composer Roger Waters. Like many other longtime Waters/Pink Floyd fans, I had known about Roger's "Ca Ira" project for some time. In the pipeline for 15 long years, it almost seemed as if "Ca Ira" would never see the light of day. But Roger has finally finished it and released it to the world, and, I must admit, it's a very impressive work. Basing his classical opera on an original libretto by Etienne & Nadine Roda-Gil, Waters' "Ca Ira" is the story of the French Revolution, with the opera metaphorically set inside a circus ring, complete with a ringmaster, clowns, and acrobats acting out the tale. To make a long review short, I'll just say this: I think the music is quite powerful, the libretto (in english) is very intriguing, and the vocal performances by such opera veterans as Bryn Terfel, Paul Groves and Ying Huang are all superb. I also like the various sound effects, such as guns & cannons being fired, dogs barking, and the falling of the guillotine, as they all add to the mood & atmosphere of the piece. And the sound quality is great, too."Ca Ira" may not be for everybody, as some of Roger's fans may have set their expectations of it too high. My advice to them is this: don't expect to hear "The Wall Part II," or anything "Floydian" for that matter. This is a *classical* opera, not a rock opera. There's no guitar solos, no rock elements whatsoever, and Roger doesn't sing on it, either. But Roger HAS done an incredible job here, and, after waiting 15 years for it, I'm just happy to finally hear "Ca Ira" at last. And it is very, very good stuff indeed. I hope I can see it performed on the live stage in the near future, too. I strongly recommend picking up Roger Waters' "Ca Ira."
