 George Harrison had huge success with his 1987 album, "Cloud Nine," and with good reason: this is some of the most catchiest, irresistible music George ever made in his solo career. Co-produced by George and his pal, Jeff Lynne (of ELO), "Cloud Nine" contains nothing but absolutely wonderful, infectious pop: the title song, "That's What It Takes," "This Is Love," "When We Was Fab" (George's affectionate look back at his Fab Four days), "Devil's Radio," "Breath Away From Heaven," George's #1 hit single cover of Rudy Clark's "Got My Mind Set On You," and all the rest---simply marvelous music. George sings & plays his heart out, and he's joined on the album by a great group of friends, not only Jeff Lynne but also Eric Clapton, Elton John, and his old Beatle chum Ringo Starr. "Cloud Nine" is a very happy, upbeat, feel-good album that's eager to please, and it remains one of George Harrison's very best. You, too, will be on Cloud Nine listening to this one!
