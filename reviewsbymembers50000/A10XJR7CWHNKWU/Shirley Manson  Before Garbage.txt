 In 1993, before she was literally handpicked by the guys in Garbage to become their lead singer, Scottish lass Shirley Manson recorded one self-titled album with the band Angelfish. In short, this is a very good, solid rock album, highlighted by Shirley's sultry lead vocals on such cool tunes as "Suffocate Me," "Sleep With Me," and "Mummy Can't Drive." Little did Shirley realise it at the time, but she was practically auditioning for Garbage with this album, and she passed with flying colors. Angelfish quickly folded, and Shirley graduated to the big leagues of rock with Garbage, but Angelfish's lone album is great stuff, and is a must-own for any fan of Garbage who desires that one extra album with the seductive voice of Shirley Manson. Buy it!
