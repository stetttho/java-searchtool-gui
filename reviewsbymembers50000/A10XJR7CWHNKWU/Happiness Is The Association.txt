 With the temporary departure of singer/guitarist Jules Alexander, with his vacancy being filled by Larry Ramos (who still fronts the touring version of the band with Russ Giguere to this day), The Association struck commercial gold with their third album, 1967's "Insight Out," one of their most classic releases. It's got the group's biggest hit on it, the sunny #1 smash "Windy" (written for the band by a young female friend), as well as the all-time Wedding Day favorite, "Never My Love" (which reached #2). But these aren't the only great songs on the album---there's the ragtime rock of "Wasn't It A Bit Like Now," the dreamy "On A Quiet Night," the bouncy pop of "When Love Comes To Me," the rockin' "Reputation," the sitar-flavored pop-rock of "Wantin' Ain't Gettin'," and the totally powerful anti-war number, "Requiem For The Masses." Fabulous songs, performances, and vocal harmonies. When it comes to 60's "sunshine pop," there's nobody better than The Association. "Insight Out" is outstanding.
