 Composer/multi-instrumentalist Paul Hardcastle has been making awesome, smooth groove music since the 80's. Unfortunately, Paul's earliest albums from the 80's all appear to be out-of-print, but this CD, "The Best Of Paul Hardcastle," collects 14 tracks from Paul's early work, including the coveted *original mix* of his first big hit, "19," the classic Top 20 hit about U.S. soldiers who served in Vietnam (and whose average age was 19). Other goodies include the catchy "Don't Waste My Time," "Just For Money" (featuring spoken passages by actors Bob Hoskins and the late Sir Laurence Olivier), "The Wizard" (Paul's theme for the popular UK music program, "Top Of The Pops"), the jazzy "Walk In The Night," "40 Years," and the giddy instrumental, "Moonhopper." The only debits to this CD is that some of the other tracks don't fare as well---the polished 80's production kinda swamps the other songs---and the CD booklet gives no credit to the various guest performers on Paul's songs. Is the woman singing on "Don't Waste My Time" Paul's longtime vocalist Helen Rogers? Could be, but I can't be sure. And who's the guy singing on "40 Years"? Or the guy playing the sax solo on "Walk In The Night"? It's frustrating not to know! But for the most part, "The Best Of Paul Hardcastle" is an excellent, catchy, *groovy* slice of vintage Paul Hardcastle. I sure hope Paul's early albums will one day be re-issued, but this fine "Best Of" collection will do for now.
