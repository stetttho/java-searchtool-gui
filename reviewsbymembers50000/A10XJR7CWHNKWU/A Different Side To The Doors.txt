 1969's "The Soft Parade" is easily the Doors' most controversial album, with the band incorporating horns & strings to some of the tracks. It's certainly a different album from anything the group had done before, and, admittedly, it's not entirely successful. Some fans understandably balked, but I think the Doors should nonetheless be commended for taking the risk. Is "The Soft Parade" their greatest work? No, but it still contains a lot of great Doors music. "Touch Me" is an all-time Doors classic, one of the band's biggest hits, and it's still played very consistently on rock radio to this day. The 8 minute-40 second title rock suite that closes the album is a marvelous tour-de-force, and just as powerful as any of the Doors' other rock epics, like "The End" and "When The Music's Over." Other winners are the spooky grooves of "Shaman's Blues," the catchy psychedelic rock of "Wild Child," and the beautiful "Wishful Sinful." Only two tracks, in my opinion, fall flat---"Do It" is just meandering filler, and "Runnin' Blue" is sunk by a silly-sounding country/western chorus. But other than that, this is still a very good Doors album, featuring Jim Morrison's legendary master-of-ceremonies voice (and intriguing lyrics), Robbie Krieger's tasty guitar hooks, Ray Manzarek's awesome keyboard work, and John Densmore keeping the drumbeat firm and tough. "The Soft Parade" is the Doors bravely jumping off a musical cliff somewhat, and sure, they got a little bit bruised in the process. But in the end, they still came up with a daring, different, darn good rock album. And I do admire that.
