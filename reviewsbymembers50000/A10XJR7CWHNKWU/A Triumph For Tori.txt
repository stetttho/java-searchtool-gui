 Like many people, I can't quite fathom Tori Amos' bizarre lyrics...*I* listen to this phenomenally talented lady for her lovely singing voice, her unique piano-playing, and her incredibly strong musical arrangements. I don't know what the heck she's singing about, but nevermind---her gorgeous voice & music alone get my attention.Of Tori's albums so far, "From The Choirgirl Hotel" is the best one she's done to date. To be sure, "Little Earthquakes" & "Under The Pink" are already classics in their own right, and even the excessive "Boys For Pele" has moments of great beauty, but what I appreciate most about "Choirgirl" is Tori's willingness to branch out musically and get away from the "precious girl with the piano" persona she'd been carrying around on the first three albums. Not that there was anything wrong with that persona, of course---she made wonderful music during that time---but it WAS time for Tori to change direction a bit, or else she would've been in danger of becoming a caricature of herself. Thank goodness she did the right thing with "Choirgirl"! Tori has a full band with her on this album, giving "Choirgirl" a much more rockin' feel then her previous efforts, and the results are simply magnificent. There's some nifty electronic landscapes added to certain tracks like "Cruel," "Raspberry Swirl," "iieee" & "Liquid Diamonds," a first for Tori, giving the material a good extra kick in the audio department. "Jackie's Strength" is a lovely ballad..."She's Your Cocaine" is a great piano thumper, and the album closer, "Pandora's Aquarium," is a masterpiece, with Tori's grand piano rolling through the song like waves on a beach, and featuring one of Tori's most beautiful vocal performances ever that still sends chills up my spine whenever I hear it.I can't really praise this album enough. "From The Choirgirl Hotel" is easily Tori Amos' greatest, boldest, and most ballsy album to date. A truly amazing work from a truly amazing lady.
