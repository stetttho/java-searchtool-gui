 Having already recorded a full-length Christmas album, "To Drive The Cold Winter Away," Loreena McKennitt went into Peter Gabriel's Real World studios for three days with some musicians in July 1995 to record five Christmas songs just for fun. The end result is the Christmas EP, "A Winter Garden." Just 22 minutes long, "A Winter Garden" can easily be taken as a companion disc to "To Drive The Cold Winter Away." Loreena & company perform this quintet of holiday songs beautifully, especially the gorgeous, nearly-7 minute rendering of "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen," easily one of the very best versions of this classic song ever recorded. There are also spirited performances of "Coventry Carol," "Good King Wenceslas," "Snow" (originally featured on "To Drive The Cold Winter Away"), and "Seeds Of Love." "A Winter Garden" is a lovely holiday postcard from Loreena McKennitt.
