 Mike & The Mechanics' 1999 studio album, either known as "Mike & The Mechanics" or "M6," is an excellent album from Mike Rutherford and company, with many catchy tunes. It is also a fond farewell (however unintentional) to singer Paul Young, who passed away from a heart attack a couple of years later. Young and co-lead singer Paul Carrack deliver the goods in the vocal department throughout, on such great songs as "Whenever I Stop," the pulsating "Now That You've Gone," the fun pop rock of "Ordinary Girl," the beautiful "My Little Island," the dramatic "When I Get Over You" (which sounds very similar to the Traffic classic, "Dream Gerrard"), "If Only," and the concluding "Look Across At Dreamland." The songwriting & performances are strong, the production clean, and the sound is superb.However, I'm profoundly disappointed that Mike Rutherford can no longer get any of his new Mechanics albums released in the States anymore, courtesy of the poor US sales of the previous two Mechanics discs, "Word Of Mouth" and "Beggar On A Beach Of Gold." "M6" did not receive a US release, and ditto for the brand-new Mechanics album, "Re-Wired," so the import route will have to do for us American fans. But Mike Rutherford's music is worth every single penny, and "M6" is a GREAT Mike & The Mechanics album. And so long, Paul Young, you are greatly missed.
