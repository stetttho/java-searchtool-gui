 If you never got to see Sinatra in concert, than this live album is especially a blessing. Recorded during Frank's glory days in Vegas in 1966, it captures the man in all of his live glory. With Count Basie & His Orchestra backing him up, Frank breezes right through such classics as "Come Fly With Me," "I've Got You Under My Skin," "Luck Be A Lady," and many more. Sinatra is also a master stand-up comedian: his hilarious monologue about his Rat Pack buddies and his days growing up is absolutely priceless, just like his musical performance captured here. With "Sinatra At The Sands," Frank allowed his fans the world over to spend a very cool evening with him, and it's a show that you'll want to experience again and again. Put it on, Charlie, and let the Chairman give you a good time. :-)
