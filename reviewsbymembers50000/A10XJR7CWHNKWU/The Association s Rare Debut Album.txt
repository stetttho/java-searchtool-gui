 I'm absolutely thrilled that the lion's share of albums by the wonderful late-60's group, The Association, from their second album, "Renaissance," to their 2nd-to-last album, "Stop Your Motor," are all available in the U.S. at last. However, the band's 1966 debut disc, "And Then Along Comes The Association," is still only available as a Japanese import CD, probably because the majority of the album is already featured on the group's anthology set, "Just The Right Sound," which includes from this album such Association favorites as "Along Comes Mary," "Cherish," and "Enter The Young," as well as "Your Own Love," "Don't Blame It On Me," "I'll Be Your Man," "Standing Still," "Remember," AND the bonus single, the excellent Bob Dylan cover "One Too Many Mornings," and "Forty Times." So, dear Association fan, you may be asking yourself, why pay import price for tunes you already have?I say you should still buy this CD for (A) the original album cover art, (B) the enclosed lyric sheet, and (C) the four songs that are NOT featured on "Just The Right Sound": the fun of "Blistered," the spacey "Message Of Our Love" (nicely capped off by science-fiction sound effects), the short-but-punchy "Round Again," and the fine melodic pop of "Changes." So, in conclusion, "And Then Along Comes The Association" may indeed be a pricey import purchase for completists only, but really, folks, this IS a classic Association album, and if you happen to love this classic, harmonic pop/rock band as much as I do, then "...Along Comes The Association" is definitely worth seeking out. Happy hunting!
