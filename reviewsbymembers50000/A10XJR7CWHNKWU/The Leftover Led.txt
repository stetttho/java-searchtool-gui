 In 1982, two years after Led Zeppelin called it a day following the death of their irreplaceable drummer John Bonham, the band released the rarities album, "Coda," containing most of the last remnants of studio outtakes the band had left in the vaults. The problem was, Zeppelin had already used up most of their studio leftovers on their double-album, "Physical Graffitti," so the eight songs that make up "Coda" clock in at a very brief 33 minutes. So, yes, "Coda" is a very sparse Zeppelin collection, but most of the songs ARE very strong, and besides, what diehard fan would actually turn down a CD of some rare Zeppelin goodies, however sparse? Certainly not me.Only two tracks sound like throwaways to me: "Walter's Walk" and "Ozone Baby" are okay, but are mostly meandering and unmemorable. The rest of "Coda," however, is great. "We're Gonna Groove" and "I Can't Quit You Baby," both recorded in 1970, are absolutely *blistering* blues covers. "Poor Tom" is a true Zeppelin gem, with it's locomotive rhythm and awesome performance by the band. "Darlene," an outtake from "In Through The Out Door," is a fun 50's-style rock 'n' roller. John Bonham's drum showcase, "Bonzo's Montreaux," is just plain awesome. This is no mere drum solo, this is a magnificent drum piece with a definitive beginning, middle, and end, and it rocks. God bless you, Bonham! And "Wearing And Tearing," another leftover from "In Through The Out Door," is a tough, high-octane Zeppelin rocker.Led Zeppelin's "Coda" is what it is---an outtakes collection. Therefore, you can't really compare it fairly to Zeppelin's "proper" studio albums. But as an outtakes album, it is, for the most part, excellent. A darn good coda indeed for one of the greatest rock bands to ever walk the face of the earth.
