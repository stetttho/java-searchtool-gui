 Phil Collins went through the commercial stratosphere with 1985's "No Jacket Required," a smash-hit album with many hit singles that also won the Grammy for Album Of The Year. It's mostly a fast, high-powered pop album that's irresistibly fun, and it cemented Phil as one of the 80's most popular artists. You know the radio hits: "Sussudio," "One More Night," "Don't Lose My Number," and "Take Me Home," all of them signature Phil songs, but the album also shines with it's songs that were NOT released as singles, such as the pumped-up "Only You Know And I Know," "I Don't Wanna Know," "Who Said I Would," "Doesn't Anybody Stay Together Anymore," and the marvelous rocker, "Inside Out," quite possibly the best song from the album. Phil turns the volume down a bit on three songs, the beautiful hit ballad "One More Night," the spacious "Long Long Way To Go" (featuring Sting on background vocals), and the very lovely CD-only track, "We Said Hello Goodbye," one of Phil's finest tunes. Phil's songwriting, vocals and musical chops are terrific, and the production work by Phil & Hugh Padgham is bright & polished.The only debit for me about "No Jacket Required" is that it's become the album that Phil is forever judged by. As a longtime Phil Collins fan for well over 20 years and counting, I know for a fact that there is a LOT more to this man's music than just this one album. Check out his other solo albums, his great body of work with Genesis and the jazz-rock fusion band Brand X, and his producing & session work for other artists like Eric Clapton and Robert Plant. Phil Collins can do it all! "No Jacket Required" is only one chapter in the long, illustrious career of this very talented musician, but it is a very significant chapter, and an excellent, catchy pop album besides.
