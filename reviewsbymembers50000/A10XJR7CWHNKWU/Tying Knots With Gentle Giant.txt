 With new drummer John Weathers, who would remain with the band right to the end, Gentle Giant released their fourth album, 1973's "Octopus." It's another slice of GG's intricate "acquired taste" sort of progressive rock, but for those who are open to it--like me--it's great stuff. The band get some good jams in on tracks like "The Advent Of Panurge," "Knots," "The Boys Of The Band," and "River," as well as showing their softer side on the lovely, ballady "Think Of Me With Kindness." The band's musicianship is tight, the vocals are excellent. All in all, "Octopus" is yet another fine prog-rock album from the daring Gentle Giant.
