 An all-time personal favorite of mine, Brand X's second album, 1977's "Moroccan Roll," is the group's masterpiece. The album is absolutely exhilarating, an outstanding progressive jazz/rock fusion blend. The band---guitarist John Goodsall, bassist Percy Jones, keyboardist Robin Lumley, drummer Phil Collins (yes, THAT Phil Collins), and percussionist Morris Pert have never been better than on this album. "Sun In The Night" is a great Arabic-tinged piece, featuring Collins singing in Sanskrit language. Phil also contributes the world-class, slow & steady atmospheric piece, "Why Should I Lend You Mine," and the haunting follow-up, "Maybe I'll Lend You Mine after All," in which he also sings excellent, wordless vocals (which he does once more on "Disco Suicide"). Many other stand-outs follow, including *explosive* rockers like "Hate Zone," "Disco Suicide," "Malaga Virgen," and the closing "Macrocosm," which ends perfectly with---what else---an explosion. The band's musicianship is nothing short of stunning, the music simply phenomenal. Brand X's "Moroccan Roll" is an outstanding album, and the group's finest achievement. Progressive jazz/rock fusion doesn't get any better than this!
