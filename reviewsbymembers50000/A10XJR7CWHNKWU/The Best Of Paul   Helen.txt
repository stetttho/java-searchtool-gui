 A new greatest hits album put out by popular demand, "Jazzmasters: The Smooth Cuts" collects some of the best vocal tracks that composer/multi-instrumentalist Paul Hardcastle has recorded over the years, mostly with his most-frequent Jazzmasters singing partner, the soulful Helen Rogers (though two tracks on the album feature other singers). These songs are brilliant, catchy, and, of course, *smooth*. Many popular Hardcastle/Helen Rogers songs are featured, including "London In Springtime," "Lifetime," "Wonderland," "Runnin' Back," "Down So Low," and "Emerald Stardust," as well as the awesome covers of America's "Ventura Highway," and Fleetwood Mac's "Dreams." Also included is the beautifully heartfelt "You May Be Gone" (sung by Steve Menzies), and the groovy "It Must Be Love" (sung by Jaki Graham). Obviously, as there's only so much room on a single CD, there are other favorite Hardcastle tracks with vocals that are NOT included, such as "Don't Let It Get You Down," "Sounds Of Summer," "Got To Be Love," "Livin' In The Shadows," the cool cover of Pink Floyd's "Money," and many others. Nevertheless, "Jazzmasters: The Smooth Cuts" is a heavenly sampling of the heavenly smooth jazz music of Paul Hardcastle, with the lovely voice of Helen Rogers featured on most of the tracks. If you're a newcomer to Paul's music, this is a great CD to start with. I recommend it most highly!
