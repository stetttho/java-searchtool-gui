 After the success of her breakthrough 1993 album, "Fumbling Towards Ecstasy," and the lengthy tour that followed it, Sarah McLachlan took a couple of years off from the music biz before resurfacing in a big, BIG way with 1997's "Surfacing," which became her biggest-selling album to date. Sarah's masterful blending of pop, rock, and folk continues to work it's magic on "Surfacing," on such Sarah classics as the soft rockers "Building A Mystery" and "Sweet Surrender," and the absolutely gorgeous songs "Adia," "Angel," and "Full Of Grace." And even though it wasn't released as a single, "Black & White," the most rhythmic, atmospheric piece on the album, is my personal favorite from "Surfacing." It's a tremendous song, the album's secret weapon. But ALL of the songs here are quite marvelous, and Sarah's heavenly voice is just as entrancing as ever. Although "Fumbling Towards Ecstasy" still stands as my favorite album from Sarah, "Surfacing" is a sparkling beauty.
