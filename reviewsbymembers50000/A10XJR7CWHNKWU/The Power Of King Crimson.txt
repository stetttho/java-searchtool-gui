 34 years after their classic debut, 1969's "In The Court Of The Crimson King," the veteran prog-rockers King Crimson are still going strong. The band, comprising founder/guitarist Robert Fripp and Whoever The Heck Fripp Wants To Work With, are rock monsters that can easily shred wallpaper with full force. But they can also dip into dreamy psychedelic soundscapes, take off into the wild avant-garde, and, with the inclusion of singer/guitarist Adrian Belew since 1981, they also have a fine pop sensibility. Their latest album, "The Power To Believe," gives you the best from all of Crimson's worlds, as Fripp & company blend a modern sound with a great throwback feel to the band's experimental early days of "In The Court Of...", "Larks Tongues In Aspic," "Red," etc. Diehard Crimheads everywhere should totally dig this disc.The band tear through incredible instrumentals like "Level Five," "Elektrik," and "Dangerous Curves" with tremendous intensity. "Eyes Wide Open," the only real radio-friendly track on the album, is a terrific song---I'm sure it would do very well on modern rock radio stations. "Facts Of Life," and the tongue-twistingly titled "Happy With What You Have To Be Happy With," are great Crimson rockers. And the band ingeniously break up the title song into four separate sections that are spread throughout the album, each featuring a haunting vocal from Belew, and each one given a slightly different arrangement. It works wonderfully. Robert Fripp, now in his late-50's, still plays a lean, mean, slithering electric guitar. Adrian Belew's excellent vocals & guitarwork also stand mightily tall. Trey Gunn brilliantly plays a monstrous Warr bass guitar, and drummer Pat Mastelotto is a pure powerhouse on his "traps and buttons" (according to the CD booklet). "The Power To Believe" is an astounding King Crimson album, one of their best. May this Crimson line-up rock for many more years to come. :-)
