 To it's credit, Robin Platts' "Genesis: Inside & Out" is the only book about the rock group Genesis I've come across that is totally up to date with the band's history, including their last studio album, 1997's "Calling All Stations," and their pair of Archive box set releases from 1998 and 2000, respectively. Admittedly, it's a very good read overall, and thankfully, it does contain information about the band that I, a diehard Genesis follower for 20 years and counting, did not know about (such as the wealth of unreleased early Genesis songs that were NOT issued on the 1998 Peter Gabriel-era box set, with such titles as "Masochistic Man" & "Wooden Mask." I wonder if we'll ever get to hear these tunes?). However, the book is far from perfect. Aside from the occasional typo, Platts overlooks several well-known moments in Genesis' history (no mention of the famous onstage explosion at Oslo during the "Lamb Lies Down On Broadway" tour?), and he also makes it obvious that he's not really a fan of the band's Phil Collins-era material from 1978 onwards, with perhaps the lone exception of the "Duke" album from 1980 (and I *strongly* disagree with his derogatory remarks about the band's self-titled album from 1983---his reasons for not liking this excellent album are quite ridiculous). Still, I can't deny the fact that I did learn some more interesting things about my favorite band. "Genesis: Inside & Out" doesn't match up to "Genesis: I Know What I Like" by Armando Gallo," "The Book Of Genesis" by Hugh Fielder (currently out of print), or "Genesis: A Biography" by Dave Bowler & Bryan Dray, which, in my opinion, are easily the most insightful books ever written about the band. Nonetheless, a diehard Genesis fan can't go wrong by adding Robin Platts' book to their shelf, even if his comments about the band's later material are pretty silly. 3 out of 5 stars.
