 Supertramp's double live album from 1980, "Paris," is a wonderful live set, capturing the band at the peak of their popularity while they were on tour for their 1979 smash hit album, "Breakfast In America," at a time when co-leader Roger Hodgson was still with the group. When you consider that the possibility of Hodgson returning to Supertramp these days is highly unlikely, "Paris" becomes all the more an important live document of the band, indeed. Many great Tramp classics are included in this live set, such as "School," "Ain't Nobody But Me," "The Logical Song," "Dreamer," "Rudy," "Take The Long Way Home," "Fool's Overture," and "Crime Of The Century," plus one exclusive song, "You Started Laughing," not found anywhere else. Hodgson & co-leader Rick Davies sing their hearts out and play their respective keyboards with great passion, and Hodgson also serves up some incredible fretwork on the guitar. Co-horts John Halliwell on sax, drummer Bob Sibenberg & bassist Dougie Thomson have terrific interplay with Hodgson & Davies, helping to bring the band's great melodic music to life in tremendous fashion. Just like on their studio albums, the band totally cook live in concert, too. And the album's remastering treatment here is quite a blessing, giving a clarity to this live recording that wasn't heard before. It's almost like being at the concert itself, sitting alongside all of those lucky French Supertramp fans."Paris" is a fabulous Supertramp concert that you'll want to experience again & again. If you weren't lucky enough to see the band on their most successful tour ever, then listening to this album is definitely the next best thing. Supertramp live in Paris...ooh la la! :-)
