 1989's "A Dead Horse," the fourth album from drummer Anton Fier's studio group The Golden Palominos, is an excellent album with very strong pop-rock of both the down-to-earth & the ethereal kind. Fier's two main collaborators this time out are singer-songwriters Robert Kidney (who handles the down-to-earth material) and Amanda Kramer (who sings the dreamier-sounding stuff), and they both do great, including Kidney's confident turns on "Wild River" and "Lucky," while Kramer (who sounds quite a bit like Natalie Merchant) works vocal wonders on such songs as "Shattered Image" and the stunningly beautiful "Darklands." Great songs and performances make "A Dead Horse" a solid offering from the ever-changing Golden Palominos.
