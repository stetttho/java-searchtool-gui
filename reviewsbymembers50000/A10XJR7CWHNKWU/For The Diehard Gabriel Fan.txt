 Like Peter Gabriel himself says in the liner notes, his 1985 instrumental soundtrack album for the film, "Birdy," is a mish-mash sort of Gabriel album---7 original tracks, plus 5 tracks based on previously recorded material (ex: "Close Up" is a brief instrumental version of "Family Snapshot," "The Heat" is a shorter, instrumental version of "Rhythm Of The Heat," etc., etc.). But the new versions of the familiar songs, hearing them in a different light, are all quite interesting, and the original material is very strong, indeed. Highlights include the suitably eerie "At Night," "Floating Dogs" is a crackling good rocker, and "Quiet And Alone" & "Slow Marimbas" both have a peaceful, soothing ambience to them.  "Birdy" is not really an essential Peter Gabriel album to own if you're only a casual listener of the man, but if you're a diehard Gabriel follower like me, then this album is a must-have. As this was Gabriel's first attempt at a film score, I think he did an excellent job. "Birdy" is a fine soundtrack album from Mr. Gabriel, and an excellent foreshadowing to his classic score for "The Last Temptation Of Christ" four years later.
