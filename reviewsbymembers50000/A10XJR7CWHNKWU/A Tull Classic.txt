 1972's "Thick As A Brick" is one of Jethro Tull's greatest works, and the world's very first one-song rock album. That's right, "Thick As A Brick" is *one single song* clocking in at roughly 44 minutes, with Ian Anderson & the boys pumping it full of drama, moods, atmospheres, sound effects, acoustic beauty, awesome hard rock, and Anderson's marvelous lead vocals & intriguing lyrics. And speaking of Anderson's lyrics on this album, they've given many a Tull fan throughout the past 30 years the impression that "Thick As A Brick" is a concept album. Is it? Well, not exactly. This is because the so-called "concept" of this album is actually found in the *album cover*, NOT the album itself. The famous album cover looks like a newspaper, with the front page news story telling of the disqualification of a young boy named Gerald Bostock from a poetry competition, because his poem, "Thick As A Brick," was found to be too deranged by the judges on the panel. The lyrics to the album represent little Gerald's poem. But if you separate the album cover from the album itself, the "concept" to "Thick As A Brick" simply falls away, and what you're left with is a powerful rock album with some very allegorical lyrics about childhood & growing up, but there's no real *story* being told here. Now, "A Passion Play," THAT'S a concept album, in my opinion. "Thick As A Brick"....not really.But when all is said and done, it's the music that truly matters, and the music on "Thick As A Brick" is truly outstanding stuff, passionately played by the band, and certainly one of Ian Anderson's finest moments as a composer. It's no wonder the album is still one of the group's biggest sellers, as it's an astounding disc that has aged quite wonderfully like a fine wine, and it remains one of Tull's boldest, most adventurous pieces. A rock classic if there ever was one, "Thick As A Brick" is a must-own Jethro Tull album.
