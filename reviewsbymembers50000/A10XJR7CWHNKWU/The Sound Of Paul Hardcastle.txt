 The first in his "Jazzmasters" series of albums, Paul Hardcastle's "Jazzmasters I" is simply mindblowing. I just can't get enough of Paul's effortlessly breezy smooth jazz grooves. Deliriously catchy songs & instrumentals are all over this CD, such as "Sound Of Summer," "Blue Days," "Really Miss Your Love," "Heaven," "Lost Summer," "Without Love," and all the rest. Awesome melodies, arrangements, production & performances, as well as dreamy lead vocals by Paul's musical partner, Helen Rogers. What more can I say---Paul Hardcastle's "Jazzmasters I" is absolutely breathtaking.
