 The cloud of 9/11 hangs over Bruce Springsteen's new album, "The Rising," but who better to address that horrible day than Springsteen, who can write anthem rock like no one else on the face of the earth? Songs like the opening "Lonesome Day," "Empty Sky," and the already well-known "My City Of Ruins" will make Bruce fans proud. The man still has a great set of pipes that can scare ships off the Jersey shore, and the welcome return of Springsteen's E Street Band co-horts, including wife Patti Scialfa, Steve Van Zandt, Nils Lofgren, Clarence Clemons, and Max Weinberg, helps lift the material to the same glorious heights of "Born In The USA" & "Born To Run."With "The Rising," America's working-class hero of rock has returned in a big, big way. It's truly wonderful to have Bruce back in business. He's needed. :-)
