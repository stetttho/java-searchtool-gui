 Yes, this is a pricey Japanese import, but if you're an Association fan---and you have the bucks to burn---then this album, the 1969 movie soundtrack to "Goodbye Columbus," is worth picking up. It's not really an Association album, per se, but the band do contribute four tracks to it, including the hit title song, an instrumental version of the title song, a fine earlier recording of the catchy "It's Gotta Be Real" (though it WAS bettered when the band re-recorded it for "Stop Your Motor," in my opinion), and the very lovely "So Kind To Me." The rest of the album's score was composed & arranged by Charles Fox, who also did the *grrrroooovy* music to the Jane Fonda cult classic "Barbarella," and his music for "Goodbye Columbus," while not as psychedelic, is certainly just as cool, with a great late-60's vibe to it, perfectly matching the Association's contributions.The album clocks in at a mere 27 minutes and, once again, it IS a pricey import CD, but ask yourself this: do you *love* the music of the Association? And, do you want to get your hands on a very rare soundtrack album that the band contributed songs to? If the answer to both questions is yes---AND you can afford it---then buy it. If you're an Association completist (like I am), I know you'll be more than happy to add the "Goodbye Columbus" movie soundtrack to your Association collection.
