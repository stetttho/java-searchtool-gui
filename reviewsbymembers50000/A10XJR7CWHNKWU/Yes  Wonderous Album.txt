 With "Relayer" keyboardist Patrick Moraz making a hasty exit over "creative differences" (and later to be employed by the Moody Blues), Yes asked their old friend Rick Wakeman to return to the band. Wakeman had taken a one-album sabbatical from the group, having been displeased with Yes' direction on "Tales From Topographic Oceans." But the vacation re-ignited Wakeman's appreciation for Yes, and he was welcomed back into the band with open arms. Recorded in Switzerland, 1977's "Going For The One" is an excellent Yes album. The title song is a strong Yes rocker. "Turn Of The Century" is a beautiful piece. "Parallels" is another winner, with some great church organ from Wakeman. "Wonderous Stories," which was actually a big hit for Yes in the UK, is a lovely song. And finally, there's the classic Yes epic "Awaken," a 15 1/2 minute extravaganza that is tremendous in it's power and beauty. It's easily one of Yes' very best pieces. Jon Anderson, Steve Howe, Chris Squire, Rick Wakeman and Alan White are all in top form on this one. "Going For The One" is an excellent Yes disc.
