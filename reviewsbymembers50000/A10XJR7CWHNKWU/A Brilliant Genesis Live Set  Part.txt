 I saw Genesis live in the summer of 1992 on what would turn out to be their final tour with Phil Collins, and it still remains THE greatest concert I have ever attended in my life. The band's performance, power, and live presentation were SO magnificent, it was the closest I ever got to Heaven in my years on this earth so far. As my friend Mike so eloquently said when it was over, "I could've stayed and watched them play 'til Christmas!" Amen, brother. "Live: The Way We Walk Vol. 1 (The Shorts)" is the first half of the live document of this Genesis tour, featuring some of the band's biggest hit songs: "Land Of Confusion," "I Can't Dance," "Mama," "That's All," "In Too Deep," and "Invisible Touch," among other hits (the band's longer, more progressive-sounding material is found on "Volume 2 (The Longs)"). "The Shorts" is proof positive of what a powerhouse in concert Phil & the boys are. The performances are stunning, and Phil's singing voice is also in top form. And this live CD also makes a great case for the band regarding the slickness of their "Invisible Touch" material---although *I* like the album just fine, the "Invisible Touch" songs, including the poppy hit title track, really do sound better & stronger live in concert.The only disappointments on "Volume 1: The Shorts" is that the live rendition of "Mama" is missing a verse towards the end, and the live version of "Tonight Tonight Tonight" is much too short. Then again, this live set IS called "The Shorts," so I guess these two songs had to be pared down to hit-single length. Other than that, "Live: The Way We Walk Volume One (The Shorts)" is a terrific live Genesis set, and things only get better with it's companion release, "Volume Two (The Longs)," but that's another review....
