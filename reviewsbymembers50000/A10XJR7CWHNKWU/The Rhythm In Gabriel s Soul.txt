 Having begun his exploration of African music & rhythms with the song "Biko" on his 1980 "PG3" album, Peter Gabriel delves even deeper into his African influences on 1982's "Security" (though the album is still known as "PG4" outside the U.S.). "Security" marks another milestone for Gabriel, continuing his growth as a progressive-rock artist since his days with Genesis, whom he'd left seven years before. "Security" is a great album, a glorious marriage between haunting, dramatic rock & slamming African percussion, as the stunning opener, "The Rhythm Of The Heat," plainly shows. "San Jacinto," a Native-American influenced tune, is another pure Gabriel masterpiece. "I Have The Touch," one of the more radio-friendly songs on the album, is a great, catchy tune. "The Family & The Fishing Net" is dark, ominous, and soooooo good. Next up is Gabriel's classic rocker, "Shock The Monkey," his first big hit. "Lay Your Hands On Me" is marvelous atmospheric rock. "Wallflower," a song about confinement, is one of the most beautiful songs Gabriel has ever written. And for the grand finale, there's the exuberant "Kiss Of Life," with Gabriel heading for home on a gloriously rhythmic, upbeat note.Nobody makes music on God's given Earth like Peter Gabriel. His singing, songwriting, musicianship & production skills are simply outstanding, and his world class band of session players, including bassist Tony Levin, guitarist David Rhodes, & drummer Jerry Marotta, just can't be beat. "Security" is yet another triumph for this tremendous musical genius. :-)
