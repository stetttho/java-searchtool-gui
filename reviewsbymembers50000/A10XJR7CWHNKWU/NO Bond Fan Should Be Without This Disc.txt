 I'll just cut to the chase, 007 fans: "The Best Of Bond, James Bond" is a must-own CD. It's got *every single* Bond theme on it, from the first film, 1962's "Dr. No," to the 19th film, 1999's "The World Is Not Enough." ALL original recordings by the original artists are here, such as Shirley Bassey, Tom Jones, Nancy Sinatra, Paul McCartney, Carly Simon, Sheena Easton, Duran Duran, Tina Turner & Garbage. And no Bond CD would be complete without the legendary "James Bond Theme," featured here in no less than *three* versions: Monty Norman's 1962 original, the 1997 version by Moby, and, making it's CD debut, the "Goldeneye Trailer" version from 1995 that has featured in many 007 trailers since then (including the current trailers for the upcoming 20th Bond film, "Die Another Day"). Not only that, but the CD booklet gives you a brief rundown of Bond's history on the silver screen, film by film. Quite simply, "The Best Of Bond, James Bond" is a CD that no Bond fan should be without. It's also a great testament not only to the longevity of the world's most famous superspy, but also to the power of Bond's music. Buy it. Just buy it. :-)
