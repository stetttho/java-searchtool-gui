 The holidays have gotten even brighter with Jethro Tull's marvelous offering for this time of year, "The Jethro Tull Christmas Album." Ian Anderson & company serve up a hearty yuletide blend of new Tull Christmas originals, including the terrific "Birthday Card At Christmas," "Last Man At The Party," and "First Snow On Brooklyn," as well as new re-recordings of old holiday-themed Tull favorites like "A Christmas Song," "Another Christmas Song," "Ring Out Solstice Bells," and the signature Tull tune, "Bouree." Along with that classic instrumental, the band give us some more wonderful instrumental tracks, like the brilliant jazz take on "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen," "Pavane," "Greensleeved," and the beautiful closer, "A Winter Snowscape." The band play brilliantly, and Anderson's voice and flute are still in pristine form. "The Jethro Tull Christmas Album" is a magnificent gift from one of rock's most enduring acts. Happy holidays from Jethro Tull!
