 "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" is a wonderfully funny movie, a romantic comedy classic, and creator/star Nia Vardalos should've left it alone. But no, she tried to milk the "Greek Wedding" cow for all it was worth and came up with this woefully unfunny---and completely unnecessary---TV series, "My Big Fat Greek Life," which was promptly cancelled after only a handful of episodes (when asked why, the CBS president told TV Guide, "Well, you saw the ratings, and you saw the show"). The charmingly funny Greek family from the movie was reduced to doing pathetic sitcom shtick for the TV series, and I knew that something was very wrong when Vardalos changed her character's name from Toula to her own real-life name of Nia. Can you say, "ego"?You know what---I'll even go out on a limb and say that it was the TV show that costed Vardalos that much-deserved Academy Award for Best Screenplay for "Wedding," as the Academy must've thought to themselves, "We can't give an Oscar to something that's not good enough to win an Emmy." What a terrible, terrible shame. So, my fellow "Greek Wedding" fans, let's all keep the bloom on "My Big Fat Greek Wedding"'s rose: stick with the movie, and just forget that this lamebrained TV show ever came into being.
