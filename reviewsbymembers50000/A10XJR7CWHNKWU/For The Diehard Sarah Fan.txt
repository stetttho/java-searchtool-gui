 Sarah McLachlan's 1996 release, "Rarities, B-Sides, & Other Stuff," is exactly what it says it is, a collection of rare & hard-to-find tracks that Sarah recorded between 1989 and 1996---some for movie soundtracks, some as single B-sides, some live stuff, and some remixes. It's probably not an essential purchase for the casual Sarah fan, but for the diehard Sarah follower, it's an excellent batch of rare Sarah material. Sarah's cover songs are all marvelously done: the controversial XTC song "Dear God," the Billie Holiday classic "Gloomy Sunday," the Joni Mitchell staple "Blue," and Gordon Lightfoot's "Song For A Winter's Night." "I Will Remember You," which Sarah recorded for the film, "The Brothers McMullen," is a beautiful song, and one of Sarah's most popular tunes. The pretty "Full Of Grace" later appeared on Sarah's "Surfacing" album, and the Sarah favorite "Drawn To The Rhythm" is included here in a great live version. As for the remixes, they work for the most part, especially the remix of "Fear," which is given a powerful, driving rhythm track. Only two tracks come up short: "As The End Draws Near" is an obscure song by the group Manufacture that Sarah did a guest lead vocal on, but the song is a little *too* electronic-sounding for my taste, and the remix of Sarah's signature tune "Possession" just doesn't work, as all the beauty of the original song is gone. But overall, "Rarities, B-Sides & Other Stuff" is a definite must-purchase for Sarah McLachlan's most-devoted fans. If you love Sarah's music, then you can't go wrong adding this CD to your collection.
