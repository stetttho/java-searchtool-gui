 Before he formed his side project Mike + The Mechanics in 1985, Genesis bassist/guitarist Mike Rutherford recorded a pair of solo albums, and 1979's "Smallcreep's Day" was the first. Being Rutherford's solo debut, it was only natural that the album would sound a lot like Genesis in parts, but hey, there's nothing wrong with that! Mike recruited his old Genesis friend Anthony Phillips (the band's original guitarist) to play keyboards on the album, along with drummer Simon Phillips (no relation) and lead singer Noel McCalla. The end result is a brilliant album, with terrific compositions, performances, and production all the way around. Personal faves include the powerful rock of "Moonshine" and "Overnight Job," the beautiful "Every Road" and "Time And Time Again," and of course, the epic title rock suite, comprising tracks one to seven on the CD, including the thunderous "Working In Line," the bouncy "Cats And Rats (In This Neighborhood)," and the lovely finale, "At The End Of The Day," showing that Mike hasn't forgotten his "Supper's Ready" days in Genesis. Although it would take him until the formation of Mike + The Mechanics to *truly* step out of Genesis' shadow, "Smallcreep's Day" is an outstanding first solo step for Mike Rutherford.   (NOTE: the CD version of "Smallcreep's Day" flips around the two halves of the album, *beginning* with the "Smallcreep's Day" suite, which was actually Side Two of the original vinyl release. So, if you'd like to hear the album as Mike originally intended, begin the CD with track 8 ("Moonshine"), and when the disc ends, start the CD at the top to hear the second half. Maybe you won't care, but that's how *I* like to play "Smallcreep's Day" on my CD player.)
