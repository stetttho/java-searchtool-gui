 I can see how the Pink Floyd "greatest hits" album, "A Collection Of Great Dance Songs," originally released in 1981, may seem these days to be very obsolete, certainly in comparison to the 2-CD retrospective, "Echoes." A casual Floyd fan has no real need to buy "Dance Songs," BUT, for the diehard Pink Floyd fan who absolutely has to have it all, this CD is still worth getting. For starters, there's the re-recording of "Money" (which was reportedly done for legal reasons). Okay, so it doesn't sound all that different from the original version on "Dark Side Of The Moon", but it's still very rockin', and David Gilmour's re-done vocal and guitar solos still hit the spot. Also on "Dance Songs" is an edited version of "Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Part One)" (pared down to 10 minutes 40 seconds), with the lead vocals coming in a couple of minutes earlier, which is interesting. And you also get the single version of "Another Brick In The Wall Part 2," with the nine-second intro not featured on the "Wall" album itself. Toss in "One Of These Days," "Sheep," and "Wish You Were Here" for extra measure, plus a classic album cover by Storm Thorgerson, and you've got yourself a pretty cool Pink Floyd disc. I've always enjoyed this Floyd collection, however scant it may appear to be, and I'm happy to have it. Casual fans should buy the more-expansive "Echoes" instead, but if you're a Pink Floyd completist like myself, then I do recommend picking up "A Collection Of Great Dance Songs."
