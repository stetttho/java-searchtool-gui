 On Sept. 28, 1996, Procol Harum lead singer Gary Brooker organized a charity concert to raise funds for his local church, the St. Mary and All Saints Church, in his hometown of Surrey, England. The resulting live CD of the concert, "Within Our House," is a marvelous recording that's beautiful, uplifting & spiritual, as Brooker blends "church-friendly" arrangements of Harum classics like "A Whiter Shade Of Pale," "Nothing But The Truth," and "A Salty Dog" with Christian/Gospel numbers like "Gospel Train," "Jesus On The Mainline," and "Peace In The Valley." With Gary brilliantly leading on vocals and piano, he's joined by Harum members Dave Bronze on bass and Mark Brzezicki on drums, as well as the Chameleon Arts Choir & String Quartet. From start to finish this is a lovely live recording. Originally limited to 1000 copies, "Within Our House" is now available to all, for which Harum fans all over can be grateful. Thank you, Gary.
