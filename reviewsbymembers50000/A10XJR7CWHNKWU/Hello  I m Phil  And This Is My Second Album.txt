 On his second solo album, 1982's "Hello, I Must Be Going," Phil Collins shows two sides to himself: the happier man with a new ladylove in his life (the woman named Jill in the album credits), and the bitter man saying his last goodbyes to his first ex-wife. The end result is a powerful album, mixing tough rock with delectible pop, with a generous dose of horn-driven jazz/pop as well. It's one of Phil's best discs. The big hit from the album is Phil's faithful cover of the Supremes' "You Can't Hurry Love," and while Phil does great justice to the song, it's his own compositions that really stand out here. The angry "I Don't Care Anymore" & "Do You Know, Do You Care" are brilliant, powerful songs, with Phil's harsh lyrics, vocal & drumming attacks on both making these songs among his greatest recorded moments. "Like China" is a very humorous song (with Phil sporting a Cockney accent) about a young bloke who wants to make it with his girlfriend, but she keeps turning him down. The album's secret weapon, however, is the atmospheric "Thru These Walls," an outstanding song about a lonely man in desperate need of physical contact, but has to make do with hearing his next-door neighbors making love. It's one of Phil's strongest pieces. "I Cannot Believe It's True" & "It Don't Matter To Me" are both fine, upbeat jazz poppers, and "Don't Let Him Steal Your Heart Away" is an excellent mid-tempo ballad. Phil includes a great jazz rave-up with the instrumental "The West Side," and closes the album with the beautiful love song, "Why Can't It Wait 'Til Morning." Every song here is first-rate, as is Phil's work & production. "Hello, I Must Be Going" is a terrific second effort from Phil Collins.
