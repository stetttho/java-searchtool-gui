 Normally I don't review environmental discs, but this particular one deserves attention. "Environments 1: The Psychologically Ultimate Seashore" was the album that started the whole series of environmental sounds albums, and I do mean the WHOLE series of them, including the various offshoots. Originally released on LP in the 70's (with it's flipside being the sounds of a bird sanctuary), this album is a genuine recording of a seashore, rolling waves and all, and it plays for a full hour. Put it on "Repeat," and it can go on as long as you want. Is it relaxing? You bet it is. Played at low volume, this album helps me to sleep on many a night when I can't, and it also helps to sooth me and clear my mind. I put on this CD, and I'm instantly calmed. In fact, I'm playing it right now....aah....I can almost smell the seabreeze....Every home, in my opinion, should have a copy of "Environments 1: The Psychologically Ultimate Seashore." It's definitely the Big One in the genre of environmental CD's, and it's the only environmental album you'll ever need to own. Put it on, and relax in your home by the sea.
