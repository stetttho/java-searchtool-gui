 Balligomingo is the brainchild of keyboardist/programmer Garrett Schwarz, and I first became aware of the group through the inclusion of their song, "Purify," on the "Pure Moods IV" CD, and I was instantly taken with the song's lushness & sensuality, so I bought the group's album, "Beneath The Surface." This is an excellent disc, filled with heavenly keyboards, beats, atmospheres, and female vocals that remind me of groups like Enigma and Delerium. If you love the ethereal music of those studio groups, you will most certainly love Balligomingo. The dreamiest tracks, in my opinion, are "Purify," "Sweet Allure," "Wild Butterfly" (with an obvious nod to Enigma in it---listen for it), "Beyond," "Marooned," "Lust," and the untitled bonus track. Great music to chill to, with lovely, seductive vocals throughout by such ladies as Jody Quine, Beverley Staunton & Jennifer Hershman. "Beneath The Surface" is a great debut album by this promising studio outfit, and I definitely want to hear more. Go, Balligomingo!
