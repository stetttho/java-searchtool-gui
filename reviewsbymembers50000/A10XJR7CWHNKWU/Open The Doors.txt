 The brilliance of the Doors' 1967 self-titled debut pretty much speaks for itself. Right out of the gate, this band were a rock force to be reckoned with. The towering voice, charisma, and sex appeal of singer Jim Morrison, the electrifying keyboard work of Ray Manzarek, the powerful guitar chords from Robby Krieger, and the incredible ace drumming from John Densmore all combined to make the Doors a truly unique band in the history of rock. Note for note, song for song, "The Doors" is a perfect debut album, with every single tune on the disc a Doors classic. Where to begin? "Break On Through," "Soul Kitchen," "The Crystal Ship," "Twentieth Century Fox," "Light My Fire," "Back Door Man," "End Of The Night," and the 11 1/2 minute epic, "The End"....heck, ALL the songs, simply outstanding. Morrison & company were, and ARE one of rock's greatest groups. "The Doors" is a total keeper.
