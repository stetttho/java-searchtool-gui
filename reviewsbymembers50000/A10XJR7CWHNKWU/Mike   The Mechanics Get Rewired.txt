 (Regarding Dave's "review" of "Rewired"---what a joke! For a very different opinion, here's MY review of "Rewired.")        Mike Rutherford & Paul Carrack, I salute you! Mike & The Mechanics have just released a stunning, astonishing, magnificent brand-new album called "Rewired." It's the first M+M album in five years, and the first M+M album since the untimely passing of singer Paul Young in 2001, with co-lead singer Paul Carrack now handling all of the vocal duties. From the very first song, I was instantly floored. The album isn't called "Rewired" for nothing---it's practically a *reinvention* of Mike Rutherford's side-project outside of Genesis since 1985, and it works magnificently. Even though Paul Young's vocal presence is greatly missed, and the Mechanics will never be quite the same without him, Mike Rutherford & Paul Carrack have nonetheless created what is quite possibly the best Mechanics album to date, and I tip my hat to both of them with the utmost respect & admiration. "Rewired" is a truly special album. What you'll discover on "Rewired," along with the Mechanics' trademark, first-rate dramatic pop-rock, are the brand-new *sounds* Rutherford has brought to the band with this album. There's elements of techno, funk, and DJ-style scratching on this album, and man, does it rock. You've never heard M+M like this before. "One Left Standing" is groovy with a capital G. "If I Were You" and "Perfect Child" are both beautiful songs. And then comes one of the most daring tracks the group has ever recorded, the title track for "Rewired." This rip-roaring instrumental is nothing short of thrilling. The creativeness behind this track, with killer guitar riffs from Rutherford, the heavy percussion, ominous piano & synths, tape loops, and the occasional vocal drop-ins from Carrack, is simply astonishing. Another pair of lovely, well-crafted pop songs follow with "I Don't Want It All," and "How Can I?". "Falling" is a fabulous song, with it's catchy grooves and it's clever mixture of techno, pop, rock, and even the occasional dash of orchestral soundbites, all in one amazing tune. "Somewhere Along The Line" is a sparkling, radiant number. And finally, for the ultimate encore, there's the towering "Underscore," a rough-and-tough instrumental cousin of "Rewired," with some more delicious beats, samples, guitar & keyboard riffs, and vocal cameos from Carrack. A fitting end to a total powerhouse of an album. And it certainly goes without saying that the album's sound quality & production is fantastic, the musical performances are top-notch, and Paul Carrack, who is more than up to the challenge of becoming the band's sole lead vocalist from now on, sings brilliantly. Without question, "Rewired" is an outstanding and exciting new chapter for Mike & The Mechanics. Congratulations, Mike & Paul, and welcome back.
