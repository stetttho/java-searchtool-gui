 Bond are four young, classically-trained babes based in Britain who play violins, viola, & cello. But no, you can't quite categorise them as "classical" because their classical instruments are blended with dance beats and electronica, and the lovely Bond lasses themselves dress in tight, revealing outfits rather than typical classical-concert dresses. Let's call these girls "classical/pop/electronica," then. Like the Bond girls themselves, their debut album, "Born," is quite a curiosity, but it's an intriguing one---a fine, exquisite whirlpool of the classics with Top 40 sensibility. And while looking at the four women on the cover & inside photographs is entertaining enough (Bond obviously have no qualms about flaunting their sex appeal, God bless 'em), you have to give them credit where credit is due: the girls can PLAY."Victory" is the obvious lead-off single, a supremely catchy instrumental that gives you a darn good indication of what Bond are all about in one shot. But the rest of the album is just as fascinating, and I find myself thoroughly entranced by the groups' expertly honed pop/classical confections. But being such a curious group in today's music marketplace, only time will tell if Bond truly have a long future ahead of them, or if they're destined to be a one-album wonder. But "Born" makes one thing clear: the women of Bond have great musical talent to match their great looks, and they can only get better. "Born" is a very impressive debut by a talented up-and-coming group that you should definitely keep an eye on in the next few years.
