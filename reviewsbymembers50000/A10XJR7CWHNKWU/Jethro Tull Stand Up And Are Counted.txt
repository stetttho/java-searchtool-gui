 With new guitarist Martin Barre onboard---and who has remained with the band ever since, bless his heart---Jethro Tull recorded their 2nd album, 1969's "Stand Up," and delivered their first masterwork. This is a truly outstanding album, with first-rate songwriting and performances. The band totally rock on such classics as "A New Day Yesterday," "Back To The Family," "Nothing Is Easy," and "For A Thousand Mothers." There's the band's all-time classic instrumental, "Bouree" (which has remained a concert staple to this day), the gorgeous "Look Into The Sun" and "Reasons For Waiting," and the mandolin fun of "Fat Man." This remastered edition of "Stand Up" comes with four excellent bonus tracks, including two more classic Tull numbers in the form of "Living In The Past" (a Top 15 hit), and "Sweet Dream." Singer/flautist Ian Anderson, guitarist Martin Barre, bassist Glenn Cornick, and drummer Clive Bunker sound superb on this recording. What more can I say: "Stand Up" is one of Jethro Tull's finest.
