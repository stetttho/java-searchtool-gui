 1972's "Obscured By Clouds" is a very overlooked Pink Floyd album---it's essentially a soundtrack album to a little-seen French film, "The Valley," and it's sandwiched between two Floyd albums that are much more popular, 1971's "Meddle," and the legendary 1973 release that is "Dark Side Of The Moon." But mark my words, "Obscured By Clouds" is a stunning Floyd album that's just as strong as any of the band's well-known classics.The opening two-in-one instrumental, "Obscured By Clouds/When You're In" is one of my all-time favorite Floyd pieces. The first half starts out very hypnotically, with a pulsing rhythm and David Gilmour's searing guitar coloring it in all the right spots. Then it fades, and the band roar right back into it, full-throttle, with a gloriously rocking second half. Other highlights include the fine rockers "The Gold It's In The..." & "Childhood's End," the whimsical "Wots...Uh The Deal," "Free Four," a light-hearted Roger Waters tune about death, the lovely "Stay," which is a great showcase number for keyboardist/vocalist Richard Wright, and the atmospheric finale, "Absolutely Curtains.""Obscured By Clouds" is truly an obscured Pink Floyd album, but it is without question one of their best. As the album that came just before "Dark Side," it captures the band knocking on the door to rock immortality with an album that's just as good as that legendary monster. "Obscured By Clouds" is a marvelous buried treasure from Pink Floyd. Buy it! :-)
