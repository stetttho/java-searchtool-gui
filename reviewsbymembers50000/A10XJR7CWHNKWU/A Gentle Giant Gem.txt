 Gentle Giant's fifth album, 1973's "In A Glass House," had a little bit of difficulty upon it's original release. CBS Records, who had released GG's previous two albums in the States, "Three Friends" and "Octopus," apparently didn't care very much for the band's latest offering, and they passed on it. So, for the longest time, U.S. fans of Gentle Giant could only get "In A Glass House" as an import. Thankfully, though, with the dawn of the compact disc, this problem has since been rectified. Listening to this obscure GG album, I can only speculate that the brass at CBS must've been totally deaf at the time, because "In A Glass House" is easily one of the band's very best releases. The album's bookend tracks, "The Runaway" (kicking off with the sound of breaking glass) and the title track (which concludes with the same sound of breaking glass) are two of the band's very best pieces---great, quirky, uncompromising prog rock. "An Immate's Lullaby" and "A Reunion" are both haunting and beautiful, and "Way Of Life" and "Experience" are both solid Gentle Giant rockers. The band's precision and performances are amazing, the vocals are very strong, and the album's production is top-notch. A terrific prog rock album straight across the board, "In A Glass House" is a definitive Gentle Giant gem.
