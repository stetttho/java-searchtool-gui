 So, what shall we call Led Zeppelin's fourth album? "Zoso"? "Four Symbols"? "Runes"? "Untitled"? Heck, let's just call it "Led Zeppelin IV"! Zeppelin's classic 1971 release is understandably named by most fans as their definitive album. It's got "Stairway To Heaven" on it, so need I say more? No doubt about it, "Led Zeppelin IV" is one of THE greatest rock albums of all-time. Not only do the band totally rock out on Zeppelin classics like "Black Dog," "Rock 'N' Roll," "Misty Mountain Hop," "Four Sticks" and "When The Levee Breaks," but they also display moments of tremendous musical beauty, not only "Stairway" but also the mandolin-fused "The Battle Of Evermore," and the acoustic showcase "Going To California." The band's songwriting and musical interplay throughout is nothing short of outstanding. It's as if the group *knew* they were on a rock 'n' roll mission in making this album. And about "Stairway To Heaven"---what makes it such an enduring, all-time FM radio favorite? Well, besides the fact that it's simply a magnificent song, I think it's because it's got *everything* Led Zeppelin were all about in a single tune: some truly hypnotic guitar-playing from Jimmy Page, Robert Plant's powerful lead vocals, awesome keyboard-playing and basslines from John Paul Jones, and John Bonham's legendary thunder behind the drumkit. The poetic lyrics, the beautiful build-up, the hard rocking second-half & conclusion, it's all there in "Stairway." And although "Stairway To Heaven" is by-and-large the album's main attraction, *every single song* on "Led Zeppelin IV" stands mightily tall next to it. It's no wonder this album remains the band's biggest seller---Led Zeppelin totally outdid themselves with "Led Zeppelin IV," unquestionably a brilliant every-home-should-have-one rock masterwork.
