 After getting themselves a bit bruised with the less-than enthusiastic response to their fourth album, "The Soft Parade" (a great album for the most part, but it did contain a couple of clunkers), the Doors bounced right back with the outstanding "Morrison Hotel." No horns, no strings, and no country-western stuff to be found on this album, just pure bar-band rock & blues, all played to perfection by the Doors. These are great songs, such as the rollicking Doors classics "Roadhouse Blues" and "Peace Frog," the powerful rock of "Waiting For The Sun," the very slinky "The Spy," the fun of "You Make Me Real" and "Land Ho," the great beauty of "Indian Summer," and finally, the awesome dirty rock of "Maggie M'Gill." The charismatic Jim Morrison is simply outstanding on the microphone, while keyboardist Ray Manzarek, guitarist Robbie Krieger, and drummer John Densmore sound amazingly tight. So buy this album, and enjoy your stay at the Morrison Hotel.
