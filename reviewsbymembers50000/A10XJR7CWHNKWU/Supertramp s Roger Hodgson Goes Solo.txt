 Roger Hodgson, singer/songwriter, musician & founding member of the successful group Supertramp, left the band in 1983 after their tour for "Famous Last Words" was completed (creative differences with Supertramp co-founder Rick Davies were said to be the cause of Roger's exit). He made his solo debut in 1984 with "In The Eye Of The Storm," and, if you love Roger's work with the 'Tramp, then you'll most certainly love his solo stuff as well. "In The Eye Of The Storm" features all the musical trademarks that Hodgson brought to Supertramp's table---his classic falsetto voice, his amazing keyboard & guitar work, and his knack for writing fabulous melodies and dramatic musical elements. "Had A Dream (Sleeping With The Enemy)" is a Hodgson classic, with some clever, thinly-veiled lyrics about leaving Supertramp and striking out on his own. "In Jeopardy" is my personal favorite from the album, a brilliantly catchy piano-thumper. Also worth mentioning is the beautiful song "Lovers In The Wind," and the astonishing album-closer, "Only Because Of You," a truly haunting, memorable number. I can only guess that Roger Hodgson named his debut album "In The Eye Of The Storm" because that's precisely the situation he found himself in at the time, leaving a mega-successful band to forge his own path. Some would say that he was crazy to leave Supertramp, but, as Roger sings in "Had A Dream," "But it's time, gotta take a stance/'Cause I won't get a second chance/And I know now I have to make it alone." And he certainly has---Roger Hodgson's "In The Eye Of The Storm" is a most excellent album.
