 One of my all-time favorite albums is the 1995 debut disc by Garbage, who, in my opinion, are the world's greatest modern rock band. The group came together when guitarists' Duke Erikson & Steve Marker wanted to form a band with their friend, drummer/producer Butch Vig (who produced Nirvana's classic, "Nevermind"). But they still needed a singer. One evening the guys are watching MTV, and they see a music video by a band named Angelfish, fronted by a Scottish lass named Shirley Manson. Impressed with Shirley, the Garbage men immediately contact her, and the rest, as they say, is history. Their 1995 self-titled debut album is a fabulous whirlpool blend of bone-crunching rock and shimmering pop, with classy euro-trash production, samples and effects, capped off by Shirley's seductive voice. It arguably remains their best album to date (though I certainly love "Version 2.0" and "beautifulgarbage" just fine).There's not a dull track anywhere on "Garbage." Whether tearing up the joint on rockers like "Supervixen," "As Heaven Is Wide," "Vow," and "My Lover's Box," pumping up the pop on "Only Happy When It Rains," "Fix Me Now," and the big hit "Stupid Girl," or soaring through the atmosphere on songs like "Queer," "A Stroke Of Luck" and "Milk," Shirley & the boys are a superb musical force to be reckoned with. They are original, intelligent, crafty, and just plain genius. To my ears, there's no other modern rock band these days that comes close to them. I sure hope that there will be more music to come from Garbage in the near future, 'cause they're that good. "Garbage" is a stunning album by the kings (and queen) of modern rock. Long may they reign!
