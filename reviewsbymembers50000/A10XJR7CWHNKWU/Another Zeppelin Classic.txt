 For some reason, Led Zeppelin's 1976 album, "Presence," is not as highly touted as the band's earlier work. Yes, the band recorded it in a mere month, and yes, Robert Plant's voice, while commanding as usual, sounds a *little* restrained here, as he recorded his vocals sitting down with his leg in a cast, as he was still recovering from a car accident. But these are mere trifles, as "Presence" really is an awesome Zeppelin album, a full-throttle rocker from beginning to end. The band ride shotgun on the galloping 10 1/2 minute epic, "Achilles Last Stand," an all-time Zeppelin classic. "For Your Life" is funky with a capital F, and "Royal Orleans" is a cool little ditty. "Nobody's Fault But Mine" is another signature Zeppelin rocker, "Candy Store Rock" and "Hots On For Nowhere" are both excellent, and the band's sultry 9 1/2 minute blues number "Tea For One" is a real beauty. Robert Plant's pipes still pack a punch, Jimmy Page totally cuts loose with one killer guitar riff after another, John Paul Jones bravely puts aside his keyboards for this album and strictly lets his thunderous bass do the talking, and, of course, what needs to be said about late drummer John Bonham---the guy was simply a monster on that drumkit. First-rate production by Page, outstanding performances by the band, and, to put it simply, the album just plain rocks. No doubt in my mind---"Presence" is yet another Led Zeppelin classic.
