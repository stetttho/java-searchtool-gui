 The Squirrel Nut Zippers are a six man, one woman North Carolina outfit who specialise in old style jazz, swing, & dixieland, but with a surprising modern sensibility. 1996's "Hot" was an unexpected hit album for the group, thanks to the catchy novelty hit, "Hell," and it's very amusing music video, which even MTV couldn't resist playing. The Zippers are just plain fun, and "Hot" perfectly captures the band's lighthearted appeal. Featuring banjo, ukelele, trumpet, and the distinct vocals of Tom Maxwell & Katherine Whalen, the Zippers blaze through 12 upbeat originals, not only "Hell" but other big band winners like "Got My Own Thing Now," "Put A Lid On It" (which has a kind of "Hit The Road Jack" sort of vibe), "Big Businessman," the soothing "Twilight," and the hip instrumentals, "Memphis Exorcism," "Flight Of The Passing Fancy," and "The Interlocutor." Sometimes you just don't feel like listening to hard rock. Sometimes you just need a fix of cheery, good ol' fashioned music from way back when, and The Squirrel Nut Zippers are great suppliers of that. "Hot" IS a hot album, and great fun to listen to. Swing out, sister! :-)
