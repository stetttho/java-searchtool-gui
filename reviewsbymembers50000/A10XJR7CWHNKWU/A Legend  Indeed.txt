 When Johnny Cash sang a song, you listened. His deep, commanding voice & presence, his brilliant ability to tell stories, his heartfelt songwriting and skillful fingerpicking on the guitar....you didn't mess with The Man In Black. It's no wonder that he has influenced so many songwriters & musicians straight across the music board, and not just country music, but also rock and folk. Johnny Cash was a true original, and we'll never see another one like him. If you only buy one Johnny Cash CD, then "The Legend Of Johnny Cash" is the perfect choice---a single shot of 21 of Cash's greatest tracks spanning his entire career from 1955 to 2003, and all sequenced in chronological order, starting with Cash's earliest single "Cry Cry Cry," and ending with his gorgeous, instant-classic rendering of Nine Inch Nails' song about addiction, "Hurt." In between, you get other signature Cash favorites like "Folsom Prison Blues," "I Walk The Line," "Ring Of Fire," and Cash's duet with his beloved wife June Carter, "Jackson." There's also his huge hit novelty song, "A Boy Named Sue" (recorded live at San Quentin Prison), and later Cash material like his song with U2, "The Wanderer," his memorable tale, "Delia's Gone," and there's even a great, full-throttle rock song for Johnny with his terrific cover of Soundgarden's "Rusty Cage." Needless to say, Johnny Cash's entire catalog is well worth buying, and the man certainly left us a whole wealth of wonderful music and then some. But this CD, "The Legend Of Johnny Cash," is an outstanding disc to start with.
