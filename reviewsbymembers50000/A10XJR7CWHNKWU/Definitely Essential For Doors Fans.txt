 If you're a diehard Doors fan who didn't already purchase this CD along with "The Doors" box set, then chances are you will thoroughly enjoy "Essential Rarities," a superb collection of Doors demos, outtakes, and live recordings. On this disc you'll find such gems as the excellent "Soft Parade" leftover "Who Scared You" (which rightfully deserved to be included on that album), the drunken-bar tale of "Whiskey, Mystics And Men," the early 1965 demo of "Moonlight Drive" (with it's lighter vibe and Jim Morrison's softer vocal treatment), the cocktail-lounge alternate version of "Queen Of The Highway," the lovely "Orange County Suite," and the band's scorching live performances of "The Soft Parade" and "The End." I suppose casual listeners don't really need this album, but for the most faithful followers of The Doors, "Essential Rarities" is VERY essential stuff, no question about it.
