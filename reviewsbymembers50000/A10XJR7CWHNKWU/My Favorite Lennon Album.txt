 My personal favorite John Lennon album is 1974's "Walls And Bridges," which may seem like an odd choice to some people since the album is considered to be one of John's "weakest" releases (and recorded during John's "lost weekend" period, when he was separated from Yoko Ono). Personally, I don't understand the criticism at all. "Walls And Bridges" a "weak" album? Nonsense! Whatever personal problems Lennon was going through during this period, I think he still cranked out a fantastic album. Mind you, I enjoy all of John's solo stuff, including such classics as "Plastic Ono Band," "Imagine," and his songs on "Double Fantasy," but there's just something about "Walls And Bridges" that appeals to me the most. What else can I say? I think the songs, the production, and of course, John's singing and songwriting is just wonderful on this disc. There are memorable melodies and performances throughout "Walls And Bridges." Great songs include "Going Down On Love," the #1 hit "Whatever Gets You Through The Night" (featuring Elton John), the jazz-rock throwdown "What You Got," the gorgeous feel of "Bless You," the atmospheric dreamscapes of "#9 Dream," the powerful "Steel And Glass," the funky instrumental "Beef Jerky," and the classic Lennon ballad "Nobody Loves You (When You're Down And Out)". These songs are absolutely amongst Lennon's best work, so don't tell me that this album is weak. If I'm alone in my opinion that "Walls And Bridges" is the best solo album Lennon ever recorded, then so be it. Maybe I'm just weird. But I totally love John Lennon's "Walls And Bridges" and I always have. I hope you will, too.
