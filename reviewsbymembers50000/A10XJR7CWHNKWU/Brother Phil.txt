 This is Phil Collins' soundtrack album to the 2003 Disney movie, "Brother Bear," with Phil collaborating once again with Mark Mancina, the composer who worked with Phil on the music for Disney's "Tarzan." And while Phil's music for "Brother Bear" falls a *tad* short of the great work he did on "Tarzan"---just a tad, mind you---this is still very pleasant, solid music from Mr. Collins, including such songs as "Look Through My Eyes," "Welcome," "No Way Out," and "On My Way." Tina Turner does an excellent guest lead vocal on "Great Spirits," as do The Blind Boys Of Alabama on the second version of "Welcome." And the three orchestral tracks that close the album, co-written by Collins and Mancina, are all quite good. The songs on "Brother Bear" may not be as memorable as the batch that Phil did for "Tarzan" (which may explain Phil's lack of an Oscar nomination for this movie), but still, this is very good music, and Phil's vocals and drum work here is very strong (as always). If you're a Phil Collins fan, then definitely pick up the "Brother Bear" movie soundtrack.
