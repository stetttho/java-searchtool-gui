 Even within the genre of progressive rock, Emerson Lake & Palmer have always been an acquired taste---either you like this power trio's intricate, complex arrangements & show-offy musicianship, or you don't. But I, for one, have to give these guys some credit---much of ELP's music is very strong & powerful, indeed. Keyboardist extraordinaire Keith Emerson, singer/guitarist/bassist Greg Lake, and drummer Carl Palmer are all tremendous musicians (with Lake sporting one of the great, commanding voices in all of rock, besides), and when put together in a recording studio or on a stage, these guys are a mighty three-piece rock orchestra.ELP's third album, 1972's "Trilogy," is also their best. Keith, Greg, and Carl really sound like a well-oiled machine on this one. The great dramatic shifts of "The Endless Enigma" are awesome. Greg Lake's "From The Beginning" is a brilliant acoustic masterpiece (and arguably my favorite ELP song, bar none). "The Sheriff" is terrific Wild West fun, and the kinetic "Hoedown" is another great ELP staple. The title track is an amazing piece (love that exuberant instrumental section, too), "Living Sin"  is a strong, steady rocker (with Lake's deliciously demonic voice sounding like a creature rising from the tarpits), and finally, "Abaddon's Bolero" is an excellent march that builds & builds to a great climax---you can just imagine some armor-clad army going off to battle with this one. And "Trilogy" is also the best-sounding album from ELP, the group's production work here sounding as sharp as a knife.Emerson Lake & Palmer's "Trilogy" is the band's strongest album, with every single track on it a bonafide winner. They have other great albums, of course: "Emerson Lake & Palmer," "Tarkus," "Brain Salad Surgery," etc., but for me, ELP's brand of art-rock works to maximum effect on this one. "Trilogy" is Keith, Greg, and Carl at the peak of their powers.
