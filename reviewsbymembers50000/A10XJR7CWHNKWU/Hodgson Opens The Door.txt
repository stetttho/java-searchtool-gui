 "Open The Door," released in 2000, is ex-Supertramp singer Roger Hodgson's first solo album of studio material since 1987's "Hai Hai" (there was also his 1997 release, "Rites Of Passage," but that was a live album). This record is a brilliant return for Roger, filled with his same magic touch for melody, catchy hooks, and powerful, dramatic rock that made his work with Supertramp so special. Great songs from end to end, like the beautiful "Along Came Mary," the poppish "Hungry," the simple-but-memorable "The Garden," and the awesome extended pieces, "Death And A Zoo" and the title song, the latter of which reminds me of the old Supertramp favorite, "Fool's Overture." Hodgson's classic falsetto voice remains in pristine condition, his playing & songwriting simply wonderful. I'm disappointed that "Open The Door," like the latest 'Tramp album, "Slow Motion," is only available on import in North America, but it's totally worth getting. "Open The Door" is a must-buy CD for the Roger Hodgson/Supertramp faithful.
