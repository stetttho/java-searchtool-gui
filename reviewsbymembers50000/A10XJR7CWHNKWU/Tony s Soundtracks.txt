 Genesis keyboardist Tony Banks has always expressed interest in composing music for films, but, regretfully, he hasn't been given the opportunity too often (his score for the film "2010" was ultimately dropped in favor of David Shire's, which I still consider a great musical loss). But when Tony *does* get to do a film score, he totally delivers. For starters, his music for the 1983 Faye Dunaway flick, "The Wicked Lady," was brilliant and the *only* good thing about that movie (alas, the soundtrack album is out-of-print and still hasn't made it to CD, but do seek out an old vinyl copy if you can). Tony's 1986 release, "Soundtracks," is a compilation of film music he recorded for a pair of movies from that same year, "Quicksilver" (the one with Kevin Bacon on a bicycle), and an obscure British sci-fi movie, "Lorca And The Outlaws," which I don't believe ever got a release in the U.S. "Soundtracks" has a late-80's feel to it that will remind you of Tony's keyboard work with Genesis on their "Invisible Touch" album, also from 1986. The music is quite excellent. Guest vocalists include ex-Marillion singer Fish on the poppish "Shortcut To Somewhere," Jim Diamond on the greatly melodic "You Call This Victory," and Toyah Wilcox (aka Mrs. Robert Fripp) on the sinister "Lion Of Symmetry." The instrumental pieces also shine on the album, such as the driving punch of "Smilin' Jack Casey," the mysterious air of "Gypsy," and the powerful "Lorca" (which Tony would later re-work as "Queen Of Darkness" for his album, "Bankstatement"). If you're a diehard fan of Tony Banks, you should definitely pick up "Soundtracks." (And a message to filmmakers---if you need some great original music for your film, give Tony a call!)
