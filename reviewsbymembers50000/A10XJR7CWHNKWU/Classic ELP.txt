 1971's "Tarkus" is one of ELP's best works (though it's not really the "concept" album that some fans think it is). The title epic is a barnburning ELP classic, featuring some of Keith Emerson's best keyboard work ever, a thunderous bassline and strong guitar riffs & vocals from Greg Lake, and big booming drums from Carl Palmer. As for the second half of the album, there's the piano rag fun of "Jeremy Bender," the rollicking "Bitches Crystal," the striking hymn of "The Only Way," including it's awesome instrumental conclusion called "Infinite Space" (featuring excellent piano-banging from Emerson), the rocking "A Time And Place," and finally, the band's humorous salute to their producer Eddy Offord, "Are You Ready Eddy?," a 50's rock 'n' roll-style number. "Tarkus" is a great ELP disc.
