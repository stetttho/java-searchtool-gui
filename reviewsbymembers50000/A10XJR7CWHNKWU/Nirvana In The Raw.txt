 In the beginning, Kurt Cobain and his band Nirvana were very much living on a budget, and their 1989 debut album, "Bleach," was recorded very quickly for a mere $600, resulting in a very raw, in-your-face, gloss-free grunge rock production. The rawness, and, some would say, the sonic *wildness* of "Bleach" doesn't have the surprising mass appeal of Nirvana's mega-hit follow-up, "Nevermind," and it's apparent that the band were still in their "teething" stage at this point (even more so because drummer Dave Grohl hadn't joined yet--the drummer on "Bleach" is Chad Channing, who's good, but can't smash his kit like Grohl can). But "Bleach" still reveals a band of great rockin' power, and Kurt Cobain to be a talented singer/songwriter/guitarist who *knew* how to craft this kind of rock music, and who could also surprise you with the occasional pop hook. The best stuff on "Bleach" includes the catchy "Blew," the original "plugged" version of the "MTV Unplugged" fave "About A Girl," "School" (with Kurt's famous cry of "No recess!"), the Shocking Blue cover "Love Buzz," "Negative Creep," "Scoff" (with another great Kurt cry, "Gimme back my alcohol!"), the slow, muddy rock of "Sifting," and "Big Cheese." Some of the other tracks are, admittedly, a bit aimless, but they're good enough. Kurt's voice & guitar are rough & tough, Chris Noveselic's bass is monstrous, and, as already stated, Chad Channing is a decent drummer, but Dave Grohl is missed. (And by the way, former guitarist Jason Everman does NOT play on "Bleach," though the band gave him a credit on the album as a friendly gesture). In the end, Nirvana's "Bleach," despite it's flaws, is still a pretty awesome debut slab of take-no-prisoners grunge rock. Not bad for $600!
