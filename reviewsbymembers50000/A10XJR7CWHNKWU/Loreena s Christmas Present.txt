 Loreena McKennitt's Christmas album, "To Drive The Cold Winter Away," is unlike any Christmas album you've ever heard. Forget "Jingle Bells" and "Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer." These songs are mostly traditional English & Irish carols, with Loreena giving the songs a heavenly ambience by recording them in a church. In short, this album is simply beautiful, from the opening "In Praise Of Christmas," to the final, haunting piece, "Let All That Are To Mirth Inclined," featuring just Loreena's voice and the tolling of a church bell. Loreena sings like an angel, and her harp and accordion-playing are also perfect. A lovely disc to relax with by the fireplace, Loreena McKennitt's "To Drive The Cold Winter Away" is a must-own album for the holiday season.
