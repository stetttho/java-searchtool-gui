 1968's "Shine On Brightly" is Procol Harum's second album, and it's another classic Bach-meets-rock hybrid from Gary Brooker & company. "Quite Rightly So" and the title track are both Harum classics. "Skip Softly (My Moonbeams)" has a great ominous bounce to it. The gospel-esque "Wish Me Well" is another buried treasure from the band, as are "Rambling On" and "Magdelene (My Regal Zonophone)". Finally, Harum deliver the first of their two epic pieces in their catalog, the 17-minute "In Held Twas In I," a classical-rock suite containing 5 or 6 different movements, plus a couple of spoken word passages (Harum's other lenghty piece is the conceptual "The Worm & The Tree" from 1977's "Something Magic," but that's another review). "In Held Twas In I" is not for everybody---some fans say the various movements don't flow together too well---but I think it's a very adventurous piece, filled with lots of great moods & melodies. And, as one of rock's very first epic compositions, it's also quite groundbreaking. From start to finish, "Shine On Brightly" is another great milestone for Procol Harum.
