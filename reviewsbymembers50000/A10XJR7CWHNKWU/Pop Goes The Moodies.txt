 The Moody Blues' 1986 album, "The Other Side Of Life," is easily the most polished, radio-friendly offering in their whole catalog, but it's still a very good Moodies album, and I remain pleased to this day that it was a big hit for them, too, their last US Top Ten album. "The Other Side Of Life" has an 80's gloss of keyboards and synth drums, and yet, the music is still great fun, and the Moodies' knack for tuneful singing, songwriting and performing remains intact. Guitarist Justin Hayward's "Your Wildest Dreams" was the big hit song from the album, and it's a nice little number, but my favorite tracks on the disc are other songs that come from Justin's pen, including the excellent title song, which is a marvelously spooky 7 1/2 minute pop-rocker, the sweet "I Just Don't Care," and the catchy pop of "Running Out Of Love," co-written with bassist John Lodge. Also worth mentioning are "The Spirit," co-written by keyboardist Patrick Moraz & drummer Graeme Edge, and Lodge's fine power ballad finale, "It May Be A Fire." Excellent pop from beginning to end, "The Other Side Of Life" is a charming Moody Blues album.
