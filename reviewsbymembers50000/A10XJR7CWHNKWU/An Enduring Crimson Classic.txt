 Guitarist Robert Fripp says goodbye to the "Islands" lineup of King Crimson, and finally gets himself a Crimson clan that can endure for more than one album (they would ultimately make three). With new members John Wetton on bass & vocals, Bill Bruford on drums (recently departed from Yes), David Cross on violin and Jamie Muir on percussion, this edition of King Crimson roared to life in a big way with 1973's "Larks' Tongues In Aspic," an enduring Crimson classic to this day. As the masterful musicians that they are, Fripp & company deliver a solid platter of prog-rock that's both beautiful & powerful. The band members' chemistry together is incredible, and Wetton does an excellent job on lead vocals.The mood is set right away with the 13-minute "Larks' Tongues In Aspic Part I," with it's haunting, simple intro of chiming musical toyboxes (if that's what they are), before the band comes crashing in with full force. It's an amazing piece. In contrast to this epic is "Book Of Saturdays," the simplest tune on the disc, featuring just Wetton and a guitar. Some Crimheads don't care for it, but I've always found it to be a lovely little song. Next is the dreamy, breathtaking "Exiles," one of my personal favorite Crimson numbers. "Easy Money" is a classic rocker, and funky with a capital F. "The Talking Drum" is a startling piece, with great percussive work from Bruford, and Wetton on bass. And finally, the band head for home with the brilliant "Larks' Tongues In Aspic Part II," a Crimson concert staple featuring some scorching guitarwork from Fripp. "Larks' Tongues In Aspic" is one of King Crimson's finest albums. From start to finish it is a terrific work. If you love progressive rock, this is a must-own. :-)
