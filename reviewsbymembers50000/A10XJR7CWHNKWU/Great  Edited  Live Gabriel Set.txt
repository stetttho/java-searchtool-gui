 Well, at least you know up front that this remastered live CD is only a "Highlights" version. Documenting Peter Gabriel's U.S. tour for his 1982 "Security" album, this live set is excellent proof about what a dynamic live performer Gabriel is, and how tight his live band is as well, including guitarist David Rhoades, bassist Tony Levin, and drummer Jerry Marotta. The performances are passionate, putting fresh coats of paint on such Gabriel tunes as "I Don't Remember" & "Shock The Monkey." If you're a diehard Gabrielphile, then this live set is a must-own. However, keep in mind that this is only a "Highlights" single-disc version. Originally a 16-track double-disc live set, this newly remastered version removes four tracks: "The Rhythm Of The Heat," "Not One Of Us," "Intruder," and "On The Air," so you're not getting the complete live album as originally released. I recommend this shorter edition of "Peter Gabriel Plays Live" for the casual Gabriel listener who wants a live recording of the man but doesn't want to spend as much. If you're a Gabriel completist like me, however, then stick with the full-length 2-CD version, which is still available.
