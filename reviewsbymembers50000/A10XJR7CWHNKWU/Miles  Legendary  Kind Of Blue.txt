 Miles Davis' 1959 opus "Kind Of Blue" is one of the most popular jazz albums ever made, another one of those rare "every home should have one" recordings. Even if you're NOT a big jazz buff, you should have this album. So, what is it about "Kind Of Blue" that makes it so special? I can only say that Miles Davis and his cracking band of jazz greats---Julian "Cannonball" Adderley, John Coltrane, Bill Evans, Wynton Kelly, Paul Chambers and Jimmy Cobb---created an album with outstanding mood & melody, where all the notes ebb & flow, and where all the musicians get to strut their stuff without stepping on each other. There's no instrumental "noodling" to be found anywhere on "Kind Of Blue". The album has a great cohesiveness to it, where every improvised note you hear makes perfect sense. Miles Davis knew that musical magic could be achieved through spontaneous invention, as long as each piece had a basic "setting" for the musicians to work within. Davis & company rise to the challenge and then some on "Kind Of Blue." From the classic opener "So What," to the concluding "Flamenco Sketches," the music is wonderful, melodic and breezy, but most of all, cool. It's amazing to think that this classic album was finished in a mere two sessions, with every track except one nailed down in a single take ("Flamenco Sketches" took two takes to complete). Drummer Jimmy Cobb famously said that "Kind Of Blue" must have been made in Heaven. I couldn't have said it better myself. I don't claim to be a top authority on classic jazz, as I'm just starting to check out the classic recordings, and there are many fans of the genre who know much more about it than I do. But I do know what I like, and I LOVE Miles Davis' "Kind Of Blue." It's a jazz masterwork that anyone can like, and that everyone should own. God bless Miles & his supreme team of musicians for this legendary album.
