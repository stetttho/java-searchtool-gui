 Enigma's 3rd album, "Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi" (which means "The King Is Dead, Long Live The King"), is Enigma's softest, most laid-back album to date (even Enigma leader Michael Cretu described "Le Roi Est Mort" as a very "middle of the road" Enigma album). That's not to say that there are no percussive tracks--there are many--but even they have a unique calmness to them of sorts. No real rockers on "Le Roi Est Mort," but there are still plenty of hypnotic, dreamy, atmospheric songs that definitely qualify as classic Enigma. The best tracks include the richly lush "Morphing Thru Time," "Beyond The Invisible," the powerful "Why" (arguably the best song on the album, and featuring a great vocal from Cretu), "Shadows In Silence," "TNT For The Brain," "Almost Full Moon," and "The Roundabout." Terrific production throughout, with breathtaking moods and atmospheres. I do think that all the other Enigma albums to date are a little bit better than "Le Roi Est Mort," as they have a little more variety & energy to them, and are more upbeat. But "Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi" is an excellent, hypnotic Enigma album all the same, and perfect for playing late at night with the lights out.
