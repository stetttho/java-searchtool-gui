 That voice, that beautiful voice. AND the beautiful music that accompanies it...pure heaven. Like many fans, I discovered Sarah McLachlan 10 years ago (has it *really* been 10 years?) with her third album, 1993's "Fumbling Towards Ecstasy," and the powerful first single, "Posession." I was completely entranced by what I heard, and I've been a devoted Sarah fan ever since. This marvelous woman writes, plays, and sings marvelous music, a combination of rock, folk, pop, and even a touch of progressive rock seeps through some of her songs arrangements (Sarah names Peter Gabriel as a big influence on her, bless her heart). Sarah's music and angelic voice is exquisite, and SO soothing. I enjoy all of Sarah's wonderful albums (and I eagerly await her newest offering, "Afterglow"), but "Fumbling Towards Ecstasy" remains her best work so far. This is a truly gorgeous album from beginning to end, and one of my all-time favorites by anyone. Where to begin? "Possession," "Good Enough," "Elsewhere," "Circle," "Ice," "Hold On," "Fear," the title song....heck, let's name the other songs, too: "Wait," "Plenty," "Mary," "Ice Cream," and the hidden bonus track of "Posession" with just Sarah and her piano....ALL absolutely lovely. Sarah's heartfelt singing, songwriting & playing will deeply touch you, and the production by producer Pierre Marchand sparkles like a fine diamond, just like the album itself.Like other reviewers have pointed out, it's hard not to gush about Sarah McLachlan, especially when talking about "Fumbling Towards Ecstasy." It's an outstanding album by one of music's most gifted ladies. Sarah, you're the best.
