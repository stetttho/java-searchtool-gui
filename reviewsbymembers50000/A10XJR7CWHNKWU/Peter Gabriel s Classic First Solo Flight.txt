 With the tribal beat intro to the opening track, "Moribund The Bergermeister," the incredibly talented Peter Gabriel made his introduction to the music world as a solo artist. After leaving the band Genesis in 1975, partially due to exhaustion, and partially to spend more time with his family, among other reasons, Peter Gabriel took a couple of years off from the music business before roaring back in 1977 with his very first solo album. Simply called "Peter Gabriel" (or "Car" or "Rainy Windshield"---see cover art), it's an excellent debut from a musical genius with a long, fruitful solo career ahead of him. This is the album that features Gabriel's first signature tune, "Solsbury Hill," partially about his departure from Genesis (certainly the second verse, featuring "I was feeling part of the scenery/I walked out of the machinery", directly addresses it). It also features the lovely "Here Comes The Flood," another Gabriel staple, as well as the humorous barbershop-quartet number, "Excuse Me," the grand cocktail-jazz piece, "Waiting For The Big One," another fine ballad in the form of "Humdrum," and the great orchestral rocker, "Down The Dolce Vita." Gabriel's singing & songwriting is world class, and the sound, especially on this new remastered edition, is excellent.Peter Gabriel already made a name for himself as the lead singer for Genesis, and God bless him for his amazing years with the band. But with his 1977 debut solo album, it was time for Gabriel to spread his wings and forge his own musical path. Boy, did he ever. :-)
