 The band that famously combines classical influences with Beatle-esque pop/rock, the Electric Light Orchestra debuted in 1972 with their album, "No Answer," and it's definitely a good album, though it would take the band a couple more albums to truly find their way. "No Answer" is the only ELO album to feature Roy Wood, and he splits the songwriting duties on the album with former Move bandmate Jeff Lynne, who would later become ELO's definitive bandleader after Wood's departure. As it turns out, Lynne's songs on "No Answer" are stronger than Wood's. "10538 Overture" remains an all-time ELO classic, and Lynne also lends the fine, melodic "Nellie Takes Her Bow," "Mr. Radio," the piano-thumping "Manhattan Rumble," and "Queen Of The Hours." Of Wood's contributions, the best one is the acoustic instrumental "1st Movement," which sounds like a re-working of Mason Williams' famous piece, "Classical Gas," but it's excellent. The rest of Wood's songs are good---the string-arranged "Look At Me Now" is a standout---but they just don't hold a candle to the expert melodies of Lynne's songs. Also on the debit side is that some of the orchestral arrangements sound a little awkward, and the album's sound quality is a bit muddy. Still, the album does have it's share of good songs, and if you're a diehard ELO fan, than "No Answer" is certainly worth getting. It's a good, promising debut from a band that were definitely destined for the big time.
