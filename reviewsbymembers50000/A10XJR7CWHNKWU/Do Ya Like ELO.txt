 The Electric Light Orchestra continue to make world-class symphonic pop-rock with their 1976 release, "A New World Record." Jeff Lynne & company deliver another great disc that's rich in melodies & musicianship, with excellent orchestral flourishes throughout. Several ELO classics come from this record, such as "Telephone Line," "Rockaria," "Livin' Thing," and "Do Ya," as well as the very inventive "Mission (A World Record)," and the beautiful album-closer, "Shangri-La." ELO were totally at their creative peak during the mid-to-late 70's, and "A New World Record" is another fine standout for this classic rock group.
