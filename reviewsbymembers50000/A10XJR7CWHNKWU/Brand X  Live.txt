 Brand X's third album, "Livestock," is a live recording from 1977, capturing the band while they were on tour for their "Moroccan Roll" album. Oddly, three of the five live tracks are original compositions not found anywhere else, with a couple of older Brand X pieces thrown in to round off the album. But it's all great stuff, and "Livestock" shows that Brand X are just as powerful live as they are in the studio. The original jams, "Nightmare Patrol," "Ish," and "Isis Mourning" are all amazing instrumental workouts, as are the band's live renditions of the classics "Euthanasia Waltz" and "Malaga Virgen." Each piece allows each band member to totally strut his stuff. Guitarist John Goodsall, bassist Percy Jones, keyboardist Robin Lumley, percussionist Morris Pert, and the drumming duo of Phil Collins and Kenwood Dennard simply COOK on this album, their musical interplay just plain phenomenal. My only criticism---the album is too darn short! Live Brand X material is scarce, and the 41 minutes of "Livestock," while excellent, still leaves you hungry. Nonetheless, "Livestock" is a tasty live set from Brand X that's guaranteed to blow the doors off you.
