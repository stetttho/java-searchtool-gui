 Despite the fact that it didn't match the commercial success of "Reach The Beach," this third album by the Fixx, 1984's "Phantoms," is the group's masterpiece. The band's atmospheric pop-rock works to maximum effect on this album, and there's not a single song here that I don't like. GREAT hooks & melodies everywhere you look, with such classic Fixx rockers as "Less Cities, More Moving People," "Sunshine In The Shade," "Woman On A Train," and the Top 40 hit "Are We Ourselves?", as well as "Lose Face" and "Question." The band also score major points with the softer tunes, including "Wish," the dreamy "Facing The Wind," and the absolutely beautiful number, "I Will" (and why this very lovely song was never released as a single I will never know---the Fixx could've had another huge hit along the lines of "One Thing Leads To Another"). The band's performances are sharp, and Cy Curnin's passionate voice is excellent. Their record sales may have begun to decline with this one, but in my mind, it was the fault of radio and the record-buying public for missing out on this great disc. "Phantoms" is an outstanding Fixx album, with some of the best 80's pop-rock ever laid down. It's the best work Cy Curnin & company have ever done, so what are you waiting for? Pick it up, and enjoy the ultimate Fixx.
