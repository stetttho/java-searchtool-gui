 If ever there was a rock album that had tomatoes thrown at it, both of the verbal AND of the real kind, it's "Love Beach" by Emerson, Lake & Palmer. Okay, so the band only recorded this album as a contractual obligation. Okay, so the band's "Oooh, What Studly Men We Are" cover photo is a riot. Okay, so the suggestive lyrics to "Taste Of My Love" are pretty vile. Okay, so Greg Lake booming "I'm gonna make love to ya!" over and over again at the end of the title track gives one pause. But OTHER than that stuff, this is a very good ELP record. "All I Want Is You" is a very-pleasant opening number. "For You" is a great song---it might have even been a strong hit single for the band. "The Gambler" is a tasty slice of blues/pop. "Canario" is a fine instrumental ELP workout. And don't tell me that the sidelong-epic "Memoirs Of An Officer And A Gentleman" isn't powerful, classic ELP, 'cause it most certainly is. This beautiful suite alone is worth the price of admission. What a shame that Keith, Greg, & Carl never played this buried treasure live...."Love Beach" will always be considered a "throwaway" album. Noted. But despite it's flaws, there is absolutely, positively some excellent ELP material on "Love Beach." It isn't their masterpiece, but it certainly isn't a total washout either. So please ignore the album cover and just enjoy the album's musical gems (and there ARE gems). 3 stars. Uncle Alan says check it out. :-)
