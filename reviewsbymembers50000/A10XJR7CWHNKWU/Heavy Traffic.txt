 1971's "The Low Spark Of High Heeled Boys" is one of Traffic's all-time greatest. Singer/guitarist/keyboardist Steve Winwood, drummer Jim Capaldi & flautist Chris Wood are joined on this one by bassist Rich Grech, drummer Jim Gordon & percussionist Reebop Kwaku Baah, and the resulting album is a phenomenal blend of Traffic's great flare for rock, jazz, funk & folk all rolled into one. "Hidden Treasure" is a beautiful acoustic number. The 11-minute-plus title song is one of the band's signature pieces, with outstanding mood & musicianship as Winwood & company build it up & build it up into an amazing prog-jazz fusion jam. It is truly thrilling stuff. "Light Up Or Leave Me Alone" is a fun rocker, and Traffic get the funk out with the awesome "Rock 'N' Roll Stew." "Many A Mile To Freedom" is wistful & brimming with fine melody, and "Rainmaker" is masterfully steady, with the band riding into the sunset with style & some killer jamming at the end. This is without a doubt one of the best albums that Steve Winwood & company have ever done. "The Low Spark Of High Heeled Boys" is heavy Traffic all the way.
