 The Fixx are one of the best bands that came out of the MTV-80's. These guys have great pop-rock songs with catchy guitar hooks, cool keyboards, and a very charismatic frontman in the form of Cy Curnin. And, very thankfully, the Fixx are still recording & touring to this day, with four of the original five band members firmly intact (only their bassist keeps changing). Their first album, 1982's "Shuttered Room," is a strong debut disc, featuring a pair of instant Fixx classics, "Stand Or Fall" and "Red Skies," but also contains other memorable rockers, like "Lost Planes," "Cameras In Paris," "I Live," and "The Fool," as well as the fun bonus track, "Sinking Island." This is a band that knows how to make intelligent keyboard-laden rock, and Cy Curnin's voice is very commanding. The Fixx would hit the commercial jackpot with their classic second album, "Reach The Beach," but "Shuttered Room" is an excellent beginning for this fine British band.
