 Wow...I had absolutely no idea that Jeff Lynne was planning on resurrecting ELO---what a wonderful surprise! The brand-new disc, "Zoom," is a terrific album that puts ELO back in business in a big, big way after a 15-year absence & a short-lived spinoff group, ELO Part II (aka ELO minus Jeff Lynne). The group is basically a one-man band now---just Jeff Lynne and a slew of session players (including Lynne's pals George Harrison & Ringo Starr), but that's fine with me. Lynne & his team reproduce the hallmark ELO sound with the greatest of ease, with Lynne once again contributing wonderfully melodic songwriting, and his unique singing voice is still intact after all this time. I know it's a cliche' to say, "It sounds like they never left," but that is precisely what I think when listening to this 2001-model Electric Light Orchestra. There shouldn't be any debates at all about whether or not "Zoom" qualifies as an ELO album. It's the music that matters, not the number of band members that created it. "Zoom" is *definitely* an ELO album, and a great one at that. Any song on this album could very easily be a hit. My favorites are the lead-off track & single, "Alright," "Just For Love," "Stranger On A Quiet Night," "It Really Doesn't Matter," "Melting In The Sun," and "All She Wanted." But EVERY song here, in my opinion, smacks of classic ELO, and I couldn't be happier about it."Zoom" is a shining, melodious light in the current questionable market of teen pop, rap, and modern rock that currently dominate the charts. Oh, these other forms of popular music have their good moments, too, but sometimes it's just a wonderful breath of fresh air when an old, reliable pop/rock warhorse like ELO can return from out of nowhere and deliver an album THIS catchy & irresistible that puts most of the current big acts' new offerings to shame. Welcome back Jeff Lynne, welcome back Electric Light Orchestra! You have been missed.
