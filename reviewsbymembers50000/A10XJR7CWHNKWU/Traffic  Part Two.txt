 Traffic's 2nd album, simply called "Traffic," is a classic album that mixes songs from both singer/keyboardist Steve Winwood (the bigger, more dramatic, art-rock kind of stuff), and singer/guitarist Dave Mason (the simpler, more-introspective, straightforward kind of stuff). But it all hangs together, the music simply brilliant. Includes such classics as Mason's sing-along "You Can All Join In," "Don't Be Sad," the harpsicord-flavored "Cryin' To Be Heard," and the all-time radio favorite, "Feelin' Alright," as well as Winwood staples "Pearly Queen," the magnificent acoustic tale of "Forty Thousand Headmen," the groovy "Who Knows What Tomorrow May Bring," and the gorgeous number, "No Time To Live." Mason, however, disagreeing with Winwood over Traffic's direction, would soon leave the band (though he would briefly return for a tour, documented on "Welcome To The Canteen"). But he definitely left his mark with the band, having made two fantastic albums with them, "Mr. Fantasy," and this one. "Traffic" is an outstanding disc.
