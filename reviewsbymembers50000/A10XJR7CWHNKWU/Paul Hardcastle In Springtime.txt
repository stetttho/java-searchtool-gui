 "Jazzmasters III" was the CD that turned me into a diehard Paul Hardcastle fan. I'd always liked Paul's hit song from the 80's about Vietnam veterans, "19," but "Jazzmasters III" really made me sit up and take notice of the man's music. I was shopping in a music store back in '99, when I heard this album on the overhead speakers, and I was so taken with the dreamy, cool-breeze quality of the music, that I bought the album right then and there, and I've been listening to Mr. Hardcastle's catalog ever since.With Hardcastle brilliantly playing every instrument except saxophone (Snake Davis handles the sax), and featuring the lovely, soulful vocals of Helen Rogers, "Jazzmasters III" is a very cool, very smooth, very *groovy* disc to play. Songs like the dreamy "London In Springtime," the so-very-catchy "Don't Let It Get You Down," the acoustic charmer "Down So Low," and the light grooves of "Still Thinking" are just marvelous. Hardcastle also delivers some incredible, atmospheric instrumentals throughout, like the appropriately-titled "Lost In Space," "Nightcrawler," "Starchild," the super-funky "Trippin' Rhythm," "New Dawn," and "Red Zone." And for the cherry on top, there's a pair of wonderful, breezy covers of America's hit song, "Ventura Highway," and Fleetwood Mac's classic, "Dreams." Fabulous, both of them.Quite simply, Paul Hardcastle is the undisputed King Of Smooth Jazz, with Helen Rogers the perfect vocalist for Hardcastle's tasty tunes, and Snake Davis contributes some fine sax-blowing throughout. This album is just so good! I strongly recommend ALL of Paul's albums, but "Jazzmasters III" was the one that started it all for me as a Hardcastle fan. It's a great place for you to start, too. Pick it up!
