 The co-leader of Steely Dan has done it again! Donald Fagen has crafted another platter of fantastic, awesome-sounding, intelligent, skillful jazz/pop. A fabulous collection of "New York Stories" that only a master like Fagen can tell, including the gleeful cloud-spirit of "Morph The Cat" that descends upon the city folk and enriches their lives, the history of a popular New York band in "H Gang," Donald talking to the ghost of Ray Charles in "What I Do", and a guy falling in love with an airport security girl ("Security Joan"). Fagen also tells an intriguing tale of Mr. Death himself (the fella in the "Brite Nitegown"). Killer grooves, hooks & performances, great lyrics and sound, and Fagen's cool vocals make "Morph The Cat" a total keeper. It's another truly great album from the truly great Donald Fagen. Thumbs up on this one, baby!
