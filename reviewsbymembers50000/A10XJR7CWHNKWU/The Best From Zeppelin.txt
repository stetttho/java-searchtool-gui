 After the runaway success of "Led Zeppelin IV," Led Zeppelin reconvened and did the absolutely astounding---they recorded a follow-up album that's even *better* than "Zeppelin IV" (though I certainly love "Zeppelin IV," mind you). 1973's "Houses Of The Holy" is, in my opinion, the band's masterpiece, a barnburning album that showcases all different sides to this legendary group, from the thrilling, galloping rock of "The Song Remains The Same," to the stunningly beautiful "The Rain Song," to the excellent acoustic/hard rock hybrid "Over The Hills And Far Away," to the cheerful, masterful, good-time rock of "The Crunge," "Dancing Days," "D'yer Mak'er," and the fun finale, "The Ocean." But the album's secret weapon, if you have to pick one, is "No Quarter," a magnificent, heavy, ominous song, and one of the band's most potent numbers. Robert Plant's vocals soar and swoop throughout the album with great gusto, Jimmy Page blows the doors off you with his magnificent fretwork, John Paul Jones' bass is a booming work of art, and his keyboard playing throughout is supreme, while the late, great John Bonham, is, as always, a towering monster on the drumkit. Cap it all off with Page's brilliant production and a stunning, memorable album cover (in this case, anonymous nude girls climbing on rocks) and you've got yourself a Led Zeppelin masterpiece. "Houses Of The Holy" is a thrilling Zeppelin album, with Led Zeppelin totally on top of the world and on top of their game. An outstanding rock classic.
