 1996's "On Air" is one of Alan Parsons' most adventurous albums. With it's songs all having to do with the theme of flight, "On Air" is a genuine masterpiece. Although Parsons co-wrote four of the tracks, the chief songwriter here is Parsons' longtime guitarist Ian Bairnson, who had a hand in writing or co-writing all but one song. The material is simply fantastic, such as the simple-but-beautiful "Blue Blue Sky" (which opens AND closes the album), the dreamy "Too Close To The Sun," the rockin' "Can't Look Down" (a song about fear of flying), the awesome instrumentals "Cloudbreak" and "Apollo" (featuring a spoken-word cameo by President Kennedy), and the heartfelt "Brother Up In Heaven" (which Bairnson wrote in memory of a late relative) and "So Far Away." The musicianship and production is outstanding, and the lead vocal performances by Eric Stewart, Neil Lockwood, Steve Overland, Graham Dye, and the one-and-only Christopher Cross are marvelous. Not only that, but "On Air" also comes with an excellent bonus CD-ROM, filled with lots of goodies about Alan Parsons, the making of the "On Air" album, the history of flight, trivia, and games. "On Air" is without question one of Alan Parsons' very best releases. Please take flight with this album---you'll love it!
