 1981's "Eye In The Sky" is an Alan Parsons Project classic, and it remains the group's best-selling album, thanks to the lush, hugely-popular title track. While the album's theme, if it has one, is a little unclear (a look at spirituality & the human race's past, perhaps?), it contains all the hallmarks of the Project's sound: fantastic prog-pop & melodies (co-written by Parsons & Eric Woolfson) , sweeping orchestrations by Andrew Powell, and amazing studio wizardry & musical performances. As already mentioned, the title song is the Project's signature tune, a Top Five smash on the singles chart, and featuring a rich vocal turn by Woolfson. Other great songs include the spacey "Children Of The Moon," "Gemini," "Silence And I," the rockers "You're Gonna Get You're Fingers Burned" and the awesome "Psychobabble" (a Project favorite to this day), "Step By Step," and the stirring "Old And Wise," as well as the classic Project instrumentals "Sirius" (the lead-in to "Eye In The Sky"), and "Mammagamma." Along with Eric Woolfson, there are other wonderful vocals throughout by David Paton, Chris Rainbow, Colin Blunstone, Elmer Gantry, and Lenny Zakatek, and tremendous musicianship from such Project staples as guitarist Ian Bairnson and drummer Stuart Elliot. A sparkling album from beginning to end, "Eye In The Sky" is an all-time Project classic.
