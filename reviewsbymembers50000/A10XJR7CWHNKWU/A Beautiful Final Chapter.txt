 When George Harrison succumbed to cancer in November 2001, he had been working on his first new solo album since 1987's "Cloud Nine." Fortunately, he had enough new songs in the can before his death to complete the album, albeit new songs that were missing instrument & vocal overdubs here & there. So, it was up to George's son Dhani Harrison and longtime friend Jeff Lynne (of ELO fame) to put on the finishing touches, and release the album to the world. The album, "Brainwashed," was released at the end of 2002, and it's a very fond farewell to this great, gifted musician. Although Harrison's voice sounds a bit thinner on "Brainwashed" (no doubt due to his cancer), he still sings with great warmth and feeling, and his guitar playing is, as always, wonderful. And the songs are all excellent, feel-good numbers that could have come from no one else *but* the man known as the quiet Beatle. Favorites include "Any Road," the fun "P2 Vatican Blues (Last Saturday Night)," the lovely instrumental "Marwa Blues" (for which Harrison won a posthumous Grammy award), the gorgeous pop of "Stuck Inside A Cloud," Harrison's cheerful  ukelele rendering of the old favorite, "Between The Devil And The Deep Blue Sea," and the closing title track, which ends, appropriately enough, with Harrison and his son Dhani performing a spiritual chant.While it's sad that George Harrison is no longer with us, he will live forever through his music, and his musical legacy has now been given a beautiful final chapter with "Brainwashed." Farewell George, and God bless.
