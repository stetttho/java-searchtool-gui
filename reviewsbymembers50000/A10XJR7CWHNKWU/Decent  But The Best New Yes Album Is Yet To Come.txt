 Yes' 1999 album, "The Ladder," is looked upon by some fans, as well as the band themselves, as one of their finest efforts since their glory days of the 70's. Fine, I respect that. "The Ladder" is certainly a good Yes album, but "good" is the highest praise I'm willing to give it. I've listened to "The Ladder" a good number of times now, but to my ears, there are only three really-strong tracks on this disc: the excellent epic opener, "Homeworld," the fine groove of "The Messenger" (great basslines there, Chris Squire!), and the gorgeous finale, "Nine Voices," a lovely song very reminiscent of the old Yes classic, "Wondrous Stories," with a classic vocal from Jon Anderson. The rest of the album, however, pretty much goes in one ear and right out the other. Even after repeated listenings, I couldn't tell you how songs like "It Will Be A Good Day," "Lightning Strikes," "To Be Alive," or "New Language" go. My mind's a total blank in regards to those tunes. It's not that they're unlistenable tracks. They're good Yes songs **as you're listening to them**. But afterwards, only "Homeworld," "The Messenger," and "Nine Voices" stick out in my head."The Ladder" was regarded as a "return to form" for Yes. In my opinion, that's not really true. Despite it's good material, the band's reliable musicianship, and an impressive job on the keyboards by Igor Koroshev (in his lone album with the band), "The Ladder" has the unfortunate position of being sandwiched between much better Yes projects---the catchy, uplifting "Open Your Eyes" (I DO like this maligned album very much, so bite me), the powerful prog tracks from the "Keys To Ascension" sets, and the phenomenal, just-released, instant Yes masterwork, "Magnification." "The Ladder" is a decent Yes album, and I'll give it a passing grade of three stars. But as the new "Magnification" clearly shows, the REAL return to form for Yes was still to come.
