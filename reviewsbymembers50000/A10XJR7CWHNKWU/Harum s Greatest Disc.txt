 1969's "A Salty Dog" is Procol Harum's masterpiece. The music here is simply wonderful, with the band's trademark blend of rock, blues, & classical worked to majestic perfection. The title track is unquestionably one of the most hauntingly beautiful songs ever written, with passionate vocals from keyboardist Gary Brooker. "The Milk Of Human Kindness" is great piano-rock, "Too Much Between Us" is a lovely acoustic number, "The Devil Came From Kansas" is a memorable Harum song with a strong, marching feel, and "Boredom" is just plain fun, with fine vocals from organist Matthew Fisher. "Juicy John Pink" is excellent dirty blues, "Wreck Of The Hesperus" is a powerful dramatic number, and "All This And More" is sharp, melodic pop/rock. Guitarist Robin Trower steps up to the microphone with gusto on the great slow rocker, "Crucifixion Land," and Fisher returns to the mike on the winning, whimsical finale, "Pilgrim's Progress." The songwriting, with lyrics by Keith Reid, and the band's performances are all outstanding. Procol Harum have many brilliant albums to their credit, but "A Salty Dog" is the one that moves me the most. It's a gorgeous Harum classic.
