 Far out, man! The soundtrack album to the 1968 sci-fi camp classic "Barbarella," starring the knockout gorgeous Jane Fonda in the title role, is a cocktail lounge fan's dream. The groovy, psychedelic late-60's horn arrangements, organ, strings, guitars & vocals are fantastic. Listening to the "Barbarella" soundtrack, you can easily picture the movie in your mind, but even if you haven't seen the movie (and you really should, y'know), this music, composed by Bob Crew and Charles Fox, is way cool. So many great tracks, but a few favorites of mine include the title song, the drunken sing-along "Love Love Love Drags Me Down," scorching instrumentals like "Spaceship Out Of Control," "The Black Queen's Beads," "The Sex Machine" and "The Chamber Of Dreams," and the soaring, exuberant final song, "An Angel Is Love." The CD also comes with some great bonus tracks, including alternate versions of a few of the tunes as played by "The Young Lovers," as well as some radio promotion spots for the film. The "Barbarella" movie soundtrack is a solid, super psychedelic feast. Get it before it disappears, baby!
