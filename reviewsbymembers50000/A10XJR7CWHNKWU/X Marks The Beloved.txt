 The Beloved, the British synth-pop duo comprising husband & wife Jon and Helena Marsh, released their last album to date, "X", in 1996. With "X", the Beloved got more sophisticated, and dipped deeper into rich synthesiser textures & longer songs. They even got King Crimson guitarist Robert Fripp to help them out with the album's experimental sounds (or "soundscapes" as his album credit says). There are no immediate "hits" on "X", but the album is still an excellent, hypnotic work. Standouts include the appropriately titled "A Dream Within A Dream" (which prominently features Robert Fripp's magical touch), the slammin' beats of "Crystal Wave," the totally entrancing "Missing You" and "Three Steps To Heaven" (the latter also featuring Robert Fripp), and the beautiful album-closer, "Spacemen." As of this writing, the Beloved have not released anything new since "X", with Jon Marsh being perfectly content these days working as a producer, remixer, and deejay. But, reportedly, there *may* be a new Beloved album released sometime in the very near future---if Marsh ever gets around to finishing it! I sure hope he does. In the meantime, I highly recommend "X", along with the group's previous releases, "Happiness" and "Conscience." The Beloved are a great band, and I hope they will return.
