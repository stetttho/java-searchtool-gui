 Foreigner have always been lumped together with other so-called AOR (Album Oriented Rock) bands that emerged from the 70's on the heels of Led Zeppelin, such as Journey, Kansas, Styx, and REO Speedwagon. These are bands that rocked hard not only with guitars but also with--gasp!--keyboards, creating an FM radio, hard-edged rock-with-pop sensibility blend. All those aforementioned bands all have their share of good tunes, but Foreigner stood apart from the rest. Led by guitarist Mick Jones, not only could Foreigner rock the house, but they could also write *intelligent* rock songs. Foreigner's songs are catchy & melodic, expertly played by the band, and masterfully sung by the one-and-only Lou Gramm, whose voice is soulful as well as thunderous (just like the band he's singing for). Their songs still endure on the radio to this day, and any band that can count a former member of the mighty King Crimson in their ranks (multi-instrumentalist Ian McDonald) is okay in my book. If Led Zeppelin are the true kings of AOR (and by all accounts, they are), then Foreigner are greatly nipping at their heels in 2nd place, above all other competitors.Foreigner's 1977 self-titled debut still holds up as one of the group's best. You know the classic rockin' hits "Feels Like The First Time," "Cold As Ice," and "Long Long Way From Home," but there are many other great gems like "Starrider," "The Damage Is Done," "Woman Oh Woman," the ballad "Fool For You Anyway," and "I Need You." The remastering on this new CD edition of the album sounds incredible, and the four bonus demos (including the previously unreleased "Take Me To Your Leader") are all quite enjoyable to listen to, hearing how Foreigner truly began. Through and through, this band totally rocks, and Gramm's vocals are as passionate as they get. It's no wonder this album was such a huge hit: Foreigner's "Foreigner" is 70's rock at it's best, by one of rock's finest groups. Crank it up!
