 1991's "The Prodigal Stranger" marked the most-welcome return of Procol Harum, 14 years after their last album, 1977's "Something Magic." Back in the band are veteran members Gary Brooker on piano & vocals, Matthew Fisher on organ, Robin Trower on guitar, & lyricist Keith Reid. "The Prodigal Stranger" is a magnificent album, the band sounding so re-vitalized on these masterful, melodic songs. Not a bad tune among them. High points include the passionate "The Truth Won't Fade Away," the great rockers "Man With A Mission," "One More Time," "All Are Dreams Are Sold" & "Learn To Fly," the wonderfully catchy "Hand That Rocks The Cradle," and the beautiful "A Dream In Every Home," "King Of Hearts" (with a clever nod to "Whiter Shade Of Pale" in it's lyrics), and the finale, "The Pursuit Of Happiness." Gary Brooker's voice is still as strong as ever, as are the band's solid  musicianship & songwriting. "The Prodigal Stranger" is one of Procol Harum's greatest albums, and a true welcome return of one of rock's greatest bands.
