 1975's "Face The Music" was ELO's fifth album, and it remains my personal favorite ELO disc to this day. It was the first ELO album I ever bought, and it made me a lifelong fan. I was completely blown away by the album's most famous trio of songs that I kept hearing on the radio: the magnificent orchestral rocker, "Fire On High," and the instant pop classics "Evil Woman" & "Strange Magic." And I was equally thrilled by the album's other musical gems, such as "Waterfall," "Nightrider," "Down Home Town," and the dreamy album closer, "One Summer Dream." I love the band's Beatle-esque flair for melody, their fine musicianship & production, and the excellent singing, songwriting, and guitar work of leader Jeff Lynne. Great stuff all the way.Capturing the group right smack in the middle of the 70's, "Face The Music" is the Electric Light Orchestra at their most creative. I enjoy all of the band's albums, including other great works like "On The Third Day," "Out Of The Blue" and "Time," but "Face The Music" is the one that I have the most fondness for. Now, if only those folks at Sony Music would give this album a long-overdue remaster treatment....one can dream. :-)
