 1973's "Brain Salad Surgery" is Emerson Lake & Palmer's most notorious album. On one hand, it's a longstanding fan favorite, with many ELP enthusiasts naming it as the best ELP album. But on the *other* hand, the album's oh-so-grand musical designs have made it an easy target for critics and other detractors. But for those who can handle Keith, Greg, and Carl's daring-do and ambitiousness, chances are you'll enjoy "Brain Salad Surgery" just fine. The band's treatment of classical favorites "Jerusalem" and Ginastera's "Toccata" are mighty impressive. "Still...You Turn Me On" is a beautiful, classic Greg Lake ballad. "Benny The Bouncer" is another of ELP's quickie ragtime piano numbers, but it's great fun, with Lake singing in a faux-Cockney accent. But the album's centerpiece is unquestionably the group's 30-minute epic about man vs. machine, "Karn Evil 9." What can I say about this mammoth prog-rock piece that hasn't already been covered---it is indeed a monster, with the band throwing in everything but the kitchen sink, and THEN they throw in the kitchen sink itself! Keith Emerson's take-no-prisoners keyboards are a force of nature all on their own, while Greg Lake's booming bass strongly anchors the proceedings, along with some very commanding lead vocals & excellent lead-guitar work, while Carl Palmer smashes his big fat drumkit like a pro. No doubt about it, Emerson Lake & Palmer's "Brain Salad Surgery" is VERY grandiose, but it's great stuff. It may not be for the faint of heart, but if you love progressive rock, then this album is a most-essential purchase.
