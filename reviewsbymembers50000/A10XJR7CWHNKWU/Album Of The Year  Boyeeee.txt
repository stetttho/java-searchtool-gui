 Incredible---"Two Against Nature," Steely Dan's first new album in 20(!) years, wins the Grammy for Album Of The Year, and the whole world goes into shock. Right on! Personally, I'm thrilled for the guys. Their surprising victory at the Grammys, and their recent induction into the Rock N Roll Hall Of Fame were LONG overdue. Walter Becker & Donald Fagen are two of the most intelligent dudes in the music biz. Every album they've created in their laboratory (i.e. the recording studio) is the epitome of cool. I've always dug their unique blend of pop/rock with several shots of jazz. Not a bad record among their whole catalog. Who cares that they're now in their 50's? Steely Dan are STILL hip cats to be reckoned with.Listening to the Dan's comeback album, "Two Against Nature," you'd never guess that these guys had ever gone away. 20 years? It sounds like they picked up right where they left off after "Gaucho," a mere 20 DAYS after recording it! In fact, "Two Against Nature" sounds like a great blend between the styles of "Aja" with "Gaucho." It's laid back, but punchy at the same time, with the hallmark Dan sound gracing every track (as well as Fagen's solidly cool voice). Every single song clicks, starting with "Gaslighting Abbie" straight through to the grand finale, the jammin' "West Of Hollywood." Like Steely Dan's best waxed hot ones of the past, "Two Against Nature" is a *groovy* record. It's the Album Of The Year, and deservedly so. It's classy music speaks for itself. Congratulations, Walt & Don, and welcome back. :-)
