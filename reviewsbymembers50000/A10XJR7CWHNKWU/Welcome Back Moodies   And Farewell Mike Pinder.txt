 After a six-year hiatus, the Moody Blues returned to the music world in 1978 with "Octave." However, keyboardist & mellotron master Mike Pinder, upon completing the album, decided that he didn't want to go out on tour anymore. Thus, "Octave" became his swan song album with the band. Although Pinder's departure was certainly the end of an era for the Moody Blues, at least Pinder left the band on a very high note. "Octave" is a marvelous Moodies album, with the band picking up right where they left off---it's as if they never left at all. All the band members contribute excellent songs. My personal faves: John Lodge's steady rocker "Steppin' In A Slide Zone," Justin Hayward's gorgeous "Had To Fall In Love" & "Driftwood," and the fun jazz/pop of "Top Rank Suite," Graeme Edge's rockin' "I'll Be Level With You," Ray Thomas' light, breezy cocktail pop of "I'm Your Man," and Mike Pinder's loving farewell contribution to the group, "One Step Into The Light."  Very surprisingly, when Moody Blues fans talk about the band's classic early albums, they usually talk about the band's "Classic Seven"---everything from 1967's "Days Of Future Passed," to 1972's "Seventh Sojourn." But "Octave" doesn't get much of a mention, which I think is totally unfair. There's not a bad track on it, and the return of the Moodies after so long---and with the classic line-up intact, no less---was certainly great cause for celebration. But perhaps the big six-year absence, and the fact that Pinder left the group shortly after the release of "Octave," has something to do with it's "odd-album-out" status. Nonetheless, "Octave" is a wonderful comeback album for the Moodies, and one that deserves to be just as strongly revered as the band's earlier releases that preceded it. With "Octave," the Moody Blues' "Classic Seven" *should* be known as their "Classic Eight."
