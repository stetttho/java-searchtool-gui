 Enigma's second album, 1993's "The Cross Of Changes," continues this recording act's explorations in estoteric, spacey keyboard music, mixed with samples, slamming beats, ethereal vocals, and tribal chants (replacing the chanting monks from the classic first album from 1990). Enigma mastermind Michael Cretu, who also contributes lead vocals on a couple of tracks, has created another astonishing, dreamy soundscape where the music ebbs & flows, and simply takes your breath away. The awesome "Return To Innocence" was the big hit from the album, but there's many other delights such as the powerful "The Eyes Of Truth," the thrilling 9-minute extravaganza "I Love You, I'll Kill You," the Enigma signature "Age Of Loneliness" (from the Sharon Stone movie "Sliver"), the beautiful "Dream Of The Dolphin," and the triumphant "Out From The Deep." I just can't get enough of this awesome group---"The Cross Of Changes" is another hypnotic Enigma classic.
