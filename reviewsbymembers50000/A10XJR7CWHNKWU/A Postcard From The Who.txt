 1974's "Odds & Sods" is a Who rarities album, and it's a great one. It's jam-packed with various tracks that were either released solely as singles (or at least were *intended* for single release), or were outtakes that didn't make it onto the original albums they were recorded for. This 1998 re-issue greatly expands "Odds & Sods" to a whopping 23 tracks (including previously unreleased material), so you're getting a whole lotta great Who music on one disc. There's not enough space here for me to go over every single track, but I'll mention some personal favorites: the rockin' singles "I'm The Face" and "Leaving Here" (which were two of the Who's earliest recordings), the Rolling Stones cover "Under My Thumb," the "Tommy"-esque "Glow Girl" (with it's closing line of "It's a girl, Mrs. Walker, it's a girl"), the all-time Who classic "Long Live Rock," the excellent "Put The Money Down," John Entwistle's humorous "Postcard" (a snapshot tale about life on the road), the groovy rock of "Water," and the brilliant "Naked Eye." Admittedly, there are a couple of throwaways: "Cousin Kevin Model Child," which was John Entwistle's first attempt at writing his classic song from "Tommy," and "We Close Tonight," a reject from "Quadrophenia." Both songs are listenable, but there's really nothing special about them (which is probably why they were rejected in the first place). But hey, 21 great songs out of 23 is a darn good score. The Who's "Odds & Sods" is a great rarities collection that no Who fan should do without.
