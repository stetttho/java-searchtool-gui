 Traffic's third album, "Last Exit," was originally intended to be the group's final album (hence the title), as Traffic leaders Dave Mason & Steve Winwood were splitting up over creative differences at the time, and because of it, both men decided to put Traffic out to pasture. Thankfully, this did not happen, as Winwood, flautist/saxophonist Chris Wood and drummer Jim Capaldi unexpectedly revived Traffic with their 1970 classic, "John Barleycorn Must Die" (but that's another review). In the meantime, "Last Exit" is a great odds-and-sods Traffic album, containing several rare singles like the lighthearted "Shanghai Noodle Factory" and the groovy "Medicated Goo," and a pair of barnburning, jamming live tracks (recorded at the Fillmore West) in the form of "Feelin' Good" and "Blind Man." "Last Exit" is an excellent album that no Traffic fan should do without.
