 The Who's 1966 second album, "A Quick One," is a great Who classic, and the only Who album to feature songwriting contributions from all four band members (which came about due to a publishing deal the band had secured at the time). This remastered edition of "A Quick One" also contains a whopping TEN bonus tracks of various songs the Who also recorded at the time, some previously unreleased. The album also features the band's very first foray into "rock opera" territory, with the brilliant 9-minute mini-opera penned by guitarist Pete Townshend, "A Quick One While He's Away," about a lonely woman who cheats on her hubby while he's out working, regrets it, confesses her sin, and is forgiven. It's a bonafide Who classic, and a great forerunner for the group's full-on rock operas "Tommy" & "Quadrophenia" that would follow in the years ahead. Other great Who tunes on this album are Townshend's "Run Run Run," "So Sad About Us," and "Disguises," bassist John Entwistle's signature song "Boris The Spider" and the equally great "Whiskey Man" & "Doctor Doctor," drummer Keith Moon's instrumental big top insanity known as "Cobwebs And Strange" and his fine popper "I Need You" (with both tracks featuring brilliant skin smashing from Keith), and even singer Roger Daltrey contributes a decent little number with "See My Way." There's also great covers of Martha & The Vandellas' "Heatwave," the Beach Boys fave "Barbara Ann," and the "Batman" theme song! And if THAT wasn't enough, there's also an acoustic version of the hit "Happy Jack," and an alternate version of the Who staple "My Generation," coupled together with the anthem "Land Of Hope And Glory." Whew! For the dedicated Who fan, this CD edition of "A Quick One" is a rock 'n' roll feast, and, needless to say, the band totally rock on this one. "A Quick One" is an absolute must-buy Who album.
