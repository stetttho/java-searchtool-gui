 It's hard to believe that Kurt Cobain has been gone for ten years now. Listening to this "Best-Of" Nirvana CD, on the ten-year anniversary of Cobain's tragic suicide, I'm reminded quite plainly of what a musical genius Kurt was, and how pioneering Nirvana were. Kurt & his two partners in crime, bassist Krist Novoselic and drummer Dave Grohl, turned the music business inside out with their powerful, trailblazing, *passionate* rock music, and they finally kicked those pathetic hairspray/metal bands right off the map. There will never be another voice & songwriter like Cobain, and there will never be another Nirvana, which is sad.But what does remain of Kurt & company, and what WILL be their legacy, is the music they did create, and "Nirvana" is a brilliant overview of their all-too-brief existence. All of the band's best-known tunes are here, including The Shot Heard Round The World, better known as "Smells Like Teen Spirit," "Come As You Are," "Lithium," "In Bloom," "Heart-Shaped Box," "Pennyroyal Tea," "Dumb," and "All Apologies" (the MTV Unplugged version). But considering that you may have all these tunes in your collection already, the main hook for buying "Nirvana" is, of course, the previously unreleased song, "You Know You're Right," the very last song Nirvana ever recorded. With it's slow & steady, assured build-up, followed by a classic thunderous full-throttle attack and Kurt's tortured voice & lyrics, this song is in instant Nirvana classic. "Nirvana" is worth getting just for the inclusion of "You Know You're Right" alone, but it is also worth getting as a tribute to a great musical genius and his great, trailblazing band. All the proof needed on why Kurt Cobain & Nirvana were--and are--so great is all here on this one CD. Thank you Kurt, and thank you, Nirvana. You are remembered.
