 The Amazon critic has it wrong: the chorus on "School" is "No recess," NOT "Don't be sad"! Now that we've got that cleared up....It is well documented that Nirvana could be very scattershot live in concert, usually depending on the mental & physical health of troubled singer/guitarist Kurt Cobain. On a bad night, the band could be very ragged and sloppy, even rude---some nights, they wouldn't even play their big hit, "Smells Like Teen Spirit," much to the dismay of their audience. But on a GOOD night---and there were quite a few of those, too---Nirvana were powerful, rockin' monsters. "From The Muddy Banks of The Wishkah" captures Nirvana live in concert on the various GOOD nights they had over the years, with the live tracks recorded between 1989 and 1994. Nirvana blast through 16 songs, featuring some signature tunes like "Teen Spirit" and "Lithium," as well as some lesser-known songs like "Spank Thru" and "Blew." The band sound incredible, with Cobain, bassist Krist Noveselic and drummer Dave Grohl interlocked together like a three-headed rock beast (though on some tracks, guitarist Pat Smear joins the trio, and original drummer Chad Channing is featured on a couple of tracks instead of Grohl). This is raw, in-your-face, take-no-prisoners rock of the highest order, with no bad performances anywhere, and the louder you can play this CD, the better. "From The Muddy Banks Of The Wishkah" is a brilliant document of what Nirvana could do live in concert on the nights when they *really* gave it everything they had. No Nirvana fan should go without this awesome live set.
