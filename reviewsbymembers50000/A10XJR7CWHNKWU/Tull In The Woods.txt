 I can't believe some of the negative reviews I'm seeing here for Jethro Tull's classic, "Songs From The Wood." And you Tull purists call yourselves true fans? Not in my book. Now, a *sensible* Jethro Tull fan knows darn well that this 1977 release is one of the band's very best albums. Even Ian Anderson himself names it as one of his personal favorites, and why the heck not. For this album, and, inspired by his move to the English countryside in the mid-70's, Anderson came up with some wonderful Tull songs that have an earthier, folkier feel to them than previous albums, adding rustic musical elements to the band's prog-rock leanings like mandolin, whistles, glockenspiel, and bells. Not *entirely* folk, fer chrissake, just a winning, whimsical blend of upbeat, jig-inducing folk-rock. And, contrary to belief, the band still *rock* on this album. Not only does Anderson show his tremendous talents once more on songwriting, vocals, guitar & flute, but Martin Barre delivers some excellent guitar licks, John Glascock's bass is commanding, John Evan & David Palmer's keyboard playing sparkles, and Barriemore Barlow keeps the beat big & strong. From the classic title song, to other cheerful tunes like "Cup Of Wonder," "Hunting Girl," "Ring Out Solstice Bells," "Velvet Green," and my personal fave, the exquisite "The Whistler," this Tull album is a true beauty.   Listening to "Songs From The Wood," you can just picture Ian & the boys sawing logs, hunting game, telling stories 'round the campfire, and singing merry songs while passing the ale around. That's how *imaginative* the songs are on this album. So please ignore those annoying naysayers and enjoy Jethro Tull's "Songs From The Wood," one of the band's finest works.
