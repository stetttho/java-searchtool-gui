 1985's "Mike + The Mechanics" isn't really guitarist/bassist Mike Rutherford's first solo project---it's his third---but it is the first release under the group name, which became Rutherford's successful solo project outside of his main band, Genesis. With lead vocals by Paul Carrack and Sad Cafe's Paul Young, this album is a wonderfully catchy disc of excellent, melodic 80's pop/rock. The pair of Top Ten hits, the spacey "Silent Running," and the finger-snapping "All I Need Is A Miracle," are both M+M staples, but there are other great songs like the beautiful "Par Avion" & "Taken In" (which was a minor hit), the hard-rocking "Hanging By A Thread" & "Take The Reins," and the marvelous "A Call To Arms," which actually started out as a Genesis song, co-written by bandmates Phil Collins & Tony Banks, but Rutherford ultimately saved it for his own album. "Mike + The Mechanics" is a terrific album, one of Mike Rutherford's best offerings as a solo artist, and one of the 80's finest albums.
