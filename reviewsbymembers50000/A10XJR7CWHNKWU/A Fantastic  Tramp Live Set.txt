 I saw Supertramp on their 1997 tour for "Some Things Never Change," and it was one of the best concerts I've ever seen in my life. The band sounded so tight, so clean, and so good, I could've sat there and watched them play all night. Thank God they released a live album from this phenomenal tour! Supertramp's 1999 double live album, "It Was The Best Of Times," is a fantastic live set, with Rick Davies & the boys recorded live at the Royal Albert Hall in September of '97. The double CD contains the complete 21-song concert in it's entirety, as well as the occasional song introduction from saxophonist John Helliwell, so the album really does give you a marvelous "you are there" feel. Rick Davies & company are simply sensational, delivering smoking-hot live renditions of 'Tramp classics such as "Ain't Nobody But Me," "Cannonball," "Breakfast In America," "Rudy," "Downstream," "Take The Long Way Home," "The Logical Song," "School," and "Crime Of The Century." The material performed from the "Some Things Never Change" album, including "It's A Hard World," "You Win, I Lose," "Sooner Or Later," and "Listen To Me Please" are also wonderfully done. And although former co-leader Roger Hodgson is no longer with the group, his place is taken just fine by Mark Hart, whose voice sounds close enough to Hodgson's, and who sings the Hodgson material perfectly. And, of course, Davies' voice is still as rich-sounding as ever, and his effortless piano-playing outstanding, as is the band's amazing live chemistry. "It Was The Best Of Times" is a truly mind-blowing live set from Supertramp that easily rivals their classic "Paris" concert album. Definitely pick it up!
