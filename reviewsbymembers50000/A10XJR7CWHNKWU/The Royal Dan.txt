 Walter Becker & Donald Fagen, aka Steely Dan, are the hippest cats in the music biz. Their seamless blend of rock, pop, & jazz, their first-rate musical chops & production skills, not to mention Fagen's cool voice, are world class. For me, 1976's "The Royal Scam" is the group's masterpiece. It's their funkiest, grooviest, most exuberant, guitar-driven album ever made, and, track for track, this sucker rocks. Who can resist such slammin' tunes like "Kid Charlemagne," "The Caves Of Altamira" (love that horn section), "The Fez," "Green Earrings," or the monstrous title track, featuring an equally monstrous piano that hovers over the song like a vulture circling above it's prey. Love it! I dig all of Steely Dan's albums, but for me, this is The Big One for Walt & Don. "The Royal Scam" is my favorite Steely Dan album, and always has been. From the first note of "Kid Charlemagne" to the final fade-out of the title song, this album is simply mindblowing. "The Royal Scam" is Steely Dan at the very peak of their musical powers. So, what are you waiting for, dude? Pick it up! :-)
