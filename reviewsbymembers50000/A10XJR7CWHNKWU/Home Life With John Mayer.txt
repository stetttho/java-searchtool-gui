 John Mayer's second release, "Heavier Things," is a great, GREAT album, with ten songs worth of terrific, groovy pop rock, featuring Mayer's knack for outstanding singing, songwriting, and guitar-playing. "Clarity," "Something's Missing," the awesome pop-rocker "Home Life" (my favorite cut on the disc), the beautiful, Grammy-winning "Daughters," "Only Heart"....damn, these are great songs! There's no sophomore slump here---John Mayer's "Heavier Things" is great stuff.
