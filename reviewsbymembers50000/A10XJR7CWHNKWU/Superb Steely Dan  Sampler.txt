 Okay, so Steely Dan's "Gold" is more of a sampler than a "proper" greatest hits package (no "Do It Again" or "Reelin' In The Years" or "Rikki Don't Lose That Number" or "Josie"?), but it still contains some fine Dan classics, such as "Hey Nineteen," "Green Earrings," "Deacon Blue," and "King Of The World." But there are two main reasons to buy this CD, even if you already have those aforementioned tunes in your Dan collection. One is the inclusion of the all-time Dan classic, "FM" (from the motion picture of the same name), one of the group's most popular songs (AND one of their most funky!). And secondly, the generous inclusion of four excellent bonus tracks: the "Royal Scam" leftover "Here At The Western World," a pair of rare Donald Fagen solo songs, "Century's End" (from the film "Bright Lights Big City"), "True Companion" (from the film "Heavy Metal"), and a rare 1974 live recording of "Bodhisattva" (with a hilarious, drunken introduction from Jerome Aniton).  Granted, if you want a "proper" Steely Dan greatest hits CD, then pick up either of the Dan's excellent best-of albums, "Greatest Hits" or "A Decade Of Steely Dan." But "Gold," with the inclusion of "FM" and four hard-to-find bonus songs, is an essential Steely Dan CD to own. No static at all with this one, baby!
