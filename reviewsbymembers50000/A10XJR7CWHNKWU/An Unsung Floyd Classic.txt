 If you had to pick the one Pink Floyd album that's talked about the least, it's the band's soundtrack album to Barbet Schroeder's 1969 film, "More," about a swinging young couple's heroin addiction. While the film itself has pretty much disappeared (and, to my knowledge, it still isn't available on home video yet), Pink Floyd's accompanying soundtrack album has thankfully survived, but it's arguably the band's least popular album, which is a shame because it truly is an outstanding Pink Floyd disc that works perfectly well as a stand-alone Floyd album away from the film that inspired it.Five of the album's tracks were written by bassist Roger Waters, and they're all excellent songs: the eerie, melancholy opener "Cirrus Minor," the take-no-prisoners rock of "The Nile Song" (if you ever wanted to hear Pink Floyd do heavy metal, here it is), the light, breezy "Crying Song," the ballady "Green Is The Colour," and the absolutely gorgeous, atmospheric "Cymbaline," one of my all-time favorite Floyd songs. Drummer Nick Mason and keyboardist Richard Wright contribute the aggressive, powerful drums-and-piano workout, "Up The Khyber," and guitarist David Gilmour strums a mighty spanish guitar with his fine solo showcase, "A Spanish Piece." Other highlights include the fine hard rock of "Ibiza Bar" (which is basically the sister rocker to "The Nile Song"), the trippy space-rock of "Main Theme" and "Dramatic Theme," and the avant-garde sounds of "Quicksilver." Even the brief percussion piece "Party Sequence" and the equally-brief blues riff of "More Blues" are pretty cool as well. The band's musical interplay throughout is sharp as a knife, and David Gilmour's voice, whether yelling through the "The Nile Song" or singing the beautiful "Cymbaline," is very commanding.Regretfully, "More" is a very underrated Pink Floyd album, most likely because (A) it's a soundtrack to a very obscure movie, and (B) because the band tossed it off so quickly, as they reportedly wrote the "More" soundtrack in eight days flat (although it's unknown how many days the Floyd took to record it---presumably not many). But in the end, it's the quality of the final product that matters, and "More," while not one of Pink Floyd's most popular albums, is certainly one of their best. It's a powerful, unsung Floyd classic.
