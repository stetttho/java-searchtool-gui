 If it worked for The Beatles and their "1" collection, surely it can work for Elvis Presley, too. And it has---"30 #1 Hits" has returned The King to the top of the album charts, and with darn good reason. For the casual Elvis fan, this CD is quite possibly the only Elvis disc you'll ever need to own, as it's got ALL of his best-known, best-loved tunes on it ("Don't Be Cruel," "Hound Dog," "Jailhouse Rock"...heck, ALL of the big hits). For the diehard Elvis followers who already own everything, this CD is worth getting alone for the inclusion of Elvis' latest smash hit, the muscular "A Little Less Conversation" (a UK #1 from this past summer). "30 #1 Hits" is grand proof why The King Of Rock 'N' Roll is here to stay. Elvis lives! :-)
