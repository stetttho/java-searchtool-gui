 The Beatles' sixth album, "Rubber Soul," saw the Fab Four push the bar up once more, continuing their growth as songwriters and musicians, experimenting more in the studio, and pull away some more from the simpler boy-meets-girl pop songs they started with and into more sophisticated avenues. The love songs are still there, but the lyrics have more weight and maturity than ever before. "Rubber Soul" has more of an acoustic feel to it than any previous Beatles album, but the band still plug in often enough. And the music is wonderful. In short, it's another masterpiece for the Beatles! Classic songs include Paul McCartney's pop-rocker "Drive My Car," the beautiful ballad "Michelle," and the fun "I'm Looking Through You," and John Lennon's gorgeous compositions, including "Norwegian Wood" (featuring sitar by George Harrison), "In My Life" (with a lovely piano solo by producer George Martin), the soaring "Nowhere Man," and the dreaminess of "Girl." George Harrison contributes a pair of terrific songs, "Think For Yourself," and, my personal choice for the all-time best song Harrison ever did with the Beatles, "If I Needed Someone," which is an absolutely radiant, sparkling number. And Ringo Starr gets a great spotlight tune with the country-ish "What Goes On" (and for which he received a rare co-writing credit with Lennon & McCartney). The Beatles' musical evolution gloriously continues with "Rubber Soul."
