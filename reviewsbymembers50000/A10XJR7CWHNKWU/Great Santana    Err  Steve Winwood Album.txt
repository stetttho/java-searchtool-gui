 ....and I mean that positively! Steve Winwood's first new solo album since 1997, the appropriately-titled "About Time," finds Steve dipping into Latino-flavored rock that greatly reminds me of a particularly famous rock guitarist named Carlos. Even the album cover looks like it was drawn by the same artist who draws Santana's album covers, so there you go. But seriously, this is a terrific album, the best music I've heard from Steve in years. "About Time" also finds Steve re-visiting his experimental side he so marvelously displayed with his old band, Traffic. Steve proudly wields his trademark Hammond organ all throughout the album, and his classic, soulful singing voice, so often compared to Ray Charles, remains perfectly intact. Also, Steve gets excellent support on this album from guitarist Jose Neto and drummer Walfredo Reyes Jr., as well as his wife, Eugenia, who co-wrote three of the songs. Most of the tracks are over five minutes in length, recorded live with no overdubs, and show no trace of the pop gloss that Winwood used on some of his hit albums of the past. Not that there was anything *wrong* with that---I like Steve's older stuff---but in comparison to popular Winwood favorites like "Back In The Highlife" and "Roll With It," "About Time" sounds very refreshing, indeed. Highlights include the tasty "Different Light" & "Cigano (For The Gypsies)," the totally dreamy "Why Can't We Live Together," the Traffic-esque "Now That You're Alive," and the beautiful "Horizon." But Winwood saves the best track for last: "Silvia (Who Is She?)," clocking in at 11 1/2 minutes, is a smoking-hot piece, one of Steve's greatest tunes, featuring some mesmerizing organ from Steve, scorching guitar work from Neto, and a powerful drumkit attack from Reyes Jr.  Recording on his own label, Wincraft Music, for the very first time, Steve Winwood sounds totally re-energized with "About Time," easily one of his finest albums. Welcome back, Steve, and yes, it IS about time.
