 "Serious Hits Live" documents Phil Collins' tour for his 1989 album, "But Seriously." As promised, this live album has Phil performing his biggest hits, including "You Can't Hurry Love," "Sussudio," "One More Night," "Easy Lover," and "Take Me Home." Phil proves for all to hear what a dynamic performer he & his band are live in concert. His earth-shattering performance of "In The Air Tonight" alone makes this CD worth getting, but overall this is a fabulous live set. It's Phil's show all the way, and you're invited! Enjoy.
