 This is the excellent soundtrack album to the 1988 movie "Buster" starring Phil Collins in his feature film debut as a famed British thief. Phil also contributed to the film's soundtrack album, and the "Buster" soundtrack does have a lot of great tunes on it, not only the two big #1 hit songs from Phil, "Two Hearts" and "A Groovy Kind Of Love," but also some classic 60's tunes from the likes of Sonny & Cher, The Spencer Davis Group, Dusty Springfield, and Gerry & The Pacemakers. Phil also contributes another pair of great songs, one sung by The Four Tops ("Loco In Acapulco"), and the up-tempo, rhythmic fun of "Big Noise," while Anne Dudley composes the fine orchestral music, which is sprinkled throughout the soundtrack album (including "The Robbery," featuring Phil on drums). I'm disappointed that the movie didn't do particularly well, but Phil did give an excellent performance as Buster, and he also delivered a great little batch of tunes to the soundtrack. The "Buster" movie soundtrack is a must-own CD for any diehard Phil fan. Pick it up!
