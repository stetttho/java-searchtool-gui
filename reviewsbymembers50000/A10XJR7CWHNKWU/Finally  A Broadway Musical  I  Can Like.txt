 When I was growing up, my older brother & sister, who were both heavily into their drama classes in high school, drove me friggin' NUTS by playing nothing but showtune music on their respective stereos. Showtunes, showtunes, showtunes, that's all I ever heard playing in the house as a young boy. Maybe that's why I can't stand typical (*cue Ethel Merman*) "Broadway Shooooooow!" kind of music. It just sounds way too corny & cheeseball to my ears, and it's simply not music that I would want to buy, much less listen to. I'm a rock 'n' roller, baby!That's why I'm so thrilled with David Yazbek's wonderful, ROCKING score for the stage musical version of the movie, "The Full Monty," which I had the great pleasure of seeing recently (MARVELOUS show, by the way). Yazbek's songs, blending pop, rock and jazz (with a little pinch of salsa and barbershop vocals, too), are catchy & memorable, with really clever, sometimes-hilarious lyrics that totally hit home. Yazbek's songs totally add something special to the already-endearing story of six unemployed steel workers who bare it all for some much-needed cash & self-respect. I can't get songs like "Scrap," "Big-Ass Rock," "You Rule My World," "Big Black Man," "The Goods," or "Let It Go" out of my head! Even the ballads, like "Breeze Off The River" & "You Walk With Me," are beautiful. Yes, the songs are THAT good."The Full Monty," one of my all-time favorite movies, has now been adapted into one of my all-time favorite musicals, and in no small part to David Yazbek's wonderful, rockin' tunes on this Broadway cast album. Let it go! :-)
