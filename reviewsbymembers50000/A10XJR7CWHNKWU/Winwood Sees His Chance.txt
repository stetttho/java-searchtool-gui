 Steve Winwood's second solo album, 1980's "Arc Of A Diver," remains one of his most popular releases, and it is indeed an excellent album. Winwood produced it, co-wrote all the songs, and plays all of the instruments himself. And, of course, he sings with that marvelous Ray Charles-ish voice. The album is a keyboard-heavy platter of pop, and it's all good. The catchy "While You See A Chance" was a big #2 hit for Steve on the U.S. singles chart, but there are also other goodies including the atmospheric title song, the breezy "Second Hand Woman," the great grooves of "Spanish Dancer," and the up-tempo funk-pop of "Night Train" (featuring some fine electric guitar from Winwood). Steve also slows things down a bit for the cool mellowness of "Slowdown Sundown" and "Dust." "Arc Of A Diver" is a great Steve Winwood album.
