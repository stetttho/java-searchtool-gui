 Genesis keyboardist Tony Banks began his solo career with 1979's "A Curious Feeling." This is an outstanding solo debut for Banks, and, of all his solo albums, "A Curious Feeling" is the most progressive-sounding, the one that sounds the most like vintage Genesis. Not only is Tony's songwriting and keyboard-playing here superb (as always), but he also proves himself on this album to be a fine guitarist and bass player. With some extra help from Genesis' touring drummer Chester Thompson and singer Kim Beacon, Tony delivers such stunning tracks as the instrumentals "From The Undertow," "Forever Morning," and the truly gorgeous "Waters Of Lethe," as well as great melodic songs like "Lucky Me" (which *could* have been a hit single), and the title tune. There's also brilliant progressive tracks like the powerful "Somebody Else's Dream," and, what is arguably the album's centerpiece, "You," which starts off as a beautiful love song before seguing into a charging, classic Genesis-style instrumental break. Brilliant music, and brilliant performances all around by Banks, Thompson and singer Kim Beacon, whose powerful voice fits Tony's dramatic rock perfectly. "A Curious Feeling" is a terrific solo debut for Tony Banks.
