 I first became aware of German cabaret singer/actress Ute Lemper when she was a guest performer at Roger Waters' Berlin Wall performance of the Pink Floyd epic, "The Wall," back in 1990. Even though her participation was brief, I was nonetheless struck by her lovely, powerful singing voice, her commanding stage presence, and her goddess-like beauty. And I've been a huge fan ever since. Her 1992 album, "Illusions," is one of Ute's best. Throwing herself into the songs of Marlene Dietrich and Edith Piaf, Ute makes each song her own. One of the amazing things about Ute is that she doesn't just sing a song, she *performs* it, completely getting into character and giving the listener a totally theatrical experience. Listen to how she delivers such classic Dietrich/Piaf numbers like "They Call Me Naughty Lola," "Padam," "Black Market," "Jonny, Wenn Du Geburtstag Hast" and "L'Accordeoniste." Simply outstanding. And her voice can also make you melt---and I mean MELT--- on such beautiful ballads as "Want To Buy Some Illusions" and "Falling In Love Again." Ute Lemper is simply one of the most fantastic singers and performers in the world today, a truly talented lady, and "Illusions" is easily one of her very best releases. So pick it up, and let the one-and-only Ute Lemper entrance you with her vocal magic.
