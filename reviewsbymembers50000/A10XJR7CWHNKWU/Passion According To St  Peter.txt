 "Passion" is Peter Gabriel's landmark 1989 soundtrack album to the controversial film, "The Last Temptation Of Christ," directed by Martin Scorsese. It is also one of Gabriel's finest works ever. The album is ocean-deep in sounds, moods & rhythms, as Gabriel is augmented by singers & musicians from around the world, such as Shankar, Hossam Ramzy, Yousou N'dour, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Baba Maal, and many others. It's a sensational, breathtaking pallette of music, quite possibly THE best world music album ever recorded. And you don't have to listen to it within the context of the film, either, as the album totally opens up the listener's imagination, with such tracks as "The Feeling Begins," with it's driving rhythms, "Of These, Hope," with it's chugging bass lines suggesting the movement of a caravan, "A Different Drum," with it's beautiful chanting (featuring Gabriel) and slamming percussion, "Zaar," with it's sensation of being in a thunder & rain storm, "Before Night Falls," featuring beautiful finger cymbals that sparkle on your stereo speakers, the lovely "With This Love," the haunting "Passion," with vocals by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan that will send shivers down your spine, and the glorious, triumphant "It Is Accomplished." But every single track here is simply stunning. And the new remastering treatment on the album makes it sound even crisper & sharper than ever before. "Passion" may not be a "proper" Peter Gabriel album, but nonetheless, Gabriel totally outdid himself with this one. The fact that he wasn't even nominated for an Academy Award for this exquisite film score is a total mockery of justice. Peter Gabriel's "Passion" is a musical triumph. It's music will haunt you & stimulate your senses. A true classic. :-)
