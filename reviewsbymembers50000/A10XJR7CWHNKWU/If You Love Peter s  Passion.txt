 "Rabbit Proof Fence" is the new Australian film by Philip Noyce, telling the true story of three aboriginal girls who are kidnapped from their home in order to be sold as slave workers. But the three girls escape, and must travel alongside a 1500 mile-long "rabbit proof" fence that stretches across the Australian outback in order to get home. Peter Gabriel's new soundtrack album for the film, appropriately titled "The Long Walk Home," is a beautiful instrumental album that picks up where his classic previous instrumental album, "Passion: Music From The Last Temptation Of Christ," left off. This is a mostly quieter soundtrack album than "Passion," but it's no less powerful. Gabriel infuses traditional Australian musical elements to the soundtrack's aural soundscapes, such as didgeridoo and tribal chant. He plays various keyboards, and also pitches in on background vocals for a couple of tracks. Credit must also be given to guest artists The Blind Boys Of Alabama, who contribute memorable, haunting vocals to the equally-haunting tracks, "Ngankarrparni," & "Cloudless."While the long wait continues for the new "proper" solo album from Gabriel--10 years now--"The Long Walk Home: Music From The Rabbit Proof Fence" is another incredible, essential "stop-gap" Peter Gabriel album to add to your collection, the other being the import-only "OVO" from 2000. Filled with an amazing lushness & atmosphere, "The Long Walk Home," like "OVO," should succeed in holding you over until the new Gabriel album is *finally* released later this year. Seriously, has this brilliant man ever recorded a bad disc? Not to my ears. :-)
