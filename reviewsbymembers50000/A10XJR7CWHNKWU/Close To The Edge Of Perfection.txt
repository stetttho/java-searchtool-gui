 Yes deliver another progressive rock masterpiece with 1972's "Close To The Edge." The final Yes album with drummer Bill Bruford (who would later leave the band to join King Crimson), "Close To The Edge" is one of the band's most barn-burning releases. The 19-minute title track alone is arguably the group's finest piece ever, a monstrous, dramatic, adventurous work that keeps you held in it's grip from fade-in to fade-out. "And You And I" is a gorgeous piece and an enduring Yes concert staple, and the concluding "Siberian Khatru" is another memorable, popular Yes rocker. Everybody in the band scores major points on this album: Jon Anderson's soothing falsetto voice & intriguing lyrics, Steve Howe's ace guitar playing, Chris Squire's thunderous bass, Rick Wakeman's brilliant keyboard work, and Bruford's awesome swansong Yes performance on the drumkit, as well as Eddie Offord's brilliant production, co-produced with the band. The early 70's were truly the golden years for Yes, as they were totally on top of the world and carving a very special place for themselves in rock history with these classic albums. "Close To The Edge" remains one of Yes' true masterworks, and one of the greatest albums ever from the progressive rock genre.
