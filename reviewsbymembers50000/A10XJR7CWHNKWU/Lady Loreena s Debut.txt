 "Elemental" is the 1985 debut album by the multi-talented Loreena McKennitt. The album is a beautiful, celtic masterpiece, with Loreena taking traditional songs & poems, and putting her own angelic stamp on every single one of them. With her heavenly voice and exquisite harp playing & arrangements, Loreena casts her spell over the listener with the greatest of ease. "Blacksmith," "Stolen Child," "Carrighfergus" (a gorgeous duet between Loreena and Cedric Smith), "Banks Of Claudy," and the powerful William Blake poem with musical accompanyment, "Lullaby," are all standouts. Loreena McKennitt is a lady I have the utmost respect & admiration for, as she truly is a very special, unique artist. "Elemental" is an outstanding debut.
