 1977's "Even In The Quietest Moments" finds Supertramp going for a more piano & acoustic-guitar based, orchestral sound (hinted at by the snow-covered grand piano on the album cover), and putting aside their trademark Wurlitzer keyboard entirely. But don't worry, the band still leave room for rock as well. "Even In The Quietest Moments" is another wonderful, classic disc from Roger Hodgson, Rick Davies and the Trampers, with such classic tunes as the Hodgson signature "Give A Little Bit," the totally gorgeous title song, the equally-gorgeous "Downstream" (a great solo showcase for Davies), "From Now On," and the stunning finale, the 11-minute suite, "Fool's Overture," a true rock masterwork."Even In The Quietest Moments" is yet another winner from Supertramp. What more can I say about it---just buy it! :-)
