 "Rupi's Dance," the latest solo album from Jethro Tull leader Ian Anderson, is an excellent album that showcases Anderson's gift for storytelling, as well as his trademark flute & vocal abilities. He weaves some pretty fine tales here, such as his tributes to his current feline companion (the title song) and his recently-departed one ("Old Black Cat"), his fascination with a beautiful CNN reporter ("Not Ralitsa Vassileva"), perusing coffee shops ("Calliandra Shade"), taking vacations ("A Week Of Moments"), and the joys of photo developing ("Photo Shop"), among others. All the while, Ian's rich voice and sparkling flute (and acoustic guitar, too) shine brightly on the disc, with the album's mix of madrigal folk and rock very, very charming. And to sweeten the deal, Ian even includes a great bonus cut from Jethro Tull's Christmas album, "Birthday Card At Christmas," to round things off. What more could you ask for? Whether solo or with Jethro Tull, Ian Anderson is a musical genius that I will follow anywhere, and "Rupi's Dance" is a wonderful album from this most-excellent pied piper.
