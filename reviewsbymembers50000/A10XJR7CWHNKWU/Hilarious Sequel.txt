 Picking up right where "The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy" left off, Douglas Adams' "The Restaurant At The End Of The Universe" continues the hilarious intergalactic adventures of earthman Arthur Dent, his alien chum Ford Prefect, the two-headed freakazoid Zaphod Beeblebrox, earthwoman Trillian, and Marvin The Paranoid Android. When we last left this ragtag bunch, they were still on the run from the intergalactic authorities in their stolen souped-up spacecraft, The Heart Of Gold. Book 2 includes Zaphod's outrageous adventure to find the man who rules the Universe, a memorable stop at Milliways, The Restaurant At The End Of The Universe, the gang's close shave with having their ship plunge into a sun (all part of a rock concert spectacle put on by the rock group Disaster Area), and finally, Ford & Arthur's adventure onboard an Ark ship manned by a clueless bunch from the planet Golgafrincham. Oh, a startling revelation will also be made, and The Ultimate Question to the Ultimate Answer of "Forty-Two" will also be revealed! (Well, sort of....). Once again, Adams' brilliantly clever wit & writing style shines through on every page, and the book, like it's predecessor, is a real gutbuster.If you have enjoyed the adventures of Arthur Dent & Ford Prefect & company so far, why stop now? Please go to Book 3 in Adams' marvelous sci-fi comedy series, "Life, The Universe, And Everything"....
