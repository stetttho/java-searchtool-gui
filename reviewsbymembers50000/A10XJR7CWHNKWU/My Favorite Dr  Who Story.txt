 Part of being a "Doctor Who" fan is not only having a favorite story, but also having a favorite Doctor. Jon Pertwee, the Third Doctor, has always been my favorite. His charm, courage, wit, intelligence & personality, not to mention  his fancy choice of wardrobe, has always endeared him the most to me of all the Doctors (though I love 'em all!). With "Planet Of The Daleks," Jon Pertwee is given his greatest adventure, and, in my opinion, it's the best "Doctor Who" story ever made. It's exciting & greatly entertaining, just like a "Doctor Who" classic should be.The six-part "Planet Of The Daleks" has it all: the best Doctor (Pertwee, in a terrific performance), the best companion, Jo Grant (the eternally adorable Katy Manning), the legendary Daleks, a great script by Terry Nation, a fine supporting cast playing the Thals (the space travelers who help the Doctor & Jo in their fight against the Daleks), and excellent set pieces in the Spiridon jungle, as well as inside the Daleks' hidden base. Terrific action & drama abounds, with nice bits of humor sprinkled throughout. Not once does this story ever lag, and it always entertains. What more could you WANT from a "Doctor Who" story?"Planet Of The Daleks" is solid, first-rate "Doctor Who," and my personal favorite story of the entire series. Add this classic "Doctor Who" adventure to your collection now. It's a winner!
