 For his 1999 album, "The Time Machine," producer/musician/composer Alan Parsons remains primarily in the background, writing only a lone, one-minute piece, "Temporalia," and playing keyboards on just a pair of tracks. But Parsons IS the album's producer and master of ceremonies, so he still gets the name credit. "The Time Machine" is an excellent album that explores time travel & time itself, with a great selection of songs and first-rate performances. With Parsons perfectly content to sit behind the controlboard, the songwriting & performing spotlights fall on longtime Parsons pals Ian Bairnson on guitar and Stuart Elliott on drums, who both contribute the album's songs & instrumentals, and who play the majority of instruments as well. From start to finish this is great music, including the pulsating "H.G. Force," the atmospheric "Out Of The Blue," the funky "Call Up," the fine pop-rock of "No Future In The Past," the Middle-Eastern flavored "Far Ago And Long Away," and the lovely "The Very Last Time." As usual with Alan Parsons, the music, production & performances are top-notch, including great vocal performances from Tony Hadley of Spandau Ballet, Neil Lockwood, Colin Blunstone, Graham Dye, and the lovely voices of Maire Brennan of Clannad and Beverley Craven, the first women to sing lead on an Alan Parsons album since 1979's "Eve." Granted, I do wish that Parsons would've written & played more on the album, but this is a very small gripe, as Bairnson & Elliott deliver the goods in those departments just fine. All in all, "The Time Machine" is a most excellent offering from Alan Parsons.
