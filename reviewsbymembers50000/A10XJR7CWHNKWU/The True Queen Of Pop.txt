 Singer Cathy Dennis, whose big moment in the spotlight was in the early 90's, has always been a guilty pleasure of mine. Just as I enjoy rock, I can also go for a good pop song, and Cathy Dennis makes GREAT pop songs. In fact, she's the true Queen Of Pop, in my opinion. She has a beautiful voice, plays keyboards, writes her own material, and--spit it out, man--she's drop dead gorgeous. These days, she writes songs for other artists, but she released three excellent solo albums between 1990 and 1996, and her second album, 1992's "Into The Skyline," is my personal favorite. This album is overflowing with terrific, catchy pop music that truly is, as one song title says, "Irresistible." Not only is that song a major highlight, but so are "You Lied To Me," "Why," "Change Will Come," "Our True Emotions," and the superb "Falling," which is one of Cathy's very best tunes. But ALL of the songs on "Into The Skyline" are wonderful, with Cathy's lovely voice and magic touch on the keyboards and in the songwriting department leading the way.It's very unfortunate that this excellent album is currently out-of-print, but at least there are some used copies available, so if you love pop music, then this album is for you. No one on Earth makes pop music like Cathy Dennis, and "Into The Skyline" is arguably her finest work to date. So pick it up, and let the marvelous Cathy Dennis enchant you.
