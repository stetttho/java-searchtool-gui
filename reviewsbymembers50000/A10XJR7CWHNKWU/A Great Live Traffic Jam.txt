 "Welcome To The Canteen" is Traffic recorded live in 1971, following the big success of their 1970 comeback album, "John Barleycorn Must Die," and it features the surprise return of original guitarist Dave Mason to the fold, albeit much too briefly (he would play six gigs with the band, and then leave again). Traffic men Steve Winwood, Jim Capaldi and Chris Wood are joined on this live set not only by Mason but also bassist Rick Grech, drummer Jim Gordon and percussionist Rebop Kwaku Baah, and although sound quality on "Canteen" is not the greatest (though this remastered version cleans it up as best as possible), the performances from the band are rock solid, including a marvelous version of "40,000 Headmen" that actually tops the studio original. As totally great as the studio original of "Headmen" is, the band give the song a little more ebb and flow live in concert, making it even more powerful than before. Mason shines with his two solo spotlight songs, "Sad And Deep As You" and "Shouldn't Have Took More Than You Gave" (both from his classic "Alone Together" album), and Traffic also deliver a funky "Medicated Goo," and a pair of awesome, extended jams on "Dear Mr. Fantasy" and Winwood's classic oldie with the Spencer Davis Group, "Gimme Some Lovin'." Just six tracks long, "Welcome To The Canteen" does leave you hungry for more---it most certainly would've been even better as a double album. But still, this is undoubtedly a great live document of Traffic in their prime. "Welcome To The Canteen," indeed!
