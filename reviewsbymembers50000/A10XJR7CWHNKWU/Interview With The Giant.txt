 The eighth Gentle Giant album, 1976's "Interview," finds the art-rock band *just starting* to step away from their earlier progressive sound, and crafting tunes that were a bit looser and more accessible to the ears (the change in musical direction would be complete by the next album, "The Missing Piece"). But there's still enough of the ol' Gentle Giant sound here to satisfy the diehard GG followers, while the more streamlined, simpler elements the band incorporate on "Interview" actually sound quite refreshing (honestly, I don't mind it when bands try different approaches to their music, just so long as the end result is still genuinely good music!). The title song is punchy & fun, as GG put rock music interviewers firmly in their place, while "Give It Back" has a surprising reggae-ish swing to it in parts, but it works well. "Design" is the song that sounds the most like classic Gentle Giant, featuring the group's trademark, haunting vocal arrangements. "Empty City" sounds a lot like Jethro Tull (one of the bands GG are always compared to), but that's cool with me, and it's both a very beautiful & powerful number. And the album concludes with "I Lost My Head," an instant Gentle Giant classic that is both elegant AND rockin'. It's definitely my favorite song on the album. There are those GG purists out there who say that "Interview" is the band's last good album, as many of them did NOT warm up to the group's later work, starting with "The Missing Piece." I don't think the band nosedived after "Interview"---for starters, I happen to love "The Missing Piece" (but that's another review). "Interview" is an excellent Gentle Giant album, but it certainly isn't their "last" excellent album. There was still some great music yet to come from this Gentle ol' Giant.
