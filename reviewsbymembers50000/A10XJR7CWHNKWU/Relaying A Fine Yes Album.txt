 In 1974, keyboardist Rick Wakeman left Yes (the first of *many* comings and goings of Rick), as he wasn't happy with the group's direction on "Tales From Topographic Oceans," and decided to leave (but don't worry folks, he'll be back). In his absence, Yes recruited Swiss keyboardist Patrick Moraz (later of the Moody Blues), and together, they recorded "Relayer." Featuring three epic songs, "Relayer" is a great Yes album, though the first piece, the 22-minute extravaganza "The Gates Of Delerium," seems to overshadow the two shorter pieces that follow it. "Delerium," a grand rock piece about war, is a signature Yes epic, with the band slowly building it up and building it up until it becomes a sonic battle, with each band member throwing in everything but the kitchen sink as the music builds into a frenzy. Finally, there's calm, and Jon Anderson steps in to sing the lament "Soon," a hauntingly beautiful conclusion to an all-time Yes classic. And the next two pieces, the jazzy "Sound Chaser" and the concluding "To Be Over," although they don't quite match up to "Delerium" in power, are still both excellent Yes songs in their own right. Filled with thunderous performances and moments of great beauty, "Relayer" is another fine Yes album.
