 Sarah McLachlan was just a young sprite of 21 when she released her debut album, "Touch," in 1989. This is an excellent first album, showcasing Sarah's beautiful voice (though obviously younger-sounding on this disc), her melodic songwriting abilities, and her skillful playing on both guitar and piano. Being a 1989 release, "Touch" certainly sounds different from Sarah's later albums, as the production is very studio-polished (i.e. 80's-sounding keyboards and echoed drums feature throughout), so some fans may be a bit surprised. Nonetheless, if you love Sarah's music, then you will certainly love "Touch." Many great songs are on this one, like the gorgeous "Out Of The Shadows," the hit song "Vox," "Trust," "Steaming," the beautiful instrumental "Uphill Battle," and the exquisite "Ben's Song," featuring just Sarah and her piano. Sarah's angelic voice simply soars--and soothes--throughout the whole album. It's unfortunate that "Touch" is a somewhat overlooked Sarah McLachlan album---nothing from it was featured on Sarah's live album, "Mirrorball"---but your Sarah collection is simply not complete without "Touch." After "Touch," Sarah's music would only get better and better, as she pushed up the bar greatly with her next album, "Solace," and even more so with her third & best album to date, "Fumbling Towards Ecstasy." But "Touch" still stands today as a wonderful first step for this incredibly talented lady.
