 1975's "Minstrel In The Gallery" finds Jethro Tull going for a more acoustic-rock sound, and, with several tracks featuring Tull leader Ian Anderson by himself, the album at times sounds more like an Anderson solo project than a group project. Still, "Minstrel In The Gallery" is a very strong Tull album. The first three cuts---the title song, "Cold Wind To Valhalla" and "Black Satin Dancer"---are all wondrous hybrids of acoustic beauty and tough-as-nails rock. "One White Duck/0 = Nothing At All" is a great solo showcase for Anderson, one of his finest moments on record. And the lengthy suite known as "Baker St. Muse" is an awesome Tull piece. And, as an added bonus, this new remastered edition of "Gallery" contains five bonus tracks, including such Tull gems as "Summerday Sands," and the flute instrumental, "Pan Dance." All in all, "Minstrel In The Gallery" is a very good Jethro Tull album.
