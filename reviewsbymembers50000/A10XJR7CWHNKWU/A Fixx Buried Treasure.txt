 One of two studio albums by the Fixx that's currently out-of-print (the other being "Ink"), 1986's "Walkabout" is one of the Fixx's very best releases. Why this brilliant Fixx album has not yet been re-issued, when so many of their other albums have, is a mystery to me. Still in their musical prime in the late 80's, lead singer Cy Curnin, ace guitarist Jamie West-Oram & company deliver one smart, catchy pop-rocker after another on "Walkabout." EVERY song here is a great one, including the hit song "Secret Separation," "Built For The Future," "Chase The Fire," the title song, the beautiful ballad "Read Between The Lines" (featuring some fine piano-playing from singer Curnin), and "Camphor." There's even an excellent hidden bonus track at the end of the CD (which I can only assume is called "There Is Only"). Curnin's singing voice is superb, West-Oram delivers some incredibly tasty guitar licks throughout, and the band's performances are as tight as can be. "Walkabout" is TOO good a Fixx album to remain out-of-print! Hopefully it will be re-issued at some point, but for now, buy it used. It's a great buried treasure from the Fixx.
