 1972's "Three Friends" is Gentle Giant's third album (though the US release mistakenly uses the same cover art from the band's first album), and it's a magnificent work. A concept album, "Three Friends" is a 35-minute, six-part opus, telling the tale of three young friends who go to school together, but are separated as they get older, and their lives take them down different paths---one becomes a construction worker, the second a painter, and the third a businessman. A simple story, but very effective, anchored by Gentle Giant's brilliant music. The band's musicianship, arrangements, and vocalising are all superb, the music haunting and powerful. While my personal favorite GG album remains "The Power And The Glory," there's no denying that the band definitely pushed up the bar another notch with "Three Friends." It's a Gentle Giant classic, and a must-own album for any fan of progressive rock.
