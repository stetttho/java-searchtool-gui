 Although a fine album, the Alan Parsons Project's 1984 release, "Vulture Culture," with it's pop-oriented sound, had many Project fans worried that the veteran studio group had gotten too soft in their musical approach. So, Project leaders Alan Parsons & Eric Woolfson decided that the follow-up disc, 1985's "Stereotomy," would be a tougher-sounding Project album, for which many fans breathed a sigh of relief. This is a powerful, punchy, mostly hard-rocking Project album, and one of their best. The title track is an awesome, classic Project rocker, which segues quite well into the fun, upbeat "Beaujolais." Next up is the terrific, ambient-rock instrumental, "Urbania," and then, the Project turn the volume down a bit for one of their all-time greatest ballads, "Limelight," beautifully sung by the one-and-only Gary Brooker of Procol Harum. "In The Real World" is a cool pop-rocker, and the pumped-up instrumental "Where's The Walrus?" is absolutely electric. "Light Of The World" is a gorgeous song, a true Project buried treasure. Finally, there's the brief, atmospheric "Chinese Whispers," and the grand finale, "Stereotomy Two," with the group charging for home with guns blazing. The album is outstanding from beginning to end, with first-rate songs & instrumentals, incredible, energetic musicianship & production, and great lead vocals by John Miles, Chris Rainbow, Gary Brooker and Graham Dye. Quite simply, "Stereotomy" rocks. The Alan Parsons Project's album sales may have been in decline by this point, but "Stereotomy" certainly remains one of the group's very best releases. Pick it up and crank it up!
