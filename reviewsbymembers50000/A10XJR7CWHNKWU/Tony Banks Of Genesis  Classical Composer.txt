 "Seven: A Suite For Orchestra" is the debut classical album by the one-and-only Tony Banks, the keyboard player for Genesis, and it consists of five pieces that Tony wrote specifically for the album, plus two older pieces Tony had lying around that hadn't found a home yet. It's performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Mike Dixon, with Tony chipping in here & there on piano. And it is absolutely gorgeous music. It's impossible for me to single out a single track. All I can tell you is that this music is breathtakingly beautiful. And if you're familiar with Tony's work in Genesis---and bonus points are awarded to you if you know his solo material as well---you will *instantly* recognize the powerful melodies, moods, and musical nuances that couldn't be written by anyone else but Tony Banks. And, being released on the Naxos budget label, the price of this CD is practically a steal, so you're definitely getting a GREAT deal in purchasing it. I know that Tony had this classical album in the pipeline for many years, and, as a longtime fan, I wondered if it would *ever* be released. But here it is at last, and I can happily say to you that it was so worth the wait. With "Seven: A Suite For Orchestra," Tony Banks takes a brilliant first step as a classical composer, and I'd love to hear more. It's a beautiful classical album, and I can't recommend it highly enough. Congratulations, Tony!
