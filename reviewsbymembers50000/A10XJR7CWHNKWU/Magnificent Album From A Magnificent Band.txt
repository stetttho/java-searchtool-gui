 Led by singer/bassist Michael Been, the Call were always a very critically acclaimed group, but sadly, for all of their musical firepower, they never acheived the commercial success that they so rightfully deserved. Though most of their albums are currently out-of-print, and they apparently disbanded for good after their 1997 release, "To Heaven And Back," the Call were--and are--rock music titans, and their phenomenal eight studio albums recorded between 1982 and 1997 are all worth seeking out.In 1986, the Call released what is without a doubt their masterpiece, "Reconciled." It is one of the greatest, most passionate rock albums ever made. The Call deliver one emotional, powerhouse rocker after another, such as the dramatic "Everywhere I Go," the triumphant "I Still Believe," "Blood Red," "Oklahoma," "Sanctuary," and the closing "Even Now." The band's musical interplay is tight, and Michael Been's lyrics & transcendent lead vocals are passionate with a capital P. And, for the coup de grace, "Reconciled" features guest performances by such Call fans as Peter Gabriel and Simple Minds' Jim Kerr on backing vocals, and Robbie Robertson on guitar. Outstanding music from start to finish, the Call's "Reconciled" is a magnificent album from a magnificent band.
