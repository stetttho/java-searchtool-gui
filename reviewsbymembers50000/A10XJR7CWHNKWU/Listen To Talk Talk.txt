 This outstanding British art-pop band, led by singer/songwriter Mark Hollis, released five studio albums between 1982 and 1991. "Natural History" is a Best-Of collection that covers the first four Talk Talk albums, and I can most certainly guarantee that if you enjoy this disc, you'll definitely want to seek out the band's whole catalog. They only had one Top 40 hit in the States, "It's My Life" (recently covered by No Doubt), but there's a lot more intelligent, sophisticated tunes where that classic song came from. Talk Talk made GREAT music, with a grace and power in the way they used keyboards and piano, the big thumping of the drums, the cleverness of the songwriting & arrangements, the way their music could instantly grab you and hold your attention, and, of course, the distinctive, rich voice of Mark Hollis. "Talk Talk," "Such A Shame," "It's My Life," "Life Is What You Make It," "Living In Another World," "Desire"....simply wonderful songs. Thanks to "Natural History," I'm an instant fan, and I'm already seeking out the rest of the group's stuff. They never got the huge success that they so rightfully deserved, but Talk Talk was and IS a band to treasure. "Natural History" is a marvelous introduction.
