 In 1988, a band from Manchester, England named the Stone Roses released a self-titled album that became a smash in their homeland. Before Oasis, Radiohead and Coldplay came along, there were the Stone Roses, and they were a *phenomenon*. John Squire was an instant guitar-god, Ian Brown had a singing voice that could easily melt you, Gary Mounfield was a solid bassist, and the drummer known only as Reni was nothing short of fantastic. Oh yeah, and they also wrote fantastic songs, shimmering beauties that perfectly mixed rock, pop, funk, dance, psychedelia, and acoustic stuff. And all in one album! And although the Roses never got beyond cult status in the States, their self-titled debut remains a landmark album in British rock history. From the opening "I Wanna Be Adored," "She Bangs The Drums" and "Elephant Stone," to the halfway point of "Elizabeth My Dear" (all 59 seconds of it), "(Song For My) Sugar Spun Sister" and "Made Of Stone," to the brilliant extended tracks of "I Am The Resurection" and the GROOVY "Fools Gold," this album is a mindblower. As other reviewers have pointed out, every note played and sung is absolutely perfect. Sadly, when the promotional duties for the album were finally finished, the Stone Roses got tangled up in legal hassles with their record label, preventing them from releasing another album for six years. The second album, "Second Coming," finally arrived in 1994, and it, too, was brilliant (and it was also the album that made me a Roses fan, t'boot), but it wasn't received anywhere near as well as the first album, and the band fell apart shortly afterwards. Their lifespan was much too brief, but ALL the current hot British bands of the day owe a great debt of some form or another to the Stone Roses for helping to forge the path with this all-time classic 1988 release.
