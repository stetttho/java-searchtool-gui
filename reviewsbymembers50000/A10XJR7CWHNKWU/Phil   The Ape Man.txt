 1999's "Tarzan" movie soundrack isn't really a "proper" Phil Collins album, per se, but Phil does contribute some wonderful tunes to the soundtrack, as well as some killer tribal rhythms & beats that perfectly fit this animated Disney hit about the legendary ape man. Of course there's the gorgeous "You'll Be In My Heart," for which Phil won his well-deserved Oscar for Best Song, but also the equally-powerful "Two Worlds," the fun "Trashin' The Camp," and the skillful pop of "Son Of Man" and "Strangers Like Me." There's also incredible orchestral music that makes up the album's second-half, written by Mark Mancina, which Phil contributes drums to.Okay, so I could've done without NSync's guest duet with Phil on the second version of "Trashin' The Camp," but otherwise, this is a marvelous soundtrack album, with some classic Phil Collins music. The "Tarzan" movie soundtrack is a very swingin' disc in my book.
