 1992's "Connected" was the big album for Rob B & company, better known as the Stereo MC's. This deliriously catchy album has funk written all over it, with killer grooves & beats, and very cool singing & rapping from Rob. The head-bobbing hits "Connected" and "Step It Up" alone are worth the price of admission, but MAN, there are so many fly tracks on this album: "Ground Level," "All Night Long," "Playing With Fire," "Creation," and "The End," just to name some. When it comes to dance pop, there's nobody that comes close to the Stereo MC's in catchiness, intelligence and studio expertise. "Connected" will definitely fit the bill if you need music to cruise down the highway to, or to get down with your bad self at a mixer or in private. Party on, Stereo MC's!
