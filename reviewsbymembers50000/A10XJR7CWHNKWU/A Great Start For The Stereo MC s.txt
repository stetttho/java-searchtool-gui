 Those master DJ/rapper/dance pop groovers from Britain known as the Stereo MC's have been kickin'it since 1989, when they released their debut album, "33-45-78" (named after the three playing speeds of record turntables). This is a solid debut album from the Stereo MC's, filled with lots of great grooves, clever samples & slammin' beats, and the charismatic, smooth-sounding voice of lead rapper Rob B. Great tracks include "On 33," "Toe To Toe," the awesome, funky hit single "What Is Soul" (arguably the album's best cut), "Bring It On," the instrumental "Sunday 19th March," Rob B's rap duet with T.G.G. Sherrif, "This Ain't A Love Song," and the totally funky "Move." The Stereo MC's would make their masterpiece with their next offering, "Supernatural" (my personal candidate for Best Rap Album Ever Made), but "33-45-78" is a groovy, excellent start for this brilliant UK studio outfit. So pop this sucker into your stereo, and let Rob B & the gang rock your box!
