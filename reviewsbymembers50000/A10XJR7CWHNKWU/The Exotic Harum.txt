 Procol Harum's 1974 release, "Exotic Birds And Fruit," is one of the group's finest albums. It may not boast any "hits," but diehard Harum fans know classic Harum songs when they hear them, and "Exotic Birds" contains many of them, such as the thumping "Nothing But The Truth," the drinking-song pastiche "Beyond The Pale," the fine melodies of "As Strong As Samson" (with one of Keith Reid's very best lyrics: "Ain't no use in preacher's preaching/When they don't know what they're teaching"), the spooky "The Thin Edge Of The Wedge," the playful "Fresh Fruit," and the rockin' "Butterfly Boys." The band, led by singer/pianist extraordinaire Gary Brooker, sound superb on this one. Thumbs up all the way on Procol Harum's "Exotic Birds And Fruit."
