 Still rocking 21 years after their debut disc, 1982's "Shuttered Room," the Fixx are back with a new album, "Want That Life," and it's excellent. The first pair of tracks, "Touch" and "You Don't Have To Prove Yourself," are two of the best songs the band have done in years, really catchy stuff with great hooks. But the rest of the album is solid as well, with more fine songs like "Are You Satisfied," the title track, "No Hollywood Ending," "Roger And Out," and "Brave." Although their time of hit singles and big record sales may be over, I'm thrilled that Cy Curnin and the rest of the Fixx are still making music. They're a great band, and their diehard fans, myself included, are still here for them. With "Want That Life," the Fixx are still going strong.
