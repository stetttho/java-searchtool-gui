 With the departure of keyboardist Tony Kaye, Yes said hello to new keyboard wiz Rick Wakeman, and together they recorded 1972's "Fragile," a terrific Yes album. An enduring fan favorite, "Fragile" contains many Yes classics, such as the hit "Roundabout," and other FM staples like "Long Distance Runaround," "Heart Of The Sunrise," and "South Side Of The Sky." Yes also decided to give each band member a "solo spotlight" track on "Fragile": singer Jon Anderson's vocal layer cake known as "We Have Heaven," guitarist Steve Howe's acoustic "Mood For A Day," Chris Squire's funky bass workout on "The Fish," Wakeman's brief keyboard renduring of "Cans And Brahms," and drummer Bill Bruford's "Five Percent For Nothing," clocking in at a mere 35 seconds. The band's chemistry & power on "Fragile" is amazing, as are the vocals, arrangements, and production by the band & producer Eddy Offord. Although "Fragile" is sandwiched between two Yes albums that are, in my opinion, a little better, "The Yes Album" and "Close To The Edge," "Fragile" is still an excellent Yes disc, and an enduring classic from one of progressive rock's hallmark bands.
