 The Fixx's 1991 album, "Ink," pretty much sank like a stone upon it's initial release, which ultimately led to the band taking a five-year hiatus. And although "Ink" isn't a particularly memorable album in the band's catalog---perhaps because it's the most commercial-sounding thing they've ever done---it still is a good, solid effort from Cy Curnin & company, with very good songs like "All Is Fair," "Crucified," "Shut It Out," and "Make No Plans." While not exactly a classic, "Ink" is still a good Fixx.
