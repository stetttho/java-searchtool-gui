 As I eagerly await the arrival of "Deep Down And Dirty," the Stereo MC's first new album in 9(!) years, I've been happily re-visiting the group's earlier releases recently, including this one, "Supernatural (The American Mix)." This album is, quite simply, the best rap record I've ever heard, bar none (and it's also the rap album that proves that you DON'T have to swear like a sailor to make an important statement in the rap medium). The tunes are all hip & slammin', with terrific beats, samples, production work, and the charismatic, very-British voice of Rob Birch (aka Rob B), who can easily lay claim to being the world's greatest rapper. He's also got a very cool, very smooth singing voice, too! I could listen to Rob rap & sing all day, 'cause he's got a GREAT, commanding presence at the mike. With such awesome, catchy songs as these, like "I'm A Believer," "Scene Of The Crime," the hit "Elevate My Mind," "Two Horse Town," "Lost In Music" & "The Other Side," you will not be able to resist bobbing your head, snappin' your fingers, and grooving along with this amazing disc. It's rap music for the mind & soul as well as the ears.The Stereo MC's are comin' back, y'all, and that's great cause for celebration! In the meantime, check out "Supernatural," and find out for yourself what makes this excellent English group so great. Check it out!
