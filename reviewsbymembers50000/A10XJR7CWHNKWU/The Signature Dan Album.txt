 Steely Dan hit the commercial jackpot in 1977 with "Aja," their most successful release to date. So much has already been written about this signature classic from Walter Becker & Donald Fagen, that I don't have much else to add. I will just say that, with "Aja," Walt & Don crafted an outstanding jazz/pop/rock record in which every note played & sung, every melody, every arrangement, and every ounce of studio production is nothing short of genius. The towering piano, the sparkling horn section, the tasty guitars, and Donald Fagen's ultra-cool voice....pure magic. And to cap it off, ALL seven tracks---"Black Cow," "Aja," "Deacon Blues," "Peg," "Home At Last," "I Got The News," and "Josie"---are all classic FM-radio staples, all classic Steely Dan songs. In fact, these songs flow together SO effortlessly, you'd think that "Aja" is one continuous 40-minute suite simply split up into seven movements. Yep, it's that good.Most Steely Dan fans point to "Aja" as the group's greatest work. My personal fave is "The Royal Scam," but there's no doubt that "Aja" is a superb---heck, *legendary*---Steely Dan disc. It's the album that sent Walt & Don into the commercial stratosphere, and with good reason. Magnificent.
