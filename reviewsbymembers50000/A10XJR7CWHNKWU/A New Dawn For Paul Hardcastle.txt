 On his latest album, "Hardcastle 4," Paul Hardcastle introduces some new, surprise elements into his unbeatable style of smooth jazz---some new keyboard sounds, some new arrangements, and the lovely singing voice of his lovely young daughter, Maxine, who is featured on three tracks, which she co-wrote with her father. It's a new dawn for Paul Hardcastle with this one! Fabulous, groovy tunes, such as the captivating "Serene" and "Freefall," "Straight Ahead" and the beautifully aquatic feel of "Journey Of The Lost Tribes." And Maxine's collaborations with her dad are all terrific: "Smooth Jazz Is Bumpin" (finally, a smooth-jazz anthem!), "Was It Love" and "Where Are You Now." Maxine has a very cute, breathy, almost pixie-ish kind of voice, and she also shows excellent songwriting talent, too. I buy all of Paul Hardcastle's new CD's without ever previewing them first because I know I'm going to get something good, and so far, Paul is still batting 100 with me. "Hardcastle 4" is outstanding and catchy with a capital C. Well done, Paul & Maxine. Keep the great music comin'!
