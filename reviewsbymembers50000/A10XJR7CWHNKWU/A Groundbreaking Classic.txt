 If The Who had never recorded "Tommy," there never would've been  "The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway," or "The Wall," or  "Jesus Christ Superstar," or "War Of The Worlds." Or  The Who's follow-up concept album, "Quadrophenia," for that  matter. Yes, "Tommy" was the world's first rock opera, and it  still stands today as a landmark album in the history of rock. Pete  Townshend & company crafted a rock album whose music is brilliantly  intelligent, passionate, beautiful, and kicks major rear-end in the rock  department. It also tells a fascinating story, as it's narrative about the  pinball-playing deaf dumb & blind boy holds up amazingly well from  start to finish. The Who have always been one of the world's greatest rock  bands, and their earlier albums showed that they could do British  "Mod" music like no other band in existence. But with  "Tommy," The Who showed what rock music could BE. I can't  recommend this album enough---add "Tommy" to your CD collection,  and let The Who take you, right along with Tommy himself, on an amazing  journey.
