 "Dance Into The Light" is one of Phil Collins' most overlooked albums. It was released in 1996, during a time when Phil wasn't as popular as he was all throughout the 80's, and still three years off from his comeback with the "Tarzan" movie soundtrack. It's really too bad that not too many people checked out this disc upon it's release, because "Dance Into The Light" is one of Phil's best albums, and his finest solo work since 1981's "Face Value." Highlights include "Lorenzo," a brilliant tune with lyrics from a poem by Michaela Odone, the young boy who inspired the film "Lorenzo's Oil." Phil supplies a powerful music bed for this piece, complete with slammin' African drum beats & instrumentation, and heartful vocal delivery. "Just Another Story" is another work of genius, with it's atmospheric, late night stroll-down-the-street vibe, as Phil tells a gripping tale about some people's lives in the big city. It's a very memorable song. "Oughta Know By Now" SHOULD have been this album's secret weapon. With a great guitar hook, tight brass arrangement and powerful drumming and singing from Phil, this song has all the makings of a smash hit, and could've been the song that saved the album from commercial disappointment. And "No Matter Who" is a wonderfully light, breezy number that also could've been a surefire hit.   "Dance Into The Light" is a terrific hidden gem from one of the hardest working men in the music biz, Phil Collins. Check it out!
