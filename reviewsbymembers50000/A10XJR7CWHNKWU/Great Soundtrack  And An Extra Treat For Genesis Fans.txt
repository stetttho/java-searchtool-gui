 The soundtrack to the 1984 film "Against All Odds" is an excellent album, and, if you happen to be a Genesis fan, you'll also appreciate that no less than three past members of Genesis contribute solo tracks. Of course there's singer Phil Collins with his classic, Oscar-nominated title song, but also making appearances are singer Peter Gabriel and his rhythmic track, "Walk Through The Fire", and guitarist Mike Rutherford, who contributes the pulsating rock of "Making A Big Mistake" (Mike also does a rare lead vocal on the song as well). Also onboard with great songs are Stevie Nicks, Big Country, and Kid Creole & The Coconuts (remember them?). The second half of the album features the instrumental music from the film, performed with great flare by Michel Colombier and veteran guitarist Larry Carlton, including the spooky "The Search," the romantic shades of "For Love Alone," and the manically percussive "Murder Of A Friend." "Against All Odds" is a great soundtrack disc. I highly recommend it to anyone, but I think Genesis fans in particular should take notice of it for the contributions from Phil, Peter, and Mike. (NOTE: Peter Gabriel's song, "Walk Through The Fire," as it appears on the soundtrack album, is great, but it was an even better song when it was released as a single, as it was remixed with a stronger percussion track. I hope the single version of "Walk Through The Fire" will resurface in the near future, either on a Gabriel rarities collection or box set.)
