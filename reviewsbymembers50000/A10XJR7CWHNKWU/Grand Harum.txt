 Coming off the success of their "Live With The Edmonton Symphony Orchestra" album, which hit #5 on the U.S. album chart, as well as a successful tour playing more concerts with full orchestra accompanyment, it was probably preordained that Procol Harum's next album would have a decidedly more orchestral, classical feel to it. And such was 1973's "Grand Hotel." Featuring new guitarist Mick Grabham, "Grand Hotel" is an instant Harum classic. The songs are so musically rich, and the orchestral arrangements perfectly compliment the band note for note. The big, lush title song is one of the group's best-known tunes, and is still a staple in their live repertoire today. Other favorites include the driving "Toujours L'Amour" and "TV Caesar," the lighthearted fun of "A Souvenir Of London" (with drummer B.J. Wilson playing 22 mandolins!), the classic Harum rocker "Bringing Home The Bacon," and the beautiful "For Liquorice John," which singer/pianist Gary Brooker wrote for a late friend. One of their very best releases, "Grand Hotel" is a sparkling Procol Harum album that tastes like a fine wine.
