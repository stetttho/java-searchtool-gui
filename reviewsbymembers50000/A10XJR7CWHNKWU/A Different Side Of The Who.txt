 Following their 1973 double-album rock opera, "Quadrophenia," The Who took a simpler, more down-to-earth approach for their 1975 release, "The Who By Numbers." Often referred to as the Who's "quietest" album (though that IS an exaggeration), "Who By Numbers" still features some awesome Who rockers, but it also has some beautiful, softer tunes, plus some very autobiographical lyrics, mostly from guitarist Pete Townshend. It's the Who's most introspective album, and it's a great album, too. All of the songs are outstanding, such as the shuffling piano rock of "Slip Kid," the banjo fun of the hit single "Squeeze Box," bassist John Entwistle's rock star tale of "Success Story," and the powerful "Dreaming From The Waist" and "In A Hand Or A Face." Townshend brilliantly discusses his problems with the bottle in "However Much I Booze," and he also delivers one of the most beautiful songs of his entire career, "Blue Red And Grey," with just his voice & ukelele, and french horn accompanyment by Entwistle. Great performances all around by Townshend, Entwistle, singer Roger Daltrey and drummer Keith Moon. It may not be as highly touted as "Tommy," "Who's Next" or "Quadrophenia," but "The Who By Numbers" is, nevertheless, a very special Who album.
