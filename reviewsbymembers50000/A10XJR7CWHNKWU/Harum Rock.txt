 For their fourth album, 1970's "Home," Procol Harum saw their first major line-up change with the departures of organist Matthew Fisher (relax, though---Matt will return in 21 years!), and bassist David Knights. They're both replaced on "Home" by Chris Copping, a fine organ player & bassist himself. "Home" is one of Harum's greatest albums, with the band cranking up the volume for some of the tracks and just plain rocking out, but they still leave room for some beautiful softer numbers as well. Although some of Keith Reid's lyrics on "Home" are about death, the album is still quite happy-sounding in many places, so to say that this Harum album is depressing is utterly false. Just listen for yourself. The opening salvo, "Whiskey Train," is one of Harum's greatest rockers (and still a part of Harum's concert setlist today), with guitarist Robin Trower attacking his fretboard like a man possessed, and also featuring Gary Brooker's powerful voice and rock piano, and B.J. Wilson's thunderous drumming. Other great songs include the fun "Still They'll Be More," the lovely "Nothing That I Didn't Know," the awesome rocker "About To Die" (a truly underrated Harum gem), the haunting "Barnyard Story," and the drama that is the 7-minute Harum classic, "Whaling Stories." But ALL of the songs here are wonderful. Brooker sings marvelously, and the band play throughout with superb chemistry. "Home" is an outstanding Procol Harum album, and one of their best.
