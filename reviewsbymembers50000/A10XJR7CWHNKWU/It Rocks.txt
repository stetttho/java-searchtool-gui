 A great rockin' movie like "School Of Rock" deserves a great rockin' soundtrack, and such this CD is. Who can say no to an album that has classic tunes by The Who, The Doors, Led Zeppelin, Cream, AND Stevie Nicks? Certainly not me! And, as an added bonus, the two songs by film stars Jack Black & the schoolkids (under their group name, the School Of Rock) are just as awesome. What more needs to be said? If you're a fan of classic rock music, then you've just *gotta* pick up the "School Of Rock" movie soundtrack. And don't forget to pick up the movie on DVD as well---it's a total keeper, just like this excellent soundtrack CD.
