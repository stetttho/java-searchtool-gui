 When it comes to emotion, Paula Cole pulls no punches. Spunky, lyrically & vocally blunt, and with a flair for theatricality (which I'm sure was magnified by her work as Peter Gabriel's backup singer on his "Secret World" tour in the mid-90's), Paula is definitely a woman with a lot of inner fire to spare, especially on her second album, the appropriately-titled "This Fire." This is a scorchingly powerful album, with Paula giving the likes of Tori Amos and Fiona Apple a run for their money. With all of the emotion running wild all throughout the album, Paula still knows to include good hooks and melodies, as on the pair of hits "Where Have All The Cowboys Gone?" and "I Don't Want To Wait." "Tiger" is a fiery number, as Paula drives it home with some awesome banshee wails at the end. "Me" is an achingly beautiful song that should've been a hit. "Feelin' Love" is another catchy tune that could've been a hit on the radio (were it not for the lyric about Paula's...err...chest area), and "Hush Hush Hush" is a great ballad, with fine backing vocals by Peter Gabriel himself. All the while, Paula's take-no-prisoners voice, songwriting, and piano-playing are outstanding.Just one little personal gripe: on Paula's list of "Thank You's" in the album's liner notes, she thanks all sorts of people, except one: Peter Gabriel. Paula, HOW could you possibly forget to give Peter Gabriel, who gave you a stint on his world tour & sang backup on your album, a thank you in your album's liner notes? Shame on you, girl! But let's be realistic, I'm not going to deduct a star off my rating of "This Fire" just for this one personal pet peeve of mine. The album remains a terrific one, and Paula is undoubtedly an amazingly talented artist, and I look forward to hearing more from her in the future. Paula Cole's "This Fire" is a brilliant work, a true "torch" album if there ever was one.
