 After the phenomenal, sultry masterpiece that is "Pure," Golden Palominos drummer/mastermind Anton Fier said bye-bye to singer Lori Carson, and hello to spoken-word artist Nicole Blackman. The resulting album, 1996's "Dead Inside," is a cold, creepy, disturbing blend of Blackman's poetry & verse with Fier's "sound collage" accompanyment. It's a brave 180-degree turn from the Palominos' previous albums, and it certainly starts off promisingly enough with the opening track, "Victim," Blackman's chilling tale of a shooting victim's thoughts just before her life is ended. But the album ultimately gets pulled down by it's own dark weight, as the pitch-blackness of it all becomes really off-putting after a while. Albums like Pink Floyd's "The Wall" & Peter Gabriel's "UP" are also very dark, but at least they're still very TUNEFUL. But "Dead Inside"....would you really, truly want to listen to this ice-cold album more than once? That's very difficult to say.The Golden Palominos are/were known for the different musical directions they would take from album to album, from line-up to line-up (Fier was the only constant member). "Dead Inside" was obviously meant to be yet another musical avenue for the group to travel down, but it just doesn't work. The Golden Palominos have not been heard from again since the release of "Dead Inside," some recent "Best Of" compilations notwithstanding. I'd hate for this album to be the Palominos' final musical statement, as Fier & company have made MUCH better, warmer, friendlier-sounding albums than this one, such as "Pure," "This Is How It Feels," and "A Dead Horse." I'd like to think that they can definitely do it again. Please come back, Anton Fier, wherever you are.
