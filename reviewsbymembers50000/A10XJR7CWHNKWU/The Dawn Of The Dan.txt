 1972's "Can't Buy A Thrill" was the debut album by Steely Dan, and it still remains one of their best. Although the core of the group has always been singer/keyboardist Donald Fagen & bassist/guitarist Walter Becker, they surrounded themselves on the first album with a proper band, including guitarists Denny Dias and Jeff "Skunk" Baxter, drummer/singer Jim Hodder, and singer David Palmer, giving "Can't Buy A Thrill" a more rocking feel to it than later albums. Every song here, from the instant Dan classics "Do It Again" & "Reelin' In The Years," to the equally-irresistable melodies of "Only A Fool Would Say That," "Change Of The Guard," "Brooklyn," and ALL the rest, is a brilliant composition, showing off the group's expert musical chops, lyrical acid wit, and the cool vocal stylings of Fagen (with guest cameos by Hodder and Palmer on "Midnite Cruiser" and "Dirty Work," respectively, as Fagen wasn't too confident about his singing voice just yet, though he needn't have worried!).Steely Dan would crank out several more outstanding albums in the years ahead, but they couldn't have asked for a better debut. "Can't Buy A Thrill" is a classic album all the way! There's no better place to start your Steely Dan collection than here. :-)
