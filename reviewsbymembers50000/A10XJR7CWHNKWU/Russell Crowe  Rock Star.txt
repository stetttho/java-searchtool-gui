 When Oscar-winning actor Russell Crowe isn't doing movies, he sings & plays in a rock band called 30 Odd Foot Of Grunts. And the amazing thing is, he's actually GOOD! His album with the Grunts, "Bastard Life Or Clarity," is a strong collection of rockers and lighter acoustic stuff. I put this CD on for my co-workers the other day, and ALL of them were very impressed with Crowe's musical talents (especially the ladies, who are all now scrambling for a copy themselves!). Crowe's already proven himself a fine actor, but who knew the guy could also sing, write, and play guitar so well? No doubt about it, this ain't no William Shatner album.The one thing that struck everybody at my workplace was how Crowe's singing voice has an uncanny resemblance to Elvis Costello (albeit a deeper-voiced Costello). His vocal delivery is quite smooth, and his guitar playing is firm (no flashy guitar solos, really, just good and steady playing). And, by gum, Crowe can also write! His songs (some co-written with other band members) show that Crowe also has a good flare for melody and tunefulness, as well as intriguing lyrics. And while Crowe is most certainly the star of the band, the rest of the five-man group are just as strong on their own instruments to back him up.With Crowe's hugely successful film-career in total overdrive at the moment, it's anybody's guess if he'll ever get around to doing another album with 30 Odd Foot Of Grunts, let alone find the time to promote THIS one. But one thing is quite certain: Russell Crowe CAN have a successful second career in music if he pursues it far enough. He's definitely got the talent for it. "Bastard Life Or Clarity" is quite a musical discovery, a very good album by a very good rock band, led by a very talented man who really CAN do it all. Spread the word!
