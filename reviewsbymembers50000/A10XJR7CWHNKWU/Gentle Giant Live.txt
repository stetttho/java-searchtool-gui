 Gentle Giant's 1977 release, "Playing The Fool," is a double-live set (though, at 78 minutes, it thankfully squeezes onto a single CD!). It's a great live document of the group, showing off the band's tight musicianship and knack for experimentation (such as those giddy-sounding flutes on "Excerpts From Octopus" and the amazing performance on vibes during "Funny Ways," not to mention John Weathers' outstanding drum solo on "So Sincere"). Gentle Giant's odd time signatures, vocals & arrangements may be an acquired taste, but these guys were a great, very unique group, and "Playing The Fool" is a very solid live set. If you're a newer Gentle Giant fan who never got to see them live (like myself), then this album is the closest thing you'll get to experiencing the group in concert, while for longtime fans who *were* fortunate enough to attend the gigs all those years ago, "Playing The Fool" serves as a great slice of nostalgia.
