 1973's "Electric Light Orchestra II" was ELO's second album, and their first with singer/songwriter/guitarist Jeff Lynne firmly at the helm (after the departure of Roy Wood). The album is very good but a bit uneven, as it shows Lynne & the band still finding their way musically, with their trademark classical prog-rock still in the development stages, waiting to be fully flowered on their third album, "On The Third Day." Comprising of five long songs, there are three that definitely stick out: "Mama" is a beautiful, luscious tune, one of Jeff Lynne's greatest compositions. Then, of course, there's the band's amazing 8 minute treatment of Chuck Berry's "Roll Over Beethoven," complete with musical cameos from Beethoven himself. And finally, there's "Kuiama," an impressive 11 1/2 minute piece of melodic prog rock. The other two songs don't fare as well: "In Old England Town" sounds a bit ragged (and so does Jeff's vocals on it), and "From The Sun To The World" has it's bright moments, but doesn't gel too well as a whole. But hey, three out of five ain't bad. ELO still had some musical growth to do, but this album showed beyond a doubt that Jeff Lynne & company had the potential for bigger things, as time would definitely prove. "Electric Light Orchestra II" is not a perfect ELO album, but when it's good, it's darn good, and "Mama" alone is worth the price of admission.
