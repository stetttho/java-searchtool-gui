 I'm astonished by some of the negative reviews for Roger Hodgson's 2nd solo album, 1987's "Hai Hai." I guess some fans feel that Hodgson should stay in his "serious rock" box and never come out. Hey, I love the dramatic, emotional side to Roger's music, but there's nothing wrong with a "serious" music artist cutting loose every so often. To MY ears, this is Roger's solo masterpiece. After the serious tone of his solo debut, "In The Eye Of The Storm," Roger decided to loosen up & make an album that was lighter, poppier and more rockin', and just plain fun. I think he succeeded brilliantly. The songs on "Hai Hai" are wonderfully catchy and upbeat, and any one of these songs could've been big hits for Roger if only they'd had the right push at radio. Favorites include the dirty rock of "My Magazine," the poppy "You Make Me Love You," the powerful pop-rock of the title song, the dreamy "Desert Love," the charming "Land Ho" (an old 1974 song Hodgson co-wrote with his Supertramp partner Rick Davies that was never issued on any 'Tramp album), and the beautiful album closer, "Puppet Dance." Yes, the album has a late-80's polish to it's production, but it works.It's very unfortunate that "Hai Hai" is currently out-of-print in the States, but it's *totally* worth getting on import. "Hai Hai" is an outstanding Roger Hodgson album, and his best solo release to date.
