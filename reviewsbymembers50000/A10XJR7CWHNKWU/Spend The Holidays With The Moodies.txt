 As you can probably guess, the Moody Blues' latest release, "December," is a Christmas album, and it's a great one at that. The Moodies serve up five original Christmas songs and six covers of Christmas classics, all played & sung quite wonderfully. The original songs---Justin Hayward's "Don't Need A Reindeer," "December Snow" and "Yes I Believe," and John Lodge's "On This Christmas Day" and "The Spirit Of Christmas," are so good that you wish the band would've done an album of ALL original Christmas tunes! Still, the cover songs are all rendered with great care, too, including a charming soft rock treatment of "White Christmas," and the beautiful "When A Child Is Born" and "In The Bleak Midwinter." The Moodies' cover of John Lennon's "Happy Xmas (War Is Over)" is a little curious on the first listen, as the band omit the closing "War is over/If you want it" verse, but maybe that's because of the current state of the world, as war is *not* really over at this time of year, so it's very understandable.Regretfully, "December" is the first Moody Blues album without singer/flautist Ray Thomas, who recently retired from the band. Though Ray is certainly missed, his flute duties have been taken up by a lady named Norda Mullen, and she steps in for Ray just fine with some lovely flute decorations on several tracks. With "December," Justin, John, and drummer Graeme Edge continue to keep the Moody Blues flag flying, and they have also crafted an excellent, joyful album for the holidays. Pick up "December," and have a very merry Christmas with the Moodies.
