 I remember the British duo Go West from their videos on MTV in the mid-80's. I remember watching the clip for "We Close Our Eyes," which featured lead singer Peter Cox swinging a sledgehammer as he sang (at least, I think it was a sledgehammer), with these weird animated figures dancing behind him, while Cox's partner Richard Drummie popped in every so often with a guitar. Although they only made three albums, and seemed to have disbanded for good after 1992, Go West definitely had some catchy tunes. Their self-titled debut from 1985 is a great album of first-rate 80's pop. Great finger-snapping numbers throughout, including such Go West classics as "We Close Our Eyes," "Don't Look Down" and "Call Me," and other uptempo winners like "S.O.S." and "Goodbye Girl." Peter Cox's voice is excellent, and the album's production is energetic (love those keyboards, too!). If you love 80's pop, then Go West is definitely a group for you to check out. Go, Go West!
