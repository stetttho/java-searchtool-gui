 1994's "Voodoo Lounge" still remains one of the Rolling Stones' best later-period albums. With bassist Darryl Jones stepping in for the recently-departed Bill Wyman, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and the lads deliver a great platter of rock 'n' roll containing some of their best material since "Undercover." "Love Is Strong" is an instant Stones classic, and more great rockers follow such as "You Got Me Rocking," "Sparks Will Fly," "I Go Wild," and the funky "Suck On The Jugular." "Brand New Car" and "Moon Is Up" are also great fun, "Out Of Tears" is one of the Stones' greatest ballads in a long time, and "Blinded By Rainbows" is also very nice. Mick's voice is still strong and distinctive, and kudos also go to Richards for his fine vocal duties on "The Worst" and "Thru And Thru." Richards and Ronnie Wood serve up some classy guitar licks throughout, and Charlie Watts is still a slammin' drummer to be reckoned with. These veteran rock warhorses sound totally inspired on this one: "Voodoo Lounge" is an excellent Stones album. Rock on, guys!
