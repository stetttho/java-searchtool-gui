 Cathy Dennis' third---but hopefully not final---album, 1996's "Am I The Kinda Girl?", finds Cathy stepping away from drum machines & disco beats and embracing pop music with more emphasis on guitars and real drums. Fans of her first pair of albums needn't worry, 'cause the end result works magnificently. Once again, Cathy demonstrates that she is the definitive pop star who can do it all: write, sing, play, produce, AND look gorgeous. Co-producing with Mark Saunders, Cathy delivers another brilliant pop disc. No bad songs anywhere: "West End Pad" and "Fickle" are great fun, "When Dreams Turn To Dust" and "Stupid Fool" are both beautiful songs, the title song is a fun pop-rocker that Cathy co-wrote with XTC's Andy Partridge, and "Homing The Rocket" is delicious pop. But wait, there's more! "That Is Why You Love Me" and Don't Take My Heaven" are both breezy numbers, Cathy sings a marvelous cover of the Kinks' "Waterloo Sunset," and then, there's the appealing popper, "The Date," co-written with none other than Kinks leader Ray Davies himself. Finally, Cathy closes the album with the lovely light acoustic pop of "Crazy Ones." And all the while, Cathy's voice...aaaah...pure heaven (and the photos of Cathy inside the CD booklet....wow!).To date, Cathy Dennis has not recorded an album since "Am I The Kinda Girl?". That was eight years ago. These days, Cathy seems to be perfectly content writing songs for other artists. But I hope & pray that Cathy will one day return to recording herself. I hate to sound like a broken record, but as I've said in my reviews of her other records, Cathy Dennis is the Queen Of Pop. It's nice that she's writing for other artists, but she really should be writing for herself again. Cathy, I love you, and I miss you. Please come back to making albums! In the meantime, "Am I The Kinda Girl?" is a brilliant album for Cathy to close out the first chapter of her recording career with, and I eagerly await for her return. :-)
