 I LOVE this CD! In celebration of the 40th anniversary of the movie "The Pink Panther," MGM has released this special lounge compilation CD, "Pink Panther's Penthouse Party," featuring Henry Mancini's original "Pink Panther Theme," plus several groovy remixes of the theme, and lots of killer, catchy lounge tracks to party with or chill out to. Not a single bad track anywhere! My personal faves include the Fischerspooner mix of the "Pink Panther Theme," Titan's "Corazon," the Pizzicato Five's take on "The Girl From Ipanema," "Summer Sun" by Koop, Kinky's "San Antonio," and an absolutely *fantastic* remix of Peggy Lee's "Fever" that'll knock your socks off. My head just can't stop bobbing along to this disc, and I can't recommend it to you enough---"Pink Panther's Penthouse Party" is totally fly. Put it on, and party with the panther all night long!
