 With the sudden, tragic death of Who bassist John Entwistle on June 27, I pulled out this album, The Who's debut disc from 1965, and played it in tribute to the late, great Ox (and I definitely plan to play more Who albums from my collection in the days ahead as well). The only Who album to unfortunately NOT get remastered yet (apparently due to producer Shel Talmy having a long-standing dispute with the band to this day), "The Who Sings My Generation" is vintage, classic Who that presents the band in all of their early Mod glory: Roger Daltrey's great voice, Pete Townshend's expert songwriting & ferocious guitar playing, John Entwistle's monstrous bass, and Keith Moon's unique smashing of the drumkit, it's all here. Classic Who songs are everywhere: "My Generation," "The Kids Are Alright," "La La La Lies," "Circles" (featuring John on french horn!), "A Legal Matter" (with a fine debut lead vocal from Pete), "Much Too Much," and the Entwistle/Moon power showcase, "The Ox." "The Good's Gone" is a terrific Who rocker, a true buried treasure from the band, and their covers of James Brown's "I Don't Mind" and "Please Please Please" are great fun.Like their contemporaries The Beatles, The Who would definitely expand their musical horizons and greatly mature as a band in the years that would follow, but they had to start somewhere, and what a fabulous start, too: "The Who Sings My Generation" is an essential rock album, capturing The Who at their most raw in 1965 when Mod was God to so many youths of the day. A classic Who album in every sense of the word. Farewell John, and say Hi to Keith for us. Long Live The Who. :-)
