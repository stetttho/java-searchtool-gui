 Steve Winwood, Jim Capaldi, Chris Wood & the gang serve up another barnburning Traffic set with 1973's "Shoot Out At The Fantasy Factory." The title track is a phenomenal full-throttle rocker, one of Traffic's most powerful pieces. "Roll Right Stones" is a nearly 12-minute, laid-back jazz-popper, with great melodies & musicianship throughout. "Evening Blue" is a beautiful ballad, Chris Wood's "Tragic Magic" is a tasty, funky instrumental, and "(Sometimes I Feel So) Uninspired," despite the downbeat title, is actually a very uplifting tune, filled with great spirit & fine words of wisdom. Steve Winwood & company totally cook on this one: "Shoot Out At The Fantasy Factory" is another jazz/rock classic from Traffic.
