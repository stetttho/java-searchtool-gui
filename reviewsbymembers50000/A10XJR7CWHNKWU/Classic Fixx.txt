 The Fixx hit the commercial jackpot with their 2nd album, 1983's "Reach The Beach," which remains to this day the group's biggest seller, and it also features their big signature hit, "One Thing Leads To Another," which reached #4 on the U.S. singles chart. It's an outstanding disc of dramatic, atmospheric pop/rock. Besides "One Thing Leads To Another," the album contains other Fixx favorites such as "Saved By Zero" (a Top 20 hit), "Sign Of Fire," "Opinions," the title song, "Liner," and "Outside." Great songs, killer hooks, and the commanding voice of Cy Curnin all add up to a winning platter of 80's rock. "Reach The Beach" is a definitive Fixx classic.
