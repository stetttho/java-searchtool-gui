 King Crimson's 1969 debut album, "In The Court Of The Crimson King," remains an all-time progressive rock classic. The very first line-up of the band, including master guitarist Robert Fripp, bassist/vocalist Greg Lake (later to join Emerson Lake & Palmer), and keyboardist/flautist Ian McDonald created a bold, daring rock album that practically laid down the blueprint for all progressive rock bands to follow. It's music is at times fierce & ferocious (the band's signature freak-out, "21st Century Schizoid Man"), while at other times dramatic ("Epitaph" & the title song), and hauntingly beautiful ("I Talk To The Wind" and "Moonchild"), with a good deal of studio experimentation tossed in for extra measure (such as the lengthy instrumental section of "Moonchild"---it may try some listeners' patience at first, but it really is quite lovely, with the band making musical beauty out of the sparest of notes). King Crimson are progressive rock pioneers, who, 34 years later, and having endured various line-up changes along the way, are still going strong, continuing to make brilliant, sophisticated music to this day. But if "In The Court Of The Crimson King" had been their only album, King Crimson still would've carved a very special place for themselves in the history of rock with this legendary masterwork.
