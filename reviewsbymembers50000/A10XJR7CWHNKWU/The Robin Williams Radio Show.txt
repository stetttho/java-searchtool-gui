 This is the excellent soundtrack album to the film, "Good Morning Vietnam," interspersing classic tunes from the 60's by Martha & The Vandellas, The Beach Boys, James Brown, Them (w/ Van Morisson), Louis Armstrong and others, with comedy schtick by Robin Williams' DJ character, Adrian Cronauer, taken directly from the film, so listening to the album is like listening to "The Robin Williams 60's Flashback Radio Show," so to speak. The CD's very brisk running time of 35 minutes leaves you hungry for more, and Williams' aggressive comedy approach is more likely to just make you smile rather than double over laughing, but nonetheless, the "Good Morning Vietnam" movie soundtrack is a whole lot of fun, and especially a great disc to play during those hot summer days. :-)
