 Canadian singer/songwriter/multi-instrumentalist Loreena McKennitt is a brilliantly talented woman, with a gorgeous, angelic voice that simply soars into the heavens. Her 1992 release, "The Visit," is my personal favorite from Loreena, and it also sits on my Top 40 list of all-time favorite albums by anyone. Whether performing her own compositions or covering traditional songs, Loreena McKennitt has that great gift of casting a magical spell over the listener with her blend of celtic/folk/world music, and, once again, her wonderful voice. "The Visit" is a brilliant album, with such supreme cuts as "All Soul's Night," the brilliant tale "The Lady Of Shalott" (a 19th century poem by Alfred Lord Tennyson that Loreena set to music), "Courtyard Lullaby," "The Old Ways," the beautiful instrumentals "Between The Shadows" and "Tango To Evora," and the lovely finale, "Cymbeline" (with lyrics by Shakespeare). Loreena's performances are stunning, as is the album's production. What more can I say---Loreena McKennitt's "The Visit" is a magnificent, magical album. Put it on, and let Loreena sweep you away.
