 There's really nothing I can add about The Flaming Lips' outstanding album from 1999, "The Soft Bulletin," that hasn't already been covered by other reviewers, so I'll just make it brief: this album is absolutely brilliant. I don't know how Lips leader Wayne Coyne & his co-horts Steven Drozd and Michael Ivans come up with this wonderful music, but I guess that's genius for you! "The Soft Bulletin" is a deliriously giddy hybrid of rock, pop & psychedelia. It's catchy & clever, and played, sung, arranged & produced with full-throttle power and passion. Who knew that songs about superheroes and spiderbites could be this good? The Flaming Lips have been around for years but are only now just beginning to get the wide respect & reception that they so rightfully deserve, and I say it's about time! "The Soft Bulletin" is simply a mindblower. Buy it now! And while you're at it, buy the Lips' follow-up masterpiece from 2002, "Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots"! I can't wait to hear what these guys will come up with next....stay tuned!
