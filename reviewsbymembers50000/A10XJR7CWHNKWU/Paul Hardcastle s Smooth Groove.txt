 Paul Hardcastle delivers another classic smooth jazz CD with "Jazzmasters II," the 2nd album in Paul's "Jazzmasters" series, and yet another winning collaboration with vocalist and co-songwriter Helen Rogers. As usual, Hardcastle brilliantly plays most of the instruments himself, while Rogers is his perfect, soulful voice. The duo offer one slammin' song after another, such as "Do You Remember," "Summer Rain," "So Much In Love," and "Can You Hear Me?". And no Paul Hardcastle album would be complete without some grrrroovy instrumentals, and Paul gives you plenty on "Jazzmasters II," including his radio classic "Walkin' To Freedom," the appropriately-titled "Smooth Groove," "Slomotion," and "Time To Move On." When it comes to jazz music that's smooth, snappy, and seductive all in one shot, NOBODY beats Paul Hardcastle. But nobody! "Jazzmasters II" is simply outstanding.
