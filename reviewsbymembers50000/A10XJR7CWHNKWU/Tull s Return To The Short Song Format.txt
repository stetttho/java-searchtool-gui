 After making two one-song albums in a row, "Thick As A Brick" and "A Passion Play," and, as brilliant as both of those albums are, it was only inevitable that Jethro Tull would return to the short song format--apparently for good--with their next release, 1974's "Warchild." As Ian Anderson says in the new CD liner notes, the songs on "Warchild" are "whimsical, lighter in subject matter, and, above all, short!". The album contains many Tull favorites, such as "Skating Away On The Thin Ice Of The New Day" and "Bungle In The Jungle" (a U.S. top 20 hit), as well as the title song, "Back-Door Angels," "Sealion," and "Two Fingers," a re-recording of an older, obscure Tull song, "Lick Your Fingers Clean." Also, this new remastered version of "Warchild" not only has improved sound quality, but also contains a generous seven bonus tracks, including the excellent "Paradise Steakhouse" and "Glory Row," as well as a pair of charming instrumentals, "Warchild Waltz" (an orchestral piece), and "Quartet." Ian & the boys sound great on this one, the songs are strong, and the band's performances and Ian's vocals very sharp. You can't go wrong getting this disc: "Warchild" is a fine Jethro Tull classic.
