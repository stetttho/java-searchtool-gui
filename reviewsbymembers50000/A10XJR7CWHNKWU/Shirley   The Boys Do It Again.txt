 Garbage deliver more terrific euro-trash rock on their second album, 1998's "Version 2.0". Another mix of crunching guitars, wild beats, groovy keyboards & effects, and the sensual voice of Shirley Manson, the band are still the frontrunners of modern rock, with such great, rockin' tracks as "Temptation Waits," "I Think I'm Paranoid," "Push It," and my personal fave, "Sleep Together." There's also playful pop-rock with "Special" (with Shirley tipping her hat to the Pretenders' Chrissie Hynde at the end), the delirious "Hammering In My Head," and the truly gorgeous "You Look So Fine." Fabulous music & production from a fabulous band, "Version 2.0" is essential Garbage.
