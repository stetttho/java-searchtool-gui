 The Swedish rock band Whale came about purely by accident in 1994, when a trio of friends, including singer Cia Berg, recorded the deliriously insane rocker, "Hobo Humpin' Slobo Babe," purely for fun. But the song caught on, and so did the wild music video that accompanied it, so Whale went on to make a full-length album, 1995's "We Care." This is one of my all-time favorite discs---a wild, wacky, exuberantly nutty rock album with bonecrunching guitars, super-slamming drums, uber-fat basslines, and Cia Berg's sultry voice, not to mention the great helpings of humour and sexual innuendo in the lyrics, and off-the-wall production & effects. In short: Whale are an awesome band (or should I say *were* an awesome band; I'll come to that in a moment). "Slobo Babe" put the group on the map, and you haven't really lived until you've heard this crazy little sucker of a track, but every song on this disc is a mindblower. Thrilling, outrageous rockers joining "Slobo Babe" include "That's Where It's At," "Pay For Me," "Eurodog," "I'll Do Ya," "I Miss Me," and "Born To Raise Hell." The band even have a breezy little acoustic number, "Kickin'," to kick things off (no pun intended), and the spacey cocktail lounge production of "I'm Cold." ALL terrific stuff.Sadly, Whale appear to be no more. They released a second album in 1998, "All Disco Dance Must End In Broken Bones," but they have not been heard from since, and their official website no longer responds, which is not a good sign. A terrible shame, because this band was simply phenomenal. Maybe they were TOO good, and they flamed out early. Who knows? But even if we never hear from Whale again, they've definitely earned a very special place in my music collection. "We Care" is quite possibly the most insane rock album ever recorded. It's a modern rock masterpiece, no question about it. Long live the mighty Whale!
