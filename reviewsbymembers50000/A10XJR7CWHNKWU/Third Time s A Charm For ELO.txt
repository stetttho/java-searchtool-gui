 With their third album, 1973's "On The Third Day," the Electric Light Orchestra continued to evolve into a terrific symphonic rock group. Although their first two albums certainly have their share of gems, "On The Third Day" is, in my opinion, the band's first truly good album, with Jeff Lynne & company finally hitting their stride. Wonderful ELO tunes on this one: the classic hits "Showdown" and "Ma Ma Ma Belle," as well as other fine prog-poppers like "Ocean Breakup/King Of The Universe," the instrumental "Daybreaker," the excellent "Dreaming Of 4000," and an awesome re-working of the classical favorite, "The Hall Of The Mountain King." Great melodies, production, performances, and strong lead vocals by Lynne combine into a masterful ELO disc. With "On The Third Day," the Electric Light Orchestra were finally on their way, and their music would only get better. A highly-recommended ELO album.
