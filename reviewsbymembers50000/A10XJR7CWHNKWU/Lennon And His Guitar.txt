 The latest John Lennon release, "Acoustic," is just that, a collection of rare demos and live performances that feature just John and his acoustic guitar, compiled by his widow, Yoko Ono. The sound quality of the tracks varies from good to average, but Lennon's performances throughout are wonderful (though a few run a little too short---"Woman Is The Nigger Of The World" is a mere 42 seconds in length). The stuff that really stands out for me here is the haunting "Working Class Hero" and "Look At Me," a scorching acoustic rendition of "Cold Turkey," the live performances of "Luck Of The Irish" and "John Sinclair" (the former featuring Yoko on co-lead vocals), and fine renditions of "Watching The Wheels" and "Real Love," the latter of which was later augmented by the surviving Beatles for the "Anthology 2" set. But without question, the very best track on the album is Lennon's exquisitely beautiful guitar treatment of "Imagine," recorded live at the Apollo Theater in 1971. The album is worth owning just for this live gem alone, but all the way around, "Acoustic" is a great, heartfelt collection of the immortal John Lennon unplugged.
