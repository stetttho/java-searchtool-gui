 By the time 1971 came around, The Association weren't having hits or selling very much records anymore, and key member Russ Giguere had recently departed, being replaced by Richard Thompson. But "Stop Your Motor," while not being the band's masterpiece, still showed that the band were still making great music together. "Bring Yourself Home," "Funny Kind Of Song," "Along The Way," and the band's improved re-recording of "It's Gotta Be Real" (originally from the film "Goodbye Columbus") are all classic Association tunes, and Terry Kirkman's "That's Racin'," a tongue-in-cheek country-western tale of auto racing, is a fun novelty song. After "Stop Your Motor," The Association had only one more album left to do (1972's "Waterbeds In Trinidad"), but musically, they were still racin'. :-)
