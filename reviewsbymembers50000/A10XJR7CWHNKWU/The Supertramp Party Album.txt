 It's back in print! Hooray! After being MIA from record shops for several years, Supertramp's 1987 album, "Free As A Bird," has been re-issued & re-mastered, for which Tramp fans, especially those who missed the album the first time around, can be grateful. "Free As A Bird" barely made a dent on the album charts 15 years ago, and the band couldn't even tour for it in North America, but it's a great album all the same. After the serious tone of 1985's "Brother Where You Bound," Rick Davies & company decided for the follow-up album to lighten things up and have fun. "Free As A Bird" is a very catchy, upbeat, sometimes dance-oriented Tramp album that's perfect to play at a party, or cruise down the highway to. Songs like "It's Alright" & "I'm Beggin' You" will get you on the dancefloor in no time. The title song, a minor hit, is a Supertramp concert staple, with a great sing-along chorus. And there's more great jazz/pop from the band in tracks like "Not The Moment," "Thing For You," and the calypso-influenced finale, "An Awful Thing To Waste."After "Free As A Bird," Supertramp took a whole decade off before resuming work with 1997's "Some Things Never Change," and the "Free As A Bird" album itself went out of print for several years. But now that it's back, DON'T miss out. "Free As A Bird" is Supertramp at their most fun, and a great buried treasure from this great band. :-)
