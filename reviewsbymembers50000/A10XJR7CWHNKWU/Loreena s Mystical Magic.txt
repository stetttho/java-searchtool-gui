 "The Mask And Mirror" was the album that made me a Loreena McKennitt fan. It's a very beautiful, entrancing album that instantly sweeps you off to a far-away land. When the album came out back in 1994, I heard it playing in a music shop, and I was instantly taken by the album's feel, it's rhythms, it's expertly crafted arrangements and sounds, and, of course, Loreena McKennitt's soaring, magnficent voice. Inspired by a personal trip she took to Spain, "The Mask And Mirror" is a pure feast for the ears, with Loreena blending memorable melodies with powerful elements of world music and new age to brilliant effect. All eight of the album's tracks are sparkling gems, but of special mention are the opening "The Mystic's Dream" (which instantly sets the album's mystical mood), the lovely, pop-meets-world hybrid "The Bonny Swans," the atmospheric "Marrakesh Night Market," and the soaring rhythms of "Santiago." But from beginning to end, Loreena simply and effortlessly enchants the listener with her heavenly voice and her skillful piano and accordion-playing. The album's production is very handsome, and Loreena & her world-class team of session players deliver outstanding performances. "The Mask And Mirror" is a wonderful introduction to the wonderful music of Loreena McKennitt. I highly recommend it!
