 With over a decade of music behind them, it was time for Enigma to put out a greatest hits retrospective. "Love, Sensuality, Devotion: The Greatest Hits"---or "LSD" for short---covers the first four albums from 1990 to 2000 by this brilliant, ambient studio group fronted by Michael Cretu. It's a terrific collection, with many classic Enigma tracks that seamlessly blend into one another for over 76 minutes of continuous, breathtaking music. Naturally, Enigma's two big hit singles, "Sadeness Part 1" and "Return To Innocence" are included, plus other Enigma favorites like "Mea Culpa," "Push The Limits," "Gravity Of Love," "Age Of Loneliness," "Beyond The Invisible," and the thrilling "I Love You...I'll Kill You." As an extra bonus, there are two new tracks: the brief intro "The Landing," and the song "Turn Around," an excellent tune featuring a more streamlined Enigma sound that points the way to the group's next album, 2003's "Voyageur." And if that wasn't enough, a pair of tracks, "TNT For The Brain" and "Principles Of Lust," have been slightly re-mixed for this collection, giving both songs a somewhat different but no-less-powerful feel. Even if you already own all of Enigma's studio albums, "LSD" is still worth picking up for (A) the pair of new tracks, (B) the pair of re-mixed songs, and (C) the generously long playing time of over 76 minutes. And, of course, "LSD" is a perfect introductory album for any newcomer to the wonderful music of Enigma who wants to hear a healthy sampling from the group's albums on a single disc. Either way, "Love, Sensuality, Devotion" is a must-buy Enigma album for your collection.
