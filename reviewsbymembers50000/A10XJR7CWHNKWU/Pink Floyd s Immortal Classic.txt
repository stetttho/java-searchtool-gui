 My goodness, dear reader, do you really NEED convincing by us, the Amazon.com reviewers, on why you should buy Pink Floyd's immortal classic, "Dark Side Of The Moon"? I mean, really...(*laughs*)...relax, I'm just playing with you. Well, what can be said about this legendary rock album that hasn't already been said a zillion times before? This album is Pink Floyd's "Sgt. Pepper," an undisputed every-home-should-have-one masterpiece. To make a long review short, you should buy "Dark Side Of The Moon" because: a) it's music, combining the band's sharp songwriting, outstanding musical chemistry, and impressive in-the-studio skills, is fantastic, b) it's timeless theme about all the things in life that can drive us mad---money, mortality, time (or lack of), war, etc., is pure genius, c) the clever lyrics by Roger Waters REALLY hit home, d) it's unsurpassed production & sound effects make it without question THE album to test your new stereo equipment with, and e) although I've never tried it myself, it's widely reputed to be a GREAT soundtrack album for....er, intimate encounters (especially while playing "The Great Gig In The Sky"---it's supposed to be really cool, man). And yes, you can also have fun with it while watching "The Wizard Of Oz" (start the album on the *third* lion roar, kids!).So, now you know why you have to buy Pink Floyd's "Dark Side Of The Moon." :-)
