 An instant classic, 1977's "I Robot" was the first big commercial breakthrough for The Alan Parsons Project. A themed album about Man's relation to machines & vice versa, it's a winning combination of both the Project's art-rock & pop sensibilities, and, being released in 1977, it even has a great *disco* feel to some of the tracks, like the funky hit "I Wouldn't Want To Be Like You," "The Voice," and the marvelous instrumental title track. More incredible music continues on other fine tracks like "Some Other Time," "Don't Let It Show," and the beautiful "Day After Day (The Show Must Go On)." And there's more great instrumental pieces in the breathtaking "Nucleus," the ominous "Total Eclipse," and the powerful "Genesis Ch.1 V.32." Great vocals abound from the likes of Allan Clarke, Steve Harley, Lenny Zakatek, the English Chorale & others, the songwriting by Parsons & Eric Woolfson is solid, and the group's musical chemistry is nothing short of supreme. The album's production work is simply amazing, and Andrew Powell's impressive orchestrations are the icing on the cake. One of the best recorded unions of prog & pop, the Alan Parsons Project's "I Robot" is an astonishing work.
