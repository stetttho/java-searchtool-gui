 "Led Zeppelin II" rocks! There, that's my review. But I'm sure that you, dear reader, would like something a little more descriptive than that, so here goes....this is Led Zeppelin's second album from 1969, and it's also one of their best. It's got their all-time classic "Whole Lotta Love" on it (their biggest charting single ever), and other powerful FM staples like "What Is And What Should Never Be," "The Lemon Song" (with the juice running down Robert Plant's leg), the beautiful "Thank You," "Heartbreaker," "Living Loving Maid," "Ramble On" (with it's clever lyrical nod to J.R.R. Tolkien's "Lord Of The Rings"), drummer John Bonham's signature workout on the skins, "Moby Dick," and the blues rock that is "Bring It On Home." "Led Zeppelin II" has all the trademarks of this legendary band: Jimmy Page's awesome guitarwork & studio effects, Robert Plant's siren cries, wails, shrieks, and other assorted rock vocalising, John Paul Jones' mondo-big bass & organ decorations, and John Bonham beating his drumkit into submission as only Bonham could. "Led Zeppelin II" is definitely one of Zeppelin's greatest albums, and one of rock's greatest albums, too. Those heavy metal wanna-be bands don't even come close to these guys.
