 The Electric Light Orchestra's 1974 album, "Eldorado," is a true classic, and arguably the album where ELO's orchestral arrangements work their absolute best. This is symphonic rock of the highest order! "Eldorado" is also a concept album, about the adventures of several characters in the land of dreams known as Eldorado, featuring as many colorful characters as ELO leader Jeff Lynne could devise. Outstanding pop-rockers with equally-outstanding orchestral decorations populate "Eldorado," such as the classic "Can't Get It Out Of My Head," the delicious pop of "Boy Blue," the totally funky "Laredo Tornado," and other excellent songs like "Mister Kingdom," the slinky shuffler "Nobody's Child," and the rockin' "Illusions In G Major." Jeff Lynne's songwriting is strong & cohesive (and so is his singing and guitar-playing), the band's performances are first rate, and the production is very handsome. "Eldorado" is without question one of ELO's finest achievements ever. So pick it up, and have a magical time in ELO's magical land of dreams, "high on a hill in Eldorado."
