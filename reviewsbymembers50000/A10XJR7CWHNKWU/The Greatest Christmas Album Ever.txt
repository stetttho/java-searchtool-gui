 When it comes to Christmas albums, Vince Guaraldi's soundtrack to "A Charlie Brown Christmas" is IT. This CD gets played in my house every holiday season, and I've never tired of it. It's true that listening to this Christmas classic will take you back to your childhood, with images of the classic 1965 cartoon & it's characters playing in your head (especially during the Peanuts signature instrumental, "Linus And Lucy"). But more than that, Vince Guaraldi's music is just plain wonderful, bouncy & nice. Whether doing marvelous light-jazz rearrangements of "O Tannenbaum," "What Child Is This," or "Greensleeves," or serving up his own classic compositions, not only "Linus And Lucy" but also "Christmas Time Is Here," "Skating," and "Christmas Is Coming," Guaraldi simply amazes with his sparkling touch of the piano keys. Filled with tremendous, glowing warmth, Vince Guaraldi's "A Charlie Brown Christmas" is, in my book, the greatest Christmas album of all-time. It's a definite must-buy addition to your holiday music collection, and a Christmas album to treasure forever.
