 The ambient studio collective known as Enigma have returned with their fifth studio album, "Voyageur," and, in my opinion, this is their best album since their classic debut, "MCMXC A.D.", 13 years ago. For "Voyageur," group mastermind Michael Cretu said that he wanted Enigma to branch out a bit, so this is the first Enigma album to contain absolutely no samples, i.e. no gregorian chants, no Orff operas, etc., etc. (although Cretu does allow the group's signature horn intro that kicks off every Enigma album). This time, it's all original sounds, but if you think that Enigma have totally re-written their musical book with their 2003 offering, you needn't worry. Just like their first four albums, "Voyageur" is a glowing, hypnotic Enigma disc with great beats, lush keyboards & arrangements, seductive vocal performances (by Cretu, wife Sandra Cretu, Ruth-Ann from Olive, and Andru Donalds), and dreamy atmosphere. Great, catchy, luscious tracks from start to finish, including "Incognito," "Page Of Cups," "Boum-Boum," "Look Of Today" (with it's clever nod to the old ABC hit, "Look Of Love"), the awesome "In The Shadow, In The Light" (arguably the album's best track), the lovely "The Piano," and "Following The Sun." It's always a pleasure to hear new music from Michael Cretu & company---Enigma's "Voyageur" is simply fantastic.
