 1963's "Please Please Me" was the album that started it all for the world's most beloved band of all-time, The Beatles, and the music world would be forever changed. An outstanding 33 minutes of pure rock 'n' roll fun, the album was recorded in a single day, with John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison & Ringo Starr blasting through their live repertoire of originals & cover songs as quickly as producer George Martin could record them. Lennon/McCartney originals such as "I Saw Her Standing There," "Please Please Me," "Love Me Do," and "Do You Want To Know A Secret" are all immortal Beatles classics, but the group also had the magical gift of making anyone else's song they covered totally their own, such as "Anna (Go To Him)," "Boys" (featuring Ringo's debut lead vocal), "Baby It's You," and, last but definitely not least, the Fab Four's barnburning treatment of "Twist And Shout." Great songs, classic vocals & harmonising, Lennon & Harrison's jangly guitars, McCartney's strong bass-playing, and Ringo's slap-happy drumming, it's all here on "Please Please Me." Has it really been *40 years* since the Fab Four made this classic album? It hasn't aged one bit. I've always wondered what the music world would've been like had the Beatles never come around. Thank God they did with "Please Please Me."
