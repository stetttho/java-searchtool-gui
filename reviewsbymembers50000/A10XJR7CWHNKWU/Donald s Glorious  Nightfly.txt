 Two years after Steely Dan called it a day (well, until their 1993 reunion tour, anyway), Donald Fagen released his first solo album, 1982's "The Nightfly." This is a wonderful album, filled with lots of smooth, upbeat, melodic, toe-tapping tunes that don't stray too far from the classic Steely Dan jazz/pop sound. If you love the Dan, you'll love the Don. Donald's songs are all  winners: the supercool hits "I.G.Y." and "New Frontier," Donald's breezy cover of "Ruby Baby," the cocktail number "Maxine," the punch of "Green Flower Street," the calypso hooks of "The Goodbye Look," the awesome smooth-grooving title song, and the cheerful finger-snappin' conclusion, "Walk Between Raindrops." Donald's work in the singing, songwriting, and playing departments are all top of the line, as is the handsome production by longtime Steely Dan producer, Gary Katz. Whether with the Dan or on his own, Donald Fagen makes brilliant music. "The Nightfly" is a gloriously cool album.
