 Mike Rutherford's 2nd solo album, 1982's "Acting Very Strange," finds the Genesis bassist/guitarist singing lead vocals for the first and *only* time in his recording career. Rutherford says his singing on "Acting Very Strange" was basically a one-shot deal, and, since he doesn't care much for his own singing voice, he will not sing lead on his albums again (he has let Paul Carrack and the late Paul Young sing lead on his subsequent albums with Mike + The Mechanics ever since). But I do think Rutherford is being too hard on himself. His singing, while not brilliant, has a rough, throaty edge to it that serves the rock songs on "Acting Very Strange" just fine. And as for the songs themselves, they're excellent, catchy rockers with great hooks, as Rutherford dishes up some very crafty guitar work throughout. Several of these songs could've easily been big hits: the fun title song, the awesome arena rock of "Maxine," the catchy "Halfway There" (which WAS released as a single but went nowhere), the punchy sing-along "Couldn't Get Arrested," the great groove of "I Don't Wanna Know," and the beautiful ballad, "Hideaway." And I'll say it one more time: Mike Rutherford CAN sing! Mike would hit solo career paydirt with the self-titled album by Mike + The Mechanics in 1985, but "Acting Very Strange" is a solid, excellent solo effort from Mike. Considering that the album is currently out-of-print, grab yourself a used copy while you can!
