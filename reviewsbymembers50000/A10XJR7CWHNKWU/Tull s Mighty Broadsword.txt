 After their controversial "A" album from 1980, Jethro Tull charged into the year 1982 with their outstanding release, "The Broadsword And The Beast." Truly one of the group's very best works, "Broadsword" saw Jethro Tull acquire two new band members in the forms of keyboardist Peter John Vettese and drummer Gerry Conway. Vettese added a more keyboard-heavy, synthesised gloss to Tull's trademark folk-rock, and the combination works amazingly well. "Broadsword" also features some of the best material Tull frontman Ian Anderson had written since 1977's "Songs From The Wood." Lots of Tull goodies on this one, such as the marching rock of "Beastie," the catchy "Fallen On Hard Times" (which the band appropriately released as a single), the anthemic "Broadsword," the fun of "Watching Me Watching You," and the atmospheric punch of "The Clasp" and "Seal Driver." Also, this new remaster of "Broadsword" comes with a very generous helping of *eight* bonus songs all recorded during the sessions for the album, including the Christmas-themed "Jack Frost And The Hooded Crow," the part-ballad/part-rocker "Jack A Lynn," and the excellent "Overhang" and "I Am Your Gun." The album's early-80's production is top-notch, and Jethro Tull themselves sound truly inspired on this set. All the way around, "The Broadsword And The Beast" is a great Tull classic.
