 It's really great to see Tom Jones is still in action after all these years. I saw him in concert a little over a year ago, and he put on one heck of a show. The ladies still throw their panties at him! Very cool."Reload" is a great Tom Jones album. He sounds like he & his singing partners are all having a great time, and the whole fun feel of the album translates very well to the listener. "Burning Down The House" pairs Tom with The Cardigans, and the result is a very catchy version of the old Talking Heads hit. "Sexbomb," an original tune, is one of Tom's most fingerpoppin' best. He & Robbie Williams tear through "Are You Gonna Go My Way" with relish, Tom & Cery's "It's Cold Outside" is a hoot, and the powerful "Motherless Child" is another great showcase for Tom's still-commanding voice. And these are just a few examples of how good this album is!Just one question: "Reload" is a huge hit in Britain and other parts of Europe, so **WHY** can't it get released here in North America? Absolutely puzzling. I'm telling ya, Tom Jones would have hit singles galore lined up & ready for him over here if "Reload" ever gets a U.S. release. In the meantime, buy it on import. It's totally worth it!
