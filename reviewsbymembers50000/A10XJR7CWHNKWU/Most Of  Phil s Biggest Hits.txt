 Phil Collins has had SO many hit singles, that a greatest-hits package was inevitable. "Hits" collects a big 74 minutes-worth of Phil's best-known tunes, such as "In The Air Tonight," "You Can't Hurry Love," "One More Night," "Sussudio," "Take Me Home," and "Another Day In Paradise," to name but a few. The album also collects for the first time Phil's hits from movie soundtracks, such as the smash "Against All Odds," his hit duet with Marilyn Martin, "Separate Lives" (where is Marilyn Martin these days, by the way?), "Groovy Kind Of Love," and "Two Hearts." There's also his hit duet with Philip Bailey, "Easy Lover," AND one brand-new track, a cover of Cyndi Lauper's hit song, "True Colors" (which I happen to like better than Cyndi's original version!). And yet, "Hits" is an incomplete Phil retrospective, as there are a handful of surprising ommissions---"I Missed Again" (which was Phil's very first hit single), "I Don't Care Anymore," "Don't Lose My Number," "Do You Remember," and "Everyday." Obviously, these were left off the album due to lack of space, but still, it's a disappointment. Hopefully, Phil will one day get a proper *2-disc* set of his biggest tunes, which would solve the problem right there. I can see it now---"The Essential Phil Collins"! They could also toss in a few extra goodies, like "Thru These Walls," "Oughta Know By Now," "You'll Be In My Heart," "Can't Stop Loving You," and "Testify." I'm sure it'll happen eventually. For now, though, "Hits," while incomplete, is still a very cool Phil Collins collection.
