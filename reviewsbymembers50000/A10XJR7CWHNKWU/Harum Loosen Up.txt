 Procol Harum's ninth album, appropriately titled "Procol's Ninth," sees Gary Brooker & the boys cutting loose in the studio, aided in the producer's chair by legendary writer/producers Jerry Lieber and Mike Stoller, the men behind Elvis Presley's "Hound Dog" and other classic hit records. This is Procol Harum at their most fun, with such classic tracks as "Pandora's Box," "Fool's Gold," "Typewriter Torment," and a pair of fabulous cover songs: Chuck Jackson's "I Keep Forgetting" and the Beatles' "Eight Days A Week." The band sound superb, and the Lieber/Stoller production a plus. "Procol's Ninth" is terrific Procol Harum.
