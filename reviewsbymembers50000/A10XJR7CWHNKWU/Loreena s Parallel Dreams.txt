 That voice...that harp....pure heaven. Loreena McKennitt's 1989 album "Parallel Dreams" is a very beautiful album, featuring such haunting, atmospheric, magical songs as "Samain Night," "Annachie Gordon," "Ancient Pines," and my personal favorite, "Standing Stones." Once again, Loreena simply casts a spell over the listener, with her goddess-like voice, harp-playing, and musical arrangements. "Parallel Dreams" is an excellent disc.
