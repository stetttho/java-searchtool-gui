 "Led Zeppelin III" finds Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, John Paul Jones & John Bonham mixing softer, folkier songs with their trademark hard rock stuff. Some fans loved the acoustic/electric mix, while others were put off. Personally, I think the blend works great. "Led Zeppelin III" may not be the band's crowning achievement, but nonetheless this is an excellent album. The band shred wallpaper on thunderous tracks like "The Immigrant Song," "Celebration Day," and "Out On The Tiles," while "Since I've Been Loving You" is a long, slinky, tasty blues rocker. Zeppelin also score with the acoustic stuff, too: "Tangerine" and "That's The Way" are both gorgeous songs, "Friends" & "Gallows Pole" are also strong numbers, "Bron-Y-Aur Stomp" is great fun, and the grand finale, "Hats Off To (Roy) Harper," featuring just Page's steel string guitarfest on one speaker & Plant's distorted, warbly vocals on the other, is weird but very compelling. "Led Zeppelin III" is a great Zep disc, showcasing the band's magic touch with the acoustic as well as the electric. Highly recommended.
