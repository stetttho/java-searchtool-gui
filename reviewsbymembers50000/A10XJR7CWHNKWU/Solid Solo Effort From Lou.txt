 "Here I come, ready or not," sings Lou Gramm at the beginning of his 1987 solo album, "Ready Or Not," and it's an excellent solo debut for Foreigner's lead singer (although Lou's solo career would be short-lived: he recorded a second solo album that went nowhere, and promptly returned to the Foreigner fold for 1995's "Mr. Moonlight"). Gramm doesn't stray from the hard-rocking Foreigner formula on "Ready Or Not," but that's fine with me 'cause these songs totally rock. Standouts include the Top Ten hit "Midnight Blue," the title song, "If I Don't Have You," "Arrow Thru Your Heart," and "Lover Come Back." Lou's voice is in top form, and, as I've already said, the songs rock. If you're a big Foreigner fan, then you've just GOT to get Lou Gramm's "Ready Or Not"!
