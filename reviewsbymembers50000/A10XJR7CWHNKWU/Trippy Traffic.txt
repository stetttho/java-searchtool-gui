 Led by the immensely talented Steve Winwood & Dave Mason, the magnificent rock band Traffic said hello to the world with their 1967 debut album, "Mr. Fantasy," a delicious psychedelic supper of flower-power pop/rock (the weird cover photo pretty much says it all about the feel of this album). The organ is prominent throughout, the sitar makes an appearance on a few songs, and there's also a few spoken passages as well. In other words, this is a totally far out record, man! Many Traffic classics populate this disc: the 60's pop of "Heaven Is In Your Mind," the gorgeous ballad "No Face, No Name, No Number," the Traffic signature rockers "Dear Mr. Fantasy," "Dealer," and "Colored Rain," and the groovy instrumental "Giving To You." The drunken ragtime piano number "Berkshire Poppies" is a real hoot, as are the psychedelic pop of "House For Everyone" (complete with wind-up clock intro) and the trippy "Utterly Simple." Also, this new re-issue of "Mr. Fantasy" includes six bonus tracks of songs the band originally released purely as non-album singles, including more Traffic favorites like "Paper Sun" and "Hole In My Shoe." Steve Winwood's voice, guitar & keyboards are outstanding, Dave Mason's voice & guitar are equally strong, Chris Wood plays a mean flute & saxophone, and Jim Capaldi's drumming is superb. Traffic remain one of rock's greatest groups, and they couldn't have had a better intro than "Mr. Fantasy." Great stuff!
