 Until recently, I had never thought much of Jethro Tull's 1978 effort, "Heavy Horses." Only the 9-minute title track had ever really stuck in my head; the rest of the album pretty much went in one ear and out the other. I now confess that I was very wrong. Listening to this wonderful new remastered version, which brings out a new richness to the songs that I hadn't heard before, I now stand *highly* corrected. "Heavy Horses" is an excellent Tull album. Even more earthier-sounding than it's predecessor, "Songs From The Wood," and continuing the band's musical exploration of living in the English countryside, Ian Anderson & the boys work more musical magic with such fine Tull songs as "The Mouse Police Never Sleeps," "Acres Wild," "Moths," "Journeyman," "Rover," and the aforementioned title suite. The band sound great, the production is sparkling, and Anderson's vocals are strong. Sometimes an album just doesn't hit you over the head on the first listen, but you can still warm up to it over time, and hear something special in it that you hadn't heard before. That was certainly the case with me and Jethro Tull's "Heavy Horses." It's a great Tull disc--it just took me a while to realize it. Better late than never!
