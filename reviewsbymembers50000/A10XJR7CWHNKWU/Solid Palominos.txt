 Version 3 of drummer Anton Fier's ever-changing studio group, The Golden Palominos, released 1986's "Blast Of Silence." With such guest artists as vocalists Syd Straw, Matthew Sweet, Jack Bruce of Cream, T-Bone Burnett and Don Dixon, "Blast" is an excellent, solid pop/rock album, with an occasional dash of country. My personal favorites include the catchy "Something Becomes Nothing," "(Something Else Is) Working Harder," "Angels," "Work Was New," and "Strong, Simple Silences." Great performances, great tunes, great Golden Palominos album. Thumbs up on "Blast Of Silence." (NOTE: I can't help but notice that these Golden Palominos re-issues are given different album covers. I like the new "Blast Of Silence" cover with the trees, but what happened to the old album cover, which looks like a nighttime photograph/painting of a tower? Oh well, no worries. At least the music is the same!)
