 1995's "Beggar On A Beach Of Gold" was meant to be Mike + The Mechanics' "comeback" album, and while it didn't sell much better than it's predecessor, "Word Of Mouth," this is arguably the best album from Mike Rutherford's band away from Genesis. The songs are fantastic, the production is crisp & polished like a brand new car, and the lead vocals by Paul Carrack and Paul Young (of Sad Cafe) are wonderful. Song for song, "Beggar" is brilliant pop-rock: the joyful title track, the driving acoustic pop-rock of "Another Cup Of Coffee" and "Over My Shoulder," the glorious atmospheres of "Mea Culpa," "The Ghost Of Sex And You," and "A House Of Many Rooms," the lovely "Something To Believe In," and the powerful "Someone Always Hates Someone," a song that's *very* relevant with the state of the world today. And for the cherry on top, there's two excellent cover songs of Smokey Robinson's "You've Really Got A Hold On Me," and Stevie Wonder's "I Believe." It's pretty obvious that Mike, Paul & Paul had a great time making this album, as the joy of the music comes through on every track. "Beggar On A Beach Of Gold" is a fantastic Mechanics album, and quite possibly the finest "solo" album Mike Rutherford has ever made. A winner through and through!
