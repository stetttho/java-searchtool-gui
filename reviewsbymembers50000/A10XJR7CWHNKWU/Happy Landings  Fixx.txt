 After the disappointment of their 1991 album, "Ink," where the band kind of had their hands tied by other songwriters assigned to work with them (resulting in a decent-but-unmemorable album & poor sales), the Fixx took a few years off from the music biz before getting back to work in 1996 with this ten-track batch of tunes. Five songs were meant to be put on an EP (it was never released), while the other five tracks were later re-recorded for 1998's "Elemental" album. "Happy Landings And Lost Tracks" is a terrific collection, as it shows Cy Curnin & the boys fully re-charged and re-inspired, once again making powerful pop-rock just like they did in the 80's. There are some really outstanding songs on this disc, such as the rockin' "Modern World" and "Freeman," the boogie-woogie of "Elected" (a *very* different kind of Fixx song, but it's great), and the atmospheres of "Ocean Blue" and "We Once Held Hands" (and these earlier versions of songs from "Elemental" really make me want to listen to "Elemental" again, which I will do very soon). The band's comeback was still a "work in progress" when they did these sessions, but oh, what progress! With "Happy Landings And Lost Tracks," the Fixx were right back on track where they belong. This is a great CD and I highly recommend it to Fixx fans everywhere.
