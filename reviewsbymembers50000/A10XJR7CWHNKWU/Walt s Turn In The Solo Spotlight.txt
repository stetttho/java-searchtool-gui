 The duo of Steely Dan has always been an equal, 50/50 partnership between Walter Becker and Donald Fagen, but let's face it, it's usually been Fagen who has been in the Dan spotlight all this time, as he does 99% of the lead vocals. So, it's now time for good ol' Walt to stand up and be counted, as his 1994 solo album, "11 Tracks Of Whack," gives proof positive of what HE has brought to the Steely Dan table all this time. This is a brilliant, catchy, clever album, showing Becker's gift for grooves, melodies, arrangements, lyrical wit, cool guitar licks, and a singing voice that's very bluesy & laid-back, but has a charm all it's own. Co-produced with his Dan pal Donald Fagen (who also plays keyboards & did the horn arrangements), "11 Tracks Of Whack" is filled with groovy tunes such as the opening popper "Down In The Bottom," the rockin' "Surf And/Or Die," the sweet-sounding "Book Of Liars," the funky "Hard Up Case," the finger-snapping "Cringemaker," the reggae-esque "My Waterloo," and the fine sing-along finale, "Little Kawai." These are all fabulous songs, every single one of them (and there's 12 of them, not 11), and the production is smooth and assured. I hope Walt does another solo album sometime in the future, as he's a brilliant artist all on his own, AND he needs to catch up with Fagen and HIS solo output (he has two). "11 Tracks Of Whack" is a marvelous album, and all the evidence needed of Walter Becker's contribution to the music of Steely Dan. Well done, Walt!
