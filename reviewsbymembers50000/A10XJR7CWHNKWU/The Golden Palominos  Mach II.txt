 1985's "Visions Of Excess" is the 2nd album for the Golden Palominos, the New York studio collective led by drummer Anton Fier, and it represents the first of many changes in musical direction for the group (they *never* deliver the same kind of album twice). The first time around, on their self-titled debut disc, the Palominos were a very out-there, avant-garde fusion group. For "Visions Of Excess," the group goes for a much more accessible, college-radio rock sound. The line-up this time includes not only Fier on drums but also Michael Stipe of REM, John Lydon of the Sex Pistols, Jack Bruce, Syd Straw, Richard Thompson, Bernie Worrell, and Carla Bley. Of the albums eight songs, standouts include the very catchy "Boy (Go)," with funky basslines by Bill Laswell and a great vocal by Stipe, the rockin' "Clustering Train," the punkish "The Animal Speaks" (with a classic punk vocal by Lydon---who else?), and the excellent songs "(Kind Of) True" and "Buenos Aires," both richly sung by Straw. But the Palominos haven't completely forgotten their original incarnation: the album concludes with the avant-garde "Only One Party," with guitar & lead vocals by Arto Lindsay, who was also featured on the first Palominos album. "Visions Of Excess" is a solid, excellent album for the ever-changing Golden Palominos.
