 With the departure of their longtime keyboardist Mike Pinder in 1978, the Moody Blues saw one major chapter in their long musical career come to a close, and, with the dawn of the 80's, it was time for the Moodies' second chapter to begin. Obviously, the band's first hurdle to get over was to get themselves a brand-new keyboardist, but who could possibly step into Mike Pinder's giant shoes? Enter Patrick Moraz, the one-time keyboardist for Yes (he played on 1976's "Relayer"). Moraz's contribution to the Moodies was NOT to play mellotron as Pinder did, but to add a more synthesized, 80's-friendly keyboard sound to the band. Some fans pondered whether or not the Moody Blues could survive without Mike Pinder, but the finished album, 1981's "Long Distance Voyager," was a HUGE success, both creatively and commercially, hitting #1 on the U.S. album chart. Mike Pinder may be missed, but there's no denying the freshness that Patrick Moraz's keyboard touch brought to the Moody Blues, and, on top of that, the band rose to the challenge and came up with some truly fantastic songs. Not only does "Voyager" feature the Moodies staples "Gemini Dream" and "The Voice," but also such gems as John Lodge's lovely "Talking Out Of Turn," and Justin Hayward's gorgeous "In My World" (interestingly, both tracks clock in at exactly 7 minutes 17 seconds). Drummer Graeme Edge contributes the thunderous, steady rocker "22,000 Days," one of his very best songwriting contributions to the band, while flautist Ray Thomas wraps the album up in a playful, colorful bow with the circus-themed "Painted Smile," the poem "Reflective Smile," and the classic Moodies shuffler, "Veteran Cosmic Rocker." With "Long Distance Voyager," the Moody Blues re-invented themselves and entered the 80's with tremendous power. "Long Distance Voyager" is one of the Moodies' all-time greatest albums.
