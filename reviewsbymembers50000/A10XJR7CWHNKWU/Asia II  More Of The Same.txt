 Asia's 2nd album, "Alpha" (from 1983), is pretty much more of the same arena rock this supergroup started out with on their smash-hit debut disc from the previous year. Still, that doesn't make it bad. Not unlike it's much-more popular predecessor, "Alpha" is also a good, decent rock album with some catchy tunes. The Top 10 hit, "Don't Cry," is a memorable number, as is the beautiful power ballad, "The Smile Has Left Your Eyes." Also quite good are "The Heat Goes On," "The Last To Know," and "Open Your Eyes." As for individual performances, John Wetton is especially good on lead vocals here. Guitarist Steve Howe, keyboardist Geoff Downes, and drummer Carl Palmer (with Wetton on bass) all play competently on "Alpha," though they don't do anything earth-shattering. Nevertheless, Asia's "Alpha" is a good enough, enjoyable enough album.
