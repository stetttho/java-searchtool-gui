 Sarah McLachlan's "Freedom Sessions" EP from 1995 is a bit of an oddity: seven acoustic versions of songs from Sarah's masterpiece, "Fumbling Towards Ecstasy," plus a cover of the old Tom Waits chestnut, "Ol' 55." Plus, as an added bonus, "The Freedom Sessions" can also be popped into your computer for some extra Sarah goodies (and if I'm not mistaken, this was the very first "Enhanced" CD ever released, so congratulations to Sarah for being the first!). Like her import release from 1996, "Rarities, B-Sides & Other Stuff," this Sarah CD is for diehards only, but it is a wonderful disc, with Sarah and her band putting a softer, live-in-the-studio spin on such "Fumbling" favorites as "Elsewhere," "Plenty," "Mary," "Good Enough," & "Hold On" that are all very enjoyable. The cover of "Ol' 55" is great fun, and the multimedia portion for your computer is excellent. It's always a pleasure to get any new release from Sarah McLachlan, whether it's a "proper" studio album, or an extra goodie like "The Freedom Sessions." Highly recommended.
