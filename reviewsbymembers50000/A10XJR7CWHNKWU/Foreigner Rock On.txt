 For many music acts who make a big commercial splash with their debut album, they usually fall victim to the "sophomore jinx" when they release their 2nd album (i.e. the 2nd album sells poorly, and the artist subsequently vanishes without a trace). Who knows what causes it? All *I* know is that it takes a very special 2nd album to keep the masses coming back for a second helping. The mighty rockers known as Foreigner, led by the unique, powerful voice of Lou Gramm, and the masterful guitar & vocals of Mick Jones, avoided the sophomore jinx just fine, thank you very much, with their 2nd album, 1978's "Double Vision," which sold even more copies than their self-titled debut from the previous year. It's all about quality, folks: "Double Vision" is another great album of melodic rock as only Foreigner can do it. Great stuff all over the place on this one: the classic head-bobbers "Hot Blooded," the title song, and "Blue Morning, Blue Day," and wonderful ballads like "You're All I Am," "Back Where You Belong" & "I Have Waited So Long." There's even a strong, rare Foreigner instrumental, "Tramontane," and more kick-butt numbers like "Love Has Taken It's Toll," "Lonely Children," and the awesome finale, "Spellbinder." This new version of "Double Vision" also contains a pair of cool bonus tracks: a live version of "Hot Blooded," and a live performance of a rare song, "Love Maker." Foreigner *totally* rock the house with this pair of live tracks. Featuring top-notch, catchy tunes from end to end, and performed to perfection by the band, Foreigner's "Double Vision" is an instant rock classic.
