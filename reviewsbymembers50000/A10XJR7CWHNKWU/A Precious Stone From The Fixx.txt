 In 1988, The Fixx switched record labels (from MCA Records to RCA Records) and released their fifth album, "Calm Animals." This is arguably the Fixx's last *truly* great album to date. Although I've enjoyed the band's albums that have followed "Calm Animals" ("Ink," "Elemental" and "Want That Life"), they just seem to be missing that little extra special magic that graces the Fixx's first five albums. I'm not at all saying they're bad---I like them---I'm just saying that they're missing a little something. "Calm Animals," however, is outstanding Fixx music all the way through. Had there been the right amount of promotion, the album could've been a big comeback hit for the band. And it should've been: the songs totally rock, and lead singer Cy Curnin, guitarist Jamie West-Oram & company sound very inspired throughout. The band's sound & approach is tougher, and the album also boasts great sound quality & production, courtesy of producer William Wittman. The songs may not have been hits (shame on you, radio programmers), but they're all first-rate tunes: "I'm Life," "Driven Out," "Precious Stone," the title song, "The Flow," "World Weary," and all the rest....simply awesome. Although a bit underrated in the group's catalog, "Calm Animals" nonetheless remains one of the Fixx's very best releases.
