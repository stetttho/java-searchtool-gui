 On his latest release, "Hardcastle III," multi-instrumentalist Paul Hardcastle continues doing what he does best: making the smoothest, coolest, most hypnotic jazz soundscapes in all the land. Like all of his albums, "Hardcastle III" is a pure joy to listen to. There's a cool re-arrangement of his signature tune, "Rainforest" to kick things off, followed by more dreamy, groovy tracks like "Runnin' Back," "Golden Gate," "The D Train," "Walkin'," the Japanese-influenced "Zen Warrior," "Desire," "I Believe In You," and "Forest Echoes." Every single track on the album is a heavenly, sparkling beauty. Hardcastle once again displays his songwriting and performing genius, creating killer hooks as he mans the majority of the instruments like a pro, and his longtime musical partner Helen Rogers is on hand to contribute some very soulful vocals. When it comes to smooth jazz, there's no one better than Paul Hardcastle. "Hardcastle III" is yet another ray of light in the man's shimmering musical catalog.
