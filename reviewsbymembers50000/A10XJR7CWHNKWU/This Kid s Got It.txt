 Obviously, the Amazon reviewer thinks that a song's lyrics are *infinitely* more important than the music. While good lyrics ARE important, I'm the opposite kind of music reviewer: if you're going to get MY attention, ya gotta grab me *first and foremost* with the music. If I like your music (i.e. the musical notes, arrangements, and performances), THEN I'll listen to what you're singing about. My opinion of the young singer/songwriter John Mayer? This guy makes awesome music, breezy pop/rock stuffed with so many great hooks & melodies throughout that you can't even count 'em. Not only that, but he's an excellent guitarist and has a fine, breathy, whisper-in-your-ear vocal style. And his lyrics? I like them. Is it actually a *crime* to mention a lunchbox in a song? I think not.Where to begin about Mayer's major-label debut from 2001, "Room For Squares"? Song for song it is wonderfully catchy music, not only the hits "No Such Thing" and "Your Body Is A Wonderland," but other winners like "Neon," the dreamy "City Love," "83," "3x5," "Great Indoors," "St. Patrick's Day," and all the rest. Excellent songwriting & vocals, and first-rate arrangements and performances by Mayer and his studio musicians. And about Mayer's studio musicians on this record---I was delighted to see drummers Nir Z and Jerry Marotta on this album, both of whom have drumming connections to a particular veteran British group that I like (hint: Peter Gabriel used to sing for them). Thank you, John, for using their services! John Mayer is an amazing talent. He's got a magical way with a pop song, and I want to hear more. Actually, there is more: his brilliant second album "Heavier Things," a live album, and an earlier independent release (featuring earlier versions of several songs from "Room For Squares"). Keep the great music coming, John! "Room For Squares" is an outstanding debut.
