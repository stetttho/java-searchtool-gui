 So many US fans of Supertramp still believe to this day that 1974's "Crime Of The Century" was the band's very first album. This is totally not true---it's actually their *third* album, following 1970's "Supertramp" & 1971's "Indelibly Stamped," both of which are only available on import, but they're both superb Tramp albums worth seeking out. Now that we've got THAT cleared up...."Crime Of The Century" was Supertramp's first commercial breakthrough, and it's a winner all the way. Many Tramp classics are on this one: "School," "Bloody Well Right," "Dreamer, "Rudy," and the title track. Singer/songwriter/ keyboardists Roger Hodgson & Rick Davies are in top form, as are their new recruits John Halliwell on sax, bassist Dougie Thomson & drummer Bob Siebenberg. The band's unique music is melodic, rocking, and catchy, and the production is supreme, as especially evidenced on this new remastered version.It wasn't their first album, but "Crime Of The Century" WAS Supertramp's first big splash in the music world. It's a terrific album, and a sign of things to come from this great band. :-)
