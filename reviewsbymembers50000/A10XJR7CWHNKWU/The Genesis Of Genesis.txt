 For the 1969 debut album by Genesis, "From Genesis To Revelation," producer Jonathan King insisted on adding horns & string arrangements to most of the band's songs. Nonetheless, I enjoy the album just fine. "From Genesis To Revelation" is a far cry from anything else the band have recorded since, but it's a very good Genesis album in it's own right, with some fine material. The best tunes on the album are the few that the band get to rock on *without* orchestral accompanyment: "In The Beginning," "The Serpent," and the bonus track, "That's Me," all terrific Genesis rockers. I also appreciate the melodies of "When The Sour Turns To Sweet," "The Conquerer," "In Limbo," the Bee Gees-esque "The Silent Sun" (the band's first attempt at a hit single), "In Limbo," and the brief-but-beautiful "A Place To Call My Own." Peter Gabriel's voice is always a pleasure to hear, Tony Banks gets in some really good piano-thumping & organ-playing throughout, Mike Rutherford & Anthony Phillips both contribute some very good acoustic & electric guitar work, and drummer John Silver, in his lone album with the band, may be dwarfed by Phil Collins' looming shadow, but he's good enough behind the drumkit, certainly for this material, anyway. "From Genesis To Revelation" isn't the band's masterpiece, but it's still a very good debut album. If you're a diehard Genesis fan like me, you can't go wrong with adding "From Genesis To Revelation" to your collection. :-)
