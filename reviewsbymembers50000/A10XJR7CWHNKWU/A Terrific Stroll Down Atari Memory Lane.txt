 What kid during the early 80's *didn't* love Atari video games? The Atari 2600 was my very first video game system, and I must've logged *thousands* of hours playing it. Although my old Atari system is long gone, I've never forgotten it or the games. That's why I practically jumped for joy when I saw this goodie at the toy store recently---the Atari Classics 10-In-1 Game System, put out by Jakks Pacific Inc. It's a retro Atari joystick with 10 classic Atari games built right into the joystick, including old favorites like Adventure, Asteroids, Missile Command, Centipede and Yar's Revenge. Just pop in 4 AA-batteries into the joystick, plug it into your TV, and off you go! I agree that the Atari games on this joystick are simply detailed replicas, NOT the originals, and the sound effects are different. But, in my opinion, the games still look, play, and feel pretty darn close to the originals. They're a whole lot of fun, and they do make me nostalgic for my old Atari 2600. Just holding this Atari joystick in my hand makes me feel like a kid again! As for the replication and the different sound effects, I've had no problem getting used to them. Certainly Atari gave Jakks Pacific their permission to replicate these games, so it's not like this is a rip-off job. Consider it an upgrade if you will, a polishing-up of these 20 year-old games for the 21st century. Plus, you can't beat the affordable price or the convienient portability. The Atari Classics 10-In-1 Game System is a terrific stroll down Atari Memory Lane, and I hope that there will be more retro Atari joystick systems with different games released in the future. If you love classic Atari video games, this little retro joystick will provide you with hours of entertainment, just like your old Atari system did in the good old days. A definite must-buy!
