 Foreigner's "The Best Of Live" is a compilation of live tracks recorded over the years between 1977 and 1985. It is also solid proof that Foreigner were a *major* powerhouse in concert. Singer Lou Gramm, guitarist Mick Jones & company totally rock out on such favorites as "Double Vision," "The Damage Is Done," "Dirty White Boy," "Head Games," "Juke Box Hero," "Urgent,"and "Feels Like The First Time." They also handle the softer stuff live with style as well, such as "Fool For You Anyway," "Waiting For A Girl Like You," and "I Want To Know What Love Is" (featuring accompanyment by a gospel choir). The only disappointment is that there's no live version of "Hot Blooded," but then again, there IS a live version of that hit song on Foreigner's greatest hits package, "Records," and it also appears as a bonus track on the new "Double Vision" remaster, so I can't really complain. Foreigner were--and are--one of rock's finest bands. "The Best Of Live" is an awesome document of what Lou, Mick & the boys could do on the concert stage. Put it on and rock out with Foreigner!
