 I have only one thing to say to the previous reviewer---get outta here! Paul Hardcastle isn't *anything* like that sappy horntooter Kenny G, AND Paul is a zillion times more talented. Having said that...."Hardcastle 1" is another supreme slice of smooth jazz from the multi-talented composer/musician Paul Hardcastle. There's only one way to describe this disc, or ANY Paul Hardcastle disc for that matter: groovy! Great tracks are all over the place: "Can't Stop Now," "Driftin' Away," the brilliant "You May Be Gone" (one of the greatest songs ever written about losing a loved one), "Feel The Breeze," "The Only One," and "It Must Be Love." There's also an excellent cover of the Steely Dan classic, "Do It Again," and very hip instrumentals like "Forever Dreamin'," "Lazy Days," the funky "Cruisin' To Midnight," and finally, for the coup de grace, the classic instrumental "Rainforest," one of Hardcastle's most famous tunes, second only to his 80's hit, "19." Paul brilliantly plays almost all of the instruments himself, and there's excellent lead vocals throughout by Steve Menzies, Helen Rogers, Caroline Dayley and Jaki Graham.With a totally catchy sound that just can't be beat, Paul Hardcastle is quite possibly the greatest smooth jazz artist on the block. "Hardcastle 1," like all of Paul's recorded work, is a CD that's as cool as a summer breeze. :-)
