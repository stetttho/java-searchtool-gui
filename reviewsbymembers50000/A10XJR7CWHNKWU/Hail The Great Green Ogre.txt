 "Shrek 2" is a wonderful movie. I enjoyed it even more than the first "Shrek" film, as classic as the first film is. And the "Shrek 2" movie soundtrack is a great, solid batch of tunes, with a mixture of original songs and older songs that were borrowed for the film. Among the original material, I especially enjoy the exuberance of Counting Crows' "Accidentally In Love," and the quiet, peaceful pop of the Eels' "I Need Some Sleep." Of the borrowed songs, there's the funky all-time classic by Lipps Inc., "Funkytown," and the melancholic piano bar pieces by Tom Waits and Nick Cave, "Little Drop Of Poison" and "People Ain't No Good." David Bowie's "Changes" gets a fine treatment by singer Butterfly Boucher (with Bowie himself on guest vocals), and there's two excellent covers of the old Bonnie Tyler hit, "Holding Out For A Hero"---a killer, revamped dance version by Frou Frou, and a more faithful but no less powerful version sung by the voice of the Fairy Godmother, "Ab Fab"'s Jennifer Saunders (who knew Saunders had such a great singing voice?). And, of course, this CD also includes the fiesta fun of Puss 'N' Boots & Donkey (Antonio Banderas & Eddie Murphy) on "Livin' La Vida Loca." A great soundrack album for a great movie, the "Shrek 2" soundtrack rocks. Go, Shrek!
