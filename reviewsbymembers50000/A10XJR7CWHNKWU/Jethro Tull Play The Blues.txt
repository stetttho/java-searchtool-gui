 "This Was" is Jethro Tull's debut album from 1968. Led by the charismatic singer/flautist Ian Anderson, this first incarnation of the group, rounded out by guitarist Mick Abrahams, bassist Glenn Cornick and drummer Clive Bunker, deliver an exceptional platter of blues-flavored rock. Though the album has a sort of low-fi feel to it (Anderson says in the new liner notes that the album only costed $1200 to make, and the recording of it was simple), "This Was" is still an excellent beginning for this most-excellent band. The band's playing is amazing, and many Tull classics are found here, such as the dirty blues-rock of "My Sunday Feeling," the groovy "Beggar's Farm," the light-hearted instrumental "Serenade To A Cuckoo," the rockin' "Dharma For One" (featuring a great drum solo by Bunker), and the jaunty "A Song For Jeffrey." This remastered edition of "This Was" also comes with three bonus tracks: the bluesy "One For John Gee" (the band's tribute to the manager of the Marquee Club where they used to play in the early days), the classic Tull rocker "Love Story," and the beautiful yuletide number, "Christmas Song." Shortly after the album's release, Mick Abrahams left Jethro Tull and was replaced by guitarist Martin Barre, who has remained with the band ever since. But this is where it all started for Tull. Although they would totally top themselves with their outstanding 2nd album, "Stand Up," "This Was" remains a first-rate debut album for one of rock's all-time greatest groups.
