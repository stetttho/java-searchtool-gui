 After their 1987 indie-label debut, "Where It Is," the British group the Beloved, led by singer/songwriter Jon Marsh, changed musical direction and went into the world of synth-pop, making a considerable splash in 1990 with their second album, "Happiness," and it's name-dropping dance hit, "Hello." Simply put, this is a great album, with great catchy tunes, solid hooks, rhythms, and Marsh's smooth lead vocals. It's also the group's best album to date. Besides the memorable hit "Hello," there's also the beautiful "Time After Time" & "Don't You Worry," the incredibly sensual "The Sun Rising," the uplifting pop of "I Love You More," and the killer grooves of "Wake Up Soon." A true "feel-good" album if there ever was one, the Beloved's "Happiness" is a gem. Buy it right now!
