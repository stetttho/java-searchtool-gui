 Multi-talented singer/songwriter Tony Carey, who makes his home in Germany, recorded two terrific progressive pop/rock albums in the early 80's under the group name Planet P (later re-christened Planet P Project). This self-titled debut album from 1983, with Carey writing all the songs, playing most of the instruments, and singing lead vocals on all but one song,  is an awesome piece of work, combining a strong pop sensibility & great hooks with dramatic, keyboard & guitar-driven progressive rock that reminds me of Pink Floyd and the Alan Parsons Project. The songs are all excellent, especially "Static," "Armageddon," the MTV favorite "Why Me?," "Send It In A Letter," and "Only You And Me" (with guest lead vocals by David Thomas). Tony Carey would totally top himself with Planet P Project's ambitious 1984 follow-up, the double concept album "Pink World." But this self-titled debut is an awesome album all on it's own, and it remains one of 1983's very best releases.
