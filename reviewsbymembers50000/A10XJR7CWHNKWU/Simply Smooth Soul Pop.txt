 British singer Mick Hucknall has been leading Simply Red since 1986, and he has without a doubt one of the most soulful voices in music. Simply Red's music is a brilliant mix of soul & pop, and I never get tired of hearing their tunes on the radio. "The Essentials" is an excellent greatest hits package, with 12 of the group's best-known songs, including the #1 hits "Holding Back The Years" and "If You Don't Know Me By Now," and other tasty tracks like "It's Only Love," "Something Got Me Started," "Money$ Too Tight To Mention," and "The Right Thing." The music is super smooth & super catchy, with Hucknall's voice SO very rich & powerful. Whether you want music to cruise down the highway with, relax at home to, or snuggle up with your sweetheart to, Simply Red fit the bill perfectly. "The Essentials" IS an essential greatest hits CD from one of pop music's finest groups.
