 The Alan Parsons Project's third album, 1978's "Pyramid," is a heavenly delight. With a theme of mysticism, and once again spearheaded by Alan Parsons & his partner Eric Woolfson, this album is progressive pop/rock at it's very best. Dreamy, melodic songs are littered all over this one: the classic prog-pop instrumentals "Voyager," "In The Lap Of The Gods," & "Hyper-Gamma Spaces," the powerful "What Goes Up," the beautiful "The Eagle Will Rise Again," the great rockers "One More River" and the stunning "Can't Take It With You," the deliciously quirky "Pyramania," and the gorgeous finale, "Shadow Of A Lonely Man." Outstanding songwriting, production & performances, great orchestrations by Andrew Powell (can't have a Project album without him!), and great vocals throughout by the likes of Colin Blunstone, David Paton, Lenny Zakatek, John Miles, and others. With "Pyramid," the Alan Parsons Project deliver another terrific disc.
