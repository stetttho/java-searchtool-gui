 A somewhat-overlooked album in the Moody Blues' catalog, 1983's "The Present" is a wonderful album. It was the follow-up to the Moodies' #1 smash-hit release from 1981, "Long Distance Voyager," but for some reason, "The Present" just didn't sell as well, and today, the Moodies no longer perform anything from it in concert, which is a shame. Song for song the album is fantastic, starting with guitarist Justin Hayward's atmospheric rocker "Blue World." "Meet Me Halfway" is a breezy number co-written by Hayward and bassist John Lodge. Lodge's "Sitting At The Wheel," the album's lone Top 40 single, is tremendous fun. Then comes "Going Nowhere," one of the best songs ever written by drummer Graeme Edge, and beautifully sung by flautist Ray Thomas. Next up is a double shot from Lodge, the powerful instrumental "Hole In The World," and the truly sparkling number, "Under My Feet." Hayward returns with a pair of beautiful love songs, "It's Cold Outside Of Your Heart," and, one of my all-time favorite ballads from Justin, "Running Water." Finally, Ray Thomas concludes the album with the mystical "I Am," and the wonderful "Sorry." The band, along with keyboardist Patrick Moraz, sound incredible on this album. "The Present" is a brilliant Moody Blues album that deserves to be rediscovered. I'm sure many Moodies fans out there will greatly appreciate this present.
