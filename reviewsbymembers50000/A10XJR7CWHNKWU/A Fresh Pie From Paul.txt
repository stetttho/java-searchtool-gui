 Fresh off his work on the Beatles' "Anthology" albums, which reminded him of the creative standards set by his legendary old band, Paul McCartney recorded 1997's "Flaming Pie," filled with new inspiration & vigor, and came up with one of his best solo albums in years (although Paul would do even better with 2001's magnificent "Driving Rain"). It's just tremendous fun hearing Paul get back in touch with his creative genius once more, since his most recent albums up to this point, though not without their share of good songs, had been a little TOO soft & fluffy overall. Not so with "Flaming Pie". Standouts include the excellent pop-rock of "The World Tonight," "Young Boy," the title song, "Used To Be Bad," and "Beautiful Tonight," as well as lovely songs like "Somedays," "Calico Skies," "Little Willow," "Great Day," and the gorgeous beauty that is "Heaven On A Sunday," arguably the best song on the album, and featuring an amazing electric guitar solo by Paul's son, James, who was just 19 at the time. Paul's work throughout is quite wonderful, and there's excellent contributions thoughout by Steve Miller, Jeff Lynne, Paul's Beatle pal Ringo Starr, and the lovely Linda McCartney. While "Flaming Pie" doesn't represent Paul McCartney's *greatest* solo material---hence my 4-star rating instead of a perfect 5---this is undeniably a wonderful album, and a definitive step in the right direction for Sir Paul. "Flaming Pie" is mighty tasty.
