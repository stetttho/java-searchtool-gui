 1976's "A Trick Of The Tail" was the first Genesis album without lead singer Peter Gabriel, with drummer Phil Collins taking Gabriel's place at the mike on a full-time basis for the first time (Phil had already sung lead vocals on a pair of the band's earlier songs, "For Absent Friends" & "More Fool Me"). "A Trick Of The Tail" was a landmark album for the band, and it still stands today as one of their best. It not only showed the music world that Genesis *could* survive without Gabriel, it also proved to those who thought of Genesis as "The Peter Gabriel Band" that Gabriel was NOT the only talented musician in the group. Peter IS a musical genius, and he was a fantastic frontman & songwriter for Genesis, but ALL of the band members, including Collins, Tony Banks, Mike Rutherford, Steve Hackett, and former members including Anthony Phillips, etc., ALL contributed to the group's musical magic, right along with Peter. "A Trick Of The Tail" was the proof of that.Now a quartet, "A Trick Of The Tail" finds Genesis still at the top of their game, with eight marvelous compositions that remain among the best in all of progressive rock, with such band staples as "Dance On A Volcano," "Squonk" (both superb Genesis rockers), the lovely, majestic songs "Entangled," "Mad Man Moon" & "Ripples," the great fun of "Robbery, Assault & Battery" & the title song, and the mindblowing coda, "Los Endos" (a sort of instrumental re-cap of the album's previous songs, with the band bidding a fond farewell to Peter Gabriel at the very end, as Collins sings "There's an angel standing in the sun/Free to get back home"---it's a line from "Supper's Ready," the band's magnum opus from 1972). The band's songwriting & musicianship here is truly sensational, with Banks, Collins, Hackett & Rutherford delivering some of their greatest work ever recorded. And Collins' voice perfectly fits the bill---if ANY singer could take over for Peter Gabriel, it was Phil. Thank God that the band didn't have to look very far for the man for the job!"A Trick Of The Tail" is classic Genesis all the way, and one of the band's greatest accomplishments. Let the dance---and the Phil Collins era---begin! :-)
