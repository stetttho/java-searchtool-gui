 The Alan Parsons Project's 1984 release, "Ammonia Avenue," is definitely one of their best albums. Following the highly-successful "Eye In The Sky," "Ammonia Avenue" is yet another winning blend of this excellent studio group's progressive pop/rock, anchored by writer/producer Alan Parsons and his partner, singer/composer Eric Woolfson. Great songs are everywhere---the radio hits "Prime Time" & "Don't Answer Me," the catchy "One Good Reason," the excellent melodic rock of "Dancing On A Highwire," the dreamy instrumental "Pipeline," and the lovely title track that closes the album. The tunes are memorable, the vocals by such singers as Eric Woolfson himself, Lenny Zakatek, Chris Rainbow & Colin Blunstone are first-rate, the musicianship from such Project regulars as guitarist Ian Bairnson, drummer Stuart Elliot, et al, is tight, and Parsons' 80's polish to the production is sparkly. "Ammonia Avenue" is an excellent album from Alan Parsons & company. You can't go wrong purchasing this one. :-)
