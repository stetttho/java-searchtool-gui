 I have always admired Ray Charles. What a towering, soulful voice the man had, not to mention his brilliant keyboard playing. And, of course, all those great hit songs. But it wasn't until I saw the movie about Charles' life, simply called "Ray," that it dawned on me what a true innovator Charles was also. He really did lay down the blueprint for many soul acts to follow, doing things with the musical form that no one else had done before. This CD, "The Very Best Of Ray Charles," is a brilliant overview of Ray's most beloved work. These are fabulous songs, all of them, including classics like "I Got A Woman," "Hallelujah I Love Her So," "(Night Time Is) The Right Time" (a winning blues-popper featuring Margie Hendricks on co-lead vocals), "Hit The Road Jack," and the full-length version of the call-and-response smash "What I'd Say," with a brilliant performance from Charles on vocals and on his newly-acquired Wurlitzer keyboard. But it doesn't stop there---there's also the lovely ballads "Georgia On My Mind" and "I Can't Stop Loving You,"  an amazing soul re-working of the standard "You Are My Sunshine," the sultry "Unchain My Heart," the lyrically-daring "Let's Go Get Stoned," and a hot instrumental showcase for Charles, "One Mint Julep," with a scorching performance on organ. If you're new to Ray Charles' music, "The Very Best Of Ray Charles" is the perfect CD to start your collection with. God bless you, Brother Ray.
