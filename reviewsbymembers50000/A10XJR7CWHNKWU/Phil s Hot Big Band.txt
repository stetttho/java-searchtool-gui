 ...As a longtime Phil Collins fan for well over two decades now, I've gotten used to the constant idiotic bad reviews of Phil's singing & songwriting abilities that have plagued him since 1985's "No Jacket Required" album, which are stupid enough. But to put down Phil's talent as a *drummer* is absolute bull---t! Phil Collins is without a doubt one of the greatest drummers in the world. NO ONE on God's given Earth plays drums like Phil Collins. He is a master, a pro, and he has a unique drumming sound that's entirely his own. He KNOWS his way around that drumkit. If you can't hear the brilliance of Phil's drumming on "A Hot Night In Paris," or on ANY album that Phil has drummed on throughout his career for that matter, then you are obviously, 100%, frigging DEAF! Now that I've gotten that off my chest....Phil Collins has always had great affection for jazz music, and, in 1999, he did a brief tour with his own jazz band, playing certain jazz classics, as well as jazz arrangements of some of his solo & Genesis material. No singing, just some major kick-butt jazz playing. His big band's stop in Paris is well-documented on "A Hot Night In Paris," as Phil & company put excellent jazz rave-up spins on Phil favorites like "Sussudio," "I Don't Care Anymore," Genesis hits "That's All," "Invisible Touch," and their 1976 prog-rock warhorse, "Los Endos," and a phenomenal, mindblowing, 12-minute blast through the old Average White Band classic, "Pick Up The Pieces." Phil & his big band are simply sensational on this recording---I wish I could've been at the concert myself! If you're a diehard Phil Collins fan, then "A Hot Night In Paris" is a definite must-have. Rock on, Phil!
