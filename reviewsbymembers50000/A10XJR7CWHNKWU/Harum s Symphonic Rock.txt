 Procol Harum's signature symphonic rock lends itself *perfectly* to orchestral occompanyment, so it was only fitting that the band would play a concert with a full symphony orchestra & choir. This they did in Canada on November 18, 1971, with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra and the Da Camera Singers. The resulting live album, "Live With The Edmonton Symphony Orchestra," shows not only what a powerhouse Harum are live in concert, but how beautifully rich & textured their music is as a whole, a point that the brilliant orchestrations on this album help to drive home. (This is also the band's only official live album to date, other than a collection of BBC recordings that came out recently.) The famous, barnburning live version of "Conquistador" (a Top 20 hit) is included here, along with other wonderfully rendered Harum classics like "Whaling Stories," "A Salty Dog," "All This And More," and Harum's magnum opus, the 19-minute suite, "In Held Twas In I." Gary Brooker & company play their hearts out, the orchestra & choir perfectly compliment them, and the sound quality is excellent. The only negative is that this is obviously not the complete concert. And no "Whiter Shade Of Pale," either? A BIG ommission, that one. Surely the band have tapes of the complete concert lying around somewhere, so an expanded re-issue of this landmark Procol Harum concert would be *most* appreciated, methinks. But no matter---"Live With The Edmonton Symphony Orchestra" is still a classic live album from one of Britain's finest bands.
