 So, why should you buy "Wind And Wuthering" by Genesis? Because, in my opinion, it's the best album the band has ever made (and Tony Banks, the group's Keyboard King himself, concurs). This album gives me such a joyous rush every time I play it, no joke. To my ears, it's the band's finest work.Arguably the last album by Genesis to truly carry the "prog-rock" moniker, "Wind And Wuthering" simply amazes. They may no longer have Peter Gabriel's incredible contributions, but the songwriting & musical chops on display here by Tony Banks, Mike Rutherford, Phil Collins & Steve Hackett is still breathtaking stuff, nonetheless. Banks' supreme keyboard work is at it's most shimmering on this album. Rutherford's bass-playing is top-notch. Collins' powerhouse drumming & unique singing is superb. And, in his final album with the band, Steve Hackett conjures up some incredible fretboard work, both of the fiery & the gorgeous kind.The music on "Wind & Wuthering" soars ("Eleventh Earl Of Mar," "One For The Vine"), rocks ("Wot Gorilla?", "...In That Quiet Earth"), and also contains some truly beautiful ballads ("Your Own Special Way," "Blood On The Rooftops," and the classic album-closer, "Afterglow"), to create a very special musical palette. I love the band's other albums like "The Lamb," "Duke," et al, but "Wind And Wuthering" is Genesis at the very top of their game. As I've said, "Wind And Wuthering" also happens to be Tony Banks' personal favorite album with the band. Here's a brief quote from the man himself, taken from "The Book Of Genesis" by Hugh Fielder, 1983:"If anyone ever asked me which was my favorite album, I'd say 'Wind And Wuthering.' It's definitely the most musically complex of all our albums, and it has a mysterious quality to it."Hear, hear, well spoken Tony. :-)
