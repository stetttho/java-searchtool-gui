 The 2nd Yes album, 1970's "Time And A Word," saw the band add some orchestral arrangements to some of their songs. Some fans were turned off by it, and even Yes themselves now say they don't think the orchestral touches on the album worked completely (and the band would not take on orchestral accompanyment again until 2001's "Magnification"). Personally, I'm not bothered one bit by the orchestral flourishes. They don't *bury* the band, for heaven's sake, and I think they enhance the songs that they're used on very well. Yes themselves are still the main attraction throughout "Time And A Word," and the album is excellent. It features several of my personal favorite Yes songs, such as the amazing cover of Richie Havens' "No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed," the captivating sounds of "Then," the perfect pop-rock of "Sweet Dreams," the supremely powerful rock of "Astral Traveller" (with a killer guitar riff from Peter Banks), and the great beauty of the closing title track. The band are in top form on "Time And A Word," as they also say goodbye to guitarist Banks, who would be replaced by longtime guitarist Steve Howe shortly after the album's release (SO shortly, in fact, that the original US album cover features a group photo with Howe, even though Banks is the guitarist on the album!). I've always loved "Time And A Word." It's a very strong Yes album, and I highly recommend it.
