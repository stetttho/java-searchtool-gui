 1974's "The Power And The Glory" was the closest Gentle Giant ever got to mainstream success, as it remains their only album to make it into the US Top 50. It is also their masterpiece. After five albums of mostly intricate progressive rock, Gentle Giant simplified things *just a bit* for "The Power And The Glory," making an album that still contained the classic Gentle Giant prog rock sound of yor, but also had a refreshing, slightly more accessible, mainstream feel at the same time. Giving the listener the best of both worlds, the band came up with their greatest album to date. Several GG classics on this one, including "Proclamation" and "So Sincere," the very beautiful "Aspirations" and "No God's A Man," and the fun "Playing The Game." The band sound truly inspired on this one, their performances outstanding. "The Power And The Glory" is Gentle Giant at their very best.
