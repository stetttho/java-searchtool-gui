 "Free Hand" is Gentle Giant's 7th album, and it's also one of their finest. Like their previous album, "The Power And The Glory," "Free Hand" has plenty of masterful progressive rock to spare, but is also quite accessible-sounding in places. These are great songs---all seven of them! Personal favorites include the literally snappy "Just The Same," the vocal brilliance of "On Reflection," the great rock of the title track, and the very beautiful "His Last Voyage." "Free Hand" is a classic Gentle Giant disc. (One last note: I don't understand the complaints about the mix of the One Way Records edition of "Free Hand." The CD sounds pretty awesome to my ears!)
