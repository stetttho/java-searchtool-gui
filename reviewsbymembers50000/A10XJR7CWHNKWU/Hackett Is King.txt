 "The acoustic guitar is a small orchestra housing other instruments," says former Genesis guitarist Steve Hackett. "Pianos, cellos and harps are hidden away beneath it." Steve definitely proves his point with his 1983 acoustic masterwork, "Bay Of Kings." This is an exquisitely gorgeous album, with Steve working his magic touch on acoustic guitar and the occasional dash of keyboard, while brother John Hackett guest stars on flute. Pieces such as the title track, "Kim," "Second Chance," Steve's old Genesis fave "Horizons," and "The Barren Land" simply sparkle. This is wonderfully soothing music, the perfect disc to play for relaxing, or for that all-important quality time with your special someone. "Bay Of Kings" is a marvelous Steve Hackett album.
