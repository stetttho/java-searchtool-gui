 Phil Collins certainly has a lot to be happy about these days. A recent Oscar winner for the "Tarzan" song "You'll Be In My Heart," he's also newly married, and a new father as well. "Testify," Phil's first new solo album in six years, is a reflection of his personal happiness, as the bulk of the songs are obvious love letters to his wife Orianne and their new baby son. But if you're concerned that Phil might have put a little too much "lovey-dovey" material on this album, you needn't worry. "Testify" is a fine Phil Collins album that just gets better & better with repeated listenings. It's light, breezy & simple, with great melodies & emotion. While there's no real *rockers* on display here, the album still has it's share of edgy stuff, like the punch of "Wake Up Call" and the driving electric guitar, gospel choir & Phil's trademark bashing of the drumkit on the masterful title song. "Swing Low" has great mood to it. "This Love This Heart" is a beautiful love song---I'm already thinking of playing it at my wedding! "Driving Me Crazy" is bouncy & appealing, and Phil also serves up an excellent cover of Leo Sayer's "Can't Stop Loving You" (the first single). Phil's classic voice & musical chops remain intact, and the album's sparkling production quality is also a plus.With the whole music business having changed considerably since Phil Collins' glory days of the 80's & early 90's, it's highly unlikely that "Testify" will give Phil any hit singles or multi-platinum album sales. But, as Phil himself has said recently, he's okay with that. And so am I---the man has nothing more to prove to anyone, the new album will sell whatever it sells, and to heck with radio & MTV. I'm just happy to have a new Phil Collins CD at last, and "Testify" is a darn good one. Welcome back, Phil! :-)
