 Album #6 for the Moody Blues, 1971's "Every Good Boy Deserves Favour," is a very beautiful album that features some of the Moodies' spaciest sounding music ever. The opening track, "Procession," is one of the band's most progressive-sounding tracks, complete with UFO sounds, jungle & rain sound effects, chanting, grunting, and the *very first* recorded use of an electronic drumkit (courtesy of drummer Graeme Edge). Guitarist Justin Hayward's "The Story In Your Eyes" is one of the band's most-popular rockers (and they still perform it in concert to this day). This is followed by two lovely songs in the form of flautist Ray Thomas' "Our Guessing Game," and bassist John Lodge's lullaby for his young daughter, "Emily's Song." Graeme Edge's "After You Came" is another fine Moodies rocker, and one of the best songs Edge ever wrote for the group (including a terrific performance on drums, too). Lodge's "One More Time To Live," with it's partial reprise of "Procession," is a very majestic number. Thomas' "Nice To Be Here" is the most lighthearted song on the album---it's practically a children's song---but it's very, very charming. Hayward's "You Can Never Go Home" is a truly gorgeous song, and, finally, there's keyboardist Mike Pinder's "My Song," a very dramatic, haunting piece.The only reason I'm not giving "Every Good Boy" a perfect 5-star rating is because the Moodies lean a little too much on the softer, ballady side with this one, as wonderful as the ballads are. The album really only has two genuine rockers on it---"The Story In Your Eyes" and "After You Came." One or two more rockers would've certainly given the album a better-sounding balance with it's material. Nonetheless, "Every Good Boy Deserves Favour" is still a very lovely, exquisite, classic Moody Blues album. Every good Moodies fan deserves to own it!
