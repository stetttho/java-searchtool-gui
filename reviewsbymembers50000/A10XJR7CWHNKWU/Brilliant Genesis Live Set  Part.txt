 "Live: The Way We Walk Volume Two (The Longs)" picks right up where "Volume One (The Shorts)" left off, giving the Genesis faithful the second half of the band's live material from their 1992 "We Can't Dance" tour, only this time, instead of the hits, we're given the group's longer, 10-minute plus epics, and it firmly puts to rest the ridiculous notion that Genesis completely abandoned their prog-rock leanings in the 80's & 90's. This is totally and utterly false---they simply *added* pop to their prog-rock repertoire. This live set includes a phenomenal, mindblowing 19 1/2 minute medley of early songs mostly culled from the group's Peter Gabriel era, including parts of "The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway," "The Musical Box," and "I Know What I Like." There's also other barnburning performances of later progressive rockers like "Driving The Last Spike," "Domino," "Fading Lights," "Home By The Sea," and finally, a perfect, super-slamming drum duet between Phil Collins and his concert drumming partner, Chester Thompson. As on "Volume One (The Shorts)," "The Longs" is genuine proof that Phil, Chester, keyboardist Tony Banks, guitarist Mike Rutherford, and live co-hort guitarist Daryl Steurmer are truly a live rock force to be reckoned with. These performances are sensational & highly energetic, with the band running like a well-oiled machine, and Phil Collins' singing voice and thunderous work behind the drumkit equally superb. Perhaps not for the casual Genesis listener who only likes the hits--in which case "Volume One (The Shorts)" is all they really need---"Live The Way We Walk Volume Two (The Longs)" is an absolutely spellbinding live set for the diehard Genesis fan. Pick it up, and long live this marvelous band.
