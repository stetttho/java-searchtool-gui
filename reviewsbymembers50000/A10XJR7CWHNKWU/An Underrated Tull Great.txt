 Jethro Tull went through a dark period of sorts making their 1979 album, "Stormwatch." For starters, the health of bassist John Glascock was failing due to a heart ailment, only allowing him to complete three tracks for the album, before Tull leader Ian Anderson took over the bass-playing duties for the rest of the recording (very sadly, Glascock passed away shortly after "Stormwatch" was released). Secondly, "Stormwatch" would also prove to be the last Tull album for longtime members John Evan on keyboards, Barriemore Barlow on drums, and keyboardist/orchestrator David Palmer. The end result is a somewhat darker Jethro Tull album, but it is nonetheless a great one, with some very powerful Tull music throughout. "North Sea Oil," "Orion," and the dramatic "Dark Ages" are all strong Tull rockers, "Dun Ringill" is one of Anderson's most haunting acoustic pieces, "Flying Dutchman" is a memorable tune, and the two instrumentals, "Warm Sporran" and "Elegy" are both excellent. And this remastered edition of "Stormwatch" includes four bonus tracks: the catchy single "A Stitch In Time" (one of the very few instances of Tull using female backup singers), "Crossword" (featuring fine electric piano by John Evan), the charming "Kelpie," and the great jig-inducing ditty, "King Henry's Madrigal." The band are in top form, and Anderson proves himself to be a mean bassist (who knew?). And, of course, the album is a fond farewell to the late, great John Glascock, who contributes fine basslines to Tull for the last time on "Orion," "Flying Dutchman," and "Elegy." "Stormwatch" is a somewhat overlooked Jethro Tull album---it isn't mentioned all that much when fans talk about their favorite albums by the group. Even *I* hadn't played it for many years. But listening to this new remastered edition makes me hear "Stormwatch" in a whole new light. It's an excellent entry in Jethro Tull's catalog.
