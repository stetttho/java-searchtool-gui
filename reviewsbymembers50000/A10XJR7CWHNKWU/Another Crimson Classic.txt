 1974's "Starless And Bible Black" is the second King Crimson album to feature bassist/singer John Wetton, drummer Bill Bruford and violinist David Cross alongside band leader/guitar wiz Robert Fripp, and it's a great one. Powerful, bone-crunching prog-rock from start to finish, including such Crimson classics as "The Great Deceiver," "Lament," "The Mincer," the epic title track, and the even more epic finale, "Fracture," with the band's performances throughout simply monstrous. A killer slab of classic progressive rock, "Starless And Bible Black" is one of King Crimson's best albums.
