 I was very blessed to see Paul McCartney on his most recent tour, and it was without question one of the greatest concerts that I have ever attended. Paul & his band were simply outstanding, and you couldn't have asked for a better setlist from the man---all those Beatles classics, plus Wings stuff, and a pair of tunes from Paul's wonderful "Driving Rain" disc, all rendered with a lot of love & musical magic. And Paul's loving tributes to John Lennon & George Harrison, "Here Today," & "Something" played on the ukelele, had me in tears. An absolutely FAB night. "Back In The U.S. Live 2002" brings you Paul's amazing concert in it's entirety, albeit without Paul's inbetween song introductions (presumably to make this 2CD live set a little tighter, which is understandable). If you attended any of the shows, then "Back In The U.S." is a priceless souvenir. If you weren't able to get a ticket, then get this album and find out for yourself what made this particular McCartney tour so special. Either way, "Back In The U.S." is a marvelous live document of a re-energised Paul McCartney at the peak of his live powers. Rock on, Sir Paul! :-)
