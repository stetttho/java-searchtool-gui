 Recorded on the European leg of their tour in support of their "Heavy Horses" album, Jethro Tull's live album "Bursting Out" is a terrific concert recording of Ian Anderson & the boys, covering material from their 2nd album "Stand Up" straight through to "Heavy Horses." The band---Anderson, Martin Barre, John Glascock, John Evan, David Palmer and Barriemore Barlow---sound tremendous on such favorites as "Sweet Dream," "Songs From The Wood," "Minstrel In The Gallery," "Aqualung," and a powerful 12-minute excerpt from the group's epic, "Thick As A Brick." Anderson also makes for a fabulous, funny master of ceremonies, and the album's sound quality has been improved as well. The previous CD version of "Bursting Out" ommitted three tracks---"Sweet Dream," "Conundrum," and "Quatrain"---in order to squeeze the album onto a single CD, but this new remaster restores this double album to it's two-disc entirety, which is great. If you're a big Jethro Tull buff, then "Bursting Out" is a total must-have.
