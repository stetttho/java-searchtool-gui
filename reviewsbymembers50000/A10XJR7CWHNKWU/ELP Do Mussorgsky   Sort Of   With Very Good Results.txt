 A controversial 1972 live album by Emerson Lake & Palmer, "Pictures At An Exibition" finds ELP tackling Mussorgsky's all-time classic---sort of---and interspersing it with their own compositions. Classical purists have balked for over 30 years that ELP desecrated Mussorgsky's original work with this album. I say let 'em balk. Okay, so this is not a faithful, note-for-note rendition of "Pictures." It is, instead, a rock adaptation of the piece. Who the heck knows what Mussorgsky himself would've thought of it. All I know is that *I* think ELP's version of "Pictures" is very, very good. It's not perfect, but it sure is a lively, entertaining prog-rock take on it. The trio play the material with great passion, and the band's own bits fit in with the "Pictures" stuff just fine. Especially memorable are "Promenade" (music by Mussorgsky, lyrics by Greg Lake), Lake's beautiful acoustic ballad "The Sage," the tight instrumental "Blues Variations," the rockin' "Curse Of Baba Yaga," and the triumphant closer, "The Great Gates Of Kiev." And the "encore" track that ends the album, "Nutrocker," is great fun. You gotta hand it to Keith Emerson, Greg Lake & Carl Palmer for doing something no other prog-rock group would dare to attempt. I won't argue with anyone who doesn't like ELP's "Pictures At An Exibition," as it's not for everybody. But for all you open-minded listeners out there, this album is a classical/rock treat. As for the classical purists, feel free to move on. There's a whole ton of traditional recordings of "Pictures" available to you.
