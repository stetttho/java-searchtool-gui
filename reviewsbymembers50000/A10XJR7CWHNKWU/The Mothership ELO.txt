 The Electric Light Orchestra were totally in their element when they released their classic 1977 double album, "Out Of The Blue." This is a super album with many great ELO tunes, and it successfully sustains itself for over 70 minutes without once ever lagging. Frontman Jeff Lynne came up with a great wealth of material for this one, including such classics as "Turn To Stone," "Sweet Talkin' Woman" and "Mr. Blue Sky," but also such gems as "It's Over," "Night In The City," the light piano funk of "Starlight," the rhythmic "Jungle," "Standin' In The Rain," the beautiful "Big Wheels," the dreamy instrumental "The Whale," and the rockin' "Burmingham Blues." The songs are all very catchy, the orchestral flourishes throughout are suitably lush, and the album's production is sparkly (and dig that album cover artwork, especially on the inside). There are those who say that "Out Of The Blue" is too over-the-top, i.e. that a double dose of ELO's symphonic pop-rock is a little too much to take. All I can say is this: either you like ELO or you don't. If you DO like ELO, than "Out Of The Blue" will fit the bill in your CD collection just fine. It's one of the band's greatest works, and I guarantee you'll love it. (NOTE: there's a tracking error on the "Out Of The Blue" CD, as the song "Standin' In The Rain," which should be track 10, has been mistakenly tacked on to the end of track 9, which is "Steppin' Out," so you'll have to cue up "Steppin' Out" and fast forward to the 4:39 mark if you want to immediately get to "Standin' In The Rain." Just thought you should know!)
