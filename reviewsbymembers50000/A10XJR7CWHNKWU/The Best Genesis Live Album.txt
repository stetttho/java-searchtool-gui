 "Seconds Out," Genesis' 1977 double live album, is arguably their best live album, and it's also one of the best live albums ever made. The band roar through many of their prog rock gems dating from 1971 to 1976, such as "The Carpet Crawlers," "Firth Of Fifth," "Squonk," and their 25-minute magnum opus, "Supper's Ready," all played with tremendous power & precision. Listening to this live set, you can *feel* the band's live electricity. "Seconds Out" is also a marvelous opportunity to hear Phil Collins' excellent vocal interpretations of Peter Gabriel-era material. Phil steps up to the mike with gusto, and does great justice to the Gabriel-era songs, as well as the post-Gabriel stuff. "Seconds Out" is brilliant live Genesis from start to finish. The band's stunning, unforgettable performance of "Supper's Ready" alone is worth the price of admission, but all the way around, this is truly an outstanding concert. "Seconds Out" is also a fond farewell to guitarist Steve Hackett, who left Genesis around the time of this live album's release. So, what are you waiting for? Buy it, and experience Genesis in all of their live prog rock glory. :-)
