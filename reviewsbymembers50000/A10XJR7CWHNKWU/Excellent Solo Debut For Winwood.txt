 Unfairly overlooked by many of his fans, Steve Winwood's self-titled debut solo album from 1977 is a wonderful smooth-groover, filled with melodic songs and excellent musical chops. If some of the album sounds like Winwood's old band Traffic, it's because four of the six songs were co-written by Winwood's partner in Traffic, drummer Jim Capaldi, and Traffic percussionist Rebop Kwaku-Baah also plays on a couple of tracks. But hey, I'm certainly not complaining! "Hold On" is a catchy, Steely Dan-esque number, and "Time Is Running Out," featuring Capaldi & Kwaku-Baah, is a punchy pop-rocker that wouldn't have sounded out of place on a Traffic album. "Midland Maniac," on which Winwood plays all the instruments, is a lovely piano-popper, as is "Vacant Chair." "Luck's In" is a smokin' tune, with a killer, Traffic-esque jam at the end. And "Let Me Make Something In Your Life" is a perfect ballad. Although it would take Steve Winwood one more album to truly establish himself as a solo artist, which he did with his 1980 hit release "Arc Of A Diver," his self-titled solo debut is a truly excellent album, and I sincerely hope that more of Steve's fans will check it out. I guarantee you'll like it.
