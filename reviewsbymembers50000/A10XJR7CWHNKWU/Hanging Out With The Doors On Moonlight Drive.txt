 The Doors second album, "Strange Days," is an excellent follow-up to their self-titled debut, with several classic Doors tunes on it. Jim Morrison, Ray Manzarek, Robby Krieger and John Densmore totally shine on tracks like the spooky title song, the catchy blues-rock of "Love Me Two Times" and "Moonlight Drive," the haunting "You're Lost Little Girl," the driving rock of "My Eyes Have Seen You," and, of course, the 11-minute rock epic that is "When The Music's Over," with Jim and the boys really stretching out on their respective instruments with gusto. Only the poem "Horse Latitudes," with Morrison shouting the words over jarring, chaotic noises, is a little hard to take. Thankfully, it's only 1 1/2 minutes long. But other than that, "Strange Days" is a great, essential album in the Doors' catalog.
