 1979's "Discovery" was another smash album for the Electric Light Orchestra, a catchy confection of discofied pop-rock. For this album, the band had shrunk down from a sextet to a quartet, but musically Jeff Lynne & company were still at the top of their game with such irresistible classics as "Shine A Little Love," "Last Train To London," and "Don't Bring Me Down." Other standouts include the humourous "Diary Of Horace Wimp" (a somewhat maligned track, but I think it's fun), and the beautiful "Wishing." I don't understand the criticism of this album being "uneven"---as far as I'm concerned, "Discovery" is a great entry in the ELO catalog.
