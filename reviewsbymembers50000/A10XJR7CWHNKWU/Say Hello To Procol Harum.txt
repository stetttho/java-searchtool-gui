 This is the 1967 self-titled debut for Procol Harum (also released as "A Whiter Shade Of Pale"), and it's one of their all-time greatest works. Along with The Moody Blues' "Nights In White Satin," Procol Harum helped introduce classical rock to the world with their smash hit, "A Whiter Shade Of Pale." Their hybrid of organ/piano rock mixed with touches of classical elements, along with the commanding voice of singer/pianist Gary Brooker, is a winning combination that still sets this marvelous band apart from all the rest. Their 1967 debut is a brilliant album, featuring not only the all-time classic "Whiter Shade..." but also other marvelous songs like "Conquistador" (later a hit in a live version), "She Wandered Through The Garden Fence," the outrageous fun of "Mabel," the rocking "Cerdes (Outside The Gates Of)", "A Christmas Camel," "Kaleidoscope," and organist Matthew Fisher's signature instrumental, "Repent Walpurgis." All of the band members are outstanding musicians, not only Brooker & Fisher but also guitarist Robin Trower, drummer B.J. Wilson and bassist David Knights, while Keith Reid's lyrics are true poetry. Still going strong 36 years later, Procol Harum are a rock institution, and still one of the world's finest bands. They couldn't have had a better album to launch into the musical world with: "Procol Harum" is a definite rock classic.
