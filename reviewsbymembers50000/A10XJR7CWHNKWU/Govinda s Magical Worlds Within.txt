 Wow....I don't think an album has entranced me this much since the first Enigma album from 1990....no, change that: since 1994's "Pure" by The Golden Palominos....Anyway, I'm a total newbie to the music of Govinda (real name Shane O'Madden). I came across "Worlds Within" while it was playing in a music store recently, and I was instantly hooked on it. This is a *fantastic* album: hypnotic, seductive, sensual, hypnotising, atmospheric....in other words, the kind of music I absolutely go for. The way Govinda weaves dub, electronica, world, pop, and new age into one glorious tapestry of music is just breathtaking. I can't even spotlight a single track for you: "Worlds Within" comes across to me like a single, 53-minute musical opus divided into twelve parts. All I can tell you is that this is magnificently sensual music. Govinda is a brilliantly talented musician, composer & producer, and I definitely plan to check out some more of his work. In the meantime, buy "Worlds Within." Turn out the lights, and enjoy.
