 1982's "Lead Me To The Water" is the second solo album for Procol Harum frontman Gary Brooker, and it is also his best solo album to date. For "Lead Me To The Water," Brooker turns up the rock feel a little bit more, and he also gets help in the studio from such star players as George Harrison and Eric Clapton on guitars, and Phil Collins on drums. It's a terrific album, with great tracks such as "Mineral Man" (with great guitar licks and percussion from Harrison and Collins, respectively), "Hang On Rose," "The Cycle," the reggae-flavored title song, "Low Flying Birds," and the excellent "Sympathy For The Hard Of Hearing." It's a hard CD to locate these days, but diehard Harum/Gary Brooker fans will love it. Definitely seek out "Lead Me To The Water." (NOTE: Brooker recorded a third solo album in 1985 called "Echoes In The Night," which is also a difficult album to find on CD lately. But it's also a great disc and totally worth getting, just like all of Gary's wonderful music, whether solo or with Procol Harum).
