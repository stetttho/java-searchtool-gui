 Brand X's fourth album, 1978's "Masques," saw this outstanding progressive jazz/rock group go through a line-up change. Drummer Phil Collins was too busy touring with Genesis in support of their just-released album, "And Then There Were Three," so Chuck Burgi filled in on the drumkit. Keyboardist Robin Lumley decided to step away from the keyboards and produce the album instead---though I haven't a clue why---and his place was taken by keyboardist Peter Robinson. But both Burgi and Robinson fit the bill perfectly, as "Masques" remains a major highlight in Brand X's catalog. The material is very strong, and the band's performances are sizzling. Standouts include the hard-driving jazz/rock of "The Poke," the gorgeous "Black Moon," the incredible workout "Access To Data," and the spooky fun of "The Ghost Of Mayfield Lodge." Fabulous jams, and awesome music all the way around. Brand X's "Masques" is one of the group's very best releases.
