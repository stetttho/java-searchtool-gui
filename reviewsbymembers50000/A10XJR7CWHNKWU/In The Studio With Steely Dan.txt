 After their 1974 tour for "Pretzel Logic" was finished, Steely Dan masterminds Walter Becker and Donald Fagen retired from the touring grind (well, for 19 years), and made the recording studio their exclusive playground for the next several albums. Keeping onboard their guitarist Denny Dias and producer Gary Katz, and hooking up with drummer Jeff Porcaro and a young backup singer named Michael McDonald, Steely Dan recorded 1975's "Katy Lied," an instant Dan classic and certainly the band's best *sounding* album up to that point. Once again, the Dan deliver a sparkling, handsome hybrid of rock, jazz, and pop, with one awesome confection after another, such as the rocking "Black Friday," the funky "Daddy Don't Live In That New York City No More," the reflective "Bad Sneakers," the fun "Everyone's Gone To The Movies," the very-cool re-recording/re-arrangement of "Your Gold Teeth," and the excellent jazz/pop of "Doctor Wu" and "Any World (That I'm Welcome To)". A tremendous melodic beauty from end to end, "Katy Lied" is yet another in a long line of classic, must-own Steely Dan albums.
