 For me, Enigma's fourth album, "The Screen Behind The Mirror," released at the beginning of 2000, was the first GREAT album released in the New Millenium (okay, so the New Millenium really began in 2001, but why not cheat a little?). Once again, Enigma mastermind Michael Cretu turns in a glorious mix of ambient sounds, world music, opera samples, choir voices, slammin' beats, and keyboard-heavy progressive rock. "The Screen Behind The Mirror" is also a slight improvement over it's predecessor, the laid-back "Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi" (though I like that album just fine). This is a tougher-sounding Enigma, and the tunes definitely contain a lot of punch. Many brilliant tracks on this one, including "Push The Limits," "Gravity Of Love" (featuring a very clever sample of Orff's "Carmina Burana' and sung by Olive's Ruth-Ann), the powerful "Modern Crusaders," the hypnotic title instrumental & "Endless Quest," and the memorable final song "Silence Must Be Heard" (with another great vocal by Ruth-Ann). Fabulous production & sound, terrific instrumental work by Cretu & guitarist Jens Gad, and strong vocals by Ruth-Ann, Andru Donalds and Cretu, and sultry guest vocals by Sandra Cretu and Elisabeth Houghton. Enigma's "The Screen Behind The Mirror" is another sparkling album from this brilliant studio group.
