 The classic album cover says it all---Frank Sinatra, with his trademark cigarette burning, standing on a lonely street late at night, looking down and reflecting about a lost love. 1955's "In The Wee Small Hours" is a masterpiece on many levels. His first 12-inch long player (his previous records were 10-inch albums & 45 singles), and inspired by his painful breakup with Ava Gardner, Sinatra came up with this beautiful concept album about love and the loss of it. With exquisite orchestrations by Nelson Riddle, Sinatra pours his heart out into these 16 moody, perfectly selected tunes, bringing a musical cohesiveness to it that hangs together from the first song to the last. Singing from his soul, Sinatra's signature voice has arguably never been more rich or more full of feeling than on this album. With such lovely, meaningful songs as "In The Wee Small Hours Of The Morning," "I Get Along Without You Very Well," "When Your Lover Has Gone," "What Is This Thing Called Love," "Dancing On The Ceiling," and the concluding "This Love Of Mine" (for which Sinatra received a rare co-writing credit), and rendered by Sinatra with all the emotion he can muster, your heart just aches for the guy. Sinatra has many brilliant albums to his credit, including many that are certainly more upbeat and happier-sounding than this one ("Songs For Swingin' Lovers" is the epitome of that). But "In The Wee Small Hours" stands out as a truly special, landmark Sinatra recording, as Frank allows the listener to peak inside his very soul. A beautiful, highly-essential album.
