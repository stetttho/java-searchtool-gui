 1975's "Voyage Of The Acolyte" was the debut solo album for Genesis guitarist Steve Hackett, recorded two years before he left the band. In my opinion, "Voyage Of The Acolyte" remains his best solo work to date. "Acolyte" is an absolutely gorgeous album, with Steve magically weaving rock with classical, creating a perfect prog-rock palette of moods, feelings, and sounds. The album also boasts excellent production & phenomenal musicianship, not only from Steve (whose guitar work here is sensational) but also from his Genesis co-horts Mike Rutherford on bass and Phil Collins on drums, and his brother John Hackett on flute. Powerful rockers include "Ace Of Wands," "A Tower Struck Down" and the closing section of "Shadow Of The Hierophant," while "Star Of Sirius" (featuring lead vocals from Phil) is wonderful prog-pop. Exquisitely beautiful pieces include "Hands Of The Priestess Parts I & II," "The Hermit" (with lead vocals by Steve) and the opening section of "Hierophant," with a lovely vocal by Sally Oldfield. "Voyage Of The Acolyte" is Steve Hackett's masterpiece, an album that sounds just as fresh now as it did 30 years ago. No diehard fan of Steve's or Genesis or progressive rock in general should do without it.
