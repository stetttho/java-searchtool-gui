 Most Supertramp fans point to "Breakfast In America" as the group's masterpiece. Well, "Breakfast" IS a classic Tramp album, and it is without question their biggest seller, but I've always leaned more toward "Crisis? What Crisis?" as the band's best album from their days with Roger Hodgson. This is such an uplifting album to play, containing arguably the best material from the Hodgson/Rick Davies singing/songwriting team. Hodgson's "Sister Moonshine," "Lady," and the jig-inducing "The Meaning" are such incredible songs, "Another Soapbox Opera" has great mood to it, and Hodgson's album bookends "Easy Does It" & "Two Of Us" are both very lovely. The man has a classic falsetto voice, and is terrific on guitar & keyboards, too. Meanwhile, Davies, no slouch on vocals or piano either, steps up to the plate with the instant Tramp classics "Ain't Nobody But Me" & "Another Man's Woman," while "Poor Boy" is a wonderfully light, breezy number guaranteed to make you smile. And the two men come together for the excellent dramatic piece, "Just A Normal Day." Both Hodgson & Davies truly shine on this album, and they're brilliantly augmented by sax man John Helliwell, drummer Bob Seibenberg and bassist Dougie Thomson. And to top it off, the album has been remastered for superior sound quality, which makes this CD all the more sweeter."Crisis? What Crisis?" is a superb Supertramp album, one that I can't recommend enough. "Breakfast In America" may have the popular vote, but for me, THIS album is The Big One from the Roger Hodgson era. :-)
