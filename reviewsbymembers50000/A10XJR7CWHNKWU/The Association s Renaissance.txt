 "Renaissance" is the Association's 2nd album, and, once more, these guys deliver the goods with catchy, inventive, memorable pop songs and truly unique vocal harmonies. I really, really dig this band. "Renaissance" features a couple of Association hits, albeit minor ones: the lovely "No Fair At All," and the spectacular psychedelia of "Pandora's Golden Heebie Jeebies," one of the band's very best confections. But there are many more first-rate songs, including "I'm The One," "Memories Of You," "Angeline," "Looking Glass," and "You Hear Me Call Your Name." I'm very, very happy to see most of the Association's catalog available in North America at last, and "Renaissance" is definitely a major highlight for this remarkable group. So pick it up, and enjoy the superb sounds of the Association!
