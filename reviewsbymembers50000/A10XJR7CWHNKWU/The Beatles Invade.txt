 It's been 40 years to the day that the Beatles made their historic appearance on the Ed Sullivan show, so it's only fitting that I choose this very special day to review the Beatles' second album, "With The Beatles." Featuring 8 Beatles originals and 6 cover tunes, "With The Beatles" can be summed up in three words: fun, fun, FUN! The Fab Four's energy, and their wonderful musical & vocal chemistry is very apparent on this album. No wonder America fell under the group's spell so quickly! Many Beatles classics are on this one: Lennon/McCartney's "It Won't Be Long," "All I've Got To Do," "All My Loving," "Little Child," "Hold Me Tight," "I Wanna Be Your Man" (with Ringo on lead vocals), and "Not A Second Time." George Harrison makes his songwriting debut with his excellent number, "Don't Bother Me." And the Beatles once again show their knack for covering other people's songs so brilliantly on the tracks "'Til There Was You," "Please Mister Postman," "Roll Over Beethoven" (with vocals by Harrison),"You Really Got A Hold On Me," "Devil In Her Heart," and the great rockin' rave-up, "Money." "With The Beatles" is a Beatles classic that captures this beloved, pioneering group at the height of Beatlemania. So buy it, put it on, crank it up, and have your very own Beatles screamfest. Happy 40th, lads!
