 1970's "Benefit" is Jethro Tull's third album, and this one is truly something special. Ian Anderson & company continue to expand their musical horizons---with "Aqualung" just around the corner---and deliver an album that combines truly powerful rock with great acoustic numbers. Lots of Tull faves on this one, such as "With You There To Help Me," "Nothing To Say," "Son," "To Cry You A Song," "Inside," "Sossity, You're A Woman," and, what is quite possibly my all-time favorite Tull song ever, the stunningly beautiful "For Michael Collins, Jeffrey And Me." This new remastered CD of "Benefit" sounds incredible, and generously adds four bonus tracks, too, including the Tull classics "Witch's Promise" and "Teacher." Ian Anderson's songwriting is phenomenal, as is his singing and performances on flute and guitar. Martin Barre plays some truly scorching electric guitar thoughout, bassist Glenn Cornick (in his final album with the band) serves up some excellent basslines, drummer Clive Bunker does incredible work on the skins, and making his debut with Tull is keyboardist John Evan, who lends great support on keyboards and piano (though he isn't pictured with the rest of the band on the album cover). "Benefit" is one of Jethro Tull's most inspired works.
