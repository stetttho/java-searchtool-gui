 I always thought ABC were one of the better bands to come out of the 80's. The British group, led by powerful singer Martin Fry, had a great knack for excellent, romantic pop (and, I gotta give 'em credit, they were also snappy dressers---remember those gold suits they wore?). This collection contains their best-known songs, and they're all winners. "Look Of Love," "Poison Arrow," "All Of My Heart," "That Was Then This Is Now," "Be Near Me," "When Smokey Sings," they're all here. I just love the band's tunefulness, the romanticism of their music, and Martin Fry's rich voice. The 80's DID have some great bands, and ABC were definitely one of the best to come out of that MTV decade. This CD collection is the proof of that.
