 Composer & multi-instrumentalist Paul Hardcastle hits another home run out of the park with his latest release, "Jazzmasters 4," a delicious smooth groove album that will easily leave you hungry for more. The moods, melodies, sounds, beats, atmospheres, and spiritual vibes that Paul can conjure up with his songwriting, production skills, keyboards and other instruments is pure musical perfection, and enhanced all the more so by his soulful partner in crime, vocalist Helen Rogers. Sparkling tracks that have "Cool" tattooed all over them make up this marvelous platter of music. Personal favorites include pristine instrumentals like "Valley Of The Harps" and "Signs Of Life (Still Searching)," dreamy songs like "Feeling Blue," the beautiful "Lifetime," and the totally cosmic "Emerald Stardust," as well as irresistibly catchy tunes like "Time 4 Living," and "Quiet Groove." I must also give special mention to the album's grand finale, "If You Knew," a rap song collaboration between Paul and a rapper from Wisconsin named Kid Crab, who wrote a rap about his life & dreams over Paul's instrumental, "Peace On Earth." Even if you don't like rap music in general, this "smooth jazz rap" concoction works wonderfully well, combining Paul's brilliant music with Kid Crab's heartfelt story, and commanding performance at the mike. Heck, this could even be a hit single. Any radio programmers out there reading this review? Add "If You Knew" to your playlists now! With "Jazzmasters 4," Paul Hardcastle once again proves that he's the undisputed King Of Smooth Jazz.
