 1974's "Red" is King Crimson's seventh album, and the last one they made before disbanding for seven years. The core of the band was now reduced to a trio---guitarist Robert Fripp, bassist/vocalist John Wetton and drummer Bill Bruford, although the group are augmented on the album by such players as David Cross on violin and Mel Collins on sax. "Red" is another Crimson classic, featuring tough-as-nails prog rock and great musical beauty as only Crimson can do it. The title track is a scorching instrumental rocker, one of Crimson's best and most enduring numbers. "Fallen Angel" and "One More Red Nightmare" also flex some tremendous musical muscle. "Providence" is a very intriguing improvisational piece, and the 12-minute finale, "Starless," is a great, powerful song, with an excellent vocal from Wetton. At the time, "Red" seemed to mark the end of King Crimson, with Robert Fripp eager to move on to other projects. But Fripp, thankfully, would resurrect the band in 1981 with "Discipline" (featuring the debuts of guitarist/vocalist Adrian Belew and bassist Tony Levin). Although time proved that it *wasn't* the end for this great band, King Crimson closed out the first phase of their enduring career with "Red," a fantastic Crimson album all the way.
