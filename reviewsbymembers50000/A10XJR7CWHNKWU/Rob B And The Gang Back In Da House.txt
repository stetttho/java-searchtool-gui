 Like many other diehard Stereo MC's fan, I've patiently waited for the group's follow-up to their hit 1992 album, "Connected." The wait turned out to be NINE YEARS long, with only the tasty 1998 nugget from "The Avengers" movie soundtrack, "Flash," being any indication that the Stereo MC's, were, in fact, working on material for a new album. But at least Rob Birch & company haven't been idle all this time. They also work as DJ's and producers for other acts, and they run their own record label, too, so progress on the new album was sporadic at best, with the band working on the album off and on over the past few years whenever their various schedules would allow studio time.But here we are in the year 2001, and the new Stereo MC's album, "Deep Down & Dirty," is FINALLY here at last. Was it worth the wait? Absolutely---it's like the group never left! "Deep Down & Dirty" immediately reminded me why I dig this group so much---they're the only act I can think of who can blend rap & hip-hop with dance grooves and rockin' beats into a truly irresistible shake-your-booty melting pot of music and rhythm & do it so intelligently. I can never get enough of Rob B's charismatic, commanding voice, with his unique half-sung, half-rapped approach, or the incredible samples, grooves, and production to the band's music. The Stereo MC's are a slammin' studio collective, and after a nine-year sabbatical, "Deep Down & Dirty" is an excellent reminder of what the Stereo MC's are capable of.Click on any one of the audio samples and hear for yourself what I'm talking about. "Deep Down & Dirty" will have you bobbing your head in no time. The Stereo MC's are back, y'all---put on this groovy new CD and celebrate!
