 1974's "Welcome Back My Friends To The Show That Never Ends" captures Emerson, Lake & Palmer live in all of their grandiose, progressive-rock glory, while the trio were on tour for their 1973 classic, "Brain Salad Surgery." Originally a *triple* live vinyl album upon it's original release, "Welcome Back" has got it all for the diehard ELP follower: Keith Emerson's show-offy keyboard & synthesizer workouts, Greg Lake's omnipresent bass, voice, and guitar, and Carl Palmer smacking up a storm upon his mighty drumkit. The trio are a powerful force live in concert, and the album is worth getting just for their amazing, complete performances of their epics "Tarkus" and "Karn Evil 9." But, of course, no ELP live recording would be complete without a solo spotlight for each band member: Emerson's "Piano Improvisations" are outstanding, Lake is terrific with his beautiful acoustic renderings of "Still...You Turn Me On" and "Lucky Man," and Palmer delivers a powerful, extended drum solo (complete with gong) on "Karn Evil 9: First Impression." "Welcome Back My Friends To The Show That Never Ends" is an essential purchase---and a mindblowing live album---for the Emerson, Lake & Palmer faithful.
