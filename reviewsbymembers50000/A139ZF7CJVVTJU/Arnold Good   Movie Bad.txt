 There is very little of redeeming value in this movie. The plot-line, a translation of the book of Revelations so loose its laughable, is made even more unbearable by clunky and melodramatic dialogue. Although Arnold Schwarzenegger does some of the best character work in his career here, it is muddled by lopsided drama and action which just plain isn't. The pace of the show, despite the multiple and gratuitous violence, still never surpasses a struggling limp, and the movie is forced to rely on stunning special effects (I'll admit, they're good) and some big names (Gabriel Byrne and Kevin Pollack) to boost viewership. Byrne's performance as Satan seems phoned-in, and the spiritual struggle of Arnold--which could have saved the show, were it better written--is lost in a deluge of dramatic explosions, dopey double-crosses, and flammable demon pee, only to be revived at the last moment in a sort of "oops, almost forgot" by the directors, writers, and, unfortunately, Arnold himself.
