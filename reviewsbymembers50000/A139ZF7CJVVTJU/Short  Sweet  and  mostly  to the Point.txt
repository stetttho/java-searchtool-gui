 This book is easy to read. You could finish it in an hour. Some of you, thirty minutes. It's like a brand new medicine with an Easy-Swallow coating.    And medicine it is. This book WILL jump-start you. It won't give you the gas you need, or show you the road to take, or turn the wheel for you, but it will get your motor running. All that other stuff, it points out, you have to do.    Pressfield is quite concise, and he has a plan for the book, and he fullfills it almost flawlessly and with very little diversion. I say "almost" and "very little" because, at one point, he gets off track.    This is the point where he discusses religion (specifically fundamentalism---and not just of Christianity, but of any ancient doctrine). Religion, he acquiesces, is useful and even somewhat necessary, but it is not the be-all and end-all of any life.     Perhaps his point would've been better suited for his purposes if he'd done a better job of explaining his reasons and excuses, but, ultimately, all he does is advocate his own type of fundamentalism, or rather, his own type of religion. And even then, contrasted with his rather half-hearted condemnation of fundamentalism (in all its forms), his attempts at clarifying his point miss the mark entirely, so that, for an odd and about 15-page moment in the middle of the book, he sounds like an amnesiatic priest who believes strongly in something, but can't quite explain what it is, exactly.    Other than that, the book works, and despite his liberal use of cliched quotes and other people's insights, it may just be the kick-start you need to get your butt off the couch and into the winning side of the war.
