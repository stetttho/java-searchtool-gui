 I will start this review by saying that the dust jacket claims that Mr. Shepherd writes his book in the attic of the home he shares with his wife, while in his Acknowledgements, the author claims that he writes in his basement.  I know.  This seems mundane and trivial, but I believe this silly little discrepancy is like a billboard for everything that's wrong with the book.  Mr. Shepherd can't decide which is cooler: the attic or the basement.  Because this book is all about cool.  Consider this phrase from the novel's opening line:  "brain belch of accidental brilliance".  Apart from being an inherent contradiction in terms, this phrase also sums up much of what's wrong with Mr. Shepherd's prose.  He can't decide what to say or how to say it.  There are parts that are undeniably well written -- a paragraph here, a line there -- but there are also times where the novel actually repeats itself and its descriptions.  Likewise, the tone varies from the hip and tongue-in-cheek voice of a ne'er-do-well to the lofty proclomations of a formal, literary narrator.  Again, the author doesn't know what to sound like.  While the basic premise is moderately intriguing, it is made monotonous and trite by this uneven writing and the unsalvagable dialogue.  Every character sounds the same: like the confused, yet pleased-with-himself author.  And finally, the premise, I said, was intriguing, but the story is absolutely ridiculous.  Sure, Mr. Shepherd has captured high school's idiosyncracies quite well (in addition to his own distaste for teenagers), but the tale just doesn't hang on these well-written backdrops with anything close to approaching believability.  Henry's experiences with the Girl of His Dreams, his reasons for becoming the Assassin, his reasons for writing The List, well, it's all melodramatic sophism, and it plays out weakly.  Ignore this pretentious and contrived first novel of "redemption."  Instead, check out Invisible Monsters or Motherless Brooklyn.
