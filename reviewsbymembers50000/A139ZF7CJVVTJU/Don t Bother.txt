 Saul is a competent writer.  Although his style staggers some when he attempts to get prosaic (I'm thinking of the dozen or so times he tries to describe the pretty sunsets/weather in the book), his craft is not bad.  It isn't exceptionally good, but it doesn't grate.  It gets the job done, and to that end, I applaud his workmanship.  The plot of this particular tale, however, is nothing more than a hastily strung together conglomeration of stories that have been done to death before him, and done better.  Even for a reader searching for nothing more than a good, diverting tale, this book is unfullfilling.  What you have here, essentially, is a ghost story featuring young high-schooler Matt Moore, and his stressed and depressed mother, Joan, both of whom are alternately plagued by Joan's vicious mother, Emily, the spectre of Joan's dead sister, Cynthia, and an entire town's hate and accusations, once the bodies start piling up (or, in most cases, just disappearing).  Rote and tired tales can still be done well, but in this case, Saul has diluted the strength of his story with dull repetition (Matt's inner dialogues of self-doubt, for example, occur far too often and compose a good 1/6th of the 400 pg book), clumsy editing, and a few rather silly plot contrivances (I'm thinking of the final explanation for the deer hunting accident).  He does a great job of setting up audience sympathies (particularly when he relates Emily's unmotherly tendency towards violence, and when he shows us the townsfolk's unfounded hatred of Matt), but those sympathies are betrayed by an ending that is watered down and, alternately, unnecessary.  Especially the last three pages.  If you want a good ghost story, try King's Bag of Bones.  At the very least, don't try here.  No offense, Saul.  But, hey, you gave it a good shot.
