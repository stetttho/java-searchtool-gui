 In spite of its literary brilliance and its narrative genius, there will be people who won't like Boston?.  I don't say this as a lofty proclamation or to cast aspersions on those folks.  Consider a five-star restaurant's most expensive and well-touted fresh salmon entree.  It may, in fact, be a meal of the highest quality and finest ingredients, but, hey, some people just don't like fish.  This book is populated by intriguing characters (our artistically brilliant and unnamed protagonist's goal is to assassinate God, if that tells you anything) with curious and delicate lives that flirt with the fringes of madness before plunging in headlong.  It is really pointless to try to explain the basic plot, since it holds no more prominence than the philosophical inquiries and didactic ponderings that motivate it.  These underlying ideas never drag the story down, as one might suspect, although they are probably at fault when it comes to why some might like this meal and some might flat out reject.  In kind, the ending does leave something to be desired, since it is a resolution of the ambiguous kind.  Greenan doesn't kowtow to fortune cookie solutions, and he leaves the point of the book (as well as the answer to those inquiries and ponderings) in the hands of the reader, who may either be delighted to answer, or disgusted with the presumption.  Again, it's a matter of taste.  I, for one, was licking my fingers when I was done.
