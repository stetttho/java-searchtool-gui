 Bonnie cleans up crime scenes.  Bonnie cleans up some really nasty crime scenes.  Bonnie Winters is the heroine of this novella by Graham Masteron, and Bonnie Winters is not doing so well.  This isn't what I would call a horror book, or even a thriller.  It is more of a psychological drama.  Masterton has expertly, in the space of 200 pages (if you buy paperback), woven a tight, brilliantly paced story about Bonnie, her life's work, and her life's ruin.  Although what details Masterton chooses to include are sometimes confusing, they all create a flawless and suspenseful tableaux of one woman's normal, albeit desperately tragic life.  There is gore here, but pretty much only in the spare descriptions of the crime scenes which Bonnie cleans every day.  The true horror and the true trauma are hidden, quite cleverly, in Bonnie's day-to-day interactions.  I couldn't say enough how the startlingly realistic dialogue, how the vivid characters, and how the brilliant display of episodic discrimination lends this novella an enrapturing and consuming quality.  Although Bonnie's tale eventually succumbs to some melodrama and a few out-there hijinks, the reader is prepared for these.  And, in this case, it is more Graham's finely-tuned storytelling that is the draw, rather than the exact story which he is telling.  The creation of an atmosphere of tension and the release it is eventually given is as concise and powerful as Masterton's short and aptly titled chapters.  Pick this book up, and you will not put it down.
