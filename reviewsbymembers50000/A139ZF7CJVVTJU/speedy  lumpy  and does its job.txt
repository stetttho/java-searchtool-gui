 Kirsten Lord's husband was gunned down in front of her outside of a New Orleans eatery, the murder fullfilling a promise made by a druglord whom she helped convict.  Or, well, it's part of the fullfilled promise.  It's one of those open-ended promises:  for every precious thing I lose, you will lose two.  The resulting tale follows Kirsten through the world of the Witness Security Program, around obstacles such as shady US Marshalls, aging mobsters, and people and events in the past that refuse to die...or might die when they shouldn't.  It's a story that is complex and compelling enough to be a nicely workable thriller.  Literary enough and slick enough so that your bookmark, should you use one, won't stay in one place for too long.  For readers familiar with Mr. White's stories, however, the appearance of his most familiar character, Dr. Alan Gregory, will prove to be little more than an annoying footnote.  In any event, White, it seems, has included his recurring character in this case for little other reason than to showcase his natural and lifelong experience with the psychologist's profession.  It is mostly to the novel's detriment.  Likewise, although generally the text moves easily and unfettered by pretension or low-brow asthetics, it does clunk in some spots.  White's normally consistent prose jars with a few oddly placed metaphors and ill-chosen words (boobs and poop?).  And in an attempt to make foray into his central character's heart and soul, he constructed an extended and ultimately annoying whale metaphor that is more awkward and unnecessary than it is illuminating or endearing.  Still, highlights remain, such as the character of Carl Luppo, a retired hit man and one of Kirsten's only true friends, and the few action scenes that don't prove to be false leads or fake scares.  And although the plot isn't spread evenly (it lumps in places) the storytelling is competent enough to keep the page numbers advancing.
