 Twice I have seen Ronnie Earl & The Broadcasters live in small clubs, within flicking distance of his beads of sweat. After the first time, I walked out of the club shaking my head, mumbling, "Why isn't this guy famous?" I still don't know the answer, but hopefully this disc will continue to help him along in that direction. If you hear Ronnie talk in person, you can't help but get the impression that he is the most humble and sincere guitar wizard out there. Blues Guitar Virtuoso Live In Europe does an excellent job of representing Ronnie and the gang's live act, simmering, sizzling, smoking, and burning their way through a set of mostly original compositions. Bruce Katz's B3 organ is the perfect counterpoint to Ronnie's stellar picking, most notably on the cover of Bobby Timmons' classic "Moanin'." and Earl's own "Serezen". While it's a fantastic performance overall, the recording is not without flaws. First, the audio volume level varies from track to track, such that if the playback volume is adjusted for the louder tracks, you'll strain to hear the quieter ones. So I end up ping-ponging back and forth on the volume. Second, during the quieter passages, an annoying electronic hum is audible. I believe this is coming from Ronnie's guitar amp. (The same hum is also audible in a couple of tracks on his studio album Still River.) And lastly, clocking in at nearly 15 minutes, the closing track "Rego Park Blues" is too long and ambling for my listening pleasure away from the concert environment. I would give this one four and half stars if I could, but since the review system won't let me, I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt and bumping it up to five. Keep the faith, Ronnie!
