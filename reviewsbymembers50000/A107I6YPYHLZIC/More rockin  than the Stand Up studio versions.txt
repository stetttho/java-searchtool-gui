 About half the tunes in this package are from the Stand Up studio album, but the versions here are decidedly less mellow and more rockin'. "Dreamgirl" on the DVD, for example, practically sounds like a different (and better) tune. Overall, Carter's live drumming kicks butt compared to the clinical sound of the studio tunes. Skip the Stand Up studio album and get this set instead. And at least listen to this one before you decide you don't like the selection of tunes on it.
