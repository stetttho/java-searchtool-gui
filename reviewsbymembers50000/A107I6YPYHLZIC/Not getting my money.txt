 This review isn't commenting on Santana's new music, but on the CD, specifically the copy protection. I won't be buying "All That I Am" as long as it is in copy protected form that prevents me from listening to a CD that I PURCHASE on any device that I want to listen to it. I looked at this disc in a store, and the list of copy protection compatibility restrictions reads like warnings for a prescription drug. Among other things, you can only rip the disc on a PC to WMA format with rights management using Windows Media Player, and apparently cannot rip it to MP3 format.  I have been a huge Santana fan since the very beginning. I have seen the group live twice, and I have owned at least 10 of the albums over the years. But, sorry Carlos, I won't be buying this one as long as it is in this restricted form.  I strongly urge anyone considering purchase of this disc to read the detailed article at www.sysinternals.com/blog/2005/10/sony-rootkits-and-digital-rights.html regarding malicious software this disc installs on your PC.
