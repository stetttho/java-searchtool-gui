 I first heard this disc cranking loud in a music store that caters to the studded leather 20-ish crowd who listen to Korn and make the annual pilgrimage to Ozzfest. The clientele and the employees in the store were all groovin' to the funky beat. I start bopping along to, then all of sudden I think, "Wait a minute, I recognize that guitar. That's John Scofield! What the heck are these kids doing listening to JAZZ?" Then I thought, "They don't even know it's jazz. They all think it's some kind of new heavy metal." And they're right. That's how hard it is to categorize this recording. But it doesn't matter. Uberjam kicks booty. Next thing you know, those kids will be checking out Bitch's Brew and thinking they've discovered new music. And they'll be right.
