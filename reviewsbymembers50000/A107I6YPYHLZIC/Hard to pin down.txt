 The first time I listened to A Bigger Bang, I was unimpressed. The songs all seemed lackluster, and either too trite or too contrived. But after a few more listens, I have started to warm up to it. While it might not be a GREAT album, it is a good one.  What I find interesting about many reviews of A Bigger Bang (not just those on Amazon, but those from many professional reviewers), is that everyone seems to agree that the album is too long. They all say it would have benefited by omitting a handful of tunes, but then they vary about which tunes are the keepers and which are the losers.  Here's my list of the expendible tunes: - Rain Fall Down - Back Of My Hand - Oh No, Not You Again - Dangerous Beauty - Driving Too Fast  I fully expect that other reviewers will disagree with my selections and prefer to punt a few different tunes. But that's the whole point of my review: it's hard to pin down what's good or bad on this album.
