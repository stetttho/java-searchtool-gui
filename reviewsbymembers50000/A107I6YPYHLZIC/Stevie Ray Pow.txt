 The DVD of this straightforward 1983 nightclub performance is incredible, although it is by no means a slick, made-for-video production like the Live From Austin Texas shows for Austin City Limits. Here, the camera work is severely limited by the cramped quarters and dismal lighting. And there are only minimal extras on this video that's a mere 63 minutes long. Audio is available in both Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound, and PCM (digital) Stereo. Personally, I prefer the Stereo version. While the DD5.1 has greater spatial clarity and room ambience, the Stereo version imparts better bass punch, greater dynamic attack of the drums, and more overall sonic impact. In neither case is the audio quality quite up to top-notch modern recording standards, although it's fully acceptable. But Stevie's playing and singing are so powerful, so intense, so thoroughly engaging, that the limitations of the recording are irrelevant. He drips with sweat playing, and I practically drip with sweat watching him. The fireworks of "Texas Flood", and the subtle stylings and fabulous fretwork of "Lenny" bookend the range of the performance. The first time through, for most of the show I wondered why Stevie was slinging such a beat up old guitar when a rack of shiny new ones hung on the back wall. When he got around to his instrument-abusing rendition of Hendrix's "Third Stone From The Sun", the reason became self-evident. While "Third Stone" is literally a show stopper, I find it the least interesting performance on the disc, which only goes to show how great the rest of it is. No other music video or live concert audio recording that I have ever experienced does a more effective job of communicating the sheer excitement of a musician performing on stage. And more than any other recording, this one makes me want to run out to a gritty nightclub and hear some live music, ANY live music.
