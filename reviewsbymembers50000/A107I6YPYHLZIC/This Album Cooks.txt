 I first heard this group via its performance of "Elephants" on a video of the 2002 JVC Newport Jazz Festival, and I decided this disc was a must buy. The music here clearly isn't for everyone, and some listeners will no doubt dismiss it as junk food funk. But to my ears, The Bridge by Karl Denson's Tiny Universe is funky soul food. The lyrics range from party-girl grooves to downright poetic social commentary. (It's no accident that the lyrics from only two tunes, "Freedom" and "The Bridge" are reprinted in the liner notes.) Denson's vocal delivery on "The Bridge" is just dripping with hipness. The instrumentation migrates from the sizzling horn solos of "Freedom", through the burning bass on Curtis Mayfield's "Check Out Your Mind", to the flying flute of "Satisfied", culminating with the blistering beat of the instrumental "Elephants." Point your speakers out the window, crank this last tune, and even the corpses in the nearby cemetery will be tapping their feet to the beat. Throughout the disc, the arrangements are all slightly off-kilter, in a positive way, enough to prevent monotony and keep things interesting, but not so much as to devolve into jazz noise. About the only nit I can pick with The Bridge is that the sound quality is distorted and boomy in the mid-bass, which muddies up the mix. But never mind. The Bridge isn't intended for pristine audiophile listening. It's the ultimate dance party disc, and it absolutely cooks.
