 A prior reviewer asked, "why would you buy the CD version with lower sound quality, when the DVD with 48kHz 5.1 surround sound is available for less?" I will answer that question, since I own both the DVD of the original 1983 film and the audio CD of the 1998 soundtrack re-recording. (I have also seen the film at a theater with Philip Glass himself leading a live orchestral performance of the musical score.)  The prior question assumes, erroneously, that just because a DVD (48kHz, 5.1 channel surround) is capable of having better sound quality than an audio CD (44 kHz, 2 channel stereo), that it must be better. In this case, it is not. The original soundtrack on the DVD contains noticeable tape hiss, limited dynamic range, as well as numerous distortions common to many decades-old analog master tapes. The sound quality of the 1998 CD re-recording is absolutely pristine. (And, by the way, the performance on 1998 version of the CD does not cut out the substantial portions of the original as was the case with the earlier CD of the soundtrack.)  Having said that, I actually prefer the original DVD soundtrack. The performance on the newer audio CD is good, but it lacks a certain emotional vitality that was present on the original DVD. The newer performance seems a bit dull and lifeless, despite being technically superior.
