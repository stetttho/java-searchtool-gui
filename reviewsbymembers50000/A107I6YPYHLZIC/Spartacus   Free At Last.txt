 As a teenager in the 1970's, this was absolutely one of my favorite LP records (remember those?). I practically wore out the groove in the vinyl playing it so often. Then in 1985, I bought my first CD player and gave away the turntable, and I've been waiting for the CD release of Spartacus ever since. Now that it's here, I have finally gotten another long-awaited fix of Spartacus. To my pleasant surprise, the audio quality of the CD remastering is quite good. Kudo's to EMI for doing it right. The album concept is excellent. The lyrics are appropriate for the theme. (A gladiator/slave revolt is a gory matter, so this ain't no namby-pamby New Age disc.) And the musicianship is fabulous. On the LP, Juergen Fritz's keyboard work was always spectacular, and the incredible groove of Helmut Koellen's bass line on "March To The Eternal City" was instantly addictive to anyone who'd heard it. (This LP was THE bass demonstration album back in the '70's.) But on the CD, Hans Bathelt's drumming is what really stands out to me now. It's far more intricate and exiciting than that of most other rock and roll drummers, then or now. The two bonus tracks on the CD aren't of much added value IMHO. The live version of "The Capital of Power" is almost a note-for-note duplicate of the studio version, so why bother? And the previously unreleased "Showstopper" sounds like an outtake from EL&P's "Karn Evil 9" suite. The only reason I didn't give this one a 5-star rating is that Fritz's primitive Moog synthesizer, which is prominent in many of the tunes, just sounds so dated and simplistic compared to full-bodied modern synth. That's not to fault the musicianship, it's just a limitation of the tools available at the time. Nevertheless, the bottom line: Go out and buy this disc, even if you weren't born yet when Spartacus was originally released. P.S. I still don't understand the light bulb on the cover. (The rat, on the other hand, is self-explanatory.)
