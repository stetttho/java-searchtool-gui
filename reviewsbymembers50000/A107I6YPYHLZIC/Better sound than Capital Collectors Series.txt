 As an old fan of GFR from back in their heyday, I wanted a "best of" CD to remember them by. A few months ago, I purchased the Capital Collectors Series disc, and I found the sound quality to be quite unsatisfactory. I later found this Classic Masters disc in the closeout bin of a record shop. The Classic Masters disc claimed to be "24-bit remastered", so I figured the sound quality might be better. And the price was cheap enough that I figured what-the-heck.    The songs contained on these two discs are the same, except for one song on each: the Capital Collectors Series includes "Inside Looking Out"; and the Classic Masters disc includes "Take Me". Neither of these songs are among the bands's best IMHO, so it shouldn't be a deciding factor.    I compared the sound quality of both CDs quite carefully on a high-end CD player listening through high-end headphones, switching back and forth multiple times for each song, and the Classic Masters CD sounds noticeably better: overall dynamic range is better, which makes the vocals cleaner; and high notes, particularly cymbals and violins, are much less distorted than on the Capital Collectors Series CD. Both discs still exhibit plenty of distortion at times, but that is to be expected from 30+ year old master tapes.    I find the sound qualtiy on the Classic Masters to be acceptable, so I think I'll keep it.
