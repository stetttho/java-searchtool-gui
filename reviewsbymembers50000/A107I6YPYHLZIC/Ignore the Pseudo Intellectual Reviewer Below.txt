 This review is in response to the earlier one written by Rat Scabies Jr.  I am not a kid. I am old enough to have heard The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, and The Clash, when their songs were the current hits on the radio, not stuff of the oldies stations. I saw Black Sabbath live back in the 1970s. I have heard plenty of music, both good and bad over the decades, and so I provide my comments with a great deal of listening experience.  I don't care if it qualifies as Metal, Progressive, or any other label that some snobby reviewer tries to pigeon-hole it into, Tool's Lateralus is one of the greatest rock albums ever made, easily on my all-time top ten list. (Just skip over the waste of disc space called "Faaip De Oiad").
