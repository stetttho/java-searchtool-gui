 Yes, "Born To Run" is great music, and the CD remastering job is pretty good. But the Hammersmith Odeon concert DVD is the gem in this package. The video is marginal, but don't worry about it. The sound quality of the concert is outstanding for a 1975 recording. It's got a few rough spots of feedback and Max's cymbals sound a little smeared, although overall, it sounds better than the murky mix of the 2000 recording for the "Live In New York City" CD set. And the Hammersmith performance is to die for. The jazzy, jam band version of "Kitty's Back" alone is worth the price of admission, and the totally reworked "E Street Shuffle" is an unexpected treat. If you're a Springsteen fan, you cannot go wrong with this set.  By the way, the Born To Run CD is not copy protected with Sony's notoriously awful Digital Rights Management junk, and I had no problem ripping it to MP3 files.
