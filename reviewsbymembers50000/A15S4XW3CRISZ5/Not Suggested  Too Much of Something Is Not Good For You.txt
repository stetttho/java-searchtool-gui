 I'm a big fanatic when it comes to ease of use, but when it comes to this edition of Encarta I don't see ease of use anywhere, I see problems all the way. How can someone actually think that five cd's is gonna make things run smooth? That's just too much! It's a waste of hard drive space to support this program, I recommend the Deluxe edition, it is  enough to give you all the detailed information you will ever need. The program is not bad, but most of the information, will never be looked up or referenced. Too much of something is not good for you and Encarta Reference Library defines that very well!
