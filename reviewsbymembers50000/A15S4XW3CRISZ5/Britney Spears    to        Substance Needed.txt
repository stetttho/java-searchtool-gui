 I don't consider Britney Spears music as being the type of music that you play when you are alone with that special someone. But her music seems to connect more to teenagers who love to party and just have plain fun. Majority of the songs on the album are uptempo she tries to give a certain variety with songs like  "Not A Girl Not Yet A Woman". This release from Britney was a "Company" or Jive records release, it was not Britney waking up in the morning and saying "ah, I want to make a new album". The company is kind of pushing her to the limit instead of letting her cool out for a time and create some more compelling songs that will even make Britney haters want to listen. I consider the songs to be mostly fillers, they sound good but after the third play of the album you will begin to skip, this is typical of most albums today.  Still, there is  no need to hate her it's just music and she sounds just the same as she did in 1999 when "Baby One More Time" was released. Its just that we have gotten tired of her. I can vividly recall back in 1999 when everybody was rejoicing about this new face on the music seen, some of us started comparing her to Mariah Carey, some said her voice reminded them of "Billie Holiday" I laughed my guts out at that one, they even compared her to Celine Dion so in some sense its the freshness of the artiste that caused us to make Britney so "over popular". I consider  Baby One More Time to be some of Britney's best work to date with tracks like "Crazy", "Sometimes", Thinkin' About You" and the self titled track to be commendable pop songs. We all agreed that she sounds great on "Baby One More Time", so why are we dissing her now, my conclusion is that it might be the songwriters and not the voice. You can always have the perfect song but the voice does not always match, in this case its the songs.
