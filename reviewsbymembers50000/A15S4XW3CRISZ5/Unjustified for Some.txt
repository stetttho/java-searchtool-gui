 This version of Works Suite 2004 offers almost the same exact features of version 2003. The only difference is Money and Encarta, they included version 2004 instead. For users who might have stuck with version 2000, 2001 or 2002 of Works Suite, this will suite you more.The collection of software included is amazing for the value at which it is being offered. From power and easy to use Word Processing solutions such as Microsoft Word and quality photo-editing with Picture It! this is recommend set of programs for the home user and some businesses who need only the essentials. The package includes Works 7.0 which was also in Works Suite 2003, with basic spreadsheet and database applications.You also get great money management solution, Money 2004 makes it sinch to keep your budget on track and in tact. With its online itegration you can pay bills online or get further information to better manage your financial data.These applications I still consider not be strong enough as Microsoft Excel and Access. The database in Works approach to creating quiries is limited and unreliable. The Spreasheet does not offer the powerful calculation tools as Excel and integration between both applications is very limited. But if you need only essential tools for managing the essential aspects of your life whether at home or school Works Suite 2004 is truly a bargain. Remember if you are a user of Works Suite 2003, this update might be unnecessary to you because the majority of the products in version 2003 are included in version 2004. If you want the updated products which are Money 2004 Standard and Encarta Standard 2004 you can purchase them separately.
