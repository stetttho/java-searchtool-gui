 I have been a big fan of Leo since the Screen Savers first appeared on Tech/TV back then it was called ZD/TV. This guy really wants people to master technology and he's doing a darn good job at it! The book contains precise and accurate information about how to use the personal confuser. I recommend this book to the beginner, novice and expert.  Thanks Leo!!! With this book, I will be taking over your job on the Screen Savers VERY SOON!!!! I can't wait on edition 2003!!!!
