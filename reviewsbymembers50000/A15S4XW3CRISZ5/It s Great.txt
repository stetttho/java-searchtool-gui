 This new version of Word, is really no different from Word 2000, the major change is that the, hidden features are more pronounced in the interface, I like it a lot but I dont't really see the difference from 2000. If you are a user of Word 97, it would make a lot of sense to upgrade, now that user would see a whole lot differences when using Word. Certain features you might like such as speech recognition and send for review which I think won't be used. For users of Word 2000 I recommend you wait a year or two before you upgrade to this new version.
