 Honestly, if you do not have this software product in your collection, you are missing out a lot of great stuff here. The value that you are getting for your money here is worth every penny. From wordprocessing to photoediting I think this is 100% better than Microsoft Works Suite, the value appears in terms of more software and even hardware, I do not see anywhere in Microsofts Works where you are getting a headset, and Avery publishing software is truly exceptional I have version one of that software (it came with Office 97 Pro) and does every thing perfect, creating list, business cards etc imagine what you could do with this new version. Photo-editing software is satisfactory, its no Photoshop but it does get the job done. Lets not forget, Dragon Naturally speaking an excellent Voice Recognition software, it really takes the hassle from those who hate to type, one thing to remember, to get the best results from Dragon you have to practice, so that it can get use to your voice. You are also getting tons of Clipart, what else can I say but this product is better than MS Works Suite and is worth the [price]. Buy it you won't regret it.
