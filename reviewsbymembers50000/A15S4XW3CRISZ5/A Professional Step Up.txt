 Finally Microsoft has created a photo-editing product that really does the job. With a simple, easy to use interface that invites the user to experiment with its many features Image Pro7 really makes it enjoyable and easy to manipulate and perfectionise photos. With all the compulsary features for removing red-eyes and giving photos the best lighting. This product is really a match to Photoshop Elements. Image Pro 7 includes thousands of templates to get you started on that special project, whether its creating Calendars or Greeting cards, Image Pro 7 is a true master. I always stress, products like these will never reach the standard of Photoshop 7, but it does compromise features that allow novice and first time users to complete task more quickly and easily. The interface slightly resembles PhotoDraw, a wonderful Office application I sadly miss, some of the elements have been incorporated into this product to make intermidiate users feel more at home. For the first time user, I really recommend this product and for people who want to complete a specific photo-editing task quick this is really the one. With thousands of templates, easy to use editing tools, a wonderful interface, what more could you ask for at a great price!
