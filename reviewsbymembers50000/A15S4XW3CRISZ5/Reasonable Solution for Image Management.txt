 I personally think this is a great product for handling all types of images from those taken by your digital camera and those you scan in. What makes Photoshop Album so amazing is the felxibility it gives you when it comes to managing, organising your images. Organise by type, date, category whatever. With the amazing timeline. It has features for cropping and perfecting photos but these are limited, they are still welcomed. One thing I hoped for though in terms of photo-editing, users who have Photoshop Elements installed on their computer could use the engine to edit photos, instead of having to use the independent tools Photoshop Album. Another feature that I think makes this a winner is the Slide Show feature, which is a must in all Image Management programs. I think this is great value at an economical price because of its image management, photo-editing and slide show, plus many more. This I think is a must have product to have on your computer.
