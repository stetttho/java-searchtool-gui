 I have been using Microsoft Word 2002 since it's debut and I have not had any problems using the progam. A reviewer said they had about 200+ problems with the application but, I think that's plain exageration and jealousy from probable WordPerfect user. The application is easy use,that's why most businesses and schools everywhere use it including college students. With intuitive menus and a great help assistant "not Clippy" Word "2002" allows you to make professional looking documents and my brother is studying for his bachelors in education and he is not good at using computer programmes but he sure does use Microsoft Word 2002 like an expert. He also types 20 to 30 page thesis sometimes 60 and he does not have one bit of a problem. It's very easy to insert headers and footers, you have quicker access to hidden menus with the task pane unlike previous versions of Word where you had to dig through menus to find that special feature. The grammar and spell checker are more powerful and easier to use e.g. if you set the grammar for U.K. English it stay's U.K. English. For users who are new to WordProcessing Microsoft Word especially version 2002 is an excellent choice for all beginners to learn, it's very easy to learn & use. You are able to create all types of content with Word from Newsletters to simple brochures. But most Microsoft Word 2002 is more reliable and I think it's the most stable word processor out there, with the document recovery feature. My brother has had a lot of power cut's in his time and trust me Word 2002 has been an ultimate saviour. You can even create a website with the darn program, now tell me if this is not a powerful program. If there is at least one application out of the Office XP suite it's Word. That's why I think word is the best Word Processor plus almost everybody is using it.
