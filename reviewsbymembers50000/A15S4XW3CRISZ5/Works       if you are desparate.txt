 If you are really cheap or totally bankrupt when it comes to buying a set of productivity tools, here's a saviour or option. This is really low end software and I really don't recommend it, but it is commendable enough to do simple task such typing a one page document, adding numbers in the spead sheet programme. But the database is just not good at all. It's unreliable and not powerful to handle complex task such as creating complex queries or even reports. The product cost  forty dollars but if you have an extra thirty dollars, buy Star Office 6.0, if you were to compare that to Works, Star Office would look more like Microsoft Office. It is a full  featured productivity suite that includes a satisfactory word processor, spreadsheet, presentation graphics and drawing prgram. The only time I can recall when I really appreciated Works was version 4.5, that was the ultimate works, the Wizards were intuitive and easy to use. It guided you along the way, this really made Works more friendlier and useful than recent versions.So as I said before if you have the extra 30 dollars go for Star Office you won't regret it or just save and buy WordPerfect Office or Microsoft Office.
