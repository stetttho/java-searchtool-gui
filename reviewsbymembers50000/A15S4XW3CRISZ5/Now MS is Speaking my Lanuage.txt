 When I first heard about Plus! DME, I said not another...add on again. Well, I thought wrong, filled with an aray of useful intuitive accessory to make you enjoy your computer more, Plus! DME is the ultimate add on for Windows XP. It brings the digital divide together on your PC, making you more creative with the it. My favourite app has to be Photo Story, for people who don't have digital camcoder DME makes itself right at home with your images from your digital camera. With superb transitions and ability to add your favourite song in background make this product a true mater piece. Another favorite is the juke box which turns your PC literally into a kiosk, with backgrounds to suit you taste, you add personal text to make it even more interesting. Other, nice features such as analog recorder are great for turning analog sound or data into digital, also is alarm, which you can personalise with your favorite pack. Oooh, I forgot about the "Dancers, when you are playing your favorite song wither, hip-hop, classics, any style you can have someone on the desktop entertain with by dancing to that particular, their is one for every type of music, "plus" many more to download. The fat guy is my favorite! Comparing this to the [$] I paid for XP Plus for Windows, I think this is really worth your money, it has a useful feature that makes it a really great product for both the young old. Very entertaining, intuitive, and most of affordable.
