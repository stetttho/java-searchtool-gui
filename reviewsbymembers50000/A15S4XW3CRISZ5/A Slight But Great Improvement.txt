 I thought that the 2003, edition of Encarta Reference Library was the ultimate refernce resource. But I was wrong. With a restyled start center, that makes it inviting and easy to use, Encarta 2004 is truly a winner. Basically the information is so update its really the Internet on DVD.  This Digital Encyclopedia is must for students, who want concise and accurate information relating to what they are learning in school. But the fun does not stop on DVD's, users are able to expand their searching capabilities and knowledge to the Internet, through MSN Encarta. And you can also get updates from which keeps your information updated and always accurate. With great videos to give a visual concept of life in countries whether it be about people or animals. Whether its technology, science or history Encarta Reference Library 2004 gives you the information you need and expands the knowledge resource to the Internet. The program still lacks up to date images, but comparing the DVD to the 5 disk Set, you get more content on DVD. Its faster and certainly reduces disk swapping. I have always admired Encarta for its approach to presenting information in a visual stunning and easy to understand way. Comparing this to a set of books would be a dishonour, because Encarta keeps current and more efficient. Who Should Upgrade? Well, it depends, if you need to get the latest and most up to date reference information on topics relating to our world, Encarta 2004 is must upgrade especially if you want to reduce disk swapping and go for the DVD Edition. 2000, 2001, 2002 and even 2003 users will find this update a necessary update to their reference collection. But students and teachers are the ones who will benefit the most from magnitude of information.  I can't wait to see whats in Encarta Reference Library 2005!
