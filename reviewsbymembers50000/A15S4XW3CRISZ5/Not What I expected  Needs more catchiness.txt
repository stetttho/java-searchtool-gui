 When I heard "Like I Love You" for the first time, I said to myself this album is gonna be hot. The song is catchy, with its R&B, uptempo sound. When the album hit the charts and sold like hot bread, that made me a beliver more and more that this album was hot. But to tell you the truth, the other songs on the album are a bit lazy and are not as catchy as "Like I Love You". They just don't have have that certain beat that I like about a song, weird sounds coming from each song make them sound even worse. ...  Justin has a so and so album here. I hope on his second album he doesn't use the "Neptunes", they are writing for too many artiste and the songs from different artiste albums are beginning to sound too much alike because of their input on too many songs these days. We need some orginality, not the same song being recycled over and over again. ...
