 If there is at least one application out of the Microsoft Office XP family that's worth buying, it's this program. The features such as animations and effects 100% improved with great looking templates to use. The interface might look a bit surprising at first but, you will start creating awsome presentations in minutes. It's easy to use beacuse of the familiarity with Office and the New Task Pane provides quick access to certain necessary features, eg. If you want change your design template, you can do it right their from the task pane, no digging through menus and right clicking. You are also able to give presentation slides individual template designs to make your templates show more individualty. Their are tons of new features that have not been written about, you will find each every time you use the app. This is one application out of Office Microsoft has really concentrated on, I recommend it!
