 Honestly, I'm not interested in learning HTML, and I wanted to create a simple website for my Youth Group and like I said I did not want learn any web programming. So what was I going to do? I always had FrontPage on my computer since Office 2000. I always heard rumors that FrontPage was not an appropriate choice for web creation and management. Yes and No in some respects, if you really want to create a professional website with all the bells and whistles for coporate purposes or some other professional type of reason go ahead and purchase Adobe GOLIVE or DREAMWAEVER. For those who are creating simple websites either for non-profit (like me) or just a personal website I honestly think FrontPage is most suitable, easy to learn and use, no need to learn code, it has templates to get you started right away. One major dis-advantage is the code FrontPage produces is very slow, but it get's the job done at a slow rate. If you hate Microsoft's products or you think that they are buggy and too monopolistic try this alternative, Macromedia HOMESITE, that's if you want learn programming.
