 I have been using Microsoft Outlook for almost three years now, and to tell you the truth I like it a lot! Recently, I upgraded to version 2002 and was impressed by the features in the application. The integration of Hotmail is not a new feature but an easier approach to setting-up accounts with the e-mail service. Other features such as organizing e-mail whether its junk or something important is also good, but I think users will find more features when it comes to integration with other Office applications such as Word. Say for example, your typing a letter and you insert a person's name, through the use of Smart Tags Word will ask you if you would like to add it to your contacts or schedule a meeting in Outlook, a handy feature, but for me it's not really necessary. This version, I think is worth the upgrade it's much improved compared to Outlook 97, 98 and "2000" in some ways, users will some how find other useful and interesting features in this application. Remember, Outlook 2000 was always known as a virus harbor, and it was always difficult to set-up accounts with hotmail, so if there is at least one program out of the core Office XP applications, I suggest Outlook 2002. Like I said, there are some new cool features I have not yet discovered.
