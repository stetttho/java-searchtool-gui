 This album reflects a new and cool Michael Jackson, with every song keeping you on your feet every minute. Instruments on this album even make the songs sound more fantastic. Some of my favourites include; You Rock My World and Break of Dawn. You will enjoy every moment of this album, the lyrics are very hot, one of my other favourite tracks, Heaven Can Wait is a real R&B smoothy that makes you just melt away, Michael really makes me speechless with "SPEECHLESS" that song is so amazing. Songs that are video worthy include, Threatened, Whatever Happens. I don't know why people are dissing this album so, it's like they were expecting Michael to sing "MIRACLES". I have heard some albums out there today that just does not cut it at all, most of the songs on todays artiste albums sound alike, Michaels "INVINCIBLE" each song reflects individuality, yet it revolves around one theme, LOVE. All of the songs are great and this album is definitely worth the buy and it deserves to be a part of your collection. Sure it's no "THRILLER" but, who wants the same thing over again. Individuality is the key here and Michael has shown that through-out all his albums and this is surely one of them.
