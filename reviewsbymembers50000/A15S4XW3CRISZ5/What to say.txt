 Well I know a lot of people who have Star Office on their computer. They either still end-up buying Microsoft Office or uninstalling Star Office it self. But the price it-self is astounding. This product is for people who are doing essential things such as writing letter, and short documents. Most of the persons I talked have said that its little bit difficult use but you kind of eventually get the hang of it. But I'm really not into that, I would put that [money] aside and save put it towards saving for Microsoft Office or Works Suite which offers a lot of software for just [money]. But if you are using some other operating system apart from Windows such Linux, go for it because Microsoft won't be making any Office XP for this any time soon. Put it this way, Linux people buy it, Windows people it's optional.
