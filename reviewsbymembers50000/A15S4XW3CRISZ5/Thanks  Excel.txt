 I think this is the best spreadsheet programme out there on the market. It's easy to use, it's a life saver when it comes to mathematical problems, I solved percentage, multiplication, additions etc... in this programme in a breeze. Just remember when you are writing a formular in a cell remember use this:  eg. =sum(b1+a5)it all works by entering the formula properly. There are no major changes in Excel 2002, you can do most of the everyday task in Excel 97 and 2000. But overall I think its a great application compared to Quattro Pro and Lotus 123.
