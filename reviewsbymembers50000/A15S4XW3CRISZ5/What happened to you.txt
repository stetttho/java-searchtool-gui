 I heard the song "someone to hold" one night on the radio and became totally infatuated with the song. Does anybody notice that "Mariah Carey" is doing back up on the song. It's a great album that reflects true R&B music that takes away your sorrow and makes you feel really good. Like the song says "YOU TAKE ME IN AND MAKE ME WHOLE AGAIN!
