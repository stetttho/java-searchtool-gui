 I have had the privilege of using this product and to be honest, it is truly amazing. With a very concise, easy to use and intuitive interface, MS Project is the number one solution for big businesses. What Project does is to organise how events in your company is scheduled, example if your releasing a product or scheduling how workers operate in your organisation. About the easy to learn part, compared to other project managament software MS Project hands down is the easiest, with the usual Microsoft Office interface, your on way to learning this product. You might have to go to some lesson classes in Project management first, because this product is not for the ordinary user, it for big businesses that need to have their company on time and in order. The price is a little bit scary, but if you are a company that has to always be prepared I recommend it. This version is even more integrated with web services, so for those companies that have Intranets good opportunity to purchase. For the average user who wants a scheduling program, buy Microsoft Outlook.
