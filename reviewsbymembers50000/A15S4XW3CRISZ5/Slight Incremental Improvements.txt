 Well, Microsoft has done a good job of bundling to great solutions for editing and managing images. But for users of prior versions of the product may find the new features to Digital Image Pro 9, not all that needed and may not find there money's worth upgrading. The Digital Image Library program is very nice it does a good job at organizing, managing and finding images.  But the cost is not justified and I can recommend a superior easy to use Photo-editing and image management bundle that surpasses Image Pro 9 in usability and quality and also offers all the image management features with much more organization and management tools and procedures. This program is Adobe Photoshop Elements plus Adobe PhotoAlbum 2.0. Photoshop Elements has all the necessary tools from the highend version of Photoshop with superior ease of use and perfect quality results. Photoshop Albums management tools is so amazing, you will wonder how you ever lived without it. You organize images by day, year, month, groups, such as family and friends. You can also create your own category. You can create a simple slide show to view your images and it has simple Photo editing features but Photoshop Elements gives you all you need. But if you liked earlier versions of Image Pro such as the excellent Image Pro 7, stick with it, the incremental features are only needed for people who are probably looking to stick on the Microsoft path who were using previous version such as Picture It! version 1 up to 6. So if you want true tools and worth the value with great results, take a really close look at Adobe Photoshop Elements 2.0 plus Adobe Photoshop Album 2.0
