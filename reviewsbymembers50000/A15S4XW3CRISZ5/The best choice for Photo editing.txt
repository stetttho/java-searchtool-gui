 I will admit that this is not a easy to use application but if you want to become an expert, you have to go to a lesson class in graphics and photo-editing. It does pay off, the editing features of this program are amazing, for removing red eye giving pictures the best lighting and creating great photo-content. With new features for fixing photos such as the healing brush which I know a lot users will appreciate for removing wrinkles and other types facial problems in photos. You also have security with version 7.0 so people cannot steal your precious content or use dissrespectly with special water mark features and other secure and file protection stuff. A new file browser is in the product so you can find and select your photo-content easily. Over all for previous users of Photo-shop I recommend you upgrade, I highly  recommend 5.0 & 5.5 users to upgrade most of all but for people who just purchased 6.0 wait about 3 to 6 month's and hear what everybody is saying. If you want to go in photo-graphics I highly recommend Photoshop 7.0 it's new and a little bit easier use. If you are a novice and new to Photo-editing stick with Photoshop elements.
