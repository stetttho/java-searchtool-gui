 ...I waited 3 months to get this album and to tell you the truth It is the bomb every single song on this album is catchy ,energetic, sweet and great  for all fun occasions including SUMMER.The songs I think are video worthy  are : 1. STRONGER 2. I CAN'T GET NO SATISFACTION 3. WHAT U SEE IS WHAT U  GET 4. ONE KISS FROM YOU  5. CAN'T MAKE YOU LOVE ME  6. WHEN YOUR EYES SAY  IT 7. DEAR DIARY A couple of songs on the album remind of songs on her  previous album, songs such as WHAT U SEE IS WHAT U GET for eg. sounds a lot  like YOU DRIVE ME CRAZY. 2. ONE KISS FROM YOU - THINKIN' ABOUT YOU 3.  WHEN YOUR EYES SAY IT - FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY BROKEN HEART 4. LUCKY -  SOMETIMES and thats Britney's downfall she should of tried some thing  more fresh for us music listeners. Anyway no matter what I like the album.  One song on the album I really would advise you not to listen to is  "DON'T LET ME BE THE LAST TO KNOW" . Why did Shania Twain include  her backup singers on the song?, it just ruined it. Last but not least my  favourite slow song is "WHERE ARE YOU NOW" that song sounds  really great, at least she tried something new for once.
