 Microsoft Access is one of the other core Office applications I use the most, but I'm a little frustrated when it comes to compatibility, Microsoft still has not gotten it right! They need to focus on consistency and not new features only (And there aren't many new features Access 2002 when it comes to the average user). One of my computers at home still uses Office 97 and I kept a copy of my music collection database in Access 97, in Access 2000 you were able to convert a 2000 database to 97 or vice-versa smoothly. In Access 2002 that feature has been giving me problems, when I convert a 2002 database to 97 it gets ruined. When I opened the converted database in 97 there is only one record (there should be 45 records in the table) in the database leaving me angry having to type back in every artiste data in Access 97 again! Don't think if you have the database in Access 2000 its smooth running all the way, it also gives minor and major problems converting with Access 2002. Now, if I had one little problem converting a database, think about the big business people who are keeping massive records of customers. Don't get me wrong, it's an easy to use application but I think it still has some jinx in it. Now Microsoft if only you would allow multiple installs in Office XP I would be able to upgrade that computer running Office 97. Please get it right!!!
