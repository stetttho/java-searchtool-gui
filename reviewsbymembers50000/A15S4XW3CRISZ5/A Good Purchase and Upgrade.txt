 Windows XP home is a operating system from Microsoft that finally defines stability and ease of use into one. If you are thinking about upgrading from Windows 98, go straight ahead, if you are still using Windows ME, please immediately upgrade. This operating is very easy to use with a redesigned start menu that provides easier access to programs and accessories. More stable because it is built upon the Windows NT kernel so it won't crash but your applications will software apps weren't built on NT, only the Operating System, so you can't get everything perfect! But this operating system is really worth the buy you won't regret it trust me. With soft edged Windows and rich icon pictorials this operating system really makes digital media a lot of fun. Plus the multi-user settings in Windows XP makes it a good purchase, so everyone in the family can have their own settings without interupting other peoples files and  personal settings. People have been asking Microsoft for years to merge both the ease of from 98 and the stability of NT, now they have it, why not take it. And their just too many features to talk about here! Trust me you won't regret it.
