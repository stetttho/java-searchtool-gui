 I use Publisher a lot, but version 2002 I think is the a little bit jinxed. Why doesn't Microsoft allow the program to share publications with Publisher 97, 98 and 2000? "Yes there are people still using version 97". My youth group has a newsletter; and we also create other types of publications. Persons responsible for the newsletter are running Publisher 97 and 98 still, and we have to share and review publications before we publish it. Publisher 2002 is basically giving me similar problems like Microsoft Access 2002, "backward compatibility". Please Microsoft I'm begging you to work on the compatibility and not new features only. I love the new look and everything but I need better functionality and flexibility. And this is not a true Office application until compatibility has become a major priority. Please fix that for me MS and we have a deal. Over all the application is easy to use, there are new design templates and tons of clipart. I like the Picture It! Photo Editor software but I don't use it a lot. It has some cool features though, such as removing red eye and brightening photos, so a lot of you out there will find that useful for fixing up photos! Integration with Word is easier that's a plus, it was hell in 2000. What I think Microsoft wants you the consumer to do is tell your friends to upgrade to the new version, but we are strapped for cash right now MS, so all of us won't be upgrading for now. For users new to desktop publishing, I recommend Publisher 2002, it's easier than other high-end DTP's and has a lot of design features that makes it easy for you to either create cards and other design projects. The price is reasonable compared to PageMaker and Quark X-Press, I gave it four stars because of its features and ease of use, and I would have given it five, but compatibility!
