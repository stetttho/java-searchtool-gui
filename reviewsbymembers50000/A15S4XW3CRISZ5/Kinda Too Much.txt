 Nero 6 Ultra Edition, focuses on the all in one experience at a great price. With tools focusing on making the product a one stop solution. From Burining DVD's or regular CD's. But Regardless of the software's easy to use and looking start center, it still hints some complexity throughout each of its components. The approach it takes to accomploshing a task is not as straight forward as some Software burning utilities. But once you get hang of the tools,  you will begin to take advantage of its many features. Great tools for creating CD Jackets and lables, which adds value to its one stop solution idea. You can do a other recording task such burning MP3, ISO cd's.For users who really want value for their money, this is a recommended buy. I actually have two burning software programs, the other is Easy CD & DVD Creator 6, which is awesome because of the quick and easy appraoch it gives the user when it comes to burning data and music. It offers about the same tools as Nero Ultra Edition, with tools for Photo-Editing, but a little more expensive. For persons who are willing to take the time to get acquainted with Nero 6 Ultra Edition, I would certainly recommend it to them. But for those who don't want the learning time and take the quick and easy simple with powerful tools, Easy CD Creator DVD & Creator 6 would fancy you more, but cost a little more.
