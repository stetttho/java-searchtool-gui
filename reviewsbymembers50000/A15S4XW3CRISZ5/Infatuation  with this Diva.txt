 I never expected this! I was certain that this was going to be another trip into the world of POP music, but no way. Instead this album surrounds itself with high quality R&B, blues and a bit of rock music that really makes you just melt away. Some of my favorites include "Fighter" "Infatuation" "Loving Me 4Me" and "Impossible", just to name a few, certainly there is no filler on this album. Yes I'm a big fan of Britney Spears, but I know for sure she could not handle not one of these songs that Christina blast in your ear. May be "Make Over". Two more favorites Cruz & Soar are two other excellent examples of great music that reflects a artiste who has paid great attention to her art and not the money that's gonna be made from it. She gives you your money's worth, out of all the albums I have purchased this year, I consider this to be the best. The merging of the instruments with Christina's voice is just flawless. I recommend you buy this album, its really superb. The three years was worth the wait, this was not a hurry out the door album. Fully influenced mostly by Rock, R&B, Blues, Latin, hip-hop this album certainly meets everyones expectation. When you listen to the music, it seems as if Christina decided to listen some of the foundations of the past and it really paid off. A bit of everything for every music lover. (**********) 10 stars! If it takes three years to make such a great album, imagine the next one, I'll wait!
