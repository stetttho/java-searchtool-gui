 I recently went to a friends house and found out they had XP running on their machines and wasn't I amazed. The application that startled me the most was PowerPoint it is just fantastic with the new animations, this will make any audience say "WOW". The applications are also great with a much improved user interface, other improved applications are Publisher which is also my favourite application next to PPT. The other apps. such as Access and FrontPage hasn't changed a lot but they do look great with minor user interface improvements. With the look and feel of this version of Office you would surely even wan't to upgrade from 2000, thing for me is I don't have anymore money I already spent it buying Office 2000. But for those of 95,97 and even 98 it's worth the upgrade. My friends machine run's Win2k so he's O.K. I heard that it won't run on Win95, but that shouldn't be a problem just buy the upgrade for Win98 [it's cheap] and your done. Other nice features are Smart Tags, Task Panes they help a lot especially when it comes to doing school work. The only time I'm going to upgrade is in 2002 when WinXP arrives. Other products you should also try is MS Portfolio 2002 with hundreds of templates. One missing app. I miss so dearly is PhotoDraw, it was discontinued [shame on you Microsoft].
