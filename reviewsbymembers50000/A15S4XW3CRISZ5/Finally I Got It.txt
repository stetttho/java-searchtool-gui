 It took an entire year to save up enough money to buy this product. My plan was to go all the way professional, by using Quark as the defacto DTP program on my machine. After a miserable experience with PageMaker 7, I said to myself I would stay with Publisher forever. After much reviewing and testing, I finally, pushed my self to fork out the cash. I have heard a lot of people say that Quark is difficult and is not intuitive like other lowend DTPs and I agree in some respects. It works just like most DTPs, you create text boxes and link them. One feature I thank Quark for putting in this version is the table feature, I have heard of many bad experiences with importing tables in previous versions. The product is simple and easy to use although I recommend that users doing simple desktop publishing stick with Microsoft Publisher. Reason why I decided to really purchase this product was because our Youth Publication had reached 50 pages and Publisher was giving some problems handling that amount of pages, so we thougth it was time to bring in the heavy guns. We are enjoying the programe it does what it does, its just the same as it was in Publisher. It was difficult transferring the publication from MS Publisher to Quark, I had to find an extension for that. Our publications are much the same only thing is we are able control the amount of pages.     Adobe Indesign is o.k. but the print house or print press does not support it, so that's another thing to remember choosing a DTP program.
