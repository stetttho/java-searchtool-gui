 I have written almost three reviews for this product so far and Amazon did not post not even one of them. I have been using this product since version 6.0 and I have been using Publisher since version 3.0 and to be honest, I always preferred Publisher, PageMakers limited GUI, always made it difficult for me to understand and use. Adobe said that its aiming for the small business and home user, but what I think they are actually aiming for is our money. PageMaker has reached a stage in life where it is being abandoned and dethroned by leading and popular DTP prgrams such Quark, Publisher and even Adobes own Indesign. If I were to suggest a DTP program for small businesses and home users it would be Microsoft Publisher, its easy to use, cost less and does the same thing like PageMaker. If you won't a more flexible, powerful, well known product go for Quark. Why I do not really recommend the really highend programs is because their, price, non-intuitiveness. People want something that they are already familiar with.
