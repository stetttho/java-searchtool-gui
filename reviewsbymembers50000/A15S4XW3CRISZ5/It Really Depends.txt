 This version of Works Suite offers almost the same exact features of version 2004. The only difference is Money, Streets and Trips, Picture It! 10.0, Encarta, they included version 2005 instead. For users who might have stuck with version 2000, 2001 or 2002 of Works Suite, this will suit you more. The collection of software included is amazing for the value at which it is being offered. From powerful and easy to use Word Processing solutions such as Microsoft Word and quality photo-editing with Picture It! My only problem with Word is that they did not include version 2003 instead. Word 2002 is included instead and has been out since May 2001, kind of lame by Microsoft's standards. This is a recommend set of programs for the home user and some businesses who need only the essentials. The package includes Works 8.0, with basic spreadsheet and database applications. You also get great money management solution; Money 2005 makes it a synch to keep your budget on track and in tact. With its online integration you can pay bills online or get further information to better manage your financial data. These applications I still consider not to be as strong enough as Microsoft Excel and Access. The database in Works approach to creating queries is limited and unreliable. The Spreadsheet does not offer the powerful calculation tools found in Excel and integration between both applications is very limited. But if you need only the essential tools for managing the essential aspects of your life whether at home or school Works Suite 2005 is truly a bargain. Getting the latest versions of Encarta is always great and it includes version 2005, so information is once again updated and accurate and you get the benefits of updating it weekly, so your information is never outdated.  Remember if you are a user of Works Suite 2003 or 2004, this update might be unnecessary to you because the majority of the products in version 2003 have not had a drastic overhaul in version 2005. I would probably recommend this to existing users running 2000, 2001, 2002 and persons running versions 99 and really older, I think its time you upgrade!
