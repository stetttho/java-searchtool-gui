 OneNote is exactly what the name says. Its a note taking application that is used to gather notes. Its also a great companion for the Tablet PC, because of its tight integration with hand-writing recognition, which on the Tablet is called "Ink".  Some say that OneNote sounds like a great application in theory, but does it have all the potential in practice? Well, I think so, its a great organizer for persons who take a lot of notes and really want to get that information centralized and organized in one place. The tight integration once again with Office is always a winner. But, its the connection with hardware such as Tablets that give it a further boost. The handwriting recognition technology makes it a great companion for Tablet Users. OneNote, also being a 1.0 application has a long way to go, lack of such built in features such as a ruler and Office Drawing tools, make the application seem limited in some sense. The applications still retain some advantages, with features for recording 7 min voice clips to add to your notes, so if you are a student in Class or a employee in a business meeting, this is a excellent feature for capitalizing on your information more effectively. OneNote has tight integration with the web, and there is place for it on the desktop PC too. Users can drag tiny snippets of information they needs from Internet websites into the QuickNotes panel, which sits in the System Tray of Windows. All that information is stored in the My Notes folder in your My Documents folder. I personally consider this wonderful flexibility and ease of use. Users can later aggregate the information, annotate in a easier way when fully opened into the OneNote Application. So, OneNote does have its place on both the Desktop, Laptop and of course the Tablet. So, for users who want to be more personal and up close with their information, this is the opportunity.
