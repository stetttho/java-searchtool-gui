 Well, what can I say? I bought this product thinking it was an easy solution to handle images on my hard drive. The thing is why I tried to open JPEGS, GIFS even Bitmaps most of them weren't recognised in Paint Shop, regardless I selected all file formats. Oh another thing, this product is dangerous when you select all file formats, it even took over my Corel Draw files, even webpage documents, I said to myself what is going on here. When I tried to open those Corel Draw files in Paint shop it gave me an error saying it was not recognised, come on whats happening here?  You know what I suggest? Buy a product thats actually dedicated and good at what it does, "handling images", I did not ask for it to handle CAD, Vector etc... A matter of fact whats the sense in spending the money when you already have a product that does the same thing with ease of use and simplicity. Microsoft Office already comes with the excellent Photo Editor and who doesn't have Office? Save the money and buy a product that does what its meant to do. If you want a product that really works, buy Photoshop Elements or Picture It! Digital Image Pro or stick with Photo Editor, plus it has a lot of editing tools.
