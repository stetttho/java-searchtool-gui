 First of all for Mac, users this is your only option for a good reliable, well known database, so I recommend it to them most of all. For PC users however, stay very far away, Microsoft Access has all the tools you need already. Based upon user experience, I think Microsoft Access is much easier, (read carefully now, before you judge my review). People say that FileMaker is the easiest database ever created, but they are dead wrong, they have never tried Access. Entering information into the database in FileMaker is like thorns in your finger, it is so difficult. I tried to enter the date for my music collection and it kept on giving me an error message that it should be done a particular way, I followed its instructions and still ended up with the same error. Creating reports is also painful, unlike Microsoft Access which uses a simple tabed interface you can immediately switch from tables to creating quries and beautiful reports. In FileMaker, the database uses some sort of Visual Basic interface to create reports, Access uses simple wizards to get you where you are going. Access is also more powerful in terms of integration with SQL, ODBC, other database server products so there is no conflict with your data. FileMaker is simple and too weak for users to spend upto $..., buy Access and you will never regret it. And with the integration between other MS Office products, you will be amazed. One of the features I love the most is the ability to create mail merge documents using database information from Access into Microsoft Word. Your able to easily convert a database from Access to Excel, vice versa easily. All of this would be a head ache in FileMaker. If you are on the Windows platform, certainly Access is the best way to go!
