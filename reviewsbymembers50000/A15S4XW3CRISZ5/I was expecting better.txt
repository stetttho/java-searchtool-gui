 I purchased this product a few months back, expecting to receive some very cool PowerPoint and Word templates, but was very much disappointed. PowerPoint temps are more for use in creating digital photoalbums, the ones that are dedicated presentation slides are very lame and drab I would certainly stick to the ones in Office. The ones in Word were very disappointing, its like they were trying to turn Word into a desktop publishing programme, its very difficult to navigate in application that was not made for creating postcards. The Outlook stationaries are satisfactory but I do not always use them, Excel is also satisfactory it has templates for creating book list and "student register". Overall I would suggest purchasing a third party app with much more pleasing templates than this. I was also expecting templates for MS Access.
