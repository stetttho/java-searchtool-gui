 The answer depends on your relationship with previous versions of Office or whatever office suite you use. if you're sick of running through drop-down menus to find the commands you need, Task Panes may help. But some experienced users may conclude that Task Panes take up too much screen real estate doing things that the users already know how to accomplish. Smart Tags are great way to fine-tune Office's automatic corrections and add some new functions, but they also may perform some actions you wish they hadn't and may distract the user. In short, if you have a difficult time getting your current office suite to do what you want, Office XP may be a big help. But if you've already mastered the drop-down menus and configuration tweaks that you need in order to work efficiently, XP's new suitewide features probably aren't worth spending. The answer to the upgrade question also depends on what you do with Office. If you spend most of your time in any application - especially Excel where I found few changes for the good - you probably won't gain much by switching. On the other hand, if you find yourself constantly jumping from Outlook to Word to PowerPoint and using them all to their fullest, the improvements will probably make the upgrade worthwhile. Users already running Office 2000 can wait another year or two before they upgrade, by that time you will see the neccessity of the features in Office XP!
