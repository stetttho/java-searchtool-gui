 A user said approach is easier than Microsoft Access, I have a certain feeling that person was not using Access at all. Microsoft Office is considered the best Office Suite by users around the world. Why? Because of its friendly graphical user interface, that is available throughtout all the applications. If you are running a business 90% of that organization is probably using MS Office. In Lotus the procedures to using the applications in the suite are too cumbersome requiring too much clicking. If you enter Word Pro a dialog box appears asking you what type of document you would like to create, duh of course I am going to use a blank  doc to type something, the thing is Word Pro acts too much like a Database Management system, you have to always select the type of project, not convenient at all. I think the integration across all the applications in MS Office is very flawless, sharing data between Excel and Word is just a click away. PowerPoint has more effects its more intuitive, easy to use and learn than Free Lance, Free Lance is like your using a Windows 3.1 era application. Of course Outlook is the best PIM out their for organizing and scheduling your life. Last but not least Lotus SmartSuite comes with a lot of computer packages. Tell you what, save your money towards Microsoft Office, it is worth it if you are a first time user buying a Office suite or you want better productivity and ease of use out of your applications.
