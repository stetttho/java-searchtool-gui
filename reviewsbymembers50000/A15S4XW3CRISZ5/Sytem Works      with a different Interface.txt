 Should you upgrade? Well, kind of, I tend always upgrade  to the latest from Symantec. For this version I only recommend that you upgrade to "Norton Anti-virus 2003", the programs from Symantec such as System Works and Utilities are just same no major differences except for a more sleeker interface and tools for scanning "Instant messages" for viruses. I really don't know why Symantec decided to  release this version so early. Yes, I was expecting a 2003 line of products. But I thought that they would of instead released them around mid-2003 when Microsoft Office 11 would debut. Beacause people use MS Office alot and Norton is good at scanning Office files for viruses.  So, should you upgrade? If recently purchased System Works 2002 or Norton 2002 or any of the Symantec line of products at least wait until your one year subscription is up. Because that's what you by a utility program for, to keep updated against the latest attacks.
