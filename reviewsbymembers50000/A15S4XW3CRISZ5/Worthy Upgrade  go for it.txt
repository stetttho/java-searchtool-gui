 First of all, if you are going to buy this upgrade edition of the product make sure you have a previous version from either 98 to ME. Windows 95 will not work at all! This is a great upgrade to Windows, it's easier to use with lots of new features. One of the most needed was the multiple user accounts that allows users to have their own personal settings. Windows XP Home is built upon the strenghts of the Windows NT kernel which speaks reliability, so it's kind of the end of a lot of blue, that should be at least one reason to make the upgrade. It's alittle bit faster but not like what I have read in most reviews, getting work done is more easier in terms of the new "start menu" which makes programs more accessible, showing the most recently used program and quick access to system setting tools. The graphical user interface is also beautiful with softedged icons and other GUI sweeties. Other nice goodies include I.E. 6.0, Media Player 8.0 and a much more updated messenger system that allows users to see each other when instanting messaging but, make sure you have a web-cam. I would not regard Windows XP as a incremental upgrade, but a rather necessary one. Their are slew of other features that have not been discussed here. Make sure your hardware and system requirments are up to date so you won't run into any problems.
