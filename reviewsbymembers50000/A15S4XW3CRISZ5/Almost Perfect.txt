 This is a simple but commendable collection of popular Microsoft products. Encarta Encyclopedia is great for looking up interesting articles and helping people getting information interesting topics relating to our world today. It's very helpful to kids who want to get the most of their education by getting insightful information about topics relating to class work. Money is a wonderful solution that provides many home users with the ability to manage their money well, with features for banking online and managing household finances. Picture It! Photo is satisfactory for removing a flaw or two in Photos, but will never compare to other photo-editing programmes such Adobe Photoshop Elements which I think is worth it more than this low end photo-editor from Microsoft. Office Portfolio is garbage I purchased it separately and was very much disappointed. The templates in Microsoft Office are much better, I would advise you stick to those. Overall its not a bad collection, but I think it could do with a little more spice, maybe if they dropped in one of the MS Office apps such Excel it would have made it a little bit worthier. If I could recommend another product it would be Corel WordPerfect Family Pack 4 or even Microsoft's own Works Suite 2003.
