 To be honest I spend money as I look at it, but MS Money takes care of that. A wonderful solution that provides informative tutorials on how to budget ones self more efficiently. Money has evolved over the years into an enormous resource for helping users get their financial investments together. The application is becoming more and more integrated allowing users to take care of such task as paying bills online, buying a car, house or any other type of household activity concerning how you spend money. It organises the users investments. It's also a wonderful budgetting tool, comparing itself to Quicken. But the thing about Money 2003, is the interface, it's more pleasing to look at and based on my observation more easier to use based on it's intuitive wizards. I really recommend you purchase money if you don't have it. I implore users. If you are a Quicken user, stick with it, I think Quicken is more powerful than Money regardless of the many bells and whistles it has. If you are new to the budgetting software I try Money because of the ease of use, but for long time Quicken users stick with what you use to. Should you upgrade? If you recently spent money buying Money 2002, don't worry to upgrade to it yet, wait six month's to a year, their is really no reason to rush but if you are still using a previous version of Money prior to version 2002 it's a worthy upgrade. For version 2002 users the reason why I don't recommend you upgrade is because of Microsoft's unpredictable upgrade cycle just as you might purchase this new version of Money, news about Money 2004 start's circulating, I don't want you to make any mistakes wasting your money, here.
