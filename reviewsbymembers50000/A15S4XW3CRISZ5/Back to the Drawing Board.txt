 I was very much disappointed by this product I was certainly hoping a product that would make Windows XP more spectacular but all I got was things that should be a part of the operating system anyway. The games are not full version, that's a major turn off, I was expecting more games too and some of them are memory hogs. Themes are great but could have gotten a little bit more for my money. What they should have done with this product was to include 10 categories of each feature, 10 games, 10 themes etc. Just to make the product at least seem worthy of the price you are paying, remember most of the features are not full versions, the fish tank for one is not a full version that hyperbowl thing is not full version. Media Player features are really not necessary and you need a lot of PC Horse Power for the voice recognition which I think needs better integration with the product itself. Overall most of the features in here you can find elsewhere online. The product price needs to be dropped also.
