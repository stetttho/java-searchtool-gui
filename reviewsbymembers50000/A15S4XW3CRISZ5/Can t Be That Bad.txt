 At school I used a old version of Greetings and surprisingly it was easy to use. At first you have to get accustomed to the user interface, but after a while you don't have to concentrate on customization. Software programs take time getting use to. It has a lot of great features that are good enough for publishing. But if you the users want better publishing capabilities such as Business Cards, News Letters, Greeting Cards and wonderful easy to use features why not try Microsoft Publisher 2002. For users who are new to things such as creating cards and other craft projects the integration and ease use between Microsoft Office makes Publisher 2002 a easy to use application. To me, Greetings is just an essentials program but if you want it all go for Publisher 2002.
