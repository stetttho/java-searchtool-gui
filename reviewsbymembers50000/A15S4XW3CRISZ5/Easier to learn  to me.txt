 This is my fifth version of Corel Draw, I started using it at version 7. I always thought of it as being difficult, so I saved up enough money to purchase Adobe Illustrator, because I had seen some work that was done with Illustrator, so I thought maybe it would be a lot easier to use. After trying to use it I ended up reverting to Corel Draw. I consider DRAW to be much easier in terms of its intuitiveness and simple accessible GUI. Adobe tries too much to uniform all of the GUI's in their apps, making it difficult to have access to "certain" features. I have created flyers, Newsletters, post cards and other types of content creation with DRAW, I do not recommend you use it for page layout though it's not as lenient as other dedicated DTP programs, but it does get the job. Don't get me wrong though about Illustrator, its a great app, but for people who are already comfortable in the Corel Draw environment and are using the program for years now I recommend you stick with it. PhotoPaint is not what it says, forget about it and buy the master of them all, Adobe Photoshop, especially version 7, the power of that program and the capabilities it has for editing photos is amazing. RAVE, is no different from version one but I guess it would have seemed odd if they had not included it in version 11, I would also suggest you stick to Macromedia Flash or Flash MX.
