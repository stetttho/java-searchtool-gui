 Microsoft Publisher 2002 contains new features for users such as the Microsoft Office Word-Art, which I think is a plus. It was so difficult in previous versions of Publisher to insert Text Art so that's one major benefit from the program. It has the familiar Task Pane which makes integration across all the Office (XP) applications work seamlessly. You get ton's Clip Art that are very unique so that Publications can look different and fancy. You also get more design templates for better variety and individuality in your publications, so that's another added bonus. It's cheaper than most high-end desk top publishers such as PageMaker or Quark Xpress. So if you are a person who does simple projects such as creating Post Cards, News Letters Publisher I think will come in very handy for those types of Projects. ... I think Microsoft Publisher is worth the buy. And it's better for first users of desktop publishing. Some experienced users might experience some problems with publications created in previous versions of Publisher but, it's not a major problem. Older files do convert thou, you just have remember if you are going to save a file as a previous version, you have to select file type. One of the main things is that it get's the job done and thats what we all want to do, right!
