 Well, it might seem so at first, but it actually turns out to be a great deal. Offer a set of tools from CD to DVD burning and Photo-Editing. This update aims to provide users with a all in one solution that continues its tradition of ease of use. Because DVD-Burners are not white spread or people might not be burning home movies, the most used application or component must Easy CD Creator Classic, which still remains true to it self with minor improvements to user interface.  If you do want expand your capabilities and to new areas such a DVD Burning which I think is great medium for easily back up your data. Burning movies is very "easy", the 123 step approach the program takes make this a great asset and fun project for the family. The Photo-Editing solution is not inviting and not recommended, as I already use Photoshop Elements which is awesome enough to do what I want. But for simple jobs Easy CD's Photo-Editor will come true for many users especially as a bargain. Users who might want save a few dollars can look to the All in One solution,Nero 6 Ultra Edition, that has almost everything except the Kitchen sink. Overall, if you want the simplicity with extra tools that grow and expand into to other areas with you, Easy CD & DVD Creator, is certainly an easy choice.
