 ... Alright I'm going to talk about the good features, first of all the price is great, so for the money conscious consumer, it's a good purchase. It contains fair enough applications for doing your daily work task from typing documents to creating a worthy enough slide show. It's more easier to learn than the previous version, so it has really improved since the last version. Of course it takes a little bit of time getting accustomed to but eventually you begin to get the hang of it.The applications open indivdually, which is plus, in previous version the applications opened in task pane format. So if you want a simple suite to do simple and complex things it's the suite for you. One other thing the applications are more uniformed, which is why I think Microsoft Office became so popular in the first place. With more ease of use and more improved features, someday this suite might actually be competing against WordPerfect and MS Office
