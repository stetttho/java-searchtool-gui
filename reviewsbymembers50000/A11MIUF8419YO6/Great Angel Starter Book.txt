 Angel Therapy is the first Angel book I started out with!  It's a great place to start.  I liked that the book is set up in such a way that you can either read it straight through or you can simply open the book to any place and receive just the message you were needing to hear!  I liked it so much I bought copies for other members of my family and we now share and swap others of Doreen's Angel books!  If you are just starting out and interested in learning more about angels, this is a great book to start with!  When you finish with this one, you may want to check out Doreen's newest book Messages from the Angelic Realm, which is a sequel to this one.  I just purchased it and look forward to reading and giving a review of it as well.  It is done in the same format as Angel Therapy, but digs a little deeper in to some of the issues covered in Angel therapy.
