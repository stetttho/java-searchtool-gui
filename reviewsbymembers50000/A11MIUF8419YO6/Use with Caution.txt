 I have read and listened to many of Doreen Virtue's books and tapes, but this is the one I have had the most difficulty with. The message of Manifesting with the Angels is a good one, but it is one sided.  There is no caution, that when you do see yourself one year in the future, you might see something unsettling.  I went in with the biggest hopes and dreams.  I did everything asked on the tape, but what I saw one year later was my death.  I actually saw flowers all around me and people gathered in a separate room.  I wrote to Doreen immediately, but only received a message from her staff saying that they felt for me.   I have moved on to reading Archangel Michael's messages in On Wings of Light by Ronna Herman where he talks about co-creating our futures and being pro-active participants in our lives.  I feel that Archangel Michael's messages guided me thoroughly every step of the way. Doreen fails to caution or alert people that what they see one year later, could be illness, accident, death.  I wish that I had been more properly prepared for the message I received.  So I caution those of you considering purchasing this product to be open and aware that the message you receive may be unsettling.  As I am writing this, the message of my death did not come true.  I did use caution in my own life to take steps to prevent such, using the messages as a warning. But I would recommend On Wings of Light, instead, our futures are not set in stone and subject to change.  For this I am grateful.
