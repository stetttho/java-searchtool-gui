 I have been searching all over for the Love Is in the Earth book that had an extensive listing of rocks, minerals, crystals and finally this is it! If you are interested in rocks, minerals, crystals, this book is a good reference!  Contains some information about mineral families and chemical compositions as well as healing properties.  Melody has many great books, but I hope one day, she can update this version (which I like) to include pictures of the various rocks, minerals, crystals.  Now I am looking for the right Melody book of pictures to go along as a companion for this one.
