 Finally, T'ai Chi presented in a form I can follow!  Claire Hooton's Reverse teaching method helps me move with the group and she moves through slow enough that I can figure out the different steps and perform them.  I've tried other T'ai Chi videos, which were beautiful to watch, but I couldn't perform the steps.  I've tried taking a class, but the instructor grew impatient with me because I kept moving to the opposite direction.  This video actually helped me to learn T'ai Chi.  I still have difficulty doing the steps very fast, but at least I can do them with this video. Not all T'ai Chi videos work for everyone and no one should judge what methods someone uses to be healthy.  For those of us, who move a little slower or need a different approach, I highly recommend this video.  Do what works for you!
