 I purchased this book online after reading the reviews and sample pages!  I thought this was the greatest thing I have read since Erma Bombeck, then I learned that the book deals with some issues of incest, which the author is dealing with.  That part caught me off guard.  I bought two copies, one to give to a friend and now I'm not sure if this is the perfect gift to give. The majority of Succulent Wild Woman is fantastic!  And I recommend it, but I want people to know that she does talk about her incest experience.  If I had known about this, I would have chosen a different one of her books to start with.  I do like that the book looks handwritten and hand painted with neat little illustrations in and out and around the text.  This is a good book for inspiring, young women.  A good book to read with your daughters and talk through some of the deeper issues.
