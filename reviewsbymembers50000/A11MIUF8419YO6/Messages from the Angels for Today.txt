 I just received my copy of Messages from Your Angels and I was really surprised at just how much information is contained in this book.  I have read Angel Therapy, Healing with the Angels, Manifesting with the Angels, Chakra clearing with the Angels, Divine Guidance (all by Doreen Virtue) but this one is incredible! The first part of the book is very similar to Angel Therapy, where you have many different topics to open up to or just read as you feel led.  Next it moves on to messages from Archangels Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, and Uriel.  There's a Question and Answer section with questions ranging from "Is this person my soul mate?"  "How do I know if my deceased love one is okay?" From here it brings in many of the key messages for discerning between Angelic voices and Lower Realm Earth-bound souls commonly found in Divine Guidance. If you are just starting out with exploring Angels or interested in learning how to talk with Angels or just to find answers to some of your questions, this is a great book to start with!  Think of it as a sampler of Doreen's works, taking the best parts and combining them all in one book! I have only skimmed through the many sections reading some here and there and I have been very impressed and pleased that this book is so much more than just another Angel Therapy book.  It's an Angel Therapy book, a Divine Guidance Book, a communing with the Angels book, a book for healing and spiritual/personal growth.  A book to consult over and over again.
