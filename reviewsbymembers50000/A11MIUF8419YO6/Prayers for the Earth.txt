 This is a wonderful book of prayers for the earth and all living things on the earth.  The pictures are beautiful and inspiring!  The book features prayers for "children" of all ages from many different faiths.  This book truly shows that we are all one and we are all connected.  I highly recommend this book for all ages, especially adults.  Read this book to your children or purchase it for yourselves to remind you of how simple life really can be!
