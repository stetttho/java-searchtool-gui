 It is a pity that this quartet of David Miller's books: The New Polytheism, Christs, Three Faces of God and Hells and Holy Ghosts are out of print.  They are simply brilliant examples of Archetypal Psychology's eye (that is, a polytheistic, mythopoeic, psyche-logical eye) turned on the beliefs of a montheistic faith.  Not possible you think ?  It is absolutely necessary I think, necessary to turn the two Doctors of the Soul (Jung and Hillman's) eyes on a faith whose soul has been long missing.  For those Christians who have experienced the polytheism of their own soul and are seeking to integrate this experience into their faith these books are tailor made.  I don't know of any other books that have attempted to do what David Miller has done.  His accessible style in explaining complex notions is at least equal to that of Thomas Moore (of Care of the Soul fame).
