 I am a Male and Australian but regardless, this book, together with its  companion volume "Gods in Every Man" have  been foundational in  my understanding of my experience of clinical depression.  The experience  of Persephone speaks very powerfully.  Following her myth through I also  found that Hades and Dionysus spoke powerfully as well.  I have either  bought or borrowed every book or article she makes reference to in my myths  and some she doesn't.  Her evocation of those Gods and Goddesses does  justice to all the sources I have found.  This is profound stuff which I am  still coming to terms with.
