 This book is almost unreadable.  Without a solid background in literary theory, deconstruction, death of god theology, Heidegger, Nietszche and other postmodern methodologies and persons, the words used are too big, too abstract, and too specialized to make any sense to a general readership.  I sense that Winquist has something relevant to say, but it's going to take me quite a while to get a grip on the language.  Winquist's co-edited 'Encyclopedia of Postmodernism' would be minimum background reading before even thinking of getting into Epiphanies.  Perhaps the reason Death of God Theology never took off was because nobody could understand what it was saying !
