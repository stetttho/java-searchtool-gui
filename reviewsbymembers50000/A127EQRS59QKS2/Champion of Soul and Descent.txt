 Having read a variety of Hillman's books and articles and also some by Thomas Moore and David Miller, this book is a good summation of Archetypal Psychology's major thrusts.  Any longer would perhaps be too technical.  A large reference list of articles and books is particularly helpful.  It is less theoretically oriented and more practically oriented than Jungian psychology, and, from Hillmans lucid writing, easier to understand. "As Freud's paradigm of psychopathology was hysteria (and paranoia) and Jung's was schizophrenia, archetypal psychology has so far spoken mainly about depression" p 41.  Anyone who has experienced their own underworld will relate to archetypal psychology.  It validates and gives voice to those personal and cultural experiences of descent that are marginalised and suppressed in a western culture that priveleges optimism, objective science, consumerism and protestantism.
