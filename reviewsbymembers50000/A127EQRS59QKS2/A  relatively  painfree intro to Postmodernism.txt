 Winquist's co-edited 'Encyclopedia of Postmodernism' would be minimum background reading before even thinking of getting into any serious postmodern reading (like Winquist's own 'Epiphanies of Darkness' ?). Short articles written by a wide variety of authors (thankfully not many by Winquist) and (mostly) clear writing makes getting a feel for postmodernism as pain free as it could get.  I would buy this encyclopedia if it were in paperback.  A good addition to any reference library.
