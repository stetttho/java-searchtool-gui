 Of the three works of this author that I have read (Siva & Dionysus, The Phallus and this one), this is by far his best and shows him at his best.  It is eloquent, lucid, comprehensive and inspiring.  Unlike the  other two books, this one is obviously written with a passion for his  subject, and, also unlike the other two books, it has an index (!) which  makes it  accessible!   A great reference book.
