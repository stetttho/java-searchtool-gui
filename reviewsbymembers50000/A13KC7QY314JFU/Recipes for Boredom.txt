 The authors of this book are determined to play to the weaknesses of Fireworks, as if trying to prove it's a better image editor than the big gun, Photoshop.  In doing so, they completely ignore the strengths and value of the programme as a comping and layout tool for web design.  Whole chapters are devoted to...Fireworks' text abilities, while very little is made of it's superior vector capabilities.  Also to it's detriment, the book is structured in response to newsgroup postings and so plays to the intelligence of your average usenet poster, seeking technical support.  If you're looking for "recipes" for bog standard, dated looking web graphics and effects, this is the book for you.  However, if you're looking to discover and utilise the power of Fireworks, I highly recommend Fireworks 4 Expert Edge, a far more valuable use of money and time.  For some reason, PWF has been positioned as some kind of companion to Al Sparber's DW4 Magic--don't be taken in, as it's not project-oriented, reveals little beyond it's own narrow objectives and is riddled with inaccuracies and poorly written instruction.  Coupled with a useless CD to boot.
