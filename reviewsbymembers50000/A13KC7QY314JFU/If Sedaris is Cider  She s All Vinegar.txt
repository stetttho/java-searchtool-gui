 Cintra Wilson will have like minded individuals quaking with laughter, leaving anyone of a conservative bent dumb-founded and angry, no doubt.  Despite the pointed focus of the title, the emphasis is firmly on "other cultural revelations," reading like a loose collection of previous articles by the cannon known as Cintra.  A Regurgitation of American Culture might've been a more apt title, such is the force of her words at times.  Published in 2000, it's a bit dated now but still worth a read.  Though subjects like Miss America and female gymnasts feel oft-visited, Wilson's words are so fresh they're practically crisp.  Though Wilson puts some effort into justifying her sour, at times beyond black, tone as a necessary political means, she doesn't entirely convince.  In fact, the only disappointment is that this doesn't build to a more specific and prescriptive conclusion.  No matter--it doesn't have to.  Wilson is a confident enough writer to tell us all about Kato Kaelin's birthday party without ever feeling the need to explain in detail what she was doing there in the first place.  Ya gotta love that.
