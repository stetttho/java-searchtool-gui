 This book is breezy enough in tone and works well enough as a programmer's reference but the rah-rah Access! delivery grates after a while.  The authors are old school in that they introduce an end of life data access model (DAO) at length and then make endless and confusing references to it while they document the current initiative, ADO.  (They spend 64 pages on DAO--a legacy object model useful only for desktop databases and 46 pages on ADO, the preferred model, an evolving technology for use with everything from desktop to enterprise.)  These topics should be treated in isolation from one another as a side-by-side comparison is just unnecessarily confusing, especially for users of Access 2000/XP/2003.  It's almost like their only intent is to prove how long they've been Access developers instead of providing the most streamlined and useful documentation--in other words, it's more about them than it is you.  They're also big on their own received wisdom as opposed to accuracy like encouraging  readers to document their code as if they were writing a bible because there is no speed hit involved--this isn't necessarily true.  They also have a bad habit of not declaring variables in their sample code (with annoyingly trendy scenarios like "how many lattes can I buy?"), which is a cause for concern in a book about programming.  There is useful, if overenthusiastic, coverage of the new features in Access 2003.  If you're comfortable with the series and need a lengthy reference to complement the Microsoft Access help files, you'll find useful information here...with large swaths of information (hundreds of pages at a time) that you'll probably never use.
