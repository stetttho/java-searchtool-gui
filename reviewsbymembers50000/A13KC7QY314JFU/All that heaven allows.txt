 I started listening to this CD about a week before seeing the film and I felt then that it stood very firmly on it's own.  Having seen the film, I now have this playing in an endless loop on my Walkman and it is absolutely gorgeous.  It's one of those rare film soundtracks that actually plays as the soundtrack to one's life while you listen to--I lose myself in it constantly.  Bernstein and Haynes are working toward the same end, with slightly different means--where Haynes uses style to create distance so that the emotion of the story is controlled, Bernstein rears back from the big emotional moments and takes us on unfamiliar, unexpected detours that locate the uncertainty of the central character.  When the big themes do arrive, it's a stunner.  What I love are the character motifs throughout, in particular Cathy's theme, that survives and endures and emerges under the final piece, small, fragile but still heroic.  In contrast to something like The Hours, this is subtle and, at times, ambiguous.  As Haynes said recently, "I like films that make me think."  This score doesn't tell you what to feel; it deposits you in a place that is uncertain, transitory and constantly shifting.  Just...y'know, a classic.
