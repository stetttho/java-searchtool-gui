 If you're developing a Dummy library then this book is a must have.  D7 & Lingo Authorized isn't a bad bood but it's hard to figure who the target audience is...If you're a client working w/ multimedia and want a  surface knowledge of this programme, then it makes sense.  But if you  really want to learn D7, you might as well start w/ the infinitely superior  D7 Demystified.  Oddly enough, though Phil Gross worked on both books, they  are polar opposites.  D7D is not only informative and definitive, it's also  an engaging read.  D7 Authorized is not very engaging, incredibly  simplistic and not exactly error-free.  The writing itself is so void of  personality and pedantic, one will find themselves paging ahead to relieve  the tedium.  Even if you know absolutely nothing about D7, Demystified is a  better start.
