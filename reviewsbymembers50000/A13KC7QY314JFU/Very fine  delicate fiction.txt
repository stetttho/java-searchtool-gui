 Michael Cunningham has a rare gift as a writer:  he not only has finely tuned powers of observation but he also has the ability to express the unique and almost indefinable in ways that are immediately familiar and recognisable.  There is something sublime, beautiful and delicate about this novel and, in some ways, it's only at the novel's end that all Cunningham has subtly been defining throughout the book rushes over you.  It's a book about seeking presence within your own existence and finding a place of your own on this earth; how most people fear what that implies and how other people embrace it.  It feels like an early novel in this writer's career, a little rough around the edges, at times the author seems a little overwhelmed but it is always elegantly written and brims with a kind of compassion that is somehow absent in the world today.  Cunningham is quite a master with characters as well, all of whom you alternately love and hate--like real people or, at least, how someone with acute powers of observation sees real people.  And in the character of Bobby, he has created a quietly messianic figure for whom your heart will long.  Highly recommended, edifying reading.
