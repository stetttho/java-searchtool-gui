 While I successfully used their Word 2000 Study Guide to pass the Expert exam (with a few, manageable quibbles), the Excel guide leaves much to be desired.  They're good at mapping out the exam objectives but you'll have to refer to a decent third-party manual to unravel their explanations of arrays and lookups, among other things.  Aside from the typos and misinformation--very confusing when discussing a programme like this--Courter & Marquis appear to be assuming that readers bring an already advanced knowledge to this study guide.  Only useful as a springboard for further research.  Like their other guides, the lack of practice documents wastes a considerable amount of study time while you try to mock up their "Hands On" exercises, for which they don't even provide solutions.  The MOUS exam itself will provide sample documents, why C&M don't is a mystery.  They assume you already have a hard disk full of workbooks and worksheets packed with financial data at your disposal--rather wrong-headed for a study guide.  The meager download at the Sybex website is absolutely baffling.  A professional study guide is supposed to highlight valuable information and make efficient use of your time.  This one just doesn't deliver.  For advanced users only, but then, advanced users wouldn't need it.
