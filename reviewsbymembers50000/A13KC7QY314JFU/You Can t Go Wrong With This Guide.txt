 I used this guide after briefly referring to a third-party manual and scored 952/1000 on the exam--three days before, I'd never even used PowerPoint.  Some people think study guides should be as comprehensive as a manual but the truth about the MOUS exams is that, most of the time, the more advanced knowledge you have, the more likely it is that you'll get tripped up interpreting the tasks.  Klippert provides an excellent, easy to read and refer to guide that tells you exactly what you need to know.  The accompanying CD is brilliant with practice documents for everything, including finished solutions so that you can check your work.  What this guide has that most others lack is focus--which is all you need to pass the exam.
