 After slogging through D7 and Lingo Authorized--which is a boring read that condescends to anyone looking to take the big plunge--I found Dymystified to be a godsend.  D7D has great tutorials (and doesn't take  pages to explain how to copy a cast member, for example) but the best thing  about this book is that it enables you to develop a process and good work  habits.  Learning software is one thing, learning productivity is  paramount.  It's an incredibly engaging read as well with none of the  cynicism of the Nutshell books while acknowledging the idiosyncracies of  the programme.  A must have.  This is your first stop if you know nothing  about D7 and want to dig deep.  Can't recommend it enough.
