 Having waited patiently for Ronan's debut cd to be released, I was  disappointed upon hearing it.  Most of the songs do not allow Ronan's voice  to be shown at its full potential.  If you are expecting this to be a solo  rendition of a Boyzone album songwise, this isn't it.  The album definitely  has a more mature sound than Boyzone's normal bubble gum.  The voice is  great as usual, but the material comes across as lackluster.   "Addicted" is the song to skip.  The lyrics are ridiculous and  sound as though they were written by a stoned hippie from the '60's.  A  good deal of the songs are simply forgettable with not much lyrical  content.  There are some noteworthy tracks like "If I Don't Tell You  Now," penned by the great Diane Warren (Because You Loved Me, Don't  Wanna Miss A Thing).  "When You Say Nothing At All" is by far the  best example of Ronans' ability to make a song come alive.  "Once Upon  A Lifetime" is one of the more beautiful songs.  The lyrics are very  poetic. Die hard fans will enjoy the album simply because it is Ronan.   Anyone else is advised to listen before buying. There is just something  about his voice that cannot be found anywhere else.  His unique styling  goes well with that little sparkle in his eyes.  Hopefully, on his next  solo effort, the material will showcase his amazing vocal talent to a  greater extent.
