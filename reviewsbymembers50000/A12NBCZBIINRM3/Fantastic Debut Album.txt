 This former member of The Imperials and the Gaither Vocal Band proves on  is first solo effort that he can hold his own with no problem!  This is  pure pop with a fresh sound.  The title track "One Love" was  nominated for Song of the Year at the 1996 Dove Awards and set the standard   for all of his future singles.  There are some beautiful slow ballads on  this album (i.e. I Rely On You) that showcase Jonathan's amazing vocal  ability.  Stevie Wonder's "Heaven Is Ten Zillion..." is a perfect  mood lifter and though you might find it an odd choice for a "white  boy," it works beautifully with the rest of the songs on the album.   The most beautiful track is definitely "Healing Hands."  This is  a wonderful collection of songs in its own right, but it is also a great  setup for his other two albums.  Jonathan is certainly the best thing that  has happened to Christian music in the past several years!!
