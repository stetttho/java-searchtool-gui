 This guy reeks of talent.  He can sing, he can write, and he can probably  do that while standing on his head!! The album is one of the best I have  ever heard.  This is not one that you have to skip through to get to the  good stuff - the whole thing is good stuff.  The most noteworthy songs on  here are just plain old love ballads that sound fresh and new.   My  favorite is "You Sang To Me."  I don't think it is possible to  make a song any sweeter than that.  "My Baby You" is a beautiful  song that he wrote for his young daughter.  "I Need To Know" is  really fun.  Kinda makes you want to get up and start salsa-ing!!    The  Spanish tracks are very good and you will enjoy them even if you don't  speak the language.  I like the way he sang a couple of the tracks in  English and Spanish (like I Need To Know).  There is a passion in Marc's  voice that is very unique.  It's as though he is feeling the music down to  his toes.  He is often compared to Mr.Shake Your BonBon, Ricky Martin.  In  my opinion, Ricky Martin does not deserve to be compared to Marc!!  Marc  has a sound that is his own.  This album is not what I would call pop, or  R&B, or strictly Latin.  It's kind of a fresh mix of everything that  makes you wish all music sounded like this. I think he is the kind of  artist that will only get better as time goes on.  I can't wait to hear  more from him!!!
