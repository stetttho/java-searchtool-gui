 Okay, okay.....so the movie doesn't follow the book.....the costumes and hair are not exactly the best.....the plot is not what I would consider ingenius....but WHO CARES!   This is one of my alltime favorite movies.  I  love the story and the characters.   I think Aramis was one of the best  roles that Charlie Sheen has ever played.  Oliver Platt is the most  entertaining as Porthos, with his "Queen of America" and  "Tsarina of Tokyo."  Keifer Sutherland's Athos can sometimes be  hard to believe, but he pulled it off.  Gabrielle Anwar was lovely as Anne,  but the king was almost as pretty is she is.  Tim Curry plays the bad guy  perfectly, even if he is a little unbelievable.   I love Porthos and his  never ending supply of little weapons.  The movie is full of some of the  best one-liners I have ever heard.  Basically, if you want the real story,  read the book.  If you want a fun and entertaining "adaption,"  watch this.
