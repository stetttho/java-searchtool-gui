 This was the first MB Cd that I got, and it really shows his talent and  ability.  It is a great sample of the music from the early part of his solo  career.  The listener is taken on a musical journey from the softness of  "Holland Park" to the power of "As Dreams Go By."   And  I must say that he could outsing those "Three Tenors" on  "Maria" anyday!!  "If I Can Dream" is a great remake  that makes you want to put on a choir robe and clap and sway!  And of  course, "Love Changes Everything" is fabulous, as usual.  This is  a great "first one."  You won't be disappointed.
