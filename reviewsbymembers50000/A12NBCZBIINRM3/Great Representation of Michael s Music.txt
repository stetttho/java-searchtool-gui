 "The Collection" is made up of songs from Michael's first two  albums.  It is also the only Michael Ball cd that includes the song  "The First Man You Remember" from "Aspects of Love."    Some of the most beautiful songs that he has ever recorded are on this  compilation.  "Stormy Weather" is one of my all-time favorites  and he gives a certain something to the song that cannot be found anywhere  else.  Actually, he gives a certain something to every song.  This album is  very easy on the ears and will only leave you wanting more!
