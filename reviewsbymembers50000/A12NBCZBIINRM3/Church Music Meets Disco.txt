 "Mission" is Jonathan Pierce's second solo album and it doesn't  disappoint.  It is more vocally ambitious than "One Love," his  first album.  A few of the cuts (such as "Hold Me In Your Arms) let us  see the fun side of Jonathan's music, while songs like "Farther Than  Your Grace Can Reach" show us the softness and power of his voice.   His remake of "Praise the Lord" is amazing and "I Belive In  Christ" follows in the same vein.  My favorite track is "To Be A  Christian."  This song depicts what being a true Christian is all  about.  It would have had great potential if it had been released as a  single.   This is a great album that will encourage the listener to be all  they can for God.  Enjoy it!
