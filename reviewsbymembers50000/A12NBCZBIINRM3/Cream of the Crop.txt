 This man has one of the most amazing and expressive voices you will ever hear.  I enjoy many types of music-from alternative bands to opera to pop to musical theatre, and no one can match Jonathan's unique blend of  emotion, passion and pure vocal ability.  "Sanctuary" is his  third solo effort and is one of the best albums I have ever heard.  This  album has basically one theme - there is always hope in God.  The songs  will encourage and uplift (and you may even find yourself dancing along  with it!).  Jonathan has a beautiful way of presenting the gospel through  music that cannot be found anywhere else.  Most of the songs fall into the  category of easy-to-listen-to pop, with a litle flavoring of Sunday Morning  Church (WE BOW) and R&B (I TURN TO YOU).  This is "real  music."  Buy it and let your heart be encouraged!
