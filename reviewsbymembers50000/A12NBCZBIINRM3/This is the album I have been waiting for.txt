 When Avalon released their debut album on December 26, 1996, I was at home with a sprained ankle.  Someone took pity on me and got me the cd.  I loved it.  When their second album came out, I was very disappointed with it.  Their most recent effort, "A Different Light" was a great improvement.  But, this holiday album is their best to date, in my opinion.   I am so impressed with this cd.  The vocals are top rate, the orchestrations are beautiful, and the choice of material is perfect. "Angel Medley" and "Manger Medley" are comprised of traditional carols (Silent Night, Away In A Manger, etc.). Jody does a fantastic version of Celine Dion's "Don't Save It All For Christmas Day."  The Mariah Carey / Walter Afanasieff penned "Jesus Born On This Day" has never sounded better, with Cherie at her best on lead. "The Christmas Song," one of my favorites, is beautiful. "Winter Wonderland" has a great big band feel to it and is a real vocal workout (kind of reminds me of a toned down Take6). The London Session Orchestra and the various choirs add that perfect Christmas flavor.  The quality of the album is incredible, and has a lot to do with its procuder, the legendary Brown Bannister. This is how a Christmas album is supposed to sound. Excellent job, Avalon!
