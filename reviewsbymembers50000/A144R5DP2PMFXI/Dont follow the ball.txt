 This game is an arcade style shoot the ball at others of matching color type. The balls travel in mazes. There are many ways to earn bonus points. The balls travel faster at higher levels and they add more colors making it harder to get a match before the balls get past you and through the exit of the maze. This is one of those games where its easy to lose track of time. Thats the bad news. The good news is that for those days where you need a bit of mindless escapism, this game is excellent. One thing I have learned is to not watch the ball. I have made it all the way through level 13. There is an ending to this game so the writer does allow you that win. Before I was doing well I would set up and shot, watch the ball travel, then watch it blow up other balls. Then I realized, once you let the ball go, you should move on to the next shot. If you KNOW if the ball landed (you saw it land), you are watching the old ball travel instead of setting up the new shot. Your wasting time. The game sucks you into that because its so gratifying to watch something you shot blow something else up. Resist the temptation. Learn on the lower levels to make gap shots. You must be able to blow a hole through a closer level, then shoot through that to objects further away for bonus points. This bonus will slow things down enough to allow you to win up to the last level. The game goes up to one board of level 13. For those that havent bought the game yet, do so. This game is good clean fun for not much money. Once you buy it make sure you read the writing in between boards outloud. Its pretty amusing. This is a game that you will play for several days, forget about, and then rediscover again and again on your computer. So far I have thoroughly enjoyed every time I have run through this game.
