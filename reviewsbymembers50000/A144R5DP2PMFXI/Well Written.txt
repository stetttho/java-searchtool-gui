 I took freshman physics in college. I picked up this book as a bit of a review. It is well worth reading. It is pitched at a level that a 12 year old could understand, but contains physics that would educate and entertain adults. I recommend getting the accompanying work book as well. There are concept questions and math questions. The math questions at the end of the chapters require knowledge of arithmetic ( not heavy algebra or calculus ).  I recommend this book for those that just like to read educational material for fun.... this is a light enough read to allow that. I also recommend this book for science students that want to get the concepts of physics down, before they get bogged down in the math. It makes your higher level physics book much easier to read.  If you dont get this book, you are really missin out on a good thing. Katherine PS yes real girls do read physics
