 Use this book along with CDs on intermediate algebra Calc I and Calc II from www.thinkwell.com. as an excellent way to start your college studies.  I especially liked the depth he went into with conic sections. I for one had not had that much prior use for conic sections. Newton did. He invented calculus in order to answer specific questions and that involved conics. I like that the writer goes beyond using some of Newtons conclusions and goes into more depth. If you dont like depth, then you can read the first first half of the book and stop there (as is done by most nonscience majors). I have seen other calculus books and specifically bought this once because I dont like just memorizing formulas. I wanted to know more about why this subject was invented in the first place. The amaising thing is that if you get through this book, you will be able to understand some math and physics known a few generations ago only to Newton and Libenez. Dont you feel smarter already? Even if you have read other calculus books, read this one!
