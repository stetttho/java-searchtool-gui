 Dont waste your money. Its sad that a program with 2006 in the title doesnt cleanly work with the typical operating system used in most computers in 2006. The program will not load at all. The web page promising support was not helpful at all. I tutor math and was looking for material to use to assist students. There is no way I would hand a child this frustration. Try instead the programs available at www.thinkwell.com
