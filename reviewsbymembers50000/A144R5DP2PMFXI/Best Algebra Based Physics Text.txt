 Physics is a difficult subject. This text does an admirable job of making a difficult subject easier.  There are advantages and disadvantages to disallowing the writer to use calculus in writing the material. Some formulas require calculus to derive and so must be either taken on faith as true, or the derivations looked up in a calculus based test. Fortunately the times when this issue comes up are few enough to not seriously hamper the flow of the book.  This book may be read as a first book on Physics. I strongly recommend the book Conceptual Physics by Hewitt for a running start at the subject.  Members of the lay public interested in physics may read both of these texts, as they are at introductory level and contains material on classical as well as modern physics.  The units are in SI ( metric ) which simplifies the math.  The Wilson and Buffa text has Color photos of natural phenomenon and situations that illustrate the physics under discussion. There examples are intermixed throughout showing how to work problems involving the principles involved.  I believe this book is an important part of a well rounded education. Physics is NOT an easy topic. If it were, then Newton would have developed theories on relativity and gravity waves. This book does what it was designed to do, that is assist beginners in starting their journey.  I read the book. I found it to be fun. Katherine Rogers Yes, Real girls do physics.
