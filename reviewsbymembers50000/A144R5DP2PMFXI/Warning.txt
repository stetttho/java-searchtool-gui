 Do not purchase. The company advertises that the price includes free website access. Once you purchase the book, the company responds by asking a list of personal questions when you attempt to access their site. The book includes an access code but no password. They refuse to give a passcode until you have answered personal questions.What if you dont want your personal info in someones database? Thats too bad. Apparently the web site / software isn't quite free once you  have purchased the book.  Boycott this book until they stop asking personal questions that are none of their business. Their excuse is that they need this info to list a student in their database. Do you really think college students should be bullied into giving up personal data? If sales falls off, perhaps they can figure out how to create a unique number in each book so that account numbers are unique. This would mean all a student would need to do would be to choose a unique password and sign on the web site.  Do Not Purchase
