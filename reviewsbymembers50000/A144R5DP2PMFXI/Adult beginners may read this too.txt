 Many books on "dead" languages are very dry (BORING). I recommend this book as a first book in latin even for adults. You can get through the entire book in a few days, and get a running start if you wish to go further in your studies. If you dont go further you will have read an interesting book. Everyone I have shared this book with realizes they too can do this latin thing. They want more. Notice there was a demand from the people reading volume I for the publisher to print a second simliar book.   No one book can teach you all of latin. If this book does nothing else but change latin from a thing other people do to something you do... well it has served its purpose.  Its worth the money. You will spend more than this on entertainment where you dont learn a thing. Buy the book!
