 Physics without math is written at a mathematical level that a bright 11 year old could understand. The subject matter is in enough debth that even students that have taken college physics before will gain new insights. Shapiro has a gift for showing the big picture where you really do follow the thought process. Most importantly however, if the book was dull, you would not read it even if it was very educational. This book is the one that I have been reading at night for fun. Now when I find that a book ends up on the bedside stand, and next to me while cooking, and at the table at meals...that book needs a positive review. Get this book, then after this one if you havent already read it get Hewett conceptual physics. If you enjoy reading science, then this book is for you.
