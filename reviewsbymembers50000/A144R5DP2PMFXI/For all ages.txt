 This is one of the first books to use to learn chess. After you or your child know how the pieces move, the object is to look at the diagram and find a checkmate.  Most books of this type have problems that are over the heads of beginners. This book is on target.  Part of learning how to do checkmate in two moves is to know checkmate when you see it, and to be able to later back up a step and find that same mate again one and then two moves away. In this light the book starts with checkmates. It shows you positions that are checkmate. You will see some patterns you haven't used yet. Even if you are an adult player, do not underestimate this. If you keep the book somewhere that you will have a moment or two to stare at it, ( like by your phone, ) you will discover that over time you get familiar with many patterns. Then you find the checkmates in one and the ones later in two come a lot easier.  Another advantage to this book is because it is light material, it is suitable for times when you just want something really light, such as right before sleep.  If you dont own the book, get the book. It is very inexpensive.  I own 2 copies.  I also like the fact that the answers are at the bottom of the page which keeps a student from having to flip through the book to check their answer.  BR>yes real girls play chess
