 The top line is the original English. The second line is the latin. The third line is an attempted translation.  (Here I have added additional comments.)   ...in which we are introduced to Quo in capite nobis   ostentantur  By which in our heads they are shown (to show a person into someone elses head  means to introduce) (nobis our, capite heads, word order in latin  is not the same as in English  Winnie the pooh and some bees. Winnie ille Pu ataque apues nonnullae  Winne that Pooh, also bees notnone. (translate nonnullae as some)  And so our stories begin. et incipient   fabulae. And they begin the stories. (Latin unlike English had no word "the". To  translate into English this word must be inserted  when this would make sense to do so.)  HERE is Edward Bear, coming downstairs now,  Ecce   Eduardus Ursus, scalis             nunc. Look/behold Edward bear. On the staircase now.   (scalis is literally a ladder)   bump, bump,bump,  tump-tump-tump   on the back of his head,           occipite                gradus         pulsante  back of the head on the grade (stairs) he hits (pulses) (Occipital region is the back of the head. Think of hits  or pulsations while on a down grade).  behind Christopher Robin. post Christophorum Robin descendens. after Christopher Robin he climbs down (descends).   It is,  as far as  he  knows,   Est     quod       sciat, It is   which       he-thinks  the  only  way         of coming downstairs,  unus et solus    modus     gradibus descendendi,  the-one and only manner of the stairs descending,  But sometimes  Nonnunquam               autem Not-atnotime(sometimes)  but (however) (sometimes however)  he feels     that there really is another way,       sentit       etiam   alterum      modum   exstare,     he perceives also    there-is-one manner  to stand apart (he senses yet another mode exists)  if only        he could stop bumping dummodo        pulstationibus desinere  (possit) Provided that  the-bumping- to-give-up (it is possible)     for a moment and think of it. Et de     eo         modo     meditari possit. And about I go about manner consider it is possible (de Eo modo the manner you go about something ie method ) ( and it is possible to think about the method.)  And then he feels that  perhaps  there  isn't.  Dende     censet  alios modos        non esse. Then      he feels the-other manners  to not be. (so sometimes he thinks there are no other methods).   Anyhow, here  he is  at the bottom   En,     nunc ipse    in imo est. Behold, now himself  at the bottom           (note imus form of inferus is used here)  , and ready to be introduced to you. vobis   ostentari     paratus to you   to be shown   prepared  (prepared to be shown to you)  Winnie-the-Pooh.  (OK, so you get the picture. DONT miss this book. Pooh is about to roll in the mud next then take up flying. Do you really wanna miss that?  If you would have had trouble translating that level of Latin on your own, get a copy in English as well. Also get Latin translation software so that you can quickly look up any unknown word. You can plug in words, phrases, sentences, and paragraphs, into the software for immediate translation. I use QuickLatin for this purpose but there are others.
