 The number of lists of "classic" literature on Amazon is rather silly.  It is pretty clear to must people with a High School education that Steinbeck and Hemingway are pretty standard.  Absalom, Absalom is not standard.  That is because it is a searing, shocking and truly unsurpassed work of art.   At the heart of this novel is a struggle for identity.  How do we understand our history.  In these days of "evil-doers" and the axis of "evil", we are often deluged with a biased media's quest to simplify historical conflicts of identity.  Likewise, Quentin Compson is intrigued and repulsed by the history of the South.  Is the South "America"?  Are the slaves actually free in their own minds?   Faulkner is also amazing in his grasp of the philosophical underpinnings of gender issues.  Judith, Sutpen's daugther is a new Antigone who must bury one of her two brothers when they feud.  Faulkner's Southern agrarian lifestyle, and gentle humility in the face of nature(and correspondingly, our natures) is somewhat lacking in the flippant Beat generation through the electronic generation.  If Faulkner were alive today, we would be reading deconstructions of internet porn and corporate Caesars, not silly vain and impotent gestures such as "Sex in the City."  Morality is not dead.
