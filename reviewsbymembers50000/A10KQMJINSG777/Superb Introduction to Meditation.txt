 In an ideal world, it would be easy to go to a temple and sit in the presence of a compassionate teacher who can open our hearts.  Thanks to Ken McRae, we get the next best thing.  If you want to learn the basics of meditating or know someone who does, look no further than The Daily Practice of Meditation.  The CD begins with Ken's simple yet insightful comments on his experiences of teaching meditation for the past 20 years.  The next track gives clear recommendations of how to begin a session, urging potential meditators that there is no "one way of meditatinng".  Ken also reminds us not to take it too seriously.  The next tracks contain three twelve minute sequences.  The first concentrates on the breath; the second on a mantra or sacred sound; and the third is a silent track.  Having studied under McRae, I have experienced first hand the benifits of his clear and helpful instruction.  Anyone can benefit from practice, even as little as 12 minutes a day.
