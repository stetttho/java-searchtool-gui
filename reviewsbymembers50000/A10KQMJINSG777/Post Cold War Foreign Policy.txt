 Beschloss and Talbott spin a tremendously absorbing narrative about the collapse of communism. They describe in detail the summits, conversations and debates that took place between Gorbachev and his foreign minister on one side and George Bush on the other. Their main focus is the foreign policy of the Bush administration. Their prose flows well, their anecdotes are interesting their characters are engaging. They only rarely fall into the trap of overly-journalistic prose. Their description of George Bush and his role is a bit under-stated; they focus more on George Schlutz and James Baker.  The book is surprisingly straightfoward concerning the opionions of the power elite and their concerns about creating a "culture of compliance."  The best part in the book describes the Malta Summit of '89, where Bush and Gorbachev meet on a ship off the Island of Malta amidst a violent storm.  This book, while good, misses a couple of crucial areas of the Cold War. There is not a single reference to formerly-communist Yugoslavia, a country whose war in the early 1990's was both bloody and protracted. References to Gorbachev's frustration with the World Bank and the GATT/WTO deserve better examination. The book is at its best describing the spirited jargon and one-liners of the wonks, politicos and statesmen.
