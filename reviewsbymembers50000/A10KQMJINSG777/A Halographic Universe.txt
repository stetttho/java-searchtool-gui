 This is my favorite Castanenda book, and I have read almost all of them.  Please skip my following justification for these books if you are already a fan:  Regardless of how one feels about the New Age movement, it is clear that, as Einstein observed, "Whoever undertakes to set himself up as a judge of Truth and Knowledge is shipwrecked by the laughter of the gods."  Reading Castaneda gave me an appreciation for people who take seriously the complexities of the mind, the universe and their infinite dance.  Castaneda, in this book, seems ready to acknowledge that the fact of other ways of perceiving the world seems to mean that there are rational and non-rational ways which intertwine with eachother.    Having said that, Castaneda lovers will enjoy the many characters, stories and esoteric teachings that really coalesce in this book unlike in any other.  We finally understand who La Catalina really is; we go deeper into the teachings on the Eagle; we get to here more about the interplay between Don Juan and Don Genaro, and we see Carlos opening up a bit too.  It was not until I read this book that I realized how hard it was for Carlos to lose his "self-importance," and what a difficult task this is.  Enjoy.
