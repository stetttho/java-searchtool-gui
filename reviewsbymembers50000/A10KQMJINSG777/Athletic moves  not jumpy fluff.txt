 Getting this video used for a buck was the best deal I have found all year.  Cindy begins with a good warm up and stretch section.  The aerobic series follows.  I am not a fan of elaborate aerobics, so I was happy with the basics that are really worked: lunges, squats, kicks and jumps.  Three ab segments are spread out across the workout: you will feel the burn.  I think there is a total of about 160-200 reps.  The stregnth training is very thorough: lots of chest excercises are something kind of different, rows and curls are plentiful.  All of this takes place with beautiul backgrounds and ethereal music.  Cindy is sweet and inspirational, but as another reviewer pointed out, not even supermodels have perfect bodies.  Working out is fun!
