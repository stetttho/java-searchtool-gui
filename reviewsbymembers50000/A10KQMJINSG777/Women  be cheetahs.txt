 Written by a woman for women, this book covers all the bases.  Whether you are a winged-foot goddess or a beginning plodder, you will not regret buying this book when you see the good organization, nice layout and interesting anecdotes.  Training for a marathon?  This book gives a good program that, one coupled with maybe one other marathon book such as "Four Months to a Four hour marathon" could be all you need for running.  This book gives some of the best speed workout suggestions that I have seen, building you up depending on experience. Strength training section is quite decent, and with a pair of dumbbells from the Salvation Army or something, you can add a lot to your running.  There are pace charts, nutrition charts, height and weight charts galore.
