 It is hard for me to criticize this book, because the example project is practical and interesting.  The directions are pretty straightfoward, giving users a good command of working with 1. layers and 2. media assets like video clips and graphics.   However, this book is not the best for complete Flash beginners for several reasons.  First, for complete beginners the Flash work environment is very complicated.  My experience with Dreamweaver, Photoshop and HTML carried over only marginally to Flash.  The book takes a very plodding approach to acquainting new users to how Flash "works."  120 pages into the book, I felt like I still had no clue WHY the directions were telling me to do certain things.  For example, why do I have to put labels on the timeline?  Why do I have to switch between different editing modes? etc. The book is not very well edited, and the instructions themselves could be clearer.  For example, the paraphrased step and the instructions that follow it often muddle the point of what you are doing.   For a better understanding of the "what's" and "why's" of Flash, I reccomend the Sam's Teach Yourself book on the subject.  It is a better global view of the Flash authoring environment so that beginners can start projects with a better understanding of what you can accheive with Flash.  Reviewers seem to enjoy it a lot.  Following a better introduction to Flash, I will return to deHaan's book and will likely get more out of it.
