 This music is really beautiful and relaxing.  Having said that, I would suggest that this not be your FIRST step into enhancing your creativity.   Read a book such as Stephen Nachmanovitch's "Free Play" or Julia Cameron's "The Artist's Way" if you want to learn more about what it means to know yourself through art.   Those already following the path could take or leave this CD.  The music is soothing and quite pretty.  As for the messages, I believe that, for average people, subliminal suggestion is most effective under the following conditions: 1.  Early Morning 2.  After Meditation 3.  While falling asleep.   4.  When Listened to every day, preferable at the same time 5.  When listened to in conjunction with conscious affirmation. If followed in this way, it is likely that you will see some results.  Whether these results are any better than conscious affirmation or simply intending creativity is hard to say.  I leave it up to you.
