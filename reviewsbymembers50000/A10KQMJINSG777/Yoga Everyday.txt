 Do not be fooled by the relatively low sales rank of this CD.  It is the product of an authentic teacher and will help you in yoga.   If you are without a television, buy it now.  If you can program tracks on your CD player, this CD is especially helpful.  The 14 or so tracks include opening meditation, pranayama, warm-ups and various poses such as the goddess, the eagle and a spinal twist.  The vinyasa-flow is perfect for a morning stretch.  Ken's voice is clear, precise and gentle.  Be sure to check out volume one, as well as Ken's meditation CD.
