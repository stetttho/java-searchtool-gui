 Why is it so hard to find a good sushi book? I first came across this gem in a novelty shop and to my surprise, fell in love. This book is a graphic designers dream and will apeal such people as much as to raw fish eaters. This pocket guide is a museum piece and a must for any book collector. I was a bit put-off by its tiny size but some would argue it adds to its charm.
