 I saw the documentary and now I saw the book! Oh my God! This vlume sets new standards for book design/layout, fantastic computer illustrations, photographs etc... Sure some of the information concerning these beasts is guesswork but not much. Remember, many experts within the field of paleobiology have put in their `2 cents worth`and they know what they are talking about. As a fisheries biologist, i enjoyed the idea of a book that deals with the life histories of these animals on a day by day basis. Book of the year!!
