 I love and hate this book. Being a Nikon lunatic, i kept seeing the book at chapters and when the price was low enough, purchased it. If you want Nikon history, it`s all there, no doubt about that. I was more interested in lens information and performance. The text reads like a nikon pamphlet and gives some information about years in production and design changes. Certain absurdities resurface on almost every page. For example, the author writes about a certain zoom that the ranges of 28-35-50-80 are indicated on the lens. So what, every nikon lens ever made has that. Why mention it on some and not others?. Clearly, the author had to fill the lines and ran out of ideas. The text reads like something very (and I mean VERY) sensured by the nikon Corporation. Even lemon lenses receive a friendly write-up. Incidently, this book is way over-priced. A great buy if you can find it for ten bucks.
