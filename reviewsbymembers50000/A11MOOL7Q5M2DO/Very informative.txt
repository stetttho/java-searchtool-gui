 Frankly, you do not even need to own a Leica to appreciate this book. All the fundamentals of optics and lens design are explained in detail. Any serious photographer should read this book. They will understand the limitations of their non-Leica systems and be in an informative position to decide if they need the ultimate picture recording potential of Leica lenses. Until now, I was using a Nikon F4 with the 17-35 2.8 ED. The author has informed me that he tried the lens, along with the Zeiss (Contax) 17-35 2.8 and neither approach the capabilities of similar leica zooms. Is he crazy? Read this volume and you will understand why no system can match the build, optics and design of Leica. Most important, you will see that the way most lens tests are done in today's photo magazines are not worth much at all. Keep in mind, this is not a stunning picture book. Color photos are kept to an extreme minimum and are only used to make some point about optical capabilities of certain lenses. This book will no doubt serve as the ultimate leica lens buyer's guide. But remember, it is much more than that and Puts is one of the few people who can articulate lens performance into a fun and informative read.  A soft cover version would be nice for those who can't afford the hard cover volume.
