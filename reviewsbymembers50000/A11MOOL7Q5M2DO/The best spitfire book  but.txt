 No doubt, this is the single most important book to own if you are interested in the history of the Spitfire and all its variants. But, it should be mentioned that this is a rather ugly book in the visual sense. The color illustrations are among the worst i have ever seen (artwork varies from terrible to good). An endless number of pages are dedicated to listing serial numbers and the printing quality of the b&w photos is poor. The text is interesting and offers so much more than most Spitfire books. If you buy this volume, i strongly suggest you also get a book like Spitfire:Flying Legend. This way, you will have the definitive text in one volume and great photos of numerous variants in another. For those (like myself) who are interested in line drawings of the aircraft structure, this book is splendid. Also worth noting that almost all the photos, as so-so as some may be, are of great value because they are not seen in other books. Lots of unique things in this volume. They should take this book to a graphics design bureau and let them put it together. The result wiould be a book costing $80 instead of $...but imagine what it could look like.
