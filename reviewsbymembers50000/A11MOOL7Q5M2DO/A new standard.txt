 The Atlas of Pacific Salmon is what all universities and government agencies needed 20 years ago. I dare say, it was almost worth the wait. This is a splensid compilation of data and images. The map work in this volume deserves much praise. The content covers biogeography, biology, genetics, threats, status etc.... Should sell for over $150
