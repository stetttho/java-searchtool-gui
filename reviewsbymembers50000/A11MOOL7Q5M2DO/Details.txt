 If you are more interested in camouflage than the actual blue print of the aircraft, this is the book for you. The level of detail concerning insignia and variation in paint schemes makes this book fascinating. Remember, the goal of the artist was not to make super realistic lateral views. Rather, it is a chronicle on the creative camouflage applications by the Luftwaffe during WW II. I was somewhat bothered by the underneath wing cross not following the shape of the wing. Unacceptable considering all the work that went into these illustrations. No one checked for typos and word spacing problems either. Still, the two volumes of this series are the most important books of their kind. Aircraft modlers will go absolutely nuts over these books.
