 I liked the photography in this book but i can not believe how UNSHARP many of the shots appear to be. They are blown up way too much considering he works with 35mm equipment. The book layout is splendid but should be produced in half the dimensions of the current version. Best part is the distribution maps with the photos reduced and a brief write-up about the species and how the shots were taken.
