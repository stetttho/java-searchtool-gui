 First of all, I am not a rockfish biologist. All my research is focused on sturgeons, but I have always had a "thing" for rockfish. I for one, feel this book represents the ultimate field guide. But unlike most field guides, it has a tremendous amount of information concerning each species as well as fisheries, stock trends etc.....  If you need more information on rockfish than what this volume provides, go look it up in a journal! That is what journals are for. This book does a great job in summing up the basic life history aspects and description of each species. Also worth mentioning is the fact that this is one heck of a beautiful book! The photos are good to great and the distribution maps are nicely done. In terms of overall layout, we can all learn much from this volume. BRAVO !!!!!
