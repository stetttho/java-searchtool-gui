 St. Ives Apricot Scrub is the only facial scrub I use.  It's really gentle and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth, with a healthy glow.  I have such a baby soft face after using it.  My favorite part is its gentle apricot scent - it's really nice.  My sweetie can't stop cuddling close to me or kissing my cheek after I've used it, which is a big plus.  ;)  This is a great scrub; I honestly can't say enough about how soft my skin feels afterwards.
