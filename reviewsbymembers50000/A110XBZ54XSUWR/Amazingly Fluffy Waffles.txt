 Breakfast has always been my favorite meal of the day and one that I could eat at every meal.  I usually relied on cold cereals to propel me through the day, but was introduced to a waffle iron at my college and fell in love with Belgian waffles.  I decided I needed to invest in one of my own, and picked out the Hamilton Beach Flip N Fluff due to its five-star reviews.  I tried the Flip N Fluff on the same night it was delivered.  I used Aunt Jemima's Whole Wheat Pancake Mix, threw in a handful of frozen blueberries, and poured a half a cup on each griddle after the green light told me the waffle maker was ready for the batter.  I waited exactly five minutes, opened it up, and had two golden brown, fluffy waffles.  It was delicious and much better than those compact frozen Eggos.  Since then, I've experimented with different homemade batters: buttermilk, lemon poppyseed, pumpkin & cinnamon (for a seasonal treat), harvest grain and nut, and chocolate.  It's been a real pleasure trying different flavors and making waffles for family and friends, who are impressed and ready to ditch their store-bought waffles and invest in a Flip N' Fluff.  Overall, the Hamilton Beach has worked time and time again; I've already made at least 100 waffles with it.  For a breakfast aficionado such as myself, your kitchen wouldn't be complete with a waffle iron of such good quality.
