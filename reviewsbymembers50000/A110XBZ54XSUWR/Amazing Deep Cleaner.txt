 I bought this carpet cleaner because it had a great price, came with free shipping, and had 80+ people saying how well it worked on all sorts of stains.  It arrived just a few days after I place my order.  I finally used the Hoover Steamvac Jr. today and am so impressed!  We had some set-in stains in our beige carpets which looked horrible - mud that had been tracked in, and coffee that had been spilled.  The Hoover Steamvac is really easy to use: just fill the cup with the included solution, add hot water, and spray some on the carpet.  It took some time to practice aiming the spray on the stains - I found it actually squirts from the side of the nozzle, not directly straight down.  Anyway, I sprayed some on the stains, vacuumed it up (the Hoover Steamvac put the dirty water in a separate component), and the stains were miraculously gone.  I heard how well the product worked, but I needed to see it with my own eyes to be a believer.  All in all, it's a terrific product - lightweight and portable, efficient at removing stains, and low-priced.  I didn't find it noisy at all, contrary to some peoples' reviews.  If you're looking to clean your home carpets, upholstery, or car, I definitely recommend this product.
