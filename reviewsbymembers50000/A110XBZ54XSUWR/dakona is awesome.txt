 Like Megan, I was at the dakona/Jason Mraz/Michelle Branch concert at OU.  dakona blew me away - I loved Ryan's stage presentation!  He had a deep voice, and the way he slid down the microphone, soulfully singing on bended knee, had me hooked.  At intermission, I ran from my seat to buy their CD.  The guys (who are very sweet, personable) were gracious enough to sign it and chat with me afterwards.  "Perfect Change" has been on continuous play since the concert; I can't get enough of it!  I love their original lyrics ("If it'd mother all the orphans in my head"), and their sound couldn't be any better.  I love all the tracks, and by all means couldn't pick a favorite - each song has its own unique characteristic that makes the whole album enjoyable.  This is what rock should sound like!  Thank you so much for a memorable evening, and a great CD for my collection!  :)
