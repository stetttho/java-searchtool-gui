 When I was growing up, my mom and I made spritz cookies all the time.  Now that I live in my own apartment, I wanted to continue making them.  I bought a cheap, plastic $20 cookie shooter that had no motor power to drive the cookie batter out.  I was unable to make any cookies and consequently, wasted all the batter.  It was useless, and I had to throw it away.    I then decided to invest in a VillaWare Power Cookie Press.  I can't believe the difference between the two devices!  VillaWare's Press is made of high-quality parts that make it durable.  I made a huge amount of batter, and easily cranked out hundreds of holiday cookies.  It was really simple to use - just press the button and wait five seconds - and all of the cookies came out perfectly.  I loved the different discs that were included - all you have to do is get creative with colored sugars, sprinkles, and icing.  Overall, it's worth investing in the VillaWare Cookie Press.  You're sure to get a product that will actually function and have a long lifespan, providing you with batches of cookies season after season.
