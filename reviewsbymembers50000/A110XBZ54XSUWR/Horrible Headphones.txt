 I'm currently on my fourth set of Apple in-ear headphones.  I had the same problem with the previous three: the red strip of glue holding the silver part to the white weakens within time, and the earbuds keep falling apart, exposing their inner wires.  I shove the wires back in, try to firmly press the silver part in, but it just doesn't hold.  I'm by no means rough on my headphones; I do work out and run constantly, which might contribute to the band's weakening (e.x. moisture from sweat weakens the glue inside), but Apple is doing a disservice by not making them one solid piece and continuing to manufacture them as two pieces held together by a thin, weak band.  I've had them replaced free of charge by Apple each time, but I think I'm through with the Apple In-Ear Headphones after this set inevitably separates.
