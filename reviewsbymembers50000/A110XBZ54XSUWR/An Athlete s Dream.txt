 As someone who jogs, rollerblades, hikes, and works out quite often, I've found the Apple iPod shuffle is the best mp3 player for athletic activty.   While the iPod shuffle isn's as colorful or cute as the iPod mini, it has a sleek, scratch-resistant surface that looks as good as the first day I got it, even though I've dropped it, bumped it, and banged it quite a few times now.  The iPod shuffle is durable and can hold up through high-impact workouts and activities.  What I love most about it is its light and compact body, so it doesn't get in the way or hold me down while I'm jogging.  It's slim enough to comfortably slip in a pocket without noticing, yet the controls are big enough to change tracks, adjust the volume, or toggle it on/off without fumbling.    The iPod stores approximately 100 tunes; I currently have 119 on mine, which provides me with hours of fast-paced music to keep my energy up and get me through my workouts.  If you're looking for a trendy fashion device to clip on your jeans and listen to while shopping, walking, on an airplane, etc., the iPod mini is the way to go.  But if you're simply looking for a tiny, portable device that will deliver a strong and continuous flow of music, and aren't worried about its fashion factor, look no further than the iPod shuffle.
