 I feel like my review for Dr. Atkins' diet is long overdue.  At 19, I was 5'6" and 227 lbs.  I looked horrible, I didn't like getting out of breath on small hills, and I didn't feel comfortable in my own body.  Feeling frustrated and miserable, I ordered the New Diet Revolution.  It was difficult to initially ditch carbohydrates and switch to all protein and veggies.  Once I got past the first few days, though, I was on the road to success.  I saw a weight loss of 2-3 lbs. a week, which was encouraging.  The Atkins chocolate shakes and bars were a nice occasional treat.  In four months, I had lost 40 lbs. just by following the diet and not exercising.  It was so nice to be in the 100-pound range again, and it was nice to see my face and body melting.  When you're 200+ lbs., you don't really know where to start.  Dr. Atkins made the plan simple and easy, and didn't require exercise to see the results.  Once I got to the stage where I didn't feel so helpless and hopeless, thinking it'd be impossible to be slim, I incorporated exercise and switched my eating plan.  I started eating sensibly, while still using the basic principles the New Diet Revolution taught me.  Atkins allowed me to lose my sweet tooth (for pop, chocolate, cake, and cookies), taught me what reasonable portions were (to feel full, not stuffed from gorging), and allowed me to see the numerous benefits to exercise, which I engage in six days a week.  A year later, and I'm over 100 lbs. lighter.  I am 5'6, 121 lbs., and feel much more comfortable in my body.  I love shopping for cute polos and jeans, which I couldn't have fit into previously.  Dr. Atkins' saved me - he saved my self-image, self-esteem, and my health.  I wish I had him to thank personally; I never thought I'd see the day I'd fit into a size 4 pair of jeans.  Thank you so much for changing me, Dr. Atkins, and allowing me to lose those initial 40 lbs. that prevented me from changing who I was.
