 This device makes it really simple to make crepes.  I love how the red light illuminates when the surface is hot enough to add batter, and again when the crepes are finished cooking.  This eliminates any guessing games and prevents burnt or undercooked crepes.  I gave it four stars because when I dip the crepe maker into the batter (in a shallow pie pan or skillet), a very thin layer appears (half the thickness of what a crepe should be).  If left as is, it results in a brittle crepe that crumbles when touched and can't be folded or rolled.  To solve this problem, merely use a butter knife to spread a thicker layer on top of the preliminary dipped layer, then flip it and cook the other side for a few seconds.  Alternatively, you can slowly pour batter onto the surface directly and skip the dipping, but this won't result in a circular crepe - the edges will be jagged.  I LOVE the Maxim CM5 crepe maker.  It heats up quickly and only takes one or two minutes to make a large batch of crepes.  I always get a perfect batch of thin, golden crepes without any rips or tears.  I stuff mine with peanut butter, fruit and yogurt, eggs and cheese, or ice cream and cinnamon.  There are plenty of combinations to try; it's all about experimentation.  This device makes it simple to make delicious crepes for any meal, and I really enjoy using it!
