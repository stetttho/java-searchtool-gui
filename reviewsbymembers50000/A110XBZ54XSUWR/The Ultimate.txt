 What an incredible blender!  I picked up the Oster 2-speed Beehive Chrome Blender (500-watt edition) after researching blenders online.  The 30-some positive reviews it received on multiple websites had me sold, and of course, its overall look was a deciding factor.  Its shiny base adds eye candy to your kitchen, and looks like something you'd find in a 50's jukebox cafe. When I had Oster's Beehive out of the box, assembly took less than a minute - it was a complete cinch.  In the center of the rubber top, there's a small plastic circle that pops in and out, so you can add ingredients from that space, without having to remove the whole top.  Additionally, the base is solid and sturdy, so you can be sure it won't tip over and create a mess.  I bought the blender for making cold, refreshing smoothies on hot summer days, but was a bit skeptical it would be able to handle frozen strawberries / ice cubes.  Any worry I once had was diminished the first time I used it.  This machine crushed the ice completely, along with the strawberries, and resulted in one smooth, delicious, ice cold smoothie!  It was one of the best I've ever had. If you're looking for a heavy-duty, all-business blender, with a powerful motor that'll crush even the toughest ice cube, the Oster Beehive 2-Speed Chrome Blender is the blender for you.
