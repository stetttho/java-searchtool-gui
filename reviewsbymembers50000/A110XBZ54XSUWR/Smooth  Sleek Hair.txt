 My hair used to be straight, but a few years ago, it started to get curly.  Within a few years, it was full of curls and was prone to frizz from rain and humidity.  I tried every shampoo and balm that promised to "give me the hair science didn't," but had no luck.  I finally decided to get a flat iron.  I chose this one because of the positive reviews on amazon.com, and couldn't be more happy with my decision!  The Conair Hair Straightener heats up in 30 seconds and is very quick to staighten my hair.  It takes out all of my curl, and leaves me with soft, smooth, straight hair.  I don't even need hairspray to maintain the style - it stays straight all day, even with snow and rain.  I've had this for a few weeks now and can't live without it.  I love having straight hair again; my only regret is not getting it sooner!  If you're looking for a hair straightener that's quick and leaves your hair super silky, pick up the Conair CS19CS!
