 When I got my new iBook, I wanted to protect it as much as I could.  Underneath the keyboard lies the "guts" of your laptop - chips, wireless card, etc. - that can destroy your entire laptop if damaged.  The iSkin fits snugly like a glove - I'm not sure what everyone else is talking about.  It stays securely in position, doesn't interfere with typing, and the clear option doesn't blur the letters on the keyboard.  I'm really impressed by how many particles it keeps out - after I used it for just a day, the top had collected all sorts of white and black particles that otherwise, would have invaded my laptop.  Another thing I like about the iSkin Protouch PB is it protects your keyboard's lettering.  Oily fingers, over time, will wear your keys down and leave them shiny, sleek, and void of their letters.  Overall, the iSkin is the best investment you could make for your iBook.  It will keep dirt, dust, and particles that could potentially ruin your laptop out, and it will make sure the lettering on your keyboard doesn't rub off within time.  Highly recommended.
