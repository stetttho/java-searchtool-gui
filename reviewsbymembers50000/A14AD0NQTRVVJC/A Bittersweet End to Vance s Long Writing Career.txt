 As noted by others, Lurulu is the last part of one novel begun in Ports of Call. Reading Lurulu on its own without having read Ports of Call will be unsatisfying.  Lurulu picks up loosely where Ports of Call had ended rather abruptly, following the adventures of typical young Vance hero Myron Tany and his shipmates aboard the Glicca (the taciturn captain, Maloof Adair, the impressionable Wingo, and the gaudy Fay Schwatzendale).  Most of the loose plot threads from PoC are resolved in Lurulu, though some are disposed of very abruptly. But Lurulu is not to be read for its plot structure. The characterization is fairly well done, though Myron takes a backseat to Maloof, and Schwatzendale is surprisingly neglected. As is often the case with Vance, the scenery and sociology dominate the narrative. The various planets visited by the Glicca are given somewhat short shrift compared to the usual meticulous Vance treatment. And as he approaches 90, Vance has begun to repeat his earlier works at times. PoC was very reminiscent in spots of Vance's Space Opera.  Also at times, Vance's usual air of sardonic detachment deserts him, and a merely querulous attitude is apparent.  But all in all, Lurulu and PoC comprise a very representative Vance novel. But it is not a book likely to make the unappreciated author any new fans. You almost have to already be familiar with Vance to appreciate Lurulu. I second the recommendation of the Tschai novels as a good introduction to Vance.  Lurulu's ending, however, is almost perfect if unsurprising. The ex-sailor Vance is one of the last romanticizers of the spaceways, and all of his readers should be affected by the way in which Myron's story is resolved.
