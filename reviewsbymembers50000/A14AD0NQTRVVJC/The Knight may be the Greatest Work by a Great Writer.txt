 Gene Wolfe's The Knight is the first half of a long single novel (to be known as The Wizard Knight in its entirety).  The Knight is a fascinating read that succeeds on every level. The Knight follows the peregrinations of Sir Able of the High Heart, a young-seeming knight aspirant who attains adulthood (or has it restored to him) overnight.  The novel draws heavily on both the legends of chivalry and Northern mythology.  Wolfe succeeds admirably in depicting both the ultimately hollow beauty of the former and the cold majesty of the latter.  Never have the Norse frost giants seemed as inexorably menacing as in Wolfe's portrayal, for instance. Wolfe is (not unfairly) often considered to be a difficult writer.  The Knight is perhaps his most reader accessible work.  Nevetheless, although straightforward-seeming, the book cannot be taken entirely at face value!  The narrator is unreliable, as Wolfe's narrators always are.  The book is best approached with extreme caution; the reader should not assume that nothing of any great import happens during a change of scenes, for instance. Wolfe fans will not need any urging to read this book.  Readers who have never tried Wolfe, perhaps put off by his reputation for being obscure or difficult, or those who have tried him and given him up as a bad job, are urged to try (again) with The Knight. Will Wolfe be able to live up to absurdly high expectations in the second part of the story?  His readers will impatiently await publication of The Wizard to find out.
