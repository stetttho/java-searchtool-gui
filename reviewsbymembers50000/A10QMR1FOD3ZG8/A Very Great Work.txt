 Braudel was one of the greatest economic historians of all time.  His scope alone was incredible.  But what in the end hurt him and significantly diminished his findings was his unfamiliarity with the work of Harold Innis, whose landmark "Empire and Communications" was published a quarter century before Braudel published this book in the original French.    Only Innis early work on the Canadian fur trade is referenced in Braudel's bibliographies.  His later work on information in the creation of markets is not.  Both looked at the economics of space and time, but what for Braudel ended in a series of uncertain conclusions ended for Innis in a profound theory of how the falling costs of information altered trade and communications patterns on a global scale.  Put the two together and you have a clear picture of paradigm shifts over the centuries and an excellent framework for understanding outcomes in today's globalized economy.
