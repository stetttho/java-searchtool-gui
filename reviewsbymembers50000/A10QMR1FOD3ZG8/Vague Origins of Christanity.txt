 Ehrman shows the murky and uncertain origins of Christianity: an amorphous collection of beliefs and ideas with no clear authenticity or boundary.  By the third century, however, Christians had a shot at real power and the fight for control -- and orthodoxy -- got serious.  Ehrman charts these events -- who got cut out and why -- with excellent prose and a good sense of humor. Editing: Five Stars.  Well put together and logical.  Clear prose, well structured paragraphs, sections, and chapters.  Careful use of verb congugations. Copy Editing: Four Stars.  There were a few mistakes that should have been corrected
