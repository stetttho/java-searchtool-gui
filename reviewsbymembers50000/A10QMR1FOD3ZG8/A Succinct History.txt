 A Short History is exactly that.  Succinct and to the point, structured around the political evolution of the city, using New York's succession of mayors as its main vehicle. Editing: Four Stars.  Simple structure and well managed. Copy Editing: Four Stars.  One or two things slipped by.  James, Duke of York, after whom the city is named, is called, oddly, Duke James instead of the Duke of York, or more properly, York.  Otherwise clean copy.
