 Krugman's own evolution over the pages of this book -- a collection of his Times pieces with a wrap-around of his recent conclusions -- is a fascinating reflection on the country's own changes since George Bush was made president. He begins as a simple critic of economic policy.  Nothing unusual in this: we need solid critics to help us focus our decisions and Krugman's work is thoughtful.  Before long though, Krugman's understanding unfolds until, like a great whodunit, he grasps that the nation is being defrauded by 1990s-style corporate management: the Enron Presidency. The magnitude of the theft is astonishing -- not millions or billions, but trillions. He, and we, are left with a dark conclusion.  The Cons are running the prison.  The Enron Presidency has moved the government and all its policing agencies to redirect trillions of our national treasure into the hands of a few through an interlocking set of well-designed frauds.  Having been in the fraud detection business myself, I am in awe.
