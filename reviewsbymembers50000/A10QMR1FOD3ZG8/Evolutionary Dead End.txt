 The survival of all organizations depends on how quickly information moves across them.  Fast, you win; slow, you lose.  Any organization, political or corporate, that cannot translate the constantly falling cost of information into higher information velocity, is doomed.  This excellent work shows how Mao raised information costs for everyone but himself, and brought information velocity to a dead stop, effectively shutting the door to China's future.  His methods were unspeakably brutal -- one Holocaust per quarter during the Great Leap Forward -- and his interest in those closest to him non existent.  Editing:  Four Stars. The copy needs a little bit of help.  Some of the prose is a touch stilted.  Copy Editing:  Five Stars.  Very clean.
