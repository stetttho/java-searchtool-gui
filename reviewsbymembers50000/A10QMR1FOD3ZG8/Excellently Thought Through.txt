 MacCulloch's book has few flaws.  It is lucid, knowledgeable without being ponderous, and to the point.  Like all great books, its final chapter, "Outcomes," is its best, threading the impact of the Reformation down to our time and touching the policies of current religious and political leadership.   Where the book stops short is the economic and social impact of the Reformation.  A few years ago I did an exercise for an audience of Japanese executives trying to understand why Japanese businessses were being surpassed by resurgent U.S. companies like Dell and Wal-Mart.  I laid out a simple black and white map of the world.  I overlaid this with a foil showing all the advanced nations, Japan included, in red.  I overlaid this red foil with another showing all the nations impacted by the Reformation in blue.  The audience gasped -- a most unJapanese reaction -- when the bulk of advanced countries came through in purple.  There were almost no red countries (impacted by the Reformation but not advanced) outside the former Soviet Block and similarly almost no blue countries (advanced but unaffected by the Reformation) except Japan -- that country was in trouble.  The greatness of MacCulloch's work is that it goes a long way toward explaining why this should be so.  To do so as clearly and simply as it does is a wonder, especially for a 700 page work.  Editing:  Five Stars though MacCulloch's Luther-like declaration for the semicolon is a little over the top and a good editor might have restrained him a bit on a point of style alone.  Copy Editing:  Five Stars.  Some of MacCulloch's naming conventions are odd, however.  The Atlantic Isles could be anywhere in the Atlantic, North or South.  And "north America"?  Hmm.  Then there is "ruinated" when ruined would do.
