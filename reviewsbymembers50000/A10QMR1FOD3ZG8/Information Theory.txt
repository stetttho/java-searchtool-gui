 There was an unfortunate and very negative review in the New York Times by Leon Wieseltier, who was clearly out of his depth.    Dennett's excellent work is certainly open to criticism.  For starters, he lacks a cogent theory of information.  All organisms survive by reducing the cost of information in their environments; even marginal information cost advantages confer significant survival benefits.  No organism understands this better than we do.  Dennett gets close to this in his discussion of memes, but never quite gets there.  Religions are a simple function of where we are on the information cost curve.  Those that improve our position we keep; those that do not collapse.  It is not for nothing at most major shifts in religion, like the Reformation, are co-incident with sudden drops in the cost of information.  The challenge for religion today is how to adapt, if it can, to  freefalling information costs.  If religion in general no longer serves to reduce the cost of information to us of our enviromnent, it is irrlelevant to our survival and has no future.  Equally, if it can reduce information costs in the post Internet age and beyond, it will prosper, even if in a form we do not yet recognize.  The question, in short, is whether or not religion has a future on the Moore Curve.  The struggle in Islam is best understood this way.  As Harold Innis pointed out half a century ago in his seminal work, "Empire and Communications" (University of Toronto Press) Mohammed, using paper and free trade, slashed the cost of information and unleashed enormous wealth for his followers and Islam grew quickly.  But Islam's information cost advantages evaporated centuries ago and today the frustration in the Muslim world is explosive. Our own religious right face the same bleak future and it is not funny.
