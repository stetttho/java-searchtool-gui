 Levy needs help.  This book is incoherent and poorly constructed.  Except when Levy takes a detour to unload on Heidegger, which he does wonderfully and with real passion, he meanders all over the place.  The book is full of non sequitors and bizarre assertions.  It is not clear at all what his point is.  Must be in here somewhere.  Editing:  Zero Stars.  Someone needed to have a quiet word with Bernard-Henri.  Sentances running 39 lines are a bit much.  Where is the verb?  Copy Editing:  Five Stars.  Very Clean.
