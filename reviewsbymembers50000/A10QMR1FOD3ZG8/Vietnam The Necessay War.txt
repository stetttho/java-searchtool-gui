 This excellent work misses a couple of key points.   First, Lind assumes the U.S. lost the Vietnam War, something that is extremely difficult to prove.  Indeed, he admits early on that no less a Communist than Mao Tse Tung, having realized the magnitude of U.S. victory, broke with the U.S.S.R. well before the war was over and cut his own deal with the United States.  As we all know from the size of our trade deficit with China, this was a decision from which his country has never ceased to benefit. Second, Lind assumes a zero sum symmetry between the contenting Cold War powers.  This is also very difficult to prove.  In FUTUREWEALTH (St Martins, 2000), I pointed out that the first principle of all policy -- social, economic, and foreign -- is that low cost of information organizations always chase out high cost of information organizations.   Since Marx, Communists assumed that the cost of information could be kept very high and rigorously controlled by the state.  Liberals assume the reverse:  that capitalism will drive the cost of information ever lower.   In this extremely asymmetric environment the U.S.S.R. had to collapse.  The only question was when.   We won the Vietnam War so decisively because our advantages were both relative and absolute, something that could be said of few powers before that time.  But that is a commonplace today.
