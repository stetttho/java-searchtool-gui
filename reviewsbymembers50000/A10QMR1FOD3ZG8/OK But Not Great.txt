 This is not one of Chernow's best books.  He suffers from a weakness too many Americans suffer from:  excessive adoration of the country's founders.  Great wonder at how delightful it must have been to be in Washington's glowing presence, for example, just doesn't cut it in a book like this.  In "Titan" on the other hand, Chernow grasped much of the essential character of one of America's most enigmatic, secretive, and successful citizens, John D. Rockefeller.  Perhaps because Chernow was less in awe of Rockefeller or possibly didn't much like what he learned, "Titan" is indeed titanic.  I would venture that you cannot really understand America, especially today, without reading it.  In "Alexander Hamilton", however, Chernow seems too much of a moth to Hamilton's flame.  Moroever, Hamilton's time has passed.  There is almost no interest -- or none that is discernable -- in Hamilton's fundamental liberalism and fiscal probity.  The alacrity with which our government decided to garnish the wages of generations of unborn Americans to pay off the rich is judgment enough.  Hamilton's liberal capitalism has been shown the door.
