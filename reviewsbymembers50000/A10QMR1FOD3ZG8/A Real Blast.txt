 Lady Thatcher had a lot of fun writing this book: it is clear succint, and very funny. She does have a small problem of definition, however.  She calls herself a conservative when she's anything but.  She repeats time and again her belief in all the core liberal values: the freedom of movement of goods, money, and people.  This she overlays with a minimum of state intervention to ensure the systems works with maximum transparency and access. Moreover, she asserts like all liberals, the value of business creation over the preservation of established wealth.  Her endlessly reenforced view is that established money deserves no more protection from the state than does the newest market entrant or the biggest labor union. On these points she is refreshingly unambiguous.  And relentless. George W. Bush, by contrast, is a conservative.  He believes strongly that established wealth must be protected at all costs, even at the expense of the largest budget deficits in history.  Extending the Great Society program to the wealthy is the core of his policy.  Lady Thatcher would make short work of this!
