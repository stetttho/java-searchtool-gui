 The first of the Information Age biographers, Kevin Maney's book on Thomas Watson Sr. sets a template for how Gates, Dell, and other industrialists will be written about when their time comes.  Maney reveals a man of insufferable ego who took enormous risks, risks that not even John D. Rockefeller would have contemplated, to reshape the world for a century yet to come.  How Watson did this and succeeded are the life skills of today's executives in every industry.  A must read.
