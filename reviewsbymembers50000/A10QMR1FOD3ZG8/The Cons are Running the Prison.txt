 I had never heard of Al Franken before I picked this book up on a whim while waiting for a flight to Tokyo.  The language is a bit strong, but the work is excellent and thorough.   I read it back to back with Paul Krugman's The Great Unraveling.  The two read like chapters of the same book, The Enron Presidency. Economists and forensic accountants will make careers over the next few decades unravelling the fraud Franken describes.  The brilliance of using the government itself to run a trillion dollar sting is breath-taking.  Having been in the fraud detection business myself, I was deeply impressed by Team Franken's work.
