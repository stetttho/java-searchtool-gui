 What makes this superb book astonishing is Ehrman's passing comment that early Christianity grew because it was spread by relatively inexpensive book in a world of high cost, temple-based religions that, Judaism apart, had no written processes whatever.    Cheap books could move; expensive temples could not.  In other words, Christianty spread rather like information on the Internet.  Gospels and letters went from node to node, as it were, where they were copied and read to followers.  The system was highly error prone -- the main subject of Ehrman's book -- but what made it work was that it emerged immediately following the creation of the Empire.  Just as soon as they emerged, Imperial stability and transportation were the vehicles of Christian transmission.  No other religion adapted to this low cost system and, as a result, none of the other Imperial religions, except Judaism, survive.  For those of us who have asked for decades what Christianity's information cost advantage was, because it must have had one to survive, let alone prosper, Ehrman provides the answer.    Ehrman's always excellent prose and cogent reasoning make wonderful reading. Editing: Five Stars.  Copy Editing: Five Stars.
