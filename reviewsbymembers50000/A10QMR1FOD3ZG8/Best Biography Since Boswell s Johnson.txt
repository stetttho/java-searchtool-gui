 "Roosevelt" is the first serious study of the U.S. by a foreigner since de Tocqueville's "Democracy in America" and is easily the best biography since Boswell's "Johnson".    Black's prose is direct and his simple, declarative sentences refreshing.  "Roosevelt" is one of the best books written in the history of our language.  There are one or two glaring errors:  that Carlton, Laval and McGill all graduated someone who thought Keynes went to Oxford says little for these institutions.  Worse, none of Black's many editors seemed any the wiser.  The New York Times published a particularly uninformed review -- not its usual style -- which lambasted Black for his private financial concerns.  Rather like slamming Boswell for being syphilitic.  Not a high point for the paper.
