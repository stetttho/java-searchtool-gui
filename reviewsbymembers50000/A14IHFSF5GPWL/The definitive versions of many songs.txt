 OK, be honest: how many live rock albums actually have performances that IMPROVE upon the studio versions of the songs? Besides The Who, Bob Dylan, and The Allman Bros. Band, it's a rare occurrence. On this magnificent set, Simple Minds justify the massive popularity they enjoyed in the mid-eighties. Every song is performed as if their lives depended on it, and on several tunes, they exceed the excellence of the studio recordings. In particular, "Book Of Brilliant Things" is amazing. This is a perfect document of an important band at the peak of their power. They would scale the heights again, but never at this level of popularity. I recommend this set as a terrific introduction to Simple Minds for the novice, or as a wonderful addition to the committed fans' collection.
