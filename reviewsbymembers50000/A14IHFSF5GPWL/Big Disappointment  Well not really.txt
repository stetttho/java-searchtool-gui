 I never thought I would say this about a Simple Minds disc, but "Cry" is flat-out dull. Turgid techno beats, and lackluster melodies make this a far cry (no pun intended) from the glorious rush of "Good News From The Next World". After awhile, you get desperate to hear some live drums and Charlie Burchill's guitar! It says a lot that the two most interesting cuts, "Lazy Lately" and "Sugar" are the only ones co-written and produced by Charlie. The rest of the tunes are written by Jim Kerr with a variety of others. I wish Simple Minds (now basically Jim and Charlie) would drop the techno collaborators and get back to basics. Addendum as of August 30, 2002: Well, I have listened to this disc many more times since my initial review, and I have to admit it definitely grows on you. Jim Kerr's vocals are subdued, yet draw you in to the music. Give this cd a chance: it will reward repeated listening.
