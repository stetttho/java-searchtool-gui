 Collective Soul's fifth disc continues the winning formula they hit upon from the beginning: a wall of guitars, gritty vocals, and hooky melodies that sink into your brain the first time around. While not as musically varied as their phenomenal disc _Dosage_, _Blender_ should keep fans happy. There is a slightly more contemporary feel to this disc's sound, e.g. a more prominent use of synthesizers. The poppiest tune, "Perfect Day" features an appearance by Elton John which is pretty darn good. Guitars still dominate the rest of the disc; in particular "Skin" and "Why pt 2" really rock out. However, _Blender_ finds Collective Soul stretching out a bit and smoothing some of their rough edges. It will be interesting to see if they can maintain a balance between the desire to flat-out rock, and the need to expand their musical palette.
