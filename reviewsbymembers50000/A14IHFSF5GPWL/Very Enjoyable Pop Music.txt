 I bought this disc because I admire Richard's work so much with Third Matinee and Mister Mister. While it is not as immediately endearing as those groups' outputs, this cd certainly has its charms. I find myself popping it into the player when I'm not sure what I want to listen to, and it always satisfies. It is not anything spectacular, but it has a warm-hearted charm that I enjoy very much.
