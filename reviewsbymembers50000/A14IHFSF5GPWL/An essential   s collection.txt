 Who else but Stevie Wonder could coexist with The Allman Bros. Band, Jethro Tull, and Yes on FM radio? I grew up listening to these songs on a tinny little alarm clock radio in the mid-70s, and he blew everyone else off of the airwaves. Regardless of your race, musical preference, or car sound system ;), Stevie was the most exciting musician on the planet. Not since the mid-sixties Beatles did an artist/group dominate the musical landscape the way Stevie Wonder did from 1973 - 1977. This 2-cd set skims the cream of his output off the top of his phenomenal run of creativity. Buy this album as an introduction, but I guarantee you will want to get the original lps the songs come from, and you won't be disappointed.
