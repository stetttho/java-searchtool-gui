 Usually a label's remastering project is an attempt to get fans to shell out the bucks one more time, but Columbia's new Dylan cds are a different proposition. In particular, "Planet Waves" is like a whole new album. I never realized how warm and relaxed Dylan's vocals are, how tight The Band locks in behind him, how perfect Richard Manuel's and Garth Hudson's piano and organ accompaniment are. This remastered version is light years better than the original, and the songs aren't too shabby either. The whole gambit of moods is explored here, from the urgent rock of "Tough Mama" through the tender prayer of "Forever Young" to the aching confusion of "Wedding Song". At the time he recorded this, Dylan was a man in conflict between his love of settled family life and his desire to hit the road again, and this album captures his dilemma perfectly. "Planet Waves" could be his most underrated album.
