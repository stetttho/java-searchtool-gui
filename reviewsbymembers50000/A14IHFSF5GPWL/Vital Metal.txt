 Ok, I'm not a huge metal fan, but I was intrigued by this band because they use the same distributor as Transatlantic. So I took a chance and ordered it. I was not disappointed. Everything comes together on this disc to create a wonderful suite of songs. The vocals are outstanding, the guitars crunch, and most importantly, the songs have actual melodies. (The lyrics aren't too shabby, either!) It is reassuring to know that despite the best efforts of the major labels to homogenize rock music, there are some musicians willing to take chances on independent labels and come out with a true winner. Highly recommended for fans of hard rock that appreciate songs that rise above the tired old "sex, drugs, & rock'n'roll" subject matter.
