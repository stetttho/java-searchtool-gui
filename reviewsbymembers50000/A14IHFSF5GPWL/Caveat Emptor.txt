 Buyer beware! This 3-cd set has the absolute worst sound I have ever heard on a live recording. The fact that this was recorded during the 2002 tour makes it inexplicable. Geddy Lee's vocals are almost completely buried. Alex's guitar sounds like it is coming out of a 15-watt amplifier. Neil's drums are totally bass-heavy, and the crowd noise is obtrusive to the point of being a real distraction.On the other hand, the DVD's sound is excellent. I don't know what these guys were thinking when they released this cd set; they have done so much better in the past.
