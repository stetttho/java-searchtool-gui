 I have been waiting 20 years for "Hard" to be released on cd. It's finally here, on a 2-for-1 disc. It is wonderful to hear this neglected new-wave/pop-funk masterpiece on compact disc, but I am not sure why Wounded Bird chose to pair it with "Solid Gold". Even though only 2 years separate the two albums, (SG was released in 1981, Hard in '83), there is a world of difference between them stylistically. Where "Hard" is all sleek pop sheen underpinned by Sara Lee's elastic/melodic basslines, "Solid Gold" is the last gasp of Gang Of Four's agit-punk days. "Hard" revels in complex melodies, heavy synths, gorgeous background harmonies; "Solid Gold" is minimalistic politically-charged chant (Kind of like Wire with socialist lyrics). Whichever style you prefer (the critics went gaga over the early stuff), it is quite jarring to have them side-by side on one disc. A much more logical compilation might have been "Hard" with the transitional album that preceded it, "Songs Of The Free". However, I shouldn't complain; many thanks to Wounded Bird for resurrecting a lost gem of the early 80s.
