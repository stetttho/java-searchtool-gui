 I was expecting a book that examined the faults and failings of the music business in general. While this is an excellent example of reporting the business deals that went down in the mid to late 80s, it focuses on EMI primarily. I would have liked learning more about David Geffen's dealings, and the CBS/Sony merger. However, Haring shines some much-needed light on a shady business. Given the notorious secretiveness of the industry, this is probably the best we can hope for.
