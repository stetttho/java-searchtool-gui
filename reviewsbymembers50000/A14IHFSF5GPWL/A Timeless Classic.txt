 When I first heard the songs on this album, I thought The Band had covered a bunch of old American folk songs in a rock style. Then I bought the lp, scoured the credits, and realized that they had written all of the songs themselves (with the exception of "Long Black Veil"). These songs sound like they come from the heart of Appalachia, or the Mississippi delta. They tap into some some timeless American musical vein that will forever remain fresh.  And the musicianship! Levon's drumming and singing throughout... Richard Manuel's achingly beautiful vocals on "Tears of Rage" ... the ragged but right harmonies of "The Weight"... Robbie Robertson's exquisite guitar solo on "To Kingdom Come"... Garth Hudson's manic organ intro to "Chest Fever". And how about a round of applause for the unsung sixth member, producer John Simon. He was obviously an integral part of their unique sound, and now he should get the credit he deserves. On this album, each member of The Band subsumed his ego to serve the songs, and they never again hit the perfect combination of relaxed, good-timey vibes with incredible rock 'n' roll energy. This is a record I will enjoy as much when I am eighty years old as I did when I was in college.  The bonus tracks are a nice addition. They practically double the length of the original album, and while their quality is not up to the original songs, they definitely add a lot of value to the package. Kudos to Capitol Records for putting out an excellent reissue. The liner notes are outstanding, and the sound quality is top-notch.
