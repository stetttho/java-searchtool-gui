 This disc sports what has to be some of the ugliest cover art ever allowed out in public: a distinctly unflattering black and white photo of Hovhaness cut-and-pasted onto a sickly, solid green background. While this does not bode well for the contents within, the brave consumer will be rewarded, for Saint Vartan's  Symphony is one of the most beautiful pieces of classical music ever recorded. While not a symphony in the "classic" sonata form, it is still a complex and massive work. There are twenty-four (!) short movements that vary from dance-like pieces to solemn ceremonial ones. Overall, it is an organic work that builds in intensity to an emotional climax. What is Hovhaness' genius is his ability to meld Eastern modes of music with Western canons into a seamless and unique work whose sum is far greater than its parts. Nowadays, with the well-deserved popularity of Part, Gorecki, Taverner, Rautavaara, Glass, and Reich, this does not seem like such a big deal. What is incredible is that Hovhaness composed this symphony in 1949-50! Almost all of the aforementioned contemporary composers owe Alan Hovhaness a huge stylistic debt. If you are attracted to any of their works, do yourself a favor and check out Hovhaness' music. This disc is an excellent place to start.
