 I got on a Dickens kick this summer and read five of his novels: Pickwick Papers, Oliver Twist, Nicholas Nickleby, The Old Curiousity Shop, and Barnaby Rudge. Of those five, Oliver Twist is my least favorite. It is obvious Dickens is making a statement against the Poor Laws of his time, and while that was a worthwhile cause, this book suffers from it. For me, the best element in Dickens' work is his humor. Even his villains, like Quilp in The Old Curiousity Shop, are often hilarious. However, any comic relief is few and far between in Oliver Twist.  Because Dickens is such a fine novelist, a three-star book for him would qualify as a five-star for anybody else. But if I were looking for an introduction to his work, I would try Pickwick Papers, or Nicholas Nickleby.
