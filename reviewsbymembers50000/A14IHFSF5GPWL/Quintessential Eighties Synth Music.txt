 Midge Ure and Ultravox really hit their stride with this disc. If you want to know what all the fuss was about in the early eighties, take a listen to Vienna. MTV was just starting out, haircuts were as important as musical chops, and English groups were making the most interesting music. Despite the ephemeral nature of the music at that time, Ultravox managed to rise above the crowd (The Fixx, Flock of Seagulls, Spandau Ballet, etc, etc), and create music of lasting value. I still enjoy this album very much, even though I was a freshman in college when it first came out!
