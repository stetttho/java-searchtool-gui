 I freely admit that I'm stuck in the 80's. As far as I was concerned, New Order hit their peak with 1985's _Low Life_, and went into steep decline afterward. That said, _Get Ready_ is one of the greatest recordings of their career. From the adrenaline rush of the opening song "Crystal" to the heartachingly beautiful closer "Run Wild", Bernard, Gillian, Stephen, and Peter sound as desperate and committed as they did in the days of _Power, Corruption, and Lies_.  Here are the highlights (in my opinion): "60 Miles An Hour" is absolutely addictive. As its title suggests, this is a song to put the top down to and go for a cruise down the highway. "Rock The Shack" is down 'n' dirty Stones-like riffing. To my ears, "Close Range" is the masterpiece of the album. Beginning with an insistent synth line, it slowly and inexorably builds to a mighty climax. What is most exciting about this cut (and all of the tracks in general) is Peter Hook's bass. Imagine the high-end melodicism of Rush's Geddy Lee combined with the rock-solid underpinning of The Who's John Entwhistle, and you have a glimmer of the beauty of Hooksy's work on this cd. When he takes the lead on "Close Range", it's enough to bring tears to your eyes. It fades out during his solo, and I can't help but wonder what heights he eventually reached.  Lest you think this is all bass pyrotechnics, let me praise the amazing drum riffs of Stephen Morris, the warm and assured vocals of Bernard Sumner, and the near-perfect synth backing of Gillian Gilbert. Bernie's guitar has not sounded this aggressive in years.  What a great piece of work.
