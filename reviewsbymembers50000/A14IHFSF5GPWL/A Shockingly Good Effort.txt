 For some reason, I decided to not bother with King Crimson after Three of a Perfect Pair (perhaps I was angry with Fripp for disbanding an incredible group of musicians). Anyway, I picked up THRAK out of curiosity, and I have to admit that I was blown away by this disc. The complexity that is revealed after multiple listenings makes this a must-own for Crimson fans. One would think that having two drummers, two bass/stick players, and two guitarists would clutter up the sound, but the dynamics of these six artists interacting are incredible. I will never tire of listening to the frenetic opener "VROOM", and being transported to a higher plane by the peaceful "Walking On Air". The sequencing of the songs on this cd is part of the brilliance of this group. "Dinosaur" is one of the two or three greatest songs ever recorded by King Crimson. Make sure you purchase the just-released 24-bit remastered version.
