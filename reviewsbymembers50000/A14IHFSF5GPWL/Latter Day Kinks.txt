 I own all of Blur's cds, and this is the one I consistently pop in the cd player. Sure, some of their other releases garnered more critical acclaim, but for me this is the most endearingly fun disc of all their efforts. Song after song boasts hooks that embed themselves in your brain. Being an American, I know I don't get the full effect of this very British collection, but I still love Damon Albarn's wry observations on modern life, and Graham Coxon's guitar is brilliant. If you think the Kinks' "Village Green Preservation Society" was one of the finest albums ever, then you will love this one.
