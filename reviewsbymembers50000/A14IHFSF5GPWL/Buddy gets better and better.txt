 Buddy Miller's latest disc, "Cruel Moon" is even better than his excellent "Poison Love". Once again he is assisted by fellow songwriters Jim Lauderdale and his wife Julie. He starts off with a raging  country-rocker "Does My Ring Burn Your Finger", in which he peels  off some stinging guitar leads. Over the course of the disc, Buddy moves  from pure traditionalist country, to Memphis soul, to achingly beautiful  ballads. The closing tune is a Pops Staples song done in a swampy, John  Fogerty style. This disc, coupled with wife Julie's "Broken  Things" released a couple of months ago, proves that the Miller family  are making the most exciting music in Nashville right now. An excellent,  excellent album.
