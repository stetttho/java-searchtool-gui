 This work contains information about the premiere pioneering multimedia tool, Apple QuickTime 4. As the basis of the upcoming MPEG-4 standard, QuickTime is unexcelled in providing audio, graphics, video, and text, in a  single application. Numerous file formats can be imported, interchanged,  edited, and released as a single QuickTime file. This work outlines the  underlying structure of this most influential multimedia format, and how to  produce potentially interactive creations. Much of the content and  information of the book is provided on the Apple website. There are also  numerous Inside Macintosh publications, available in book form or as .PDF  files, also on their website. Finally, there is an SDK included on the  CD-ROM, the full version of which is available as well for free on the  website. So, why even consider purchasing this book?  1. Portability --  don't have to print the numerous files out  2. Overview -- gives  fundamental information, the reader can look for details afterwards  3.  Examples -- this book is specifically written for portability using the  Java language; in this way programs can be used, in principle, on Windows,  MacOS, or UNIX systems (the last one still takes some extra effort) The  readability of this work suffers at times, this is its biggest shortcoming.  Getting the Java programs up and running at first is a bit frustrating. The  information provided is so vast in potential, however, that it easily  deserves a high rating. Be certain to check the quicktime.com website as  well, to supplement the content of this book. If one is inclined to  search for files on the Web and does not mind reading hundreds of pages  from the screen, this information can be acquired free of charge. Otherwise  this is a highly recommended work.
