 This is an excellent convenient and affordable atlas. It is softcover and flexible, with a sturdy plastic cover. Slim and with large pages, this atlas includes a full sized map of each complete state spanning one or two pages, along with a number of inset maps of the most populated or popular regions of each state. These are indicated on the full map by a convenient yellow rectangular outline. The legend includes highways and their different types (multilane, unpaved, principals, and so on), hospitals, rest and service areas, hospitals, ports of entry, parks and campsites, and other landmarks and major points of interest. All of the basics, superimposed on detailed and easy to read maps. The index includes the major counties cities and towns, arranged alphabetically by state, along with the population and location on the map by vertical (alphabetic) and horizontal (numerical) sections. For example, Los Angeles CA has the entry 3694820 SJ-11. It is typical of any atlas, national or global, and it is a system which still works. The use of colors and geometric outlines and shapes is highly intuitive. Major interstate highways are thick blue, with sign symbols and the highway number, while principle highways are pink. The distance between cities is also provided per map, at the top of the page. All of the basics, nationwide, immediately available. There are of course websites which now provide extensive geographic information for free. Two which come to mind are www.mapquest.com and www.worldatlas.com, the former providing thorough street information, the latter free quizzes maps and essential information of all the continents and nations of the world. Even with this free information readily available, this atlas is very helpful for overview information  of Canada, the United States and territories, and Mexico. Highly recommended for air train or road travel and general information.
