 I have used numerous over-the-ear varieties of headphones, as I find behind-the-neck sets much of the time to be uncomfortable for me, as are most in-the-ear pods.  The sound quality of these inexpensive headphones is very impressive. It is what one might expect from this particular company, however in this case it exceeded even my expectations, using primarily 192-kbps guitar-rock mp3 files. The bass is very impressive for the small size, and the maximum volume level is far greater than many comparable sets of similar price. This is important in very noisy settings, which is where I typically use these. The ear-fitting itself does not cancel out much sound, it is the volume while playing that does.  The rubber fitting and 3-to-4 foot wire all facilitate quick placement and removal at the gym, or in other on-the-go settings. There is no case provided. Having owned my pair for under one month now I am uncertain when if ever the ear-fitting begins loosening and separating from the amplifier-portion. Another brand I was using began falling apart after only several months. This model feels very sturdy. I typically wind the wire around the two separate fittings and place it as-is in my mp3 player flexible casing. I will update this review in a few months and indicate how reliable it is as well.  During stretches and other athletic motions, I find that almost all other variations of headphones tend to slip, or come out of the ear entirely. For this reason I am a staunch user of over-the-ear headphones, and recommend these at this price highly.
