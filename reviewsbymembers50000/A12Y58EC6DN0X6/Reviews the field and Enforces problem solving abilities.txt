 Computer science has been the primary catalyst transforming the status of this once-obscure field of discrete mathematics into state-of-the-art information, and required knowledge. Switching circuits, programming languages, expert systems and their underlying logic, to name but a few computer-related topics, each rely upon the results from this field as a foundation. There is a proliferation of books on graph theory, discrete mathematics, and even set theory and mathematical logic, for this reason. A paucity exists, however, of texts facilitating a newcomer in verifying the lessons presumably learned through formal education or through self-study. Schaum's solved problems books are invaluable for this purpose. The more recent n'000 solved problem books are beneficial to any willing to invest the effort and time required to attempt the numerous problems posed. The discrete mathematics book reviews subjects ranging from fundamentals of logic and set theory, to lattices, combinatorics, as well as abstract algebra and the basics of the theory of languages. There are a variety of questions, from recalling definitions, to number-crunching, to providing sketches or fragments of proofs. These are typically in a progressive problem-solving form, which lends itself to becoming a programed course. The book easily and quietly supplements any standard, classic, or assigned works from the field. Gradually the questions in this work will be perceived as increasingly basic, perhaps some sections too basic now - however that is only because the book has served its purpose, as a foundation for other more practical, detailed, or complex assignments or problems.  While reading through other works in this field, make note and observe how most have numerous exercises suffixed to each chapter, and yet how few actually provide comprehensible solutions to them. The true value of Schaum's series of solved problems books then becomes more evident.
