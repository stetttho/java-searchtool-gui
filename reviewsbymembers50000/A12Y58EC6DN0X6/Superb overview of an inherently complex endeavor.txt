 Martial arts in general has two distinct facets: the internal arts, which ultimately tend toward spiritual and theoretical issues, and external arts, focusing upon training and competition. Typically these lead to  divisiveness in the martial arts community. Resolving these two sides of  the same coin, on an individual level, is a difficult and often frustrating  issue. Pa-Kua Chang is a style dedicated to incorporating both of these  aspects of the martial arts. Its skilled practitioners can easily confound  some of the best stylists from other disciplines. The techniques are  extremely efficient and systematic. At the same time, internal cultivation  is emphasized as a key to development physically as well as spiritually.  Both sides are necessary. This work on Pa-Kua Chang introduces the reader  to the many diverse facets of this style. Tradition, theory,  internalization, physical considerations, are all interwoven into a  complete and self-contained foundational work. Many of the details (read:  secrets) one may wish from a martial arts book are necessarily missing.  After all, true martial functionality is a social aspect of life, between  two (or more) intelligent beings. Exercises and basics are described  herein, so that the seeker has tools with which to pursue higher degrees of  refinement. Nothing in this work is glossed over, however. Reaching a high  level of proficiency of even the basic exercises outlined takes tremendous  discipline and dedication. One can seek out further instruction in the  interim.
