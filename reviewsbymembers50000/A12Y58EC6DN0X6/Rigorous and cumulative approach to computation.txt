 Logic and linguistics interweave and become virtually indistinguishable through the unifying topic of computability. Any serious seeker of knowledge must be familiar with the underlying concepts of computation.  Psychology, philosophy, computer science, the physical and metaphysical are all touched upon by this one subject. The approach of this work is fairly standard. It begins with machines generating or recognizing languages of increasing inclusiveness and generality, and proceeds to further subject matter, computability and complexity. It opens with two introductory chapters covering the basics of set theory, inductive proofs, and linguistic concepts which will be utilized throughout the book. Each topic after this builds upon the previous ones systematically and gradually. Both mathematical/logical, and verbose prose descriptions are employed, to coax the reader through this intricate and immensely important subject. One must be well grounded in reading mathematics. The introductory chapters will likely be insufficient for the neophyte, who may become frustrated as the material develops, even as gradual as this cumulation is. Rigorous proofs are provided, and the reader is expected to appreciate the underlying implications. One must exert some considerable personal effort to achieve this level. This work stands at a middle ground in the subject, between the relatively informal approach of the excellent Sipser text, and the extremely thorough work by Hopcraft et al. It expects the reader to approach the subject with seriousness, yet provides gentler guidance through the more complex subtopics than other related works having this level of mathematical rigor.
