 The media has traditionally been an extremely specialized, not to mention prohibitively expensive, field. With the introduction of digital production and editing, however, the material costs and requirements for video and  audio production is decreasing rapidly, with quality levels already  remarkably high and increasing annually. This book provides a superlative  introduction and overview to all of the key subjects in producing a lower-  to higher- budget film. Though the title makes reference to the digital  age, analog equipment is discussed when pertinent as well, and compared to  existing and emerging digital technologies. The technicalities of optics  for lenses is fully detailed, as are filters, microphones, stands and other  equipment, recommendations for each field of what emergency supplies to  have on hand, editing and previewing equipment, software, to name but a few  of the countless topics covered. A truly comprehensive and detailed  work. Anyone with a serious interest in this field can learn from this  book the fundamentals needed to get started in extremely high quality  digital production. Given the materials and information provided, the cost  of the book is truly remarkable. Any reader will complete any section  feeling like an expert on the subject. One does not have to begin with  experience in the digital arena, however, nor even in video production.  Even as technical as this work is, it leads the reader very carefully  through all which is pertinent and necessary. A single possible minor  shortcoming, is the description of the process of digitizing analog  recordings or an actual/ambient environment, into a digital format. One  totally unfamiliar with digital concepts may find the analogies provided a  bit difficult to follow. It provides enough of a foundation, however, that  an interested reader can seek out more technical and/or accurate  descriptions of this process. A very small criticism to an otherwise truly  excellent work.
