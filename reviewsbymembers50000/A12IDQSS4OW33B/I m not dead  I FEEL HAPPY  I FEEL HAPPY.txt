 "I THINK I'LL GO FOR A WALK!" This is as silly as And Now For Something Completely Different.Very good "knight" movie. It starts out with King Arthur and Patsy traveling through the land of England seeking out other knights that will join him at the Round Table and it goes on with him being successful with some of them such as Sir Lancelot and Sir Bedevere, Sir Robin the-not-so-brave-as-Sir Lancelot, and Sir Galahad. The end is sort of surprising. The killer rabbit is cool, too. That's later in the movie. This movie is worth being enjoyable. You will agree too. You will enjoy it yourself the whole entire time.
