 I PLAY THIS GAME ALL THE TIME! I LOVE THE DESIGN OF THE DESTRUCTION AND GRAPHICS OF THIS GAME. BY THE LOOKS OF THINGS FROM THE CHARACTERS, IT'S HARD TO TELL IF THERE'LL BE ANOTHER TWISTED METAL GAME FOR THE SERIES. I WONDER HOW FREAKY LOOKING SWEETTOOTH WOULD BE IN THE NEXT ONE. THAT'S WHY I DON'T KNOW IF THERE WILL BE ANOTHER ONE. THAT WILL SUCK, THOUGH. THIS IS ALREADY THE BEST IN THE SERIES.
