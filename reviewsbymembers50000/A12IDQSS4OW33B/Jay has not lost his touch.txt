 I found this to be  almost  as funny as Robin Williams Live on Broadway. It's a competion to see who can be the funniest to win between some comedians that I'm not too familar with and Jay also does some stand-up comedy himself. All of it is pretty funny because it's not really stuff people would  normally talk about on a regular basis.... sort of.
