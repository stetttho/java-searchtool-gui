 When I say that, I mean A LOT. It's almost like this computer game was based on that trilogy.   Here's why:{I'd like to start with #2 first if that ok with you} 2. There are orcs. 1. There are some wizards like Gandelf.  3. There is a crapload of battle. 4. There are neat fantasy elements like LOTR.  5. It is so close to LOTR, that if there were hobbits, that's exactly what it would definetely be.    The main reason I love this game is because it is fun and it is my first computer game to be played on my computer, which has to mean it is special. Doesn't it? This game also comes with "Frozen Throne". I think it is the "to be continued" part of this game. The graphics are good and have a LOTR feeling to them.   HIGHLY RECOMMENDED if you like fantasy/adventure/action stuff.
