 "Laughter Is A State Of Mind" just may be true. Every outdoor scene is pretty consisting of fields and blue skies. There are some funny scenes with a big toy factory making this a strange film. Which is good. It HAD to be funny because Robin Williams is the funniest man alive. I wasn't sure what to expect. It's not to be taken seriously either. This is pure fantasy to begin with.   The film starts with "Closing Of The Year", a nice christmas song. Then Michael Gambon comes to the factory to talk with the founder of Zevo Toys. That's how it starts off and goes into the film with fun performances by Robin Williams and Joan Cusack. I'm recommending this movie for everyone. Here's the gig with Michael Gambon: He is given the toy factory and wants to set up military toys which were never made at Zevo. But he gets a little carried away with everything. You only need to read the title and see it. You will probably be blown away by this movie.
