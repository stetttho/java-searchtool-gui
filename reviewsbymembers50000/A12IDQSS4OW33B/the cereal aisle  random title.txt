 These radio situation tracks are very morbid. I wasn't sure if I would like this album when I first got it, but a few of the songs are alright like Thunderkiss '65. That sounds like most of the other songs but sounds nothing like White Zombie's song on Beavis and Butthead Do America. THAT IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SONGS BY WHITE ZOMBIE. I Am Legend started out cool and strange, but it did soon sound like the familiar "White Zombie" band  singing. Not on this cd, but on other songs by them it  doesn't even sound like they did that very song.....That's a little  peculiar if you ask me. Even the radio tracks that I mentioned earlier don't sound like White Zombie material...but it is.
