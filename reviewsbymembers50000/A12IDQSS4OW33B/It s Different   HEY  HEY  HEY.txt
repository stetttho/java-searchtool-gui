 I am familiar with Fat Albert, just don't ask me how I missed the cartoon before seeing this. I HAVE seen the cartoon before, but not a lot. If I ever thought this was anything like the cartoon it isn't very different. This movie is Fat Albert without a junkyard. It's different, interesting, neat and a good movie for really anyone to see. Kenan Thompson portrays a good Fat Albert, and this movie is just cool! Can be fun to watch. Fat Albert just wants to help people so they're happy. I never thought of Kenan Thompson before this movie came out, and now that's about all I think of when I think of him.
