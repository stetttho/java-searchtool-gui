 {Some spoilers}:  Now, I'm not saying that all the other Batman films were that bad. But THIS....is darker than Spiderman. Dr. Jonathan Crane {Cillian Murphy} becomes more viscious than any other villain in a Batman film as the Scarecrow. His mask shoots out a harmful fear toxin that poisons the victim and makes them imagine that they are seeing something freaky. It gets worse when the Scarecrow spreads this stuff out all across Gotham City affecting everyone, and that it would destroy itself in fear, and Batman {Christian Bale} has to stop it. Both Christian Bale and Cillian Murphy pulled off their roles quite well for one being the hero and the other as the villain. The other actors were great too, including Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman.   The movie starts with Bruce Wayne in Asia training in karate. However, when he gets back to Gotham City afterwards, it is overrun with crime. Then, he finds a batcave under a hole in the ground where he fell when he was just a child. This is where he decides to become what he is: Batman! Luscious Fox {Morgan Freeman} helps him build the equipment along with the batsuit. From here, he seeks out criminals, epecially the Scarecrow and that's how the whole toxin thing is started after Dr. Jonathan Crane tests it out on an inmate from Arkham Asylum and then Dr. Crane goes crazy and confronts Batman, but so does everyone else. It gets really, really awesome.   Highly recommended. 5 out of 5 stars for a splendidly-made Batman movie that we've all been waiting for to see the lights of DVD.   'Can't get enough of that Scarecrow! Excellent villain.
