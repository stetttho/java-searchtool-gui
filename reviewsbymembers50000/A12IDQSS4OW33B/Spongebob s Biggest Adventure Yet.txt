 King Neptune somehow misplaces his crown and suspects it was stolen. He then goes to Mr. Krabs, who is a crab {obviously}, and the owner of the restaurant the Krusty Krab. He is also egomaniacal. Spongebob and his friend Patrick who is a starfish agree to go find the crown so King Neptune would be happy. {It's nice to not have commercials in between the movie too}. But, Mr. Krabs nemisis, Plankton, hires a guy {more like a tough biker} to go after Spongebob.
