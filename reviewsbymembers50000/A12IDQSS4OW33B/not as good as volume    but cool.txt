 As I noted, I DIDN'T have Volume 1, but now I do. {I actually have had it for quite some time}. In fact, many many many many many many many many many many many many many weeks. But this, not so long. Throughout this review, I don't want to talk about JUST the 3 volumes. AND NOW, FOR THE COUP DE GRACIE:   Some of these episodes are WEIRD. And I don't just say that for {DR.} Weird. But I don't want to keep this too long either. He starts the weirdness! But, I like it however. I'm not so sure what else to say, but that this is neat if you have or haven't seen the show, and don't own this, get it. And I say that ESPECIALLY to whomever hasn't seen the show.
