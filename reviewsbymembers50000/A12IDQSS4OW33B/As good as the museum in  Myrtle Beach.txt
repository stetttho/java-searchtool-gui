 I LOVE THE MUSEUMS AND THE BOOK.  I'M WAITING TO SEE IF THERE'LL BE A 2005 BOOK.MUCH OF THIS BOOK IS PRETTY CREEPY AND COOL AT THE SAME TIME.FOR SOME STUFF, I DON'T SEE HOW THEY COULD DO IT.  I'VE ALSO HEARD THERE'S A MUSEUM IN TENNESSEE, TOO. IF YOU HAVEN'T BEEN TO ANY, GO TO ONE. YOU WILL, WITHOUT A DOUBT, BE AMAZED.
