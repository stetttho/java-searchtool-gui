 "The Outsiders" didn't seem as though I would get anything out of it at first. It got better. The first few chapters aren't that great but the rest is kinda good. There are 2 gangs who oppose each other in this book. The greasers and the Socs. {That is short for "socials"}. Not "socks". The whole book just revolves around the members of the greasers and one member who is a part of the gang, but doesn't claim himself one. Near the end of the book, {you probably guessed it} the 2 gangs face off and fight. Before that, the greasers aren't sure about everything since things are screwed plus the main character is an orphan to begin with. He's afraid he might be put in a boys' home as said in chapter 6. I have seen quite a few films which were books beforehand. They are all very close to each other and some are cool such as HOLES and/or TUCK EVERLASTING. The setting of "The Outsiders" is in Tulsa, Oklahoma in a very bad neighborhood where many of the Socs usually beat the living CRAP out of each other...litterally. There's not much the greasers can do about it because they're rebels and still only wait until the end because they occasionally talk about what they need to do about things like that and not procrastinate. Perhaps it sort of sends out an important message...besides, there IS a good poem that represents one of the situations they get into. The book starts and ends the same way and before that things get decieving but that goes to the bit I mentioned about the "good".
