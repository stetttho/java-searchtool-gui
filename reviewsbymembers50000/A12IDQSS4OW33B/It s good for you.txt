 This  is one cereal out of many that taste delicious and are even very good for you. It's tastes like nothing but a cinnamon stick. It's got cinnamon sprinkled on the inside and the outside, and it's good for anybody. As I heard, even adventurous, sophisticated gourmets like me will eat it, and I do! Cinnamon life is one of my favorite cereals besides "OH" cereal. It's as effective as a glass of orange juice {as it says on the side of the box} because they both give you balanced energy, prevent heart disease, they both have plenty of potassium and vitamin C and Cinnamon Life has all the yummyness you can expect from a cereal. You just have to try it to believe me.
