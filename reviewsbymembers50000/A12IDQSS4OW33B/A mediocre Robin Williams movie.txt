 "Dead Poets Society" wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. It got better as it went on is what I should also add. I am a great fan of Robin, but I rather enjoy his comedy better like "Toys" and "Mrs. Doubtfire". I can see why a lot of people love his drama too. This was ALRIGHT. It kind of got better, but then it was not as good but it had a worthful ending to it. Need I say anymore? In conclusion, Robin Williams teaching a few boys poetry in his own way is not as good as Robin Williams as a toy maker or a ironic housekeeper. Although, I CAN see why this film is loved so much. Drama for me is good every once in a while. {Actually, I think Robin Williams has been in more dramas than comedy because I also think he got some award for "Good Will Hunting", but I am not really interested in  seeing that}.Comedy or fantasy is more of my style.
