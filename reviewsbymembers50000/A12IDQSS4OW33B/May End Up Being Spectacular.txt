 Victor {Johnny Depp} is about to get married when he is in the woods and sees a stick on the ground. Just as a joke, he puts on the wedding ring and says the vows, but unbeknownest to him that the stick was really the broken off finger of a murdered girl who comes back as a zombie and insists that they get married.  Directed by Tim Burton.
