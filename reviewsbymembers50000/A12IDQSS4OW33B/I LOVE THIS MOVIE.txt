 My favorite Danny Elfman song on this cd is the main titles because it's fast, and wacky-sounding. The rest of it sounds a little bit like caveman music, but the entire album is great! The Oompa-loompa songs are completely different than the way they were in the original. My favorite on that is Veruca's song. Overall, the entire album sounds like another Edward Scissorhands album, but because of this, I think Danny Elfman's orignal score is better than John Williams'. Danny Elfman also does the music for the rest of Tim Burton's movie and it's no wonder he's a grammy award winner! Highly recommended.
