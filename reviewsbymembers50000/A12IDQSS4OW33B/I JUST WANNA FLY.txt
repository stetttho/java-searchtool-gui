 If you don't have this, and you like Sugar Ray, get this. There are some other songs by this band I'd like to get an album of, but I cannot find them. What's that all about? Ah, well. Who gives a  crap, huh? There are 2 kinds of "FLY" on this album. One is just the song, and the other, is with this guy in the song who starts it off and continues as the song goes on. I like that version, but then again, that might just be me. Peace.
