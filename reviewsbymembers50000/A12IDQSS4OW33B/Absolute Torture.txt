 This is not Home Alone. The producers of this film screwed everything up with their own dumb imaginations. I  don't care if I don't see this movie again, because I really don't want to. I AM TELLING THE TRUTH. The snow is computer generated because this must've been made in the frickin' summertime and nothing is the way it should be. Not even the best film makers in the world would be able to pull THIS off. I THOUGHT I WOULD ENJOY THIS MOVIE. 1 star=dreadfully crappy.
