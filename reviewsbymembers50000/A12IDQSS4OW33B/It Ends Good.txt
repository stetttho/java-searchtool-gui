 Daryl Van Horne {Jack Nicholson} is the devil. Cher, Susan Sarandon and Michelle Pfeiffer are 3 witches who are always saying what they'd want in a man, so, that's what they get when the devil shows up.    That's what happens in the beginning. I thought the beginning was pretty boring and I've waited until everybody begins to vomit cherries and hate each other. And, there's always the guarantee that Daryl Van Horne will be complaining how many mistakes god makes with women. Such as saying that it's called stuff like "evil" and "religion." Jack Nicholson becomes a nut as Daryl Van Horne because later, he is tortured by the 3 witches and confronts them and THAT'S where it got good in my humble opinion after he was stuck in the arms and legs a few times when the witches made a voodoo doll of him. There are actually 2 endings to this movie: A mild one and a particularly creepy one. I saw the "creepy" one, and it wasn't creepy, so I don't want to spoil the good, original ending. While this wasn't the greatest horror/comedy I've ever seen, it was interesting to watch.
