 I used to watch this all the time and liked the soundtrack.If you're somebody who doesn't mind seeing people get hurt and/or sick, see  Jackass the movie. This is different from the tv show dvd {volume 2} and has nudity and locker language in it. When I first watched it, the "rent-a-car-crash-up-derby" was pretty rough including many others like the "whale shark gummer" and "hardware store crap" with "yellow snowcone". One of my personal favorites was the "rockets" skit. It does tell you that you shouldn't try anything in this movie before it starts.  {IT DEFINETELY ISN'T EVERYDAY WHEN YOU SEE A MOVIE LIKE THIS}. 5 STARS.
