 This album sucks. The only barely good song that is worth listening to at least once is "Fly With Me". That has to be the only one. If this was all this band ever recorded, I doubt many people would be "into" them. It figures, not to mention I thought every other song really sucked. They try to be catchy between songs, and nothing works out. {Actually, "Fly With Me" is a 98 degrees song, which means that both of them are so bad that I get the two mixed up}.
