 I don't have a big pack of Wonka bars, but they are wonderful!  I just found a couple sitting in a grocery store, so I picked them up with a Wonka Donutz donut, and it's as tasty as the 1971 movie! It tastes a little like a Crunch bar, only it's not. It's a chocolate bar with a graham cracker inside that tastes like it was made simply with pure imagination. A Wonka bar is very sweet and great to eat anytime, but I haven't found a golden ticket yet.
