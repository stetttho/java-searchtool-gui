 Eveybody's different.....especially Jeremy Reed AKA "Powder." And he was born with stark-white skin, and no hair on his head. Not even when he's 16 does he have any hair. For 16 years he has been living in his grandparent's cellar. When he is asked to come out, everybody is freaked out by his appearance, and the fact that he can conduct electricity, but not everyone likes him. He is smarter than anyone else around him and it is thought that he is a state of being that nobody will be like for thousands of years. During the film, it is said that there is no classification high enough for Jeremy's knowledge, so like Edward Scissorhands, it must make Powder a "freak of nature." He doesn't know what the world is, but he is totally different. Some people in the movie almost think his reactions and his appearance are almost creepy.    Mediocre movie, overall.
