 WHADAYA WANT??THERE'S THE NEW WENDY'S HOMESTYLE CHICKEN STRIPS, THE BIG BACON CLASSIC,A FROSTY.... damn, I'm making myself hungry. Oh, well. It's after 5 PM anyway. It would be cool if this game had more blood, but it's violent enough to be rated "T". I usually just play the "Story" mode because it's cool, well, some very little isn't fighting, so that's why I only rated it 4 stars overall. It's SO much fun. {That's the one I'll say when I review Mortal Kombat Deception. I AM BLOOOODTHIRSTY!!!!! This game has cursed me almost as much as MK: Deadly Alliance did. I fell in love with THAT game as soon as I saw some blood and guess what???!! I DELIVERED THE BLOW!! WHAHAHAHAAHAAHAHHAHAHAHA!!!!!!! Okay. I.....sense I've gone too far. However, the story mode is reminding me of the tv series which ended the same as this game does and it's easy, but iiiiittttt'ssss......FUN TO PLAY ON A RAINY DAY! HA! My personal favorite guys to be are Frieza and Cell. {I KNOW. ELSE'S FAVORITE IS TEEN GOHAN. Who gives a flying freak}? The rest of the blood is on the fighters after they've been injured so bad they can probably barely lift a pebble. The end of the game is a little different than that. The only character I don't have is Hercule. What a doink. He can't do crap on the show and I've played him before on another memory card. HE HAD TO WEAR A FRIGGIN' ROCKET PACK! Everyone else on this game can fly! What kind of dingdong has to wear a rocket pack when he swears he can beat Cell with only a poke? He acts like it and everyone loves him for it. I loathe people like that. AAANNNYYHOO, it doesn't matter. If you like Dragonball Z and want to start off the game series, play this first....oh man, what am I blabbin' about? This is the only PS2 game I have for the Dragonball Z series. I also have LEGACY OF GOKU, but it's just not as fun.
