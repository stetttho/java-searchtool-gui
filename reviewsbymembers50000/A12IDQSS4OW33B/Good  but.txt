 not quite as good as Manson's album "Golden Age of Grotesque". I could just relate to that just a bit more. This album, known as "Holy Wood" is my second Marilyn Manson album. Sometimes, seconds just aren't as good as the first you experience, but they are alright. Now to the songs. Some of them have many references to the title of the cd....uh, much! I may sound disoriented as if I don't like it, but I do!              1. Well... not quite a masterpiece for a start.             2. It's not killing anyone.             3. Interesting song.             4. Just as neat as track 3.             5. I don't really know what to say.             6. Your first experience is interesting.             7. Just like the title.              8. Has a cool title to it.             9. Pretty dern slow.            10. Good enough.           11. Has a cool beat.            12. It's just okay.            13. Talks about the  possible concept of resurrection.            14. The flag burns.            15. I think it's like, 6 minutes long.            16. I was waiting to hear this song.            17.  Adam's fallen according to this song.            18. Long live King Kill!            19. Very creepy for your first listening.     Every song on the case of the album is in roman numerals which means you could learn something, but I already knew it.  Did I like this album? Sure. It's just not as suspectingly great as I thought it would be, I mean, I might not listen to it as much as "Golden Age of Grotesque", but with either album cranked all the way up on your stereo{which I would never do}, you'll get 4 possible consequences:      1. You'll barely be able to hear after listening to it      2. A noise complaint could be made      3. 1 and 2 will happen if you listen to it like this while watching "Collateral" on a home theater system.       4. All of the above.    Good day. I'll be here all week. For the album, it gets a B+.
