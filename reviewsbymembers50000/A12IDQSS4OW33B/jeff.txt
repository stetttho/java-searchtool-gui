 I listened to this album before I saw Blue Collar Comedy Tour The Movie, but the thing is, this album is what inspired me to see that! I thought Mr.Foxworthy was pretty good in this, like he is in "THE MUSIC ALBUM" and "GREATEST BITS", so that's why I wanted to see that movie. Some parts are silly AND funny simultaniously and I highly recommend this if you've never heard him before. This was the first cd that introduced me to him. Did I mention in any other material of his, that I've got his autograph? I think I did.
