 "The Spine" is just as loveable as any other They Might Be Giants cd. Some are more playful than others, like this one. "Stalk of Wheat" is a particularly fun song to listen to. That's just 1 personal favorite. I recommend this as well as "Apollo 18" and "Flood" if you want to get to know this band a little better. Any of this band's cds are great to listen to on a very long road trip. {I've had a couple of interesting experiences invloving that}.  Most of this band's songs  on every album never makes any sense whatsoever, nor are they supposed to. That's why they are so  great.  It makes you wonder about what they mean, or just random things to make the song cool. Lots of songs are good, lots of songs are strange, and that makes all of them what they are. Marvelous. It is so weird to me that any song by this band may never make sense, but every song on any cd by They Might Be Giants is delightful! I don't need to see them in concert. This band has been together since the early 80's, and they're still together today, and rockin'! Many people I know have never heard of TMBG, and that is such a shame. They're better than they appear if you're into this kind of music. The genre is rock, but it is like Butthole Surfers, and/or The B52's, and what I mean by that is, they are really cool, but it is hard to tell why some of their songs don't make much sense. Well, the answer is, the songs aren't supposed to make sense, and yet, in some way they do....which makes them surprisingly good and worth listening to. The best way to explain it would have to be like mixing something with something else completely different, and in it's own twisted way, IT'S GOOD! That is unless it is like 6 barrels filled with gasoline and one lit match in front of a convenience at a gas station.
