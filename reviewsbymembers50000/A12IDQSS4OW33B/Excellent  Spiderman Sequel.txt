 After 2 years of defeating the Green Goblin, things have gotten harder for Peter Parker. He has a job, he keeps having "disturbances", and he can't cast webs as well as he used to be able to do. It was already one of the most entertaining films I've seen. Later in the film, a scientist named Dr. Octavious has been working on a special experiment for some time which allows him to control extra arms attached to his body. When he finally has it all ready, he has everyone come see him put it on. For some reason, it malfunctions and Dr. Octavious blames Spiderman. From there, the conflict between Spiderman and Doc Ock begins. When I heard that everyone had seen this movie before I had, I knew I was going to have to see it and it ended up being everything I expected it to be! Highly recommended if you think Spiderman is awesome! Spiderman 3 awaits!
