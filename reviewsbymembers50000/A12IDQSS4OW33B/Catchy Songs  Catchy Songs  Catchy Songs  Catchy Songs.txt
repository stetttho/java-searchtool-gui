 "Ghosts Of Me And You" is a catchy song. Possibly the catchiest song on this entire album! You probably only have to listen to a sample of it and you will have it in your head! If you DO intend on listening to this album for a few days straight, then I must warn you that you could get tired of it quickly. But it's worth it, at least. Even if you only think about the band, "She's Gonna Break Soon" will get in your head and that will suck. It's packaged better and arranged better than GOODBYE BLUE AND WHITE or White and Blue...either way, this is a little bit better. Beware...of......the title of this review! Ah ha ha ha ha ha! Ah ha ha ha ha ha!! I'M YOUR HOST! THE GHOST HOST WITH THE MOST!  I WILL BE WITH YOU UNTIL...THE END! {Actually, this is the end of the review. And I am not crazy...and I'm still with you, so I kept my promise! Also with what I said about the album}.
