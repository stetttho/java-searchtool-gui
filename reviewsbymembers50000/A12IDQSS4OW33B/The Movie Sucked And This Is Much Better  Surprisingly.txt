 I expected this to be good. I really didn't like the movie at all. It deserved 1 star but I only gave that 2 stars. This cd, however, is much better. Why? Because, besides a few boring love songs, the soundtrack just ends up being better and nobody talks the same as in the play on this cd, even in a modern-day version. Here we go...follow meeeeee!!! {jumps on top of a rainbow}.                                1. Catchy, that is, if you listen to it enough.             2. Cool            3. I skip it            4. Nah...            5. Dumb love theme for Romeo and Juliet            6. Strange, yet what ISN'T by this peculiar band?            7. I've heard this on the radio, familiarly            8. I don't fancy this. I'll save it for a party            9. NO           10.Same as #11           11. Same as #9           12. Too mellow           13. Catchy   It gets a B+ overall together, because I like most songs that aren't about love and that's about the only downside. The bottom line about the movie is that if everyone talked normally, but said the same stuff, then MAYBE...MAYBE I would have liked it. Another good thing is that nobody talks like that on this cd. It'd be too weird and I wouldn't like this either if it were for that, and it's not. Check out the 1968 version of Romeo and Juliet too if you haven't.  It fits the setting in that movie. That's the real way it should be in the story. L.A. in a 1990 setting is absolutely nothing like Verona, Italy. Not only that, but princes aren't cops in the movie. I was in that play as a prince and I wasn't expecting it to end up being a cop, saying the same quotes. Doesn't matter. At least the soundtrack doesn't have anything to do with the dialogue and that's the best thing about it. It's no ordinary soundtrack...
