 THIS MOVIE HAS HAD SOME GREAT ACTING IN IT.I have seen some good movies in my time by Tim Burton. He is astonishing.Sleepy Hollow was not only good, but it had some real nice acting actors in it.This time, the heads looked unfake when they were beheaded.My recommendation:GO AND BUY IT AS SOON AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN. REALLY! I just saw it last night and said,"You know, I think I may get this!", it was so good. If I remember, this is the second movie that Johnny Depp and Christopher Walken were in by Tim Burton. {Mr.Walken-Batman Returns,Mr.Depp-Edward Scissorhands}.I AM NOT KIDDING, THIS IS COOL AND HAS SOME FAMILIAR ACTORS IN IT.
