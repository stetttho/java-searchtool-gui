 Inside the case of this DVD, it says Carrot Top's real name is Scott Thompson. THIS GUY IS A GOOD COMEDIAN. A LOT OF THIS WAS FUNNY. I also recommend George Carlin's best stuff, Robin Williams Live On Broadway, and Blue Collar Comedy Tour the movie. If you like Carrot Top, {most people don't, but I do} you should see this. It's not as disappointing as people think.
