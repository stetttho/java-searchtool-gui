 I now realize that "Shaun of The Dead" WASN'T the first zombie/horror/comedy film. Maybe this was. It sure is about a million times gorier too. Gorier than "Evil Dead," believe it or not. It gets really fun to watch, even though it has a great opening sequence and the rest of the blood doesn't start until a bit later. It surprises me that this was directed by Peter Jackson, who directed the "Lord Of The Rings" series, and both that and this movie are completely different, and they both get realistic for the special effects. This movie becomes very entertaining if you're into this kind of stuff. It seems like horror at first, but ironically, it's mostly a disgusting comedy that never wasn't worth watching. It reminds me of "Evil Dead" and "House of 1000 Corpses" or some other quirky horror film combined into one black comedy.
