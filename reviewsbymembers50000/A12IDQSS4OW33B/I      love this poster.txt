 as much as I love promoting  it as one of my favorite movies of all time in my room. I also have another one with an oompa-loompa on it and I have as little as one more spot to put one more poster. I have put a "Corpse Bride" poster there and my room is becoming just one of those rooms that has Tim Burton/Johnny Depp movie posters all over the place. They make a great pair when they work together, you know! So, I am expressing my gratitude considering the fact that I have seen every one of their collaberations including Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow, this and Corpse Bride. Now I only wish that I could hang up more posters of those movies because I have 2 "Charlie And The Chocolate Factory" posters, and I am getting a "Corpse Bride" poster, so why not?
