 It is okay if this game is involved because that is what makes it more challenging and fun. For example, it takes many things to do just to fix one problem. Like any other involved game, it gets tougher and more fun to play. Johnny Depp does not do the voice of Willy Wonka, but he sounds similar to Depp. The graphics for the game are neat, too. I think the kid who plays Charlie also does his voice in this. The  outdoor setting looks like England: Very snowy, overcast skies, and a candy shop which starts the entire thing. Wonkabots are enemies in the factory that chase you and try to shock you, and many different oompa-loompas lurk around such as electricians, and several others. That goes for the candy-related powers you obtain: Rock candy, bubble gum, Everlasting Gobstoppers and "spinners" help you in their own ways through a conflict. This is a good game but it gets tough and more challenging, depending on how much farther you get. Bon Voyagee!
