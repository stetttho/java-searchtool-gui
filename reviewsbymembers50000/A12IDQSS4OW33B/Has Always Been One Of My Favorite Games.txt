 "The Addams Family" for Super Nintendo has always been one of my favs for the game system. It's as much fun as the movie! I have a Game Genie so I can put in a cheat that makes me invincible. I still have this game.   Gomez Addams comes home only to find his entire family held hostage to bosses in several different parts of the house. You  have to go through each level and defeat every monster along the way until you get to the bosses. Your strategies are golfballs to throw at enemies, a sword, a fezi-copter something else with a special Super Mario Bros twist that temporarily makes you invicible while you pick up valuables along the way including riches and extra lives. There are also special bonus bosses that you can defeat for extra hearts. Once you've saved everyone, you've beaten the game! If you have an old Super Nintendo that still works, buy this masterpiece online, and enjoy!
