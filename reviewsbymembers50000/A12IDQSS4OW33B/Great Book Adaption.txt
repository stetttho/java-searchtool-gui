 The Outsiders movie is just like the book, only it skips a lot of parts from the book. That doesn't matter, since it is good. Tom Cruise, Emelio Estevez, Patrick Swayze, Ralph Macchio, C. Thomas Howell, and Matt Dillon are good in their roles. Matt Dillon especially reminded me of an Elvis impersonator. I saw this a while ago and it was a whole lot better than that horrible Romeo and Juliet remake. This has to be one of the only dramas I ever liked because I don't like very many dramas. They are all too overrated. My favorite drama/thriller of all time is Secret Window.
