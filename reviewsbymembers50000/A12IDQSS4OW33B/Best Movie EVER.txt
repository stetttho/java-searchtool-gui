 "Charlie and The Chocolate Factory" certainly is a delightful film I can really sink my teeth into!! It has to be, {if not one of} the best and most beautiful movie I've ever seen. It is just dark enough to be as good as it is and everybody portrays their roles perfectly! The factory is amazing inside and has a Tim Burton feel to it. The movie itself, does not seem dark at first, and it has a twist to it, but not anything like Beetlejuice. It does things in it's own way and what I mean by that is that while it is not as unusual as other Tim Burton movies, you can tell he'd direct it the right way. Just like the upcoming movie "Corpse Bride" which also looks wonderful. This has some new stuff which was not in the original, and the oompa loompas are cooler. It makes the whole movie very strange, and I walked into the theater having complete faith in Tim Burton and Johnny Depp and while I scarfed down those Milk Duds when watching it, this movie did not disappoint, and ought to be a classic in time!
