 I'm almost positive when I say that most of the songs on this album, like a Creed album, is occasionally heard on the radio. Before that, I didn't know what this band sung. It's basically an  "I'll know it when I hear it" kind of thing. It sounded more like a Spiderman soundtrack to me. The first song that I heard, but thought was alright was "Crawl" on the Scream 3 soundtrack. Breaking The Cycle is a little bit better than that. If you enjoy rock music, I recommend you listen to the samples on this website {that is if you have some extra time on your hands at the moment}.
