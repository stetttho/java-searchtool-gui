 It's actually the best talk show that was EVER on tv or DVD too! Brak's not a regular guy, but at least he's in there once in a while for certain episodes. Even though it's extremely weird but cool, there are many guests. Space Ghost usually runs out of stuff to talk about, but what CAN he talk about that he hasn't? There are cool guests like Emeril Lagasse, Carrot Top, Martin Yan and others. It's definetely worth it if you need something to watch late at night all by yourself. {Like me}.
