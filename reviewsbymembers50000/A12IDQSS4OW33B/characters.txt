 Why does everyone I know who's played this game does not like Carrot Top? There's absolutely nothing wrong with him. I was surprised who was on this game when I got it. If there's someone who gets annoying quickly like Ron Jeremy or Anna Nicole Smith or  Cindy Margolis, I can easily kill them with ones like Jerry Springer or the Mummy! THIS GAME IS NEAT! {It's not my favorite, but a neat fighting game}.
