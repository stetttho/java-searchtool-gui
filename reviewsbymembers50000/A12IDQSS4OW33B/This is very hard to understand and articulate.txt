 It just doesn't make any sense to me. It wasn't that interesting  and you had to figure it all out when you wanted to  watch itand not figure something out. I don't know if it was that good in theaters because it wasn't long before it came out. The Grinch is better. You'll just have to see what you think. The thing that made no sense was everything that went on inside of Joel's mind. This is very dramatic but if you do like drama, find out if you like it or not. It's all up to you.
