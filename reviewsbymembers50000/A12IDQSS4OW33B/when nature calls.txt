 When nature calls, Ace is there to answer. No kidding. He goes to find the great white bat, "but to the natives, Shakaka." I think shakaka is a cool thing to say, whether it is a word or not.In the beginning, a guy named Fulton Greenwald goes looking for Ace after an unfortunate racoon accident. He finds him in an asian looking place and Ace recieves a medallion which took his master 80 years to acheive. Then he goes with Fulton on his way to meet Vincent Cadby, who is a workaholic. The abrasion on the palm of his left hand was explained by the great white bat's great white guano which was what Ace didn't know was bat crap in the first place. He is a maniac in this movie. {This is my second favorite movie, too}.
