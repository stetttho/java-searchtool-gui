 Although I have never seen Scream 3,I want to and I think the music is cool. Some of the bands I've never really heard of before, like Powerman 5000 or Slipknot or others. I'm giving it 4 stars because all of them aren't the best songs in the world, but still alright.My personal favorite is "Is This The End", which is the longest song on here. I've also noticed many horror movie soundtracks have a few of the same bands on here like Bride Of Chucky and Dracula 2000, but they are different songs {naturally}.
