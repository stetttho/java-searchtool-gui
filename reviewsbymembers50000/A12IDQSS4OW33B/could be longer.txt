 That's the only complaint I have about Compliants and Greviances.George talks about people who ought to be killed and talks about a fun big deal about things that come off our bodies. The most disgusting things that no one wants to even talk about. He also talks about guys named Todd. The whole DVD is funny. If you really enjoy George Carlin's material, you must see this. It just came out not too long ago, too.
