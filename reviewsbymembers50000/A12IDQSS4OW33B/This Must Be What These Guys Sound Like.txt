 The only reason I got this album is just for the song "Not Falling" because it wasn't on the soundtrack to "Ghost Ship" {my favorite horror movie, by the way}. Generally when I'd get other cds for one song I end up liking the rest of the songs. A few other songs on this cd are alright to listen to. Besides, this is the only Mudvayne cd I've ever had. I wouldn't say I'd get another one of this band's albums because I've never really intended to. I don't care for some songs because they're either too hard or too mellow for this band. It either gets depressing or weird. That's why it's 3 stars. You're welcome.
