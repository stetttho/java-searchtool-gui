 Vincent Benedict {Danny Devito} has no idea whatsoever that Julius {Arnold Schwartenegger} is his fracternal twin, separated at birth. When Julius first finds out, he is very excited and he thinks his brother will "be just like him," to quote. IXNAY! Of course, Vincent does not believe him until Julius saves his life from a fight. Since they've met each other, they decide that they both need to find their mother, only they find out more about themselves other than that to begin with. That's not the only issue, but a hitman is after Vincent. Tell me, what ARE the actual odds of having 2 siblings being the exact opposite in size?
