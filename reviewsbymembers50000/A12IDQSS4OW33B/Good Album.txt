 This is the first album by Sister Hazel I've ever listened to and it is pretty good. One of the best songs {in my opinion} is "CHANGE YOUR MIND". "BACK PORCH" is only instrumental, so, well, I don't know. Every song has it's own way of..... um, being itself in it's own special way.......  Sometimes I feel the earth move. Anyhoo, there is also a song called "FORTRESS" which is also special...... and sometimes I like time to myself to listen to this album. The album's cover is hazy looking and inside of the booklet it shows the lyrics.........  ...  ........and finally I... like to feel the earth move... ....  ......and I like to have time to myself to listen to this album.
