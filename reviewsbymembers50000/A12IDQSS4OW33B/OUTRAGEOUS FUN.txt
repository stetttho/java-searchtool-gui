 Terry Zwigoff has created possibly the funniest christmas movie I HAVE EVER SEEN! Unlike "GHOST WORLD", "BADDER SANTA" has got to be the most fun comedy I've ever watched and most comedies aren't as funny as this one. Not only that, but I've found that Lauren Graham is hot. She is in some situations with Santa that are continuous and obvious that would happen. "Santa" is a guy named Willie who is quite possibly the worst department store Santa.....EVER. A santa that drinks, smokes, swears, has sex and a bunch of other horrible stuff in public places. This movie made my laugh so hard I was crying and I continued to giggle afterwards. Throughout the whole movie, Willie's horrible grinchy attitude, unshaven face,foul mouth, friendship with a troubled kid,urge to steal money from safes, and everything else that's repulsively, brilliantly, gloriously funny about this guy makes this movie fun that most likely won't be a classic, but it is wonderful and it always makes me want to watch it over again.I'm also wondering  how good "TEAM AMERICA: WORLD POLICE" is. Maybe I will get it when it comes out somewhere in time. Hopefully, it won't be as funny as this is! {I REALLY DO NOT KNOW. I DIDN'T SEE THAT IN THEATERS}.
