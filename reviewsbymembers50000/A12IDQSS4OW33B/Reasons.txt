 Many people I know have seen Scary Movie 3. That's why I was wondering what the big deal was... I figured it out. {And because I heard George Carlin and Queen Latifah are in it}. This is a  good movie, but it is silly. The people who made all 3 scary movies have taken ideas from other scary movies, but in their own way, made them different. You might not regret seeing Scary Movie 3.
