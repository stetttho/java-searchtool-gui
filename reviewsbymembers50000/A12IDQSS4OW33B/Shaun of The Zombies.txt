 "Shaun of The Dead" is a very very funny and silly little comedy which is probably the first zombie movie in history that isn't horror. It's a horror comedy. That doesn't mean it's scary because it isn't. It's just like the "Beetlejuice" genre.   Shaun and his roommate are slackers. While his roommate plays video games all day long, Shaun goes to the store and then he either goes back home, or goes to work. Little does he know after a while that zombies are roaming the streets of London and they are after Shaun and his friends and family, killing everyone in their paths. If Shaun doesn't destroy them, they'd kill every last one of them. Shaun only needs to find a way to fight back in funny ways. One of my favorite scenes is where they {Shaun and his friend} try to figure out what to throw at a female zombie that is in their yard. They try records, cricket bats, and all kinds of other things. That's already pretty much how things are with the rest of the movie and the plot is easy. It starts a little slow but gets gorier and funnier later on, especially in the final tavern scene with all of the zombies which is basically everybody in England except Shaun and the others. Highly recommended.
