 That's the only word to describe this band: "Futuristic." Since some of you might not know of The Flaming Lips, their music is neat. It's really really strange. It's even tough to describe the sound of the music. The album itself revolves around a female named Yoshimi and her battles against pink robots, or at least 2 songs do. Like many other bands, it's weird, and that's what's so wonderful about it. I'm most likely sure these guys are still together and will keep making albums in time!
