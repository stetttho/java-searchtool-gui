 "Perfume" by Patrick Suskind is the story of a murderer {obviously}. It's about a boy who's born with a strong sense of smell, yet he ironically has not one smell of his own. When he starts to grow up, he ventures France in search of the perfect smell for the ultimate perfume. He can smell everything around him, and far away. Soon after in his search, he discovers that the smell of children is the purest of all and he tries to distill that smell while still searching for other smells for his perfect perfume, and in doing so, he becomes a mass murderer.   This is a very suspicious novel that will keep you suspencefully guessing what will happen next after every twist and turn that each chapter makes. It's pretty good if you're ever feeling like reading a mysterious book. I highly recommend it for this reason. A movie based on this novel is set to be released later this year. Hope this helped.
