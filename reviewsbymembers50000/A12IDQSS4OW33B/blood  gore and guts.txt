 I just have so much fun watching the gory action parts near the end of this film! Movies with killers and a lot of blood and gore are cool. When I watch this, it sometimes makes me want to see the gory parts again and never really get tired of it! If you don't mind this stuff, YOU HAVE TO SEE ALL OF "HOLLOW MAN"!!!!
