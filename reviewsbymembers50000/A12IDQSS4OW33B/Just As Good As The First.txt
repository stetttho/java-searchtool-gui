 Orcs are everywhere. Frodo Baggins continues his quest to destroy the ring. That's all that's going on. It's cool. Cooler than I thought it would be. It is a follow-up from "Fellowship of The Ring." THAT was awesome to begin with.  You have to see that first to know whaaaatttt'ssss happenin'. MMM-KAY? Sure, there are problems. There always are problems in this trilogy. I just love fantasy movies. I cannot think of more than 2 people who don't like films like this. Some who like it still occasionally fall asleep. You know it's NOT THAT boring. Classic series.
