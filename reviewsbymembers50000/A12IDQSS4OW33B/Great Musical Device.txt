 An IPOD is basically something that is an improvement to music. If you're a cd collector, that's about to end if you want an IPOD. All you have to do is download any song{s} from any cd onto this and enjoy! It doesn't skip and it is so easy to use! I have many songs by various musical artists on mine and I have no problems whatsoever when it comes to my own taste in music. This can be fun to listen to if you have different bands in several orders on the playlist. I don't need to worry about buying too many more albums because it holds up to 1000 songs! I won't be filling it up for a very long time because I'm not even so sure I have 1000 songs altogether on all my albums. It doesn't matter what you put on this. I could even put a heavy metal song on it and then a new age song, and that's only half the fun of it! Might I finally add that you can also play games, such as "Brick" and "Parachute" and "Music Quiz" and "Solitaire" while you listen to music?? Your ear could start to hurt if you've easily listened to the thing all day with those earphones.
