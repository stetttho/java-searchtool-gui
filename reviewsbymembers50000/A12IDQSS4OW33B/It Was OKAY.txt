 The first 2 or 3 songs on this album are the best, but it gets weird in Adema's own way. My fav song on it is "IMMORTAL" because it rocks harder than any other song besides "Nutshell". I just think they are the best ones. At least in those songs, this band is enjoying themselves and that is pretty nice to hear along with the hard, hard energy of the cd.   The weird thing about it is that Adema were doing things their own way, and yet, that almost makes it better, but it still only deserves 3 stars because of the greatness of the opening of the album. I'd say it gets a B- for it's strong effort with being good. It tried very hard, but didn't quite make it. The closing of the album was my LEAST favorite because it's like they just gave up on the good songs...or something like that. It's hard to explain. I hope this was a little helpful for ya. Hasta Lombego!{or...however you spell that word}.
