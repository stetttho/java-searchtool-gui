 This movie is not really worth watching more than once. Not that it's awful, but because it's lower than mediocre. It can be compared to "Galaxy Quest," only this just wasn't as good. When I finally saw it, it barely held my attention.   Arthur Dent is having a rough day and it gets rougher after his house is destroyed for a bypass. He later finds out that his best friend is an alien and that the earth is about to also be destroyed. Arthur only survives when his friend saves him by warping both of them up to a spaceship filled with the nastiest aliens in the galaxy. When they get off that ship, they go into another one with a few of Arthur's other, and more bizzare friends to begin on a slightly mediocre sci-fi adventure.  The plot sounds awesome, but for me, it wasn't great. It's not even very funny either. I watched it because I wanted to, and because the plot did indeed sound cool. I guess it's cool to whoever likes it, but it's definetely not my cup of tea. And to think that I saw it on Mulberry Street! At least rent it if the plot sounds cool enough to you.
