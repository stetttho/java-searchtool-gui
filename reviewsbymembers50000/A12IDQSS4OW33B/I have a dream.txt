 I have a dream, a glorious dream. I have a dream when forests are safer and the world becomes nothing but fields, blue skies and mountains. I have a dream. I dream where fantasy and adventure genres rules all movies.....I have a dream where deadbeats or critics who think this movie is funny should be beaten with golfclubs and left bleeding in the moonlight.....I have a dream...a fabulous dream....where fantasy is never mixed with unfunny comedy again....I have dreams.....good dreams....I dream away.
