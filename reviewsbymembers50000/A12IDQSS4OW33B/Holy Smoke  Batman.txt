 {brief spoilers}:  You know, I hadn't really expected to like this movie very much, and I kinda did. Kate Winslet is british but in this movie she is australian...okay. I didn't think it was very funny, but that's just me. It wasn't great, but not that bad.   Ruth Barron {Kate Winslet} is in India when she is effected by a guru. Unbeknownest to her,  she comes back to her home in Australia, only to meet P.J. Waters {Harvey Keitel} who is a de-programmer who has tricked her to come back and they argue forever about love and.... stuff. Later on, P.J. discovers that Ruth will give her body and her soul to anyone because of the guru. It all goes a bit over-the-top from there on. That's about all I should give away for now. Hope this was helpful.
