 We don't find a film like this everyday DO we?? If you like chickens who want to escape a farm from a couple that you would be surprised got married!! Mrs. Tweedy builds a pie machine where, and I quote, "chickens go in, pies come out". This film must've taken a looooong time to make. DAVE'S ALL NEW WITH THE TWEEDYS'!! The chicken's have to escape from the farm and become free. It's just good clay animation if you like THAT at least. I DO. I love it. I wish I was in the clay animation business....
