 Johnny Depp plays a guy named James Matthew Barrie, who is a guy who writes plays, and not too many people like them. Later in the movie, he is claimed to be Peter Pan. That's really all this movie is about. I just have one question about Peter Pan...why is he always played by a woman?? Answer:I don't know. Maybe it just seems right, but not to me. Basically, this movie had barely anything to do with Neverland. Even though that is the case, there is one scene where Kate Winslet is shown Neverland. That's about it, and they talk a whole lot about stuff like it and James Matthew Barrie was saying to "Believe" at the end. I didn't think this was awful. Only alright. It's worth seeing.
