 Some of the songs on this album I had already heard before. The rest of them were alright. This is my third album. It is likeable if you are a fan of Marilyn Manson. "Lest We Forget" is not precisely my most favorite of his albums, but I enjoy it. "Sweet Dreams" is just a song that is in his version. I don't care for that song, as I predicted to myself how it would sound if he sung it. In case you don't like this kind of music, don't buy it. I bet a few people even think it is anti-semetic. Most people just don't understand that Brian Warner{Marilyn Manson} is a very intelligent man and it's just his music that sounds this way.
