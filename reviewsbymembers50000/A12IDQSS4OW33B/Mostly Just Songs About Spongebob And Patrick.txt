 When I say that, I mean that about EVERY single song on this soundtrack is a different "story" about Spongebob in the bands' own ways. That's not necessarily a bad thing at all. The movie was a bit better. My favorite song is by the Flaming Lips, probably because of the way the song goes and sounds. I guess the entire cd is cool to listen to, and I am very fond of the Flaming Lips song. I really need to find one of their own albums....Most of the other songs also have Spongebob and Patrick singing. I'd prefer ones with the bands, {only they don't sing in a much different catagory, just a little more mature-like}. You can see enough of them singing in the cartoon and in the movie. I noticed how some other cds don't, or sometimes don't even mention anything of the movies that they're inspired by, or have the characters present in any of the songs. I can also see why the makers of the movie and this cd wouldn't have much else to sing about other than the main characters and the plot. Most soundtracks don't. It's not all that bad, come to think of it. It's actually better compared to a few other soundtracks that weren't that good. This was. I'd have to enjoy most bands on the soundtracks to generally like the whole thing. Although most bands/artists on this cd I am not too familiar with, it's somewhat worth listening to for the fun of it. Hope this helped.
