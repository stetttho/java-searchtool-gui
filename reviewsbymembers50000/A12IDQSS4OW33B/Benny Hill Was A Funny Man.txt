 Very little material was not funny. I know some people really don't like british comedy {take Monty Python, for instance}, but whoever said Benny Hill playing various roles as women, Robin Hood, another thief, a sheriff, Mary O-hairy, and many others wasn't funny? Of course it is! No matter what Benny Hill plays he's usually guaranteed to deliver some laughs! Within 2 hours, it's all good fun with Benny Hill on this tape, NOT TO MENTION, more than a few babes in there, too. Everything on this tape is set to fit your satisfactions of Benny Hill, occasionally playing almost every character, and  funnier ones in the silent sketches, which are personally my favorite parts. You can relax, and enjoy Benny Hill's silly ways in perhaps, the silliest of any of his stuff.
