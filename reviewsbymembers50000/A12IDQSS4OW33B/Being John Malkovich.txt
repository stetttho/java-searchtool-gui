 This might be the weirdest movie I've ever seen. BJM is about Craig Schwartz, who is a puppeteer who works on the 7 1/2 floor of a building in New York. One day, he finds a door in his office that lets him be John Makovich for 15 minutes and it ditches him on the New Jersey Turnpike. He lets other people try it for $200 and he begins a little something called "J.M.INC". Mr. Malkovich finds out about it and he wants to find out what's going on. Craig explains that it's a "business", and that entices him to go into the portal himself.......
