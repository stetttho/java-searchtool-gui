 This one should be similar to my Volume 2 review. My personal favorite episode on Volume 2 is "Super Trivia" and on this one, my favs are all various. One is "Total Recarl", "The Clowning", "THE", "The Last One", and others. Not ALL of them, but many. Some episodes are violent and BLOODY. Not too bloody, but brief blood. Ya know what I mean?? Carl has to be my favorite character too. I'm bored. Just get this and like it.
