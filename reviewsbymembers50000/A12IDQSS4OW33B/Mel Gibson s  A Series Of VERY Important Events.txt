 First off, not ALL of this movie made sense to me. I don't know really what to say here because everyone else has already said everything. Some of the beginning made a little sense because I have seen "Life Of Brian" which is the exact opposite of this film. So I might have learned some things already. I do have many questions about it, though. I get why so many people were offended. Because Jesus sinned in some way. Throughout the movie, he kept praying that he, along with a few other folks would be forgiven, but THAT'S where I get confused. Oh well. I'm surprised I did understand SOME things, and yet, it's very interesting.
