 I just barely saw half of this tripe. Why is it tripe? BECAUSE I HAD NO IDEA WHAT IN THE WORLD WAS GOING ON WITH WHAT I SAW! I didn't know who the characters were supposed to be except this kid named Homer, who was only real ambition was to build a rocket and shoot it off at the end of the film. Some plot. I read the book called "Rocket Boys" and this movie is just an anagram of the book. I didn't care for the book, so why the movie?
