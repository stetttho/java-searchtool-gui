 Probably. I'm beginning to love Winona Ryder now because of this movie. It talks a whole lot about suicide with high schoolers and homosexuals and comedy all in one. Look at BEETLEJUICE this way because that was almost similar and with dark humor, this is good. Even though some of it is just plain silly, what would you expect when suicide and romance and all that other stuff wreaks havoc??
