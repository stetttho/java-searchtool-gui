  I SHOULD keep this review short and sweet.  I like this album. I don't like it as much as "Breaking The Cycle." Although both albums rock just as hard and are about the same in someone like me enjoying them. Staind is different from Marilyn Manson. I don't really like to compare the two because Marilyn Manson has nothing to do with Staind. If some people thought this music is depressive, I disagree. I don't know why, but I do. While this sounds similar to "Breaking The Cycle," I actually like them both accurately about the same, and not just because this also has a DVD with it.  I do kinda wish Marilyn Manson did the same and released an album and a DVD in the same case. Like I said before, he is entirely different. I hope this helped some.
