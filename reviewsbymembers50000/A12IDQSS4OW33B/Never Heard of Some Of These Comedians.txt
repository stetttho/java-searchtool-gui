 Chris Rock isn't very funny, and I've never heard of Paul Rodriguez, Norm Macdonald, or Richard Belzer, so they weren't too great. Ellen Degeneres was funny, though, because she talked about how things always are on airplanes. That was funny. Rosie O'donnell was funny too. I think this dvd was about the comedy  before these comedians became who they are today. It becomes manageable by including: Carrot Top, Cheech Marin, Jim Carrey, Tim Allen, Jason Alexander, Jeff Foxworthy, 2 performances by Adam Sandler, Janeane Garofalo, Ray Ramano, Drew Carey, Jerry Seinfeld and Kelsey Grammer. 3 and a half stars.
