 it's not one of my favorites. This is only okay to listen to once in a long while:                  1. Alright.                  2. Possibly the best song.                  3. I heard better.                  4. Okay.                   5. Not Judas Priest's best.                  6. Boooorrriinnnggg.                  7. Slayer sucks after 1988.                   8. The start is cool but the rest sucks.                  9. Powerman 5000 exaggerates.                  10. It's kind of lame.                    11. "So Real" is a whole lot better than this.                  12. I only listened to it once to this day.                   13. Damn Patsy Cline Wannabes!                   14. Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!     It's a lot worse than  expected it to be. It could only be a millimeter more of a crappy song and I would give it 2 well deserved stars. But I can only give it 3 stars because of a couple of good songs on this entire cd.
