 This movie was absolutely everything that I wanted it to turn out to be. I highly recommend this to anyone and not just because it's a disney movie. It also has great acting, a perfect plot and awesome characters. Especially Aslan the lion {Liam Neeson}. I also think every character was pretty well cast, like the White Witch {Tilda Swinton}, and the wardrobe is where the magic begins with beautiful scenery of Narnia and monster members of the White Witch's army, {that goes without saying} with more than a few great battle scenes that makes everything fit everything perfectly in Narnia as the way it is, like making the entire movie a cross between Indiana Jones and "Lord of The Rings." I remember seeing several different versions of "Narnia" before this movie with the BBC version and the books, neither that I remember that well, but the point is this is just another wonderful adaption that was even better than I anticipated because I didn't know what to think before I saw it and now all I can think of is how marvelous it really is.
