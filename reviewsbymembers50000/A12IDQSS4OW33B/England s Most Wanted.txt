 I hadn't expected this to be a movie about Jack The Ripper. But since Johnny Depp was in it, it had a depressing ending and was interesting overall...like a cross between "Gangs of New York" and "Sleepy Hollow". With enough thrills and chills and mystery, that's like what "From Hell" is. If everyone knew why Jack The Ripper killed prostitutes, there'd be no mystery. But they didn't know. Johnny Depp was not as much of a "wuss" as he was in "Sleepy Hollow", and he still wants to figure everything out by investigating the corpses to try to find clues. Usually, he'd just find grape vines which helped him. You don't see Jack The Ripper's face and he lures the prostitutes to the location that he murders them. That's about it for him. I've read before that in real life, Johnny Depp is actually a huge Jack The Ripper fan, so it's no wonder.
