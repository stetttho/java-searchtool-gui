 When Link's sister is captured by a bird on an island, you then soon get a boat....AND HAVE AN ENTIRE OCEAN TO EXPLORE!!!! It's full of tough temples and stuff but it's a great Zelda game nevertheless. "The Legend Of Zelda" series is based loosely on the movie "Legend" made in 1985. That might be my next review. So far, this is still one of the best Zelda games I have played in a while. I gave it 4 stars because of how difficult the temples can tend to be sometimes.
