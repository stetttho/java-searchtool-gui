 When nothing's stranger than the truth, it's all real. That's the strangest thing about "BELIEVE IT OR NOT". The television show was cool, but they never showed anything like this on the show. Some of these facts are scarier than getting a phone call from a relative or a friend who has been dead for 11 years. The entire book is filled with facts that you will not believe. Facts that even I could never conceive. You will love this book.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!
