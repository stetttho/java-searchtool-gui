 "Coraline" is a great book. It can get remotely creepy. Here's my review:  Coraline has just moved in with her parents into a new house, which is not so new. Coraline {or Caroline to some}, is a bored girl who discovers a door behind a bricked-up wall in her room which leads to another world, to another mother and another father who have liquid-paper white skin and black buttons for eyes. When Coraline gets back to her world, her parents are missing and she finds out that her other mother has captured them with lost children's souls, and the only thing that Coraline has left afterwards is a friendship with a talking cat, and the only choice of a challenge with her other mother just to get her parents back. If she loses, her other mother keeps her there forever, and if Coraline wins, her other mother has to give one of her hands and Coraline would get her parents back to her world.
