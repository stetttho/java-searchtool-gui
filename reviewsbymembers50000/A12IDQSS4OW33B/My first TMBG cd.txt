 Even though this was my first cd by my favorite band, I really enjoyed it. It has many nice computer features too!You can play as the song goes on, or you can just watch it to really amuse yourself!! I wasn't sure whether to get Apollo 18, or this. I picked this then soon got that for my birthday.
