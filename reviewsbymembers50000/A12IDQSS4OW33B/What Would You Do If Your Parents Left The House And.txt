 never returned?? That's exactly what happened to Molly. She is left all alone with the house to herself. It turns out the Skeleton Man killed her parents. I hope reading this book does not make you paranoid or a hypocondriac. I don't want to spoil everything for you, but this is a good book in my opinion. If you're interested, you ought to read it. I won't tell you the plot or anything else that happens. If I were alone with nothing to do, {that's pretty much how I live now} then I would perhaps read a neat book like this one. I think literature is important in society these days. The only other thing I will say is that the Skeleton Man soon goes after Molly.
