 The beginning of Scream 1 was good. Scream 2 was boring and this one was just okay. I actually thought I would enjoy it more than Scream 2, and I did. The story gets confusing to me, but only the best scenes are with the killer. Scream 2 had one good scene. That's it. I quite enjoy it's soundtrack but you can leave it's movie to someone else who likes it more than I do. In this one, NO ONE knows who the killer is. I knew even before I saw this movie so maybe that's why I didn't enjoy it all that much. Horror movies aren't my thing very much anymore than they use to be. Oh well. Believe it or not, this was the best one, but I'm afraid it's just not as good as everyone says it is.   Scream 1: The best part was the beginning. Scream 2: Not enjoyable like I was told it was.  Scream 3: Okay, and the best...and ONLY OKAY.
