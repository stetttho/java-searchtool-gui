 Is seeing "Wayne's World" only once enough?  It's strange that Wayne still lives with his parents at his age. In my opinion, Garth was a cooler guy. This might only be a movie for everybody else, but I have seen better. I like fantasy films. This was just a weird comedy. Most other comedies try their hardest, but are not that funny. Except "Badder Santa".
