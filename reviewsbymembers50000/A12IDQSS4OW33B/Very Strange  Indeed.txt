 Count Olaf tries to kill Violet, Sunny, and Klaus and steal their fortune after their parents die in a fire. He dresses up as different characters with weird voices/laughs, and it does not all work. Jude Law is the voice of Lemony Snicket. Roughly, I'd give this movie about 3 and a half stars because I'm not quite sure if I liked it or not. I suppose it was good.
