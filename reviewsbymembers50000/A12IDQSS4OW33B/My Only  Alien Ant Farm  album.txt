 I very much doubt I will get another one of this band's albums because this album is enjoyable enough for me. I have also heard "Bug Bytes" which is on the Spiderman 1 soundtrack. While the whole cd can be pretty entertaining, my favorite song is "Movies." I've just personally liked that the most and I'm most familar with it. This band's music is kind of like Alternative Rock/Punk put together, but mostly in the punk genre. If you are a fan of these guys, or if you like this kind of music, I recommend it. Hope this review helped.
