  "Space Ghost: Coast To Coast" is a neat late night time talk show that you can watch whenever. Space Ghost zaps Moltar more times than in Volume 2, and this has more interesting guests and more episodes. I gave Volume 2 4 stars also, but Volume 3 is a bit better. Here's why: It has more characters, it's stranger, it's sillier, and it has cooler guests such as Mike Judge, Rob Zombie, David Cross, Steve Allen {who I have never heard of until this show just like a few other guests}, and there are so many more other guests and weird stuff.
