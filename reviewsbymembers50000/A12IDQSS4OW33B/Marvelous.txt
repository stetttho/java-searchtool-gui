 This cd is great. I watched the movie today {but it wasn't the first time} and listened to this cd today. I think a nice song on it would be "Don't Change" by The Goo Goo Dolls. After listening to "Here Comes The Night" and "Jungle Groove"and watching the movie, it made me feel like taking a holiday to Africa just to see what it's reaaally like. {It's probably not too different from what it looks like}. Another good song is "Boll Weevil". I very much recommend it because it is INSPIRING AND WONDERFUL. At first, "Burnin' Rubber" sounded kinda weird, but it turned out being OK. The best part started on that song with a hard guitar after, "I'm burnin' rubber all over the whole woooorrrlllddd!!!!" I thought "Blur The Technicolor" was going to sound like another one of White Zombie's songs called "Ratfinks, Suicide Tanks and Cannibal Girls" which is featured on the Beavis and Butthead Do America soundtrack, but it was different.{Don't listen to anyone who disses any of these songs}. Order this soundtrack today, and if you don't have the movie, get that too. It's neat.
