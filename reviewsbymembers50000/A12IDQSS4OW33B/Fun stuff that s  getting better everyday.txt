 This is good music. It's even almost as marvelous as the movie. "Music Inspired by the Chronicles of Narnia" is a special soundtrack sure inspires you to see it again if you've already seen it. I highly recommend most of the songs here. The entire cd is 42 minutes long, but it certainly does not feel that long at all {the movie was almost 2 and half hours and that doesn't feel like it either, go figure}. I think the soundtrack fits well with the movie.  Not only that, but every song makes you feel darn good in it's own way. I knew that after hearing a couple of good songs I was going to get it, like I said, it's almost as good as the movie and that's basically the bottom line. That's about all I have to say about it, only in a rambling matter. Just let me tell you it's generally highly recommended {again}, as especially is the great movie on dvd that it's inspired by, and it's easy to see why.
