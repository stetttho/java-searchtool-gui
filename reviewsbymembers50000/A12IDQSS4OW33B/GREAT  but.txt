 once you get pretty far in this game it gets VERY DIFFICULT. I hope this review isn't deceiving. If you enjoy Spongebob and have seen the movie, you will really like this game as I do, as hard as it tends to become. Perhaps it's because getting near the end of the game is the toughest challenge. Then the levels will seem almost impossible to beat. You'll see what I mean if you're planning on getting this game. Anyway, it's pretty good. You get the idea that it follows the exact same story, though.  The game has realistic graphics and it could get involved if you let it. 4 and half stars overall.
