 I wasn't sure what this meant at first, but now it made sense to me at the end. You just really have to pay attention to the whole movie and finally, you'll figure it out. Mort Rainey is an author and one day a guy named John Shooter comes to his house and claims that Mort "stole his story". He keeps appearing and asking for the same thing and Mort knows, but he won't change the ending. Soon, everything starts getting worse. Many people think this is creepy, but I don't really think so. It sort of LOOKS creepy, but the entire story is stupendous until the end. Stephen King must've thought hard about this. It kind of reminds me of the plot of Dreamcatcher. You might not think it makes sense at the beginning, but you will if you've never seen this. Secret Window looks as though it's something to hesitate and stay away from, but it's not. It's a great story to check out in another Stephen King movie that {I don't think he directed, but probably wrote}.
