 Scream is very suspenseful and makes Scary Movie look like a chicken in a basement playing a styrophome piano. You see, Scary Movie took a totally opposite turn. It's  like the people who did that made Scream look stupid and they didn't know what  they were doing like Scream was stupid. It's not. I like a good movie that's cool. Let me give some advice and offence if you think this but: WHOEVER DIDN'T THINK THE RING WAS SCARY SHOULD BE SHOT.
