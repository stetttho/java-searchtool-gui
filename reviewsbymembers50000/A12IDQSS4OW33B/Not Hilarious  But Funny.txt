 While this movie wasn't totally hilarious, there's always good fun with John Goodman in it. H.I.{Nicholas Cage} is a criminal, and his wife {Holly Hunter} is a cop. When she can't get pregnant, there isn't one adoption agency around that can give them a kid. So, they just kidnap a baby and pass it on as their own, because they want one so bad, and things don't go so easily after that because that's when John Goodman and his partner {who are both also escaped criminals} have to live with them for a while and later in the movie, things still don't get better because of Leonard Smalls, a tough biker who can probably crush anything with his hands and destory anything else with his grenades. Loosely, I'd give this just 4 stars, because while it was funny, John Goodman was my favorite guy, because I thought he was funny. This movie was not bad at all for a good comedy. Just the way he appeared in one scene, yelling as he crawled out of the mud in the pouring rain just like a monster or something. He is very funny. This movie was pretty neat, and not all that serious. There was never a sequel, though. It doesn't need one anyhow.
