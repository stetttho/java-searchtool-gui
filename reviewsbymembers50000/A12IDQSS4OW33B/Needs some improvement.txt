 But I guess it's okay to occasionally watch anyway. Some of it gets boring, though. There isn't that much significance in the opening song. It's just a regular movie with no special effects because that's not the kind it is and I suppose I like it a little bit at least. I've never read the comic book because I had never heard of it before. This isn't really much of a review. It's just me talking about my brief issues with this mediocre film....... did I mention the "special effects" thing already?? If this  is supposed to be comedy, then the filmmakers should have had something better to do. This movie is okay. It's not great, but it's something to watch if you're bored.
