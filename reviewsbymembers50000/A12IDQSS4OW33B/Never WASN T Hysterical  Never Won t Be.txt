 "Kung Pow"....... is the funniest movie I've ever seen for a karate spoof! It's like as another movie, only with Steve Oedekerk dubbing all the voices for every character. Not for one second is this movie ever serious about anything. Steve Oedekerk is also the star as The Chosen One. That's his name. It is impossible to describe in words the hilarity of this movie. It's that funny! Highly recommended for a great comedy.
