 I wish I won the lottery, but that's for people with hope. I have hope. You'd have a better chance at....blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. That's the way it always is. PLUS YOU'D HAVE A BETTER CHANCE AT LIKING THIS!! IT IS SO BORING! I might never win the lottery just like all of those S.O.B.s who have all of it to themselves!!!!!!!!!!!! It makes me furious. Even though in the series, this game leads straight to Vice City, AT LEAST THE MAIN CHARACTER HAS A FRIGGIN' PERSONALITY IN THAT GAME!!!! I don't know yet how good San Andreas is either. The graphics for GTA 3 are just plain crappy, you don't have a code for weapons, and when you kill someone, it doesn't sound like you're trying to. Everything echoes for some reason when you go down hills of streets {shrug}. If you want a better game, play GTA VICE CITY, DRAGONBALL Z BUDOKAI, or MK DEADLY ALLIANCE. You will not only get blood, but a lot of good, fun violence.
