 Although there's not enough of the cat {Mr. Jynx} in this movie than there was in the first, "Meet the Fockers" was still better.   Greg Focker takes his girlfriend Pam to Detroit to "meet the fockers" and it turns out being just the way it sounds. They take a plane first class to Pam's house, and  then they plan to take another plane to Detroit. Instead, Pam's father Jack has a very luxurious R.V. for them to drive there. Greg's parents have their own isle, and the fun begins from there on with "silly situations" as I should put it. I got to borrow this movie from (...). I rate it with all 5 stars.
