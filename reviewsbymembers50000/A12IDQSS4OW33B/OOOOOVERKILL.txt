 Ron is a funny guy, no doubt. Some of this is on both BLUE COLLAR COMEDY TOUR films, but not all of it. That's why I gave it 4 stars. He talks about his dog Sluggo, tornadoes, his son Marshall, and a whole crapload of other stuff. I just rented this, but it was pretty much worth it! Believe me, Ron is funnier than a lot of comedians I've seen in a while.
