 YOU DON'T KNOW JACK  WILL BE ABLE TO KEEP YOU ENTERTAINED FOR HOURS BECAUSE THERE ARE 2 CDS FULL OF QUESTIONS. THE HOST, COOKIE, IS ALSO COOL. HE CAN BE FUNNY EVEN IF YOU GET AN ANSWER WRONG.MY PERSONAL FAVORITE ONES ON HERE ARE THE IMPOSSIBLE QUESTIONS. THEY ARE WEIRD!! ANYWAY, THE GAME ITSELF IS COOOOOL.
