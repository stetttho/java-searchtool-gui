 I haven't seen Creepshow 2, nor know what it is about, but I enjoy  and have the 1'st one. I was shocked that Mr. King is in it HIMSELF. He finds a meteor in his yard and it makes everything grow. It is one of my favorite parts with "Something to tide you over" the end of that skit was freaky. You will just have to watch it and find it out yourself. Not only do I love horror movies, but this is a TRUE CLASSIC with Children Of The Corn.{John Franklin was perfect in that}. My favorites in this movie are: THE LONESOME DEATH OF JORDY VERILL 5/5 THE CRATE 4/5 {VERY CREEPY} SOMETHING TO TIDE YOU OVER 4/5
