 You might think that because of "Oogie's Revenge," that this is a sequel to the movie, just as a game. It's like a video game of the movie, and they are very close to each other. While it's pretty fun to play whenever, it may take a while to beat it. Jack Skellington's weapon is the soul robber which defeats all of the monsters and stuff with more than one move. It is somewhat involved, but not as involved as some other video games I've played recently. The "Halloween" song from the movie usually only plays when you're fighting and it's a little different. Personally, I think it's most fun when you fight bosses. The game starts in Halloweentown, and goes from there to  levels such as hidden places, the graveyard, a burial chamber in the graveyard, and several other levels. When you beat a level, the game shows your accuracy and it is possible to earn prizes if you get an "A." The gameplay is not quite like it's easy and then it's hard and then it's easy again. It changes a lot depending on which level you're on. Overall, this game is pretty fun to play. Like I said, it's just like the movie  only as a video game with involved things and familiar voices, and it's NOT a sequel. I think it was even delayed before too. It's worth buying for the graphics and if you have always been a fan of  "The Nightmare Before Christmas" like I have, and just because it's cool. Enjoy!
