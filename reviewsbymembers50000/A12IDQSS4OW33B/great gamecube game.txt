 THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE GAMECUBE GAMES AND THE GRAPHICS ARE AWESOME!HERE'S SOME NEW STUFF: YOU CAN PLAY THE SAME CHARACTERS, BUT NOW IT'S LIKE ALL OF THEM HAVE THEIR OWN ARENA TO FIGHT IN! NOW EVEN BOWSER'S IN THIS GAME! THERE ARE SOME NEW GUYS LIKE CAPT. FALCON, BUT THAT'S JUST ABOUT IT FOR NEW CHARACTERS, BUT THE MASTER HAND IS AT THE END, AND THE ENTIRE GAMEPLAY IS WONDERFUL!!!! NINTENDO GAMECUBE IS THE GAME SYSTEM OF THE FUTURE IN MY OPINION. Cherrio.
