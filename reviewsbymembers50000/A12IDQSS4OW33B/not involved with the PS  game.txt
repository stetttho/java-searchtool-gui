 Read the title again. But it does have christmassy songs that were  heavily featured in the movie. It's a nice thing to listen to to get into the christmas spirit and it's gotten me cheered up a little as well. I gave it 4 stars because not all of the score is GREAT, but some of it is. There is also movie dialogue that everyone who saw the movie knows. The game, however, barely has anything to do with the movie but that is okay. I like "GREEN CHRISTMAS" by the Barenaked Ladies and "Lonely Christmas Eve" by Ben Folds and some of the other songs are better than others that are all based on Christmas which results hands down overall in  roughly 4 stars.
