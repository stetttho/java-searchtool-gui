 what else should I say? Well, it is just a wonderful, long adventure traveling through the ocean that has fantasy elements. When I say "fantasy elements", I mean that the cyclops does not look very real, but a sea serpent does in this movie. I don't exactly know if the story of it is so much of an epic that it has been handed down from generation after generation, but it is a pretty neat story of the certainly specific greek gods like the water god Poseidon and the goddess Calypso. They are just 2 examples who don't have very big parts, and I'm guessing it is not only them, but they all have SOME significance in the legend. It has to be some sort of a legend, otherwise, I would not care much for "The Odyssey" because it might not be at a big budget. Come to think of it, "Creepshow" could be a low budget horror film, but that's another story. At least rent this to see what I mean. Believe me, it's not as horrible as it is overally rated by other reviewers who probably do not have any respect for this movie's story and the "epic" of it. I'm quite interested.
