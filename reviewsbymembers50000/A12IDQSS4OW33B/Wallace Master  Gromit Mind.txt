 {spoilers}:  Something very bunny is going on. It's no surprise for Wallace and Gromit as a team. This cheese-obsessed man and his dog who never says anything investigate the garden sabotage that has gone around their neighborhood just before the annual giant vegetable growing contest. They use all the rabbits they've caught for Rabbit Rehabilitation so they won't like vegetables. It gets messed up and one of these rabbits {named Hutch} mutates and gets bigger, but this has also somehow affected Wallace. After this "were-rabbit" terrorizes the town, things only become plain fun when weirder things begin to happen while Wallace and Gromit investigate.   Good claymation for a fun movie, I must say. 4 and a half out of 5 stars.
