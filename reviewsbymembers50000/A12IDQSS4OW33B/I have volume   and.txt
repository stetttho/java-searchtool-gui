 I also have the movie! My favorite stunt on this DVD is "the omelette". In my opinion, THE BEST PART OF BREAKFAST! {no, not really}. All of the other stunts are....different...sort of in their own way. I haven't watched the t.v. show on MTV, but I have seen and own  volume 2 and 3 and the movie. The reason the stunts are different are because some of them may end up being shocking, but they're cool anyway. If you want a good laugh, watch some of them. Trust me. Have faith in yourself, and I say that to whomever reads this review. I think there should be a sequel to the movie because these guys can do....pretty much whatever they want. Enjoy!
