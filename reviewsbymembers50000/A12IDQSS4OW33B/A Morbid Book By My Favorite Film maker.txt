 {Believe it or not}, the "Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy" is actually one of the saddest poems in this book. Even though it IS comedy, it is dark comedy about outsiders who only wish to fit in, but something tragic happens to them. They are very short poems, but worth reading.   I could not put it down.
