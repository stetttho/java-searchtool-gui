 I thought this a particularly fun book to read for spare time, and also because it's by the great actor Alan Cumming.    Once upon a time, there lived a boy named Tommy. Tommy lived in London with his friends. He had relationships and conflicts. Between his relationships, he soon had the urge to have a child of his own. But between the conflicts, this was not all too easy.    A couple of my favorite things about this book is the random fairy tale  chapters about certain subjects and Tommy's rules for certain things. {For example, water, drugs, depression, etc}. Tommy also spends a lot of time taking showers and thinking to himself in the process. I like the way he describes things where he is and what he's thinking about when it comes to meeting new people in new places, such as New York. Alan Cumming is a very good novelist and I hope he writes another book later on. I don't mean to brag, but this novel is well worth reading. Whether you like Alan Cumming or it just looks interesting {which were my reasons for getting it}, you should read it sometime. It doesn't necessarily have a plot, then again, it does because of Tommy's relationships and how it all goes with his friends and all that jazz. Even though this book might not quite be for everyone, it's pretty good for it's pizzazz of Tommy's occasional silly rules and fairy tale chapters about separate people in separate "worlds" who have their own special, odd hobbies ...and so on. Not only are Tommy's rules cool, but they are actually also helpful if you ever find yourself in need of any related case in the category. Alan Cumming really makes it all worthwhile to take some time to read.
