 Really! We invited him over and we all had marinated grilled shrimp. I said "If anyone doesn't want their shrimp, give it to me!". I was wrong. He took off his face and revealed his skull which breathes fire. Maybe that's why I don't have flesh on my arms anymore. He just scorched it right off! Anyway, to get into the details in this movie, he fights Johnny Cage {which is a really good scene}. In the beginning, Liu Kang has a dream about his brother and Shang Tsung. His worst fear is faced here in Outworld when he gets confrontational with Shang Tsung and his supernatural warriors. Before that, a better scene is where Liu find the hidden MK character Reptile and they fight. Lord Rayden {who is Christopher Lambert from Highlander} teaches Liu about stuff that would be helpful to him later in the assistance of Princess Kitana in the Subzero fight. The entire movie is pretty cool. So is MK: Annihilation, although some of those characters are different. It's not worse, which is good! I'm waiting for the 3'rd movie which should be out in 2005 or 2006.
