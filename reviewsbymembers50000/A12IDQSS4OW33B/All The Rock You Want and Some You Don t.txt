 V-Rock contains great rock songs from the 80's. Rock music is mostly the only kind of music I ever usually listen to, and these songs fit the genre right. This cd is kind of like the radio, only it's not. Lazlow, the DJ, also has neat stuff to say about his career and the songs and other things. He is very cool. More interesting, however, is how he has the listener hear him talk for a minute or so after a few songs, and then at the end, he concludes the whole cd after 2 "commercials"....and not just right away.
