 Not too long ago, I had a nightmare about "The Wendigo" in one of these books. When I read it now, I just have to read it more than once. I do not recommend it for kids who aren't as old as 10 yet. 10+up.  {The Guests is also very good}. These books can possibly keep someone up at night. I AM NOT KIDDING. THEY CAN BE FREAKY.All of the stories are very very much enough to make someone shudder after thinking about what they had just read.{It makes me do that for some of them LIKE The Wendigo}. I DO recommend The Wendigo for camping trips.  Read these books! They rule.
