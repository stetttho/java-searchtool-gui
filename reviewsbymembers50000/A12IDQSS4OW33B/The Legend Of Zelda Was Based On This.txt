 It's no wonder, because this is fantasy at it's best. It has a nice plot to it and great sets and characters. I think I'll always enjoy this movie because I've always enjoyed fantasy. It's a must-have for any fan of fantasy, adventure, Zelda, romance or Tom Cruise fan. This MUST be a classic. Tom Cruise is the perfect guy to rescue his woman from the clutches of The Lord Of Darkness {played by Tim Curry} with the help of some friendly goblins and a fairy. DADDY'S WORKIN' RIGHT NOW! It's an amazing journey full of suspence and....stuff.
