 {Spoilers herein} Watching this certainly doesn't make you want to go camping in Burkittsville {or however that's spelled}. I think it's neat to watch despite what anyone else says. Here's the gig with the movie: 3 filmmakers decide to make a documentary, so they start to ask people around town if they've ever heard of the Blair Witch. Most people say they have, and others indeed say they had an encounter. So, then they decide to go into the woods and check it out....BIG MISTAKE. While they're there, one of them loses the map in the creek and the other two get mad at him for it. During the night scenes, they hear sounds in the woods like footsteps and other creepy noises. Before that, they recall what somebody said about a pile of rocks and that is exactly what they find outside of the tent the next morning...but it wasn't there the night before. That's when they end up staying a lot longer than expected. Soon after that, one of them vanishes and they also find sticks made in the figures of dolls and individual sticks all into one bundle. That's when there's a huge mixup because a whole bunch of other creepy things happen on their stay. Oh, yeah, and the sticks were all covered in blood, too. This is why filming a documentary when all of these things happen is a pretty bad idea.
