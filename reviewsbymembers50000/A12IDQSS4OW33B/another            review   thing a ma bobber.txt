 In this album, you will find that George talks a lot about naughty stuff, and probably some you might not even "get". George grew up in New York if it means anything to you. Preferably, my favorite  material on here is where he acts like a guy in a confessional with Father Rivera, and "Sharing A Swallow". You probably won't find this in stores because of how old it is, but if you ARE lucky enough to find it, or get it from Amazon.com, you will be glad you did, C-3PO!
