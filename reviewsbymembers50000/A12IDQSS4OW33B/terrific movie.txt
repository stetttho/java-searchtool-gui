 Mr. Kline is a great actor in everything he is in and he's in this with Michael Palin and Jamie Lee Curtis. "A Fish Called Wanda" is very good. I can't really think of much to say about this movie, but just that it's cool. That's all I can really say to describe this movie. It is not boring, or anything either. You will be entertained the whole time!
