 THAT WAS ENOUGH. I was actually expecting something out of this movie. I guess I was wrong. The final identity of the killer wasn't very surprising at all because it's not noticed that they are revealed somewhere in the middle of the film. I'm glad some of the people who died, died. {Many of them deserved it anyway}. I can't remember the plot, but it wasn't all that great to me. A few scenes were alright, but overall, this just does not make my day.
