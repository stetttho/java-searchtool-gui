 I just gave this movie 4 stars because I saw it a while ago and don't remember TOO much of it. The Graveyard Shift monster is weird with a lot of rats around. I do  remember there were some rats in it. Didn't they even describe what that thing looked like? It was alright, anyway. {FYI, I don't think the creature was shown, and it had something to do with a sewer}. Altogether, it was a neat Stephen King movie. I am a big fan of Mr. King and I think he has a lot of rad stuff in his movies. When I say "rad", I mean like....strange. Like this movie. I still don't remember too much of it......
