 MORTAL KOMBAT DECEPTION......quite possibly the best video game in MK history. It's overall a major improvement over Deadly Alliance. It's faster, more fun, bloodier, and EVERYTHING ELSE. You can kill your opponent during a fight after knocking them onto a lower level than you started! Whenever I'm NOT however playing it, I just rush to switch on my handy-dandy PS2 and choose to either play CHESS MODE, KOMBAT MODE or PUZZLE MODE. Sometimes when it says, "FINISH HIM/HER!", your opponent kills themselves! IT'S GREAT. THERE PROBABLY HASN'T BEEN A BETTER MK GAME I'VE PLAYED IN A LOOOOONNNNNGGGGG TIME.
