 "MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET" is the closest thing to a christmas classic you will ever see on this planet. I loved it when I saw it. Edmund Gwenn is PERFECT as Santa. In fact, I think this film is a great classic. If you're ever stuck with absolutely NOTHING to do one wintery-like, and a very low temperatured day, and you are inside with no fire goin' in a fireplace, watch this. And to remember something useful for a review like this, read the title of this review a second time. I don't have experience, but I'm sure it works if you love christmas.
