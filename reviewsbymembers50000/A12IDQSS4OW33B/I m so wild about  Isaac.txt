 AND HE'S SO WILD ABOUT ME! This is a good Stephen King movie. The beginning of it is very violent!! The whole movie is also strange, which is cool! If I was to pick any of my favorite Steven King classics, this would be one of them. It is about 2 people who are driving through Nebraska and they come across an apparently dead kid in the road. Everyone else there worships a cornfield and has weird rituals and stuff. They must enjoy killing people because it is part of their mumbo-jumbo religion which is one that you don't see everyday. The ending is also very violent and it has a good plot. I think the end is one of it's best parts! The cornfield death is just a little gory too. This movie is definetely recommended if you like Stephen King's stuff. Peace out.
