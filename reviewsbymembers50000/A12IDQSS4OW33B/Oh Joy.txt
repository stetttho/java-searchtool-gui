 Yes sir, I think I like it. If you're looking for a gross cartoon, look no farther than the Ren and Stimpy show. Characters like Ren Hoek go through many different changes constantly. He can be angry like he always is, and then go insane, no thanks to Stimpy. Things just couldn't get much zanier. The fun begins when characters like George Liquor show up because with people like him and pretty much anyone else that Ren and Stimpy meet, you NEVER know what could happen and how crazy things are going to get. As you might already know, Ren and Stimpy are basically the opposite of each other but still a team. This show is outstanding but very gross. Highly recommended for a good laugh.
