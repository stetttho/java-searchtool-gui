 "Loaded Weapon 1" is basically the same kind of movie as the "Naked Gun" series, only not as funny, making this just a mediocre comedy. Also because I have not seen the "Lethal Weapon"  movies either. I'm not saying this isn't the least bit funny. It was actually pretty funny. Maybe because of Tim Curry's odd cameo. He's got a funny accent and he's eeeeeevil! "Jigsaw" is his name. Sargeant Jack Colt and Sargeant Wes Luger have to stop him from distributing Wilderness Girl Scout cookies that are really cocaine cookies, and he was after a microfilm that had the recipe on it from the 2 cops after they get it. The showdown ends up in the cookie factory. This film also has a very small cast, and that's about it for the whole plot and such. There's not much else that's left to tell. Good day, then.
