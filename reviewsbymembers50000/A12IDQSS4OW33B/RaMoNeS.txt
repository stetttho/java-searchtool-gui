 There are a lot of neat hits on this album that are classic if you like the Ramones. It's  what started punk rock, resulting in the birth of BLINK-182. {I'd just like to know what Elvis Presley would sound like in a band with Buddy Holly}. That's a little different, though. I'm just saying if you like the Ramones, you will probably like this album.
