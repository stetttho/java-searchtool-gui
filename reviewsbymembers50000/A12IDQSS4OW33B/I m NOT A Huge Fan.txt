 This music needs to be a bit "louder." It is mediocre and not that interesting. I would mildly recommend it. I just got this album out of curiousity, anyhow. This cd started out a little cool with the first 3 tracks {which are actually just the ones I usually ever listen to} even if I want to listen to something calm. I can do that with more satisfaction with Enya. Besides, rock music is the majority of what I listen to. This cd is somewhat just too mellow for my taste.
