 This album will take you on a strange and fearsome journey through a graveyard and then a haunted house in a world of spirits full of twisted turns, where nothing is where you'd ever expect. The narrator seems to be the only person you can trust. Actually, he's the only "person" in the album.   The narrator has a creepy, deep voice who is your tour guide through the freaky wonders of the haunted house and the graveyard. He's not Vincent Price, in fact, he's as creepy as Price. The awesome sound effects on this cd are the best you could have for halloween-like times. You never know what's going to happen next. I have had this cd for 2 years, and have loved it ever since. If you do get it, you are "guided" through the following:    In "The Graveyard", You will discover:   1. A gathering storm   2. a vampire mausoleum   3. a witches' coven   4. Procession of the undead   5. Dangerous bridge {with some guy in the background in the rain yelling, "Don't cross the bridge!!" about 5 times} on the way to the haunted house.  Here, the narrator explains about the house and you enter.   Here, you'll discover:   1. A mad, cackling organist 2. A gallery, AKA the chamber of horrors 3. Bats in the belfry 3. {part 2} A snakepit 4. A laboratory 5. the haunted ballroom 6. the dungeons 7. the hounds of hell 8. The room of eternal silence 9. Long fuse and dynamite  The album ends there.    And there are other unknown dangers where you and the narrator experience all kinds of freaky things, and it seems like you really ARE being guided through a haunted house/graveyard, so I'm warning you, DO expect the unexpected. You can find this, or cds like it in any store that has halloween merchandise, because it's excellent to listen to on or around halloween...especially at night for an extra thrill. Highly, highly recomended. Be careful where you dread!
