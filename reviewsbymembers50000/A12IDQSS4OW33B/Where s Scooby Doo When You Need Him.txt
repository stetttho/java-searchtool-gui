 "The Scream Museum" starts with someone already murdered which is the biggest mystery in the book. P.C. Hawke and his partner Mackenzie try to uncover clues in hopes to find out who the murderer is. They ask most of the characters where they were st the time of the murder and in time, they soon believe they have their man just like on an episode of Law and Order or CSI...but  P.C. is mistaken. It's a neat suspenseful mystery novel.  Well....at least it's mystery for ya. I could not put it down.
