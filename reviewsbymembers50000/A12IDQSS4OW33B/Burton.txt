 IF I COULD, I WOULD GIVE THIS MOVIE A LOT MORE THAN 5 STARS."Big Fish" is my favorite movie, and will be until something better comes along.{Doubt it}. I am extremely impressed with this and think that Mr.Burton and I have much in common.I'm going to be a future author, and this movie is the same kind of idea of what I write about in books. Believe me, there is definetely something wrong with somebody if they've ever said they did not like this movie and is not changing their mind. One of my favorite characters is Karl the giant. I agree  with anyone that this movie didn't really have a plot to it, but at the end it seemed as though it sort of did. I guarantee most people will love "Big Fish". I do! {If you don't like this, something's wrong with you}.
