 Even though, I didn't know what to expect from this CD, it was awesome. I was going to get Greatest Bits because it has a lot more on it, but now I have both. It was better than I thought it was gonna be. This is definetely worth checking out with You Might Be A Redneck If.....{a whole concert}. A silly song on here is the "Redneck 12 days of Christmas" {just F.Y.I.}.
