 but I just simply used one of those cool in-store listening station things that are avalible to see if you enjoy the songs BEFORE you buy them.   I only heard about 15 seconds of each song, but it wasn't very good. Even the title of this cd is one of those songs that were the least bit enjoyable. This band's songs don't sound right to me either. It's like they're trying to confuse you in some way. There are better things to listen to if you agree with me. Most heavy metal bands like this one just try to make a bunch of annoying sounds with weird instruments sound like a nice song. Nowadays, the best thing to do if you're not sure if you want to buy a cd because you want to hear it first, then it IS a good thing these in-store listening stations exist.
