 "Funny Farm", is not quite Chevy Chase's best. It certainly not my favorite movie that he stars in, but it has it's moments: A corpse in the garden, a madman for a mailman, a bird outside Andy Farmer's window which always distracts him from typing and a fishing trip gone completely wrong  all in a humerous way. Those are just some samples. When Andy Farmer moves into the country, the 2 movers get very lost on the way, no thanks to a collapsed bridge. His wife also writes a novel about squirrels, and she buys a stuffed squirrel at an antique store which inpired her. {Not to mention everything in the store belonged to the relatives of the woman who owned the place}. The entire movie is in Chevy Chase's silly style, but just not his best. It still had it's moments, though.
