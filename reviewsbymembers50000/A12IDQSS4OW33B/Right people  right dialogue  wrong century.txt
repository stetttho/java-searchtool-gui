 What appears to be the setting of L.A. might be the worse place to do a remake of Romeo and Juliet. I like Leonardo Decaprio, he was not so good in this. Since when did people start talking like Romeo and Juliet in L.A.? THE STORY IS SET IN VERONA, ITALY. It is COMPLETELY different compared to the original. There are fireworks, a pool, electricity, guys dressing up like homos, and a whole bunch of crap that has absolutely NOTHING to do whatsoever with what should be associated with the  deserved setting of movie. In the story, there is a prince and in the movie, HE'S A COP!! The producers just probably wanted to screw everything about Romeo and Juliet and add this century to the story's. Everyone has cars, they carry guns instead of swords, the characters aren't very recognizable, and more isn't needed in this bad remake of what might be a classic in Shakespeare's stuff. Who knew stories like this could have such bad remakes of their adaptions?? It also seemed like a documentary.....  BOTTOM LINE:   Leo's cool, this movie really isn't.
