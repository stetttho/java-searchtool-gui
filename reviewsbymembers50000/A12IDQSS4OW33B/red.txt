 Monty Python's Big Red Book has a lot of material from the show, which makes it a good one. This may not take you that long to read, but I think it'll be worth it. I first read this over my friend's house a few years ago, and I thought it was cool, so I got myself a copy.I'm surprised the spam song is in it with the lumberjack song. It's a nice thing to read right before you go to bed.Look, just read it yourself and see what you think.
