 I SAW THIS ON TV LAST YEAR AND LET ME SAY......ANY VACATION MOVIE WITHOUT CHEVY CHASE IS A VACATION FILM THAT WILL JUST  NEVER BE GOOD. CHEVY CHASE ALONE WITH DAN AYKROYD MADE "NOTHING BUT TROUBLE" FUN.  ANY FILM THAT JUST HAS CLARK W. GRISWOLD'S RELATIVES STRANDED ON AN ISLAND FOR CHRISTMAS IS JUST DUMB. NOT ONCE DURING THE MOVIE IS CLARK EVEN MENTIONED OR IN IT. TAKE MY ADVICE AND DON'T ARGUE WITH ME:      NOT RECOMMENDED!!
