 I don't know if I'd say this is a VERY creepy film like "The Ring" and almost scary, but it certainly is strange, starting with the plot:  Annie Wilson {Cate Blanchett} is a psychic who's "gift" is to see the future, and/or what has recently happened in a certain place, and she reads cards to the local people. When someone she knows  mysteriously  disappears, no one can find her. Sooner or later {after she is found dead}, the ghost of this woman haunts Annie and this "gift" is like something to protect Annie and her family, but in the process, the following situations become somewhat disturbing as the movie goes on because the acting and the cast are very well done. The characters make you have opinions about them. This movie is just so weird it's pretty tough to explain every detail...but then I'd be spoiling it, wouldn't I?
