 Whenever I can go to the grocery store when I don't have this cereal, I get a box and enjoy myself for the weekend! Sweet, crunchy bites of Honey Bunches of Oats are in every bowl! I like to eat a lot of it, but it can get soggy and it isn't long until I only have half a box left. This is one of the very best breakfast foods you can ever have. Lucky Charms are good, but that's only for the marshmellows. Every part of this cereal is edible and tastes great! {Sometimes I even like to eat 3-4 bowls in a row, too, if I feel like it}. One guy who eats this stuff would say something silly like: I don't do drugs and I feel great! I eat a bowl of Oat Bran and I go into the bathroom for 3 and a half hours. I come out, I eat another bowl, I go back into the bathroom for 6 more hours, all I do is eat and crap, I'm gonna live forever! THIS CEREAL IS SO GOOD!
