 I love Tim Burton's stuff and this is music for Beetlejuice.I wasn't too fond of the tv show because the movie is much better with the music.{I still think the guy in the tv on the show should've been on the movie, but it probably wouldn't have fit into the story}.I'm sure all of these songs are in the movie and track 7 surprisingly goes into 8 without going away. {It's the model scene in the movie} and this cd is OK.
