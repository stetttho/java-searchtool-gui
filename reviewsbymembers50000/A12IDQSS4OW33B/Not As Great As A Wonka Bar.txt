 Wonka Donutz are a new Wonka candy that will be featured in "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory." It is a chocolate donut {believe it or not} with a creamy, enjoyable filling and sprinkles on top. These were obviously not featured in the 1971 Willy Wonka movie, even though they are still worth trying once. For Wonka chocolate, it's good. You can even find a golden ticket in this wrapper, and not just in any Wonka bar by themselves. Don't expect to bite into one because I think that's what everyone looks for when they open either one every time, and they're both 59 cents. What a price for chocolate so good!
