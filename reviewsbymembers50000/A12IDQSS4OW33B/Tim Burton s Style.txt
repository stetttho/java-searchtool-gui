 Even though Tim Burton did not write this book, it's almost like he did because it's in the same category as "The Melancholy Death Of Oyster Boy and other stories." Why? Morbid humor. It's that simple. A macabre A-Z book by Edward Gorey is close enough if you ask me. With Edward Gorey's imagination, he seems to have the same kind of dark taste. If you have an interest in morbid things, you should read this. You might like it, not to mention the fact that everybody loves this book, as I do. It's in Tim Burton's dark style, and perfectly fits what it is in the rhyming and the illustrations. "The Gashlycrumb Tinies" is a pretty quirky title to call this book. I wish there were more books like this and "Oyster Boy." I guess this is what Edward Gorey just wanted to call it, and coincidentially, it's seems right.
