 The Big Fish soundtrack goes well with the best movie. I was impressed, but I think that "Dinah" by Bing Crosby is the oldest song on here.It's a neat thing to listen to if you're traveling somewhere far away and you're driving.I usually just listen from track 1-7 because they're the only ones that aren't classical, and thanks to Elvis Presley's  superb existence and the year 1955, we have rock music!
