 I love a movie that has a lot of action. I tried playing a demo of one of the "Lara Croft" video games a couple of years ago, and I wasn't very good at it, so I figured it'd be a lot more cooler to watch instead of playing. WAS I RIGHT. It has adventure with action and fantasy. I guess you  either love or you hate video game adaptions. Everybody on this website hated "Super Mario Brothers" and I liked it, and "The Cat In The Hat." I don't know why. That had the same humor as the Grinch. But that's not a video game originally. It's just something that I liked and everyone else, for no reason that I can think of, hated.   Heeeeerrreee'ss the plot:  The Illuminati is some kind of "group" that Lara Croft {Angelina Jolie} has to stop. In order to do that, she needs to find pieces to the Triangle of Light, which goes back to her father's {Jon Voight, her real-life father} past. He had been missing for quite some time and hadn't been found. She has to go and find them on a dangerous quest. I'm not sure what else to say about the plot. I just found this movie to be pretty entertaining. Lara goes on a big adventure that is worth seeing for the special effects and the action!
