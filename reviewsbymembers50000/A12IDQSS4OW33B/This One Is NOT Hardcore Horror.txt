 Chucky should never be comedy. The jokes aren't funny, and I don't even know if SEED OF CHUCKY is any good because that's what it's turned into already...comedy. I thought that would be cool, but now it's all just gone silly. I used to enjoy this, but I've come to the conclusion that Chucky movies NEED to be horror in order to be good, but....it's changed over the past few years.
