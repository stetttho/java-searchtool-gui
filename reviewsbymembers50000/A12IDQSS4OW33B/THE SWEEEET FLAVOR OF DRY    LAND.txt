 This movie is fun! There is a whole bunch of action! This is an excellent science fiction film! It might make you take land for granted.  Here's what it's about:{spoilers}  The mariner is just a guy{Kevin Costner}. Day in and day out he occasionally does business with nearby atolls if he needs to. In the beginning of the film, he gets dirt from a drifter and goes to an atoll. He tries to leave, but the people there find out he has gills behind one of his ears, so they figure, "okay so this dude is a mutant." That is where the fun action comes in. When he finally gets away from the Deacon{Dennis Hopper}, the mariner takes along 2 people from the atoll with him. From there on, the Deacon goes after him because the little girl he has with him has a tattoo on her back that is the only way to find dryland. No one knows how to read it. It just looks like a yingyang with an arrow going up on it. Although the Deacon tries to capture he little girl who's name is Enola, {Tina Majorino} nobody still knows how to read it. I doubt I should waste time telling you more.   Excellent science fiction film with Kevin Costner.
