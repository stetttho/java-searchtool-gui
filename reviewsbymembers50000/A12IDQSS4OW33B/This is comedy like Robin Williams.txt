 Some of this stuff is from the 70's when George Carlin was young and in 1990, he looked a little bit older like in Scary Movie 3 where he looks like Santa Claus as "the architect". George Carlin is my personal favorite comedian and it's as good as Robin Williams-Live on Broadway.Recently, I heard that nowadays he wants to be taken more seriously.I think he would be very good in something serious. That's just me.
