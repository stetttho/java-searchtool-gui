 and I finally beat it. Some people may think it's impossible to beat. There are easier games, but that's besides the point. The graphics are just like any other PS1 game. There's so many tasks in this game. That is what makes it cool.   The Grinch loses all his blueprints for his gadgets while planning to steal Whoville's christmas. He has to search in 4 environments to obliterate everything to complete several tasks in Whoville, the Whoforest, the dump, and Who Lake. and retrieve these blueprints to create his Rotten Egg Launcher, Slime Gun, Rocket Spring, Octopus-climbing device, Marine Mobile and Grinch Copter. That's the basic object of the whole game. If you complete enough tasks and destroy enough gifts, you can open up 3 "sup-a-dows" which are doors that lead to cool games inside the Grinch's lair up on Mount Crumpit. The first one has a bunch of poles that you swing from to get to the finish line in the limited time. The second one is where you just smash  as many pumpkins as you can and try to beat your time. The third one is where you just fly with the Grinch Copter through rings to the finish line in the limited time. All 3 of them have limited times. Later on, you can take a sleigh ride to stop Santa! I got 100 percent. Games like "Charlie and The Chocolate Factory" for PS2 was much easier and I only beat that in a couple of days. "The Grinch" will take a lot longer, but it's worth playing for the fun of it.
