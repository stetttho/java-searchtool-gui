 You got it folks. The RIPLEY'S BELIEVE IT OR NOT 2005 SPECIAL EDITION book. That's right. There's nothing stranger than the truth when you read this. It's all real. Just like any other "Ripley's" book, there are animals doing amazing things, people with nothing better to do then to decorate of their possessions in a wacky way, people doing things to themselves, and from everything from entertainment to fun to just plain weird, this is a wonderful piece of literature. Also visit the museums! They're not bad at all.
