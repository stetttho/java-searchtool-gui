 ....but experience. "Lord of The Rings" has to be one of the greatest trilogies in movie history. It doesn't matter what certain things are slow/boring and those which aren't, because the rest is the best! That's the action! My least favorite was "Two Towers."    I had this movie on dvd for a while before I watched it, and it was definetely worth it when I did. "Return of The King" has new, and more fantasy elements than before. Nothing is bad about any of the LOTR movies. This is the longest movie out of the 3, also. I know everything has already been said about the entire trilogy, and I really wouldn't be surprised at all if this trilogy became a true classic, and I think it already is.
