 After a bloody battle, General Robert Shaw {Matthew Broaderick} is said to have won the war, and he did nothing in the war, so he's not sure whether or not to be proud or embarrassed. There's a lot of other issues that go on with the Civil War and the general is having trouble having to direct african-american soldiers into war, especially a good friend of his named Thomas.    While based on a true story, this was a decent civil war movie for it's time. Matthew Broaderick is pretty well cast as the general. Morgan Freeman is also in it and his role was cool as a grave digger who also directed the soldiers. "Glory" has an emotional ending, which goes without saying in concluding that it is a masterpiece.   4 and a half stars.
