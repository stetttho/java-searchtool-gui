 This original uncut version of "It's A Wonderful Life" shows the entire story of George Bailey {James Stewart} when he was a child and shows everything in the movie, like about his guardian angel Clarence watching flashbacks of George's life, unlike on tv where it's cut short for commercials. Even more wonderful is that it doesn't miss out on a single detail. This has to be one of the most heartwarming christmas films ever made for being a classic. It explains everything there was to ever explain about the story, and it only becomes more excellent late in the movie when George soon discovers what his life is really about after he sees what it would have been like if he didn't exist. Highly recommended for a christmas movie that is perhaps even more heartwarming than even "Miracle on 34th Street" {1947}. 5 out of 5 stars.
