 So, I suppose there's no way I can tell you if I really love this cd or not. There's a good reason for it. When I pressed play on my cd player I was surprised. It played out of order because the songs were not like they were on the back of the cd case. I gave this 3 stars. Why, you may ask?? There are 2 reasons for THIS. {I wanna start with the 2'nd one first if that's okay with you}.  2. The songs are alright but you might have no idea which one it is on a portable cd player. 1. The bad thing about it is you need a computer to figure out which song is which.   I rest my case. It should be pretty understandable now why I believe it deserves JUST 3 stars. If my copy of this cd is the only one out there that I have had complications with the songs, then in that case, I have been wrongly screwed with in the packaging of the cd. Once you know what the song is, it's up to you whether you like it or not. Some songs are hard to figure out because the bandoesn'tmention the title, and some are easier. It is not the worst cd in my collection. Hands down 3 stars for me. A few songs are better than others and when I first played it, it was like song #16 was like the first song and song number #13 was a totally different song. It is messed up to me. Isn't that hard to figure out? It might not be exactly like that, but it's similar to my explanations. Purchase a copy of the cd and you have yet to see what I mean. 3 stars hand down for me. I really did not have a mind block with this review, huh?
