 "Revenge of The Sith" definetely brings everything together from the other Star Wars movies. I'm wondering why all the negativity towards this movie. I thought it was excellent. It also shows how Anakin Skywalker turned to the dark side of the sith to become what he was in the beginning.....{deep, heavy breathing}...DARTH VADER. It brings everything together and makes it make a lot of sense.    I  noticed that, during the movie, that Ian Mcdarmid plays a very good Darth Sidious. He is a great actor and was also good in other stuff like "Sleepy Hollow."   Overall, I was quite impressed. The first 3 episodes are like prequels for the original trilogy. This movie wraps up the entire series and it all ends brilliantly. This movie AND the series. It is too bad Liam Neeson is only in Episode 1, too.
