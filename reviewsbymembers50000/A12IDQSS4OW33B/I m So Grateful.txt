 Next to Spongebob, "Ed, Edd and Eddy" is the greatest cartoon ever made. That's easily what it is because I have always liked this show no matter what. I never get tired of it. This is, without a doubt, the best show that Cartoon Network ever had. Here are the characters, starting with the Eds:  Ed-The dullest character who usually says stuff like "buttered toast" and "gravy."   Edd AKA Double-D-The most intelligent character. That's what makes him funny and he loves being clean and all that.   Eddy-He's obsessed with money and not very many people like him that much.   Then there's Ed's sister Sarah, who always bosses him around and Jonny 2 by 4 who's best friend is a piece of wood with a face on it called Plank. He's not as dumb as Ed, but I like to believe he is not that smart either because of his friendship with Plank.  The Kanker sisters are also in love with the Eds. Kevin is a boy who is the exact opposite and calls them dorks all the time. Jimmy is a younger, and very sensitive kid who hangs out with Sarah all the time and always gets hurt somehow. Nazz is a girl who gets the Eds nervous for some reason. Rolf is a foreign boy who owns his own animals and works outside all the time. I'm guessing he's from some different country that nobody probably knows about. That's about all I should say.  I love this show!
