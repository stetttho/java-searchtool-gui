 The game begins where Princess Peach entrusts Mario with a map which leads to the location of the Thousand-Year Door. Then, Mario has to go and find Crystal Stars to bring to the door. That's how it starts....  Mario soon ends up in Petal Meadows where he and his friend Goombella see a gigantic dragon flying to a far away castle. From there the long adventure goes on. This is probably the first and only Paper Mario game I've ever played but it's worth it!
