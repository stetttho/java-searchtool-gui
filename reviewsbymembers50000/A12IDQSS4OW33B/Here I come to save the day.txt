  Man On The Moon is about the life of Andy Kaufman trying to become the world's biggest star.Danny Devito is a guy named George who plays Andy's manager who's attempting to help Andy in his success.He first trys to get him on Taxi and Andy refuses, but finally takes the job in spite that he hated sitcoms. It had some good acting and in the beginning, Andy imitates Mighty Mouse and Elvis Presley singing Blue Suede Shoes. The whole movie is indeed strange, and when Andy's in Taxi, it was an episode where cookies or something had drugs in them. It also showed Christopher Lloyd, too {of course}. The movie's just about Andy trying to become a star and the movie gets more serious as it goes on and Andy soon gets lung cancer, but still performs and only wants to wrestle women. When Andy finally tries to wrestle a man, he gets hurt and ends up on the David Letterman show apologizing  for what he had done and gets mad and does something that usually doesn't happen on the show: He turns it into a Jerry Springer-like thing. He yells at the guy he's with, says a few crude words, and throws David's coffee at him. Then he leaves the set. Before that, he was doing another show where he was supposed to play someone getting high, it all goes ballistic, and Andy has to apologize. While he is, people are laughing at him and commercials roll while he's still trying to explain. When Andy's a wrestler, he's talking bad about women and still wants to try to win. {That was the very same time he wrestled a guy and lost}. I think I should keep the rest a secret because I've said enough now}.
