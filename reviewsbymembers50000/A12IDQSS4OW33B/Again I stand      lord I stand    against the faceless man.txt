 My favorite song on this cd would have to be "FACELESS MAN". I just like it. It also has some other songs that are neat if you are a CREED fan. I'm not sure what to say, but......what IS there to even say {or type} about this cd? Every song is cool and.......well, it's Creed at least:                        1. A nice way to start off the album                        2. WHAT IF WHAT IF WHAT IF I....                        3. Sounds like romance to me, bub!                        4. Not bad                        5. READ #4                        6. Again I stand.....                        7. READ #5                        8. This has been on the radio. Cool, huh?                        9. CAN YOU TAKE ME HIGHER?                       10. It's not #6, but average                       11. A better way to end the album             Overall, it deserves four stars because it's not bad, but it's Creed. It's cool and it can feel pretty good. You can possibly learn something if you listen to this, but if you don't happen to fancy this band, that's fine too. I understand. This review has been my opinion. I was hoping "IS THIS THE END" would be on this album, but the music by itself is fine rock music.
