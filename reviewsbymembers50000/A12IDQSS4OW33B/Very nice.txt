 As you can see, YES I AM A MORTAL KOMBAT FAN. I used to obsess over everything that was Mortal Kombat:  1. All the games 2. Both of the movies {I am awaiting the 3'rd movie next year} 3.The Outworld Arena  4. Anything else  I just love how the blood flies everywhere when a guy is punched or killed or uppercutted. I recommend this to any Mortal Kombat fan.
