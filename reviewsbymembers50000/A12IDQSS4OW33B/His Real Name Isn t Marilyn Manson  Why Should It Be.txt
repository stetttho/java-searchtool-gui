 Marilyn Manson is actually a very intelligent man. All of his weirdness is just a gimmick for his music. Besides, the most interesting thing I read about him is that his favorite movie is "Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory."   Now to the album. I almost bought his "Holy Wood" album. I just got this one instead. Thus, my first MM cd. I was sorta surprised. What a fine job he did with this! Very few songs are worth not hearing because this can be your caffeine pill for the day! Havin' trouble finding good shock-rock? You tryin to find something to maybe fit in with your buddies? Well, come on down and check out one of his albums! Yesserie! Hey, if ya act now, you'll get some free freaky pictures of MM himself so, when you're finished with the cd, you can compare and see how opposite it is from an Enya album! Enya might calm you down, and Marilyn Manson will WAKE YOU UP. Gimme a cow to eat! I'll carve off what I want, and ride the rest home.   I'm kiddin' folks. I'm attempting to make this review worth reading, and I hope I have done good for my first Marilyn Manson cd that was worth checking out! At least I told you why he is the way he just is. I guess he has the right to do what he needs to do whatever it is he needs to do. Believe it or not, the title of this album is one of the songs I don't really care for. After all, t's not likely EVERYONE knows what he looks like without his makeup nor has he gone out in public without it on. I very much doubt he would, anyhow. That's his schtick.
