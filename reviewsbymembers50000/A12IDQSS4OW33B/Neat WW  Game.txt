 World War 2 is finally made better than it must have seemed! This earns only 4 and a half stars because of how complicated things get. That's the beauty of this game! It has great graphics, realistic, life-like battle scenes, and violence. Just like that movie Black Hawk Down, but it is different. How, you may ask? Because, this was in Germany. That was only in Africa. The beginning of "Medal Of Honor: Allied Assault" is almost like you're in Africa. *Shrugs*. I don't know. It's Germany anyway, but you won't find Hitler anywhere soon. Maybe he shot his eye out with his  Red Ryder 200-shot Range Model Air Rifle, so you don't have to kill him. Oh well.    Apparently, I had already played another awesome Medal Of Honor game before, when I thought it was this game.....I was right. It doesn't need blood to be a good army game. It just is. The graphics are cool, the battle is cool, the weapons are cool, the projection room you go into to review a mission after you've completed it is cool....  THE WHOLE GAME IS COOL!
