 Oooooookaaaaayyyy.....well, I guess what you see MY personal favorite track on the cd is. I'm not going to exaggerate on this review. Here goes:  I really like Guns N Roses and there are some ROCKIN' songs here. This is highly recommended from me to you if you enjoy metal or this band at all. Any kind of metal, just see if you like this album by listening to it's samples....or...yeah. There's not much else left that I can say in this review. You know? TOTAL MIND BLOCK IN THE MAKING OF THIS REVIEW.
