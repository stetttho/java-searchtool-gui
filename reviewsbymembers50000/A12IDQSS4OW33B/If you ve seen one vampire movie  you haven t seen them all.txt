 IWTV is pretty neat for a vampire movie although there's a trillion other Dracula movies, but none like this ever before! I totally recommend this if you love {or at least enjoy} vampire movies. This movie may be 10 years old, but it's cool.It's one of those movies  you'll have to pay attention to it or you get bored. As it goes on, it gets better. I know. I'd say it's like an "immortality" movie such as Tuck Everlasting. {Totally different plot, no vampires or gore}. {F.Y.I., this film even had some nudity in it, but it doesn't interfere with the rating because there's only 1 scene of it}.
