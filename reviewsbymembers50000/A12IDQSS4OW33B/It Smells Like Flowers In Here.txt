  {Brief spoilers}:  A rosary in Brazil is stolen from a corpse after a bizzare funeral takes place and is sold. That's where the whole plot starts. Next, Patricia Arquette's character begins experiencing cataclymic changes in her life that makes everyone think she is losing her mind. For example, she causes one huge destruction on a subway train while being beaten on her back repeatedly by an unseen force. She also gets bloody holes in her palms. The same thing happens 2 times and she is sent to the hospital 2 times, and a  bunch of other really strange stuff happens that she can't explain. My guess is because she said she isn't religious in this movie. Her character then writes  either latin or aramiac on the wall and, in another scene, shouts that language in a male voice. Every answer leads to another question and her only hope is an exorcism. It seems like another kind of "Exorcist" movie to me. If it sounds good to you, I recommend it. "Stigmata" also has great special effects for the genre. It's sort of a religious/ritualistic/pay-attention-to-the- plot/crime/thriller type of film, and yeah, it is pretty neat. 4 stars=Really good. It was so creepy, it almost even scared me like "The Ring" and I'm hard to scare!   So... you see my point now.
