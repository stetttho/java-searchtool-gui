 You guys are obviously not looking the right places for your review information.  Consumers reports online http://www.consumerreports.org has detailed information about this.  This seat (or others like it) were deemed NOT SAFE when used as a booster (without the 5 point harness) due to the clip that's used to hold the shoulder strap (near the top/slide on the seat).  Apparently the shoulder belt can get jammed in there resulting in slack that can be a MAJOR problem.  The notes below are directly from the Consumer Reports web site.  I would think that any seat that has the same locking shoulder belt locking mechanism would have this same problem,  I wouldn't put my kid in this seat. From Consumer Reports: Some toddler/booster seats have guides that can prevent the safety belt from working properly when the seat is used as a booster. The best choice: The open-loop guide on the Fisher-Price Grow With Me allows the safety belt to slide freely and retract fully so the belt is snug.  Item discontinued but may still be available. Use with care: When threading the shoulder belt through a locking guide (like the Century Breverra Classic's), a parent may inadvertently leave the belt slack. Care is required to ensure a tight fit. Steer clear: On seats like the Cosco High Back Booster, the safety belt can jam in the guide with slack after a child pushes it away. In a crash, the child might not be adequately protected. Not Recommended These models (below) are not recommended as boosters when child's size requires use of shoulder-belt guide.  Seatbelt guide can cause belt to derail or jam, allowing slack, if a child pushes and releases the belt. A safety belt with an automatic locking retractor may minimize problem if used correctly. With this seat (Cosco Adventurer II 02-448) and Cosco High Back Booster, a child can slide under lap belt in a crash: Cosco Adventurer II 02-448 Cosco High Back Booster 02-442 Evenflo Express Comfort Touch 2481183 Graco Cherished CarGo 8480
