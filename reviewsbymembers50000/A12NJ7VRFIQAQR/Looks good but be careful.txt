 This is a good looking seat.  We were especially interested in the cup holder and toy bags.  But, I have two major problems with this seat. You may run into problems if you have two car seats sitting side by side.  We found that the cup holder got into the way.  This would be a much better product of the cup holder/bags could be moved from one side of the seat to another (like the Century Breverra Ascend SE).  I have a minivan (Ford Windstar) with a bench middle seating section.  If you have a van such as the Honda Odyssey (we have one of those too), you can solve your problem by sliding the middle captains seats apart.  My only possible solution in the Windstar was to rearrange the car seats so that the cup faced the outside (not the other seat) which for us, was not acceptable.  We did not want to change the positions of the children. Secondly, Consumer Reports Online http://www.consumerreports.org has given the Cosco high back booster a "not recommended" rating due to the type of shoulder straps used (I've submitted a detailed review of the high back booster here if you want to know more).  Although this seat has a different name, it looks like the High Back Booster to me with add-ons.  Based on what Consumers Reports had to say about that shoulder strap clip design, I'm concerned that this seat may suffer from the same problem although there is no official review of it that I could find.  I'm going to try to stay away from seats that have a shoulder strap clip like this one.   I really hate to not use this seat.  It looks great and seems to fit well.  (...)
