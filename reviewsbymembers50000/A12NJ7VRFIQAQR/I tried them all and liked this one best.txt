 Those of you who have read a lot of these reviews here already know that I have tried a bunch of these seats and logged my reviews.  But, after a lot of research and testing, I ended up using the Evenflo Comfort Touch booster (...).  Now, I know that Consumer Reports online (...) says that ANY seat with the type of shoulder harness set-up that this seat uses is bad (like the Eddie Bauer or Cosco High back).  But, I now believe that it was irresponsible for them to make a blanket statement like that.  I tested the shoulder system on both my Windstar and Odyssey minivans and there was no problem with the shoulder strap binding, no matter how hard I tried to make it bind (and I REALLY tried).  The problem that Consumer Reports saw varies depending on the vehicle apparently. You MUST test booster seats with this shoulder strap system in your car.  Install it with the shoulder straps feeding through the guide (like for an older child).  Then, pull the shoulder strap out and let it go several times.  If it seems to bind in the guide or return slowly, you�d better pick another booster. But, if you have an Odyssey or other car/van that locks the shoulder harness in �kid mode� anyway, I can�t see why the shoulder strap guide system would matter anyway since the belt should NEVER move through the guide.  By the way, the same test FAILED using the Eddie Bauer/Costo High Back seats in my Windstar.  The shoulder belt DID bind just like Consumers Reports said it would.  The Evenflo comfort touch has a ton of padding and a very curved back for sleeping kids (much better than the Century Breverra Ascend from that perspective).  Since it comes with a cup holder that can be placed on either side of the seat, I called Evenflo and ordered a second one (dollar amount) so that I could have one on both sides.  The straps adjust in the front although the system used is a bit strange.  The belt gets tangled sometimes which is a pain.  But, the choice of colors is nice.  Overall, it works well for me plus it has a wider weight range and three belt positions on the back unlike the Century Breverra.  It also adapts to the new LATCH system without any problems.  I tried much more expensive seats.  But, overall this one was the best for a lot of reasons in spite of what Consumer Reports had to say.  But again, read the Consumer Reports comments and see if their concern applies to your situation.  I don�t believe that it applied to mine.  Plus, they recommend a harness system that�s mainly made by a company that stopped making booster seats (Fisher Price).  It�s hard to find a seat that doesn�t use the type of shoulder belt system (or variation of) that they hate so much.  In my opinion, the only other reasonable choice is the Century Breverra (which they liked but I took back � see my review).  Therefore, I feel very confident that the Evenflo seat is a better product overall.  I would imagine that most people buy these seats before their child is ready for the shoulder harness.  But, it really pays to check out how well the seat works under all circumstances. The entire process of finding a seat proved to be very frustrating.  I can�t believe how so many of these seats have some sort of problem.
