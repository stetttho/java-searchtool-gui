 Rudolf Tobias was born in Estonia (in 1873, same year as Rachmaninoff) and he had quite an unfortunate short life (he died in 1918). His vision and ambition in Music was not necessarily shared by others and his Oratorio was  never performed in full during his lifetime and was soon forgotten. Thanks  to the enormous work of Musicologist Vardo Rumessen who has restored after  a considerable work. In some ways his destiny reminds me of the one of  Charles Tomaslinson Griffes who had to copy by hand his "Pleasure-Dome  Of Kubla Khan"  for a performance by the BSO and shortly died after.  But Tobias had himself no chance to see a complete performance during his  lifetime. And it was not until 1989 that the complete version was ever  performed, thanks to Rumessen, the famous Musicologist, and his restoration  work done on the score.  Three choruses are staged for "Des Jonas  Sendung", 150 chorists are used in the main and there is an addition of  children's choir. A female choir is acting as the "Mystic Chorus". The  Orchestra is deployed in full proportion. The Oratorio itself is a very  well balanced between huge, grandiose moments (the Sanctus reminds me of  one movement of Elgar's "The Spirit of England"), intimacy with  parts that could be Chamber Music and fast, muscular transients (like in  the opening bars).  It is sad that such a discovered work, neglected or  even unperformed during their time, reveals to be a major landmark in the  entire Oratorio output and ranks among the best Choral works ever written :  Beethoven Missa Solemnis, Haendel Messiah.  This is also making every  audition of this CD an unforgettable experience.
