 You will find the three works very different in every ways... The Nordgren concerto is according to me the major work on this CD, although the Bergman Concerto is also worth investigating and betrays a strong and diverse  personality who is unfortunately not well represented by the record  industry. If you don't know Nordgren yet, I think it is a good piece to  start with with remote echos from Japan through the static somewhat modal  idiom at some points. All these works although deeply anchored in the 20th  language are accessible. Recorded sound is good (maybe a little dry  however) as usual with BIS
