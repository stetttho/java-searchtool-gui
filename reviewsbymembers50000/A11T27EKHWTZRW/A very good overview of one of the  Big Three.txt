 This is one unusual review of one the "Big Three" of the Russian Avant-Garde Music (the other 2 being Roslavets and Louri)  Mossolov music can appear sometimes distant and somewhat too abstract even by our today's standards. In this CD however you will hear Mossolov on a complete range of mood, not only his avant garde style. By listening to more "easy" pieces you will realise how the real mastery of Mossolov was, the same way an abstract painter shows his complete mastery by painting a classic Still paint like Picasso, Dali or Kandisky have shown... The 4 pieces are a really moving piece, so warm, deep and filled with subtle sorrow... The more famous Newspaper announcement are a real must also.  Once again the Moscow Contemporary Music Ensemble shows not only his complete mastery and command of the 20th century repertoire but also his ubiquitous capacity of making his a very wide range of moods and expression as shown in this music.   Highly recommended!
