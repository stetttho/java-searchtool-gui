 To be franck and straightforward, Nina Tichman can at no moment compete with the complete mastery in such works as the sonata and the variation achieved by David LIVELY on Etcetera (Piano variations, sonata and  fantasy). Her playing seems to lack the necessary tension required by these  works. The two volumes have the merit however to provide a full survey of  Copland piano works, although I have not been able to find interest in them  probably because of the described playing which seems to hesitate between  low tempi and manierism. For an outstanding view of Copland major Piano  works you need to hear David Lively first!
