 This magnificent CD comes from Pro Piano, a small, though very, very clever Label. Their choice of Artists and repertoire in itself is a proof of their commitment and achievement in the classic piano area. This time,  they have recorded the famous pianist Vardo Rumessen, whose research on  Estonian Music has few equivalents in the world of great music, in a superb  repertoire from Composer Heino Eller. This is a very good choice because  the latter although being remarkable, is not very well represented on  record. Heino Eller is considered as the Father of Modern Estonian Music.  Indeed, he has dedicated his long artistic life as training such composers  as Tubin, Prt and Sumera. That is in itself a remarkable achievement!   As early as the twenties, Eller, brought new winds in his music, notably  in his first two quartets (available on old Melodiya LPs), which use  motoric rhythm and polytonality.  The Preludes were composed from the  beginning till almost the end of his composer's life and thus they give you  a hint of his evolution in style, which includes his modernist period.  Eller is starting on the basement of the late Scriabin harmonies to evolve  in a post romantic, and sometimes expressionist style. This results in a  music, which happens to be eruptive at times and quite dissonant but  carefully packed in a sensitive way. The mood of the music is in the end  quite introspective to my mind. Pianist Vardo Rumessen has all the power  required at times in these pieces but also this special sensitivity that  makes these pieces sound like delicate jewels of Music. Another major  piece of Eller on CD is his "Elegie" for Harp and Strings  available in Chandos 8525 or 7039.
