 This record certainly represents a major landmark of the 20th century music as a whole with two different works written at two representative periods of this century (i.e. before & after the war). With these two  masterpieces, we are in a position to appreciate two different periods of  Tubin' output. The second symph. was written before the war while he was  still in Estonia, the sixth was written after the war in 1950, six years  after his forced move to Sweden in 1944. Listnening to the second,  "legendary" is an extraodinary journey in the world of fabulous  tales. It will take you to places where you could imagine meeting gnomes  running outside a deep, black forest. The musical language uses enormous  growing sound waves with dissonant counterpoint. Although it would be  tempting to trace a link between this sympnony and some post-Scriabin  expressionist mood works like early pieces from Ratio, Merikanto or  Roslavets, this work definitely falls apart showing a very personal yet  very mature work for a 32 years old composer. The sixth is a totally  different work. The gloomy atmosphere of the second is replaced by a very  strong violence showing a feeling of despair. No place for relief in this  sympnony, with a last movement showing a post-shostakovich attitude (DSCH  late works) but without the quietness or resignation feelings. At the first  hearing, one might be disappointed with such a harshness and impressive  percussion, but at the second hearing, everything gets clearer. Performance  is outstanding throughout. Once you have listned to these symphonies, try  to imagine a concert performance...
