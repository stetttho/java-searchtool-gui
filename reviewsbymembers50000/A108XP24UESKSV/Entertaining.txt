 Artemis Rothwell is traveling to London for the Season.  While on the road, she reflects on recent rumors: Highwaymen have been plundering carriages along the way, stealing kisses and riches from their lady victims.  Lo and behold, the very same thing happens to Artemis and her step-mother.  A masked Romeo steals a kiss... along with the Rothwell ring.  Artemis is determined to get it back. Artemis' "Romeo" is none other than Brian, Lord Cherrington, who has infiltrated the group of "gentleman" highwaymen in order to get revenge for his brother's death.  When he meets Artemis in town, he instantly recognizes her as the woman of Amazon-stature whose carriage he recently robbed.  In London, Cherrington parades around like a foppish dandy--the very sort of guy that Artemis wants to avoid.  ...But there's more to "Cherry" than she thinks.  Much more. I really enjoyed this book.  Unlike most books, something was always happening.  It was interesting.  It was often exciting.  I just had to laugh when Lord Cherrington kept insisting that she call him "Cherry."  And Artemis was a refreshing heroine--tall, brave... she was a girl who could take care of herself.  Jenna Mindel brings an interesting new plot to the table.  Unfortunately, it did seem a bit unrealistic at times (i.e. Artemis' aptitude w/swords, and some scandalous actions from both characters).  Overall, though, I enjoyed it very much. Before you read, you might want to check out Jenna Mindel's last book, "Miranda's Mistake", in which Artemis is a central character.  I was really hoping she would get her own story.  I'm glad she did.  (Now, I can only hope for Clasby...)
