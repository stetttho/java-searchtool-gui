 Alexander, Duke of Westlake, is a rake of the worst sort. At a party, he could have responded to one of the many tryst notes from his paramours--instead, he rushes off to see his injured nephew. On his way, Alex is attacked by highwaymen.  Shot and near-death, he winds up at the house of Arabella Tichley. She is a gentle, practical sort of girl. She loves her simple life at Mabry Green (a small village), and is described as being serious-minded and managing. Bella (and her family) nurses the duke back to health. And as Westlake's strength starts to return, the book's strengths begin to decline... I won't tell you HOW it happens, but Bella's reputation is utterly ruined, and Westlake is involved. If you know enough about Society, gentleman's honor and ruined women--you can guess what happens next. Bella is forced into an unwanted marriage to save herself from being shunned. I really enjoyed the first 100 pages. Up to that point, I had high hopes for the book. But then I was disappointed. At times, Alex is evasive, domineering and... boring. I was frustrated by the way he kept leaving his new duchess. Westlake's character fluctuated dramatically; therefore, I didn't feel like I really KNEW him. And while I sympathized with Bella, who was supposed to be a pratical, bookish sort of girl, I thought she was lacking in common sense. Prior to her run-in with the duke, she had a suitor who was a complete idiot. Why, oh WHY did she ever want to marry HIM?! Also, I was a bit puzzled by her desire for an annulment. Why would she trade scandal for scandal?  And while I didn't enjoy many parts of the book, I thought the last 5 pages were uplifting.  Also, I would say that Rhonda Woodward has a good feel for the time period--especially considering this is only her second book. With an idea that is less commonplace and more exciting, she DOES have potential.
