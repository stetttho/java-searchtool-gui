 Others have done an adequate job of rehashing the plot, so I won't waste your time.  I will, however, say that I'm giving my opinion as someone who isn't already a Harlan Coben fan. This is my first Harlan Coben book. I enjoyed parts of it, but most of the time, trudging through the book felt like a task.  Coben grabs the reader's attention right away, seizing them at the very first chapter. He ends the first several chapters with little cliffhangers, and it makes you want to go on. And then the story branches. 100 pages later, you don't know any more than you knew when you started.   However, if you don't mind a story that digresses from the main plot (again, and again, and again), then you'll probably enjoy this. I did... to an extent.
