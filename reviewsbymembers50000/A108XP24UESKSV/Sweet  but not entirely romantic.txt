 Miss Alexandra Lytton, a governess, is travelling to a wedding of a former employer.  Along the way, her borrowed carriage is accosted by highwaymen!  After a slight fracas, one of the highwaymen is wounded--and he's only a fifteen-year-old boy!  Frazzled, Alexandra sets out to find the young highwayman's family.  They are a family of 5 children who recently lost their mother.  Alexandra decides to help the children find the uncle they have never met.  Richard Browning prides himself on his well-ordered lifestyle.  He finally gained control of Greengage Manor, and he has a perfect, proper fiance.  When Alexandra shows up on his doorstep with 5 children, his world is turned upside down.  He doesn't care for children and their rambunctious ways, and his fiance (Miss Wingate) is particularly upset by the presence of his nieces and nephews.  Little does he know, a little bit of disorder might be just what he needs...  The strongest point of this book was the colorful characters.  The author fleshes out even the most minor characters.  Actually, the book was less about the romance and more about the children.  The story focuses a lot on Ned, Clarissa, Isobel, Michael and Jennifer, and their struggle to find a place to call home.  Richard's fiance was delightfully despicable.  Unfortunately, Richard's and Alexandra's characters could have used more work, as could their romance.  I was hoping for more interaction between the two of them.    While the slight on the romance might disappoint some readers, I still thought the book was very charming.  It's rare to find such a sweet, innocent story.  If I could give an award for "most improved author", I would give it to Mona Gedney; her last book "Love Affair for Lizzie," was charming and unpredictable.  However, there were times when "Greengage" left something to be desired.  All in all, though, I would recommend it.  It's a little like "Sound of Music" without the music... (...)
