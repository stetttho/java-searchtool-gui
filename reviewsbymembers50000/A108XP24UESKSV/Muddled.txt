 Headstrong Lady Allyson is on a normal shopping trip when, in broad daylight, someone nearly kidnaps her!  She is rescued by a mysterious laborer, who disappears before she even has a chance to thank him.  Though four-and-twenty, Allyson is not without suitors.  Certainly, her eye has no reason to stray to the handsome new footman...  After his daughter's frightful encounter, Allyson's father summons Captain Nathan Thornton (who happens to be the "mysterious laborer").  The earl has a special proposition for Nathan.  He is to assume the role of a footman, and try to sniff out the villain in their midst.  The biggest problem this book suffers from is the fact that it isn't sure what it wants to be.  When Allyson has conversations with a child ghost (yes, GHOST) by the name of Maryvictoria, I was intrigued, but I didn't know where it fit into the plot.  The story of Allyson and Nathan might have been sweet, had it not been interrupted by a mess of other plotlines.  The ghost.  The attempts at mystery and intrigue.  The book had its moments, especially toward the end (for me, it held no interest until about chapter 10).  Overall, though, it ended up being piecemeal--the elements of the story never seemed to fit together.    Overall, I'd give it 2 1/2 stars.  It's not bad, just forgettable.
