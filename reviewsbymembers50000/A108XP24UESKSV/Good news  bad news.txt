 Sebastian, Earl of Chattington, is entranced.  The bad news? The lady in question is not his fiance.  The good news?  The lady in question is just a woman in a painting.  The lady in the portrait is a vision of loveliness, and has been his muse.  Whether she exists in real life or not, he knows he will never meet her. He decides to commision the painter of the mystery portrait, in hopes that he will catch the essence of his fiance.  The painter, however, is actually a "she."  And it was actually a self-portrait.  Which means, of course, he is about to meet the woman of his dreams--in the flesh!  The painter is Cecilia Manners, and painting is her passion.  Intelligent and thoughtful, Cecilia has no idea that Sebastian is in possession of her self-portrait.  And she takes Sebastian's fiance in immediate dislike.  Will mutual attraction lead Cecilia and Sebastian to one another?  The good news?  "A Lady of Talent" has an interesting storyline, and Evelyn Richardson seems to know the period better than most writers.  The bad news?  "A Lady of Talent" is very slowly-paced, takes much concentration, and the dialogue is a bit stilted.  When the characters talk to each other, especially when they're talking about themselves, it hardly seems natural.  It almost sounds like they're giving a speech.  My criticism has nothing to do with the period.  I've read countless Regencies that don't sound as stiff as this.  All in all, I'd give it 2 1/2 stars.  If you can handle the grueling pace, the story is somewhat enjoyable.
