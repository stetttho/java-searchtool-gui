 When Lord Thomas Dashley was in the war with his friend Peter Wendham, Peter would often read aloud his sister's letters.  And through those letters, Lord Thomas became intrigued.  In fact, he decided he wanted to marry Melisande Wendham.   When he goes to meet her, however, Lord Thomas must tell her something else.  He is also indirectly responsible for her brother's death.  Needless to say, Melisande gives him a rather icy reception. In meeting Melisande, Lord Thomas is met with another surprise--Peter Wendham had another sister, a half-sister, who is ten times sweeter and just as beautiful as her elder sister.  Caroline Norcrest is her name, and she can't help but feel sympathy for Lord Thomas... and his cause.  Caroline becomes an "ally" in his quest for Melisande's heart.   I really enjoyed this book, especially the beginning.  It had one of the most promising beginnings (the first 80 pages) that I have ever read.  I really enjoyed the characters.  Caroline is as kind as any romance heroine, and Lord Thomas is a gentleman through and through. However, there were a few things that put a damper on the book.  I felt like I was mucking through all of the war stories... and the romance was almost overshadowed by the "mystery" of the artwork.  In fact, it almost seems like "The Mystery of the Artwork" could've been an alternate title for this book--that subplot almost became the central plot.   Still, I enjoyed the characters and their foibles. I'd give it 3 1/2 stars. I even found myself feeling pity for characters I don't think I was supposed to like.  Poor Bowes...
