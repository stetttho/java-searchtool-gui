 Eliza Lytton is no pampered English miss.  She grew up in Egpyt with her father, who was something of a researcher.  Eliza needs to take her father's documents up north, and to ensure her safety, she hires a bodyguard to accompany her.  When Captain Hawkins takes a job to escort a young lady and her aunt, he doesn't expect the journey to be so harrowing.  Along the way, they encounter elopers, interlopers, Eliza's slimy ex-suitor, and a relentless flirt. In addition to this, their carriage is repeatedly vandalized, and a shocking proposal is made.  The Captain has his work cut out for him--but he finds he wants to protect Eliza.  Not only because she's his employer...  I enjoyed this book.  It certainly isn't "a notch above terrible", as the other reviewer suggested.  I liked this story, and I thought it was a major improvement from Maria Greene's previous novels.  Most importantly, I liked the characters.  Ms. Greene's heroines are sometimes annoying, but I really liked Eliza.  She's a good, rational, thoughtful person.  And Leo Hawkins (our hero) was a nice, serious, upstanding fellow.  They're just two regular people whose feelings for each other steadily grow.   There's adventure and mystery, and plenty of despicable (almost TOO despicable) characters.  It does have a big fault, however.  I think it could've wrapped up more nicely.  Some plots were left semi-hanging, and the ending was a bit rushed.  But, all in all, a good book.
