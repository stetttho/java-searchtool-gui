 Miss Aurelia Trevor had the misfortune of being born of female.  Unless she marries, her beloved Pensevey Park will fall under the care of her dastardly uncle.  Aurelia needs to find a husband--and fast.  Anyone would be better than her uncle and sniveling cousin.  Enter Thomas Lanning.  A cit (and therefore, not classified gentry), he doesn't really have any intention to wed, but he sees something beneficial in what Aurelia is proposing.  He agrees to marry Aurelia, regardless of the fact that they always butt heads.   Throughout the book, Aurelia and Thomas are at odds.  For the longest time, our hero and heroine show no interest in each other, aside from mutual attraction.  At times, they seem to barely tolerate one another.  If you like that in a book, you'd probably like this.  However, the grueling pace kept me from enjoying it.  And the author seemed to veer away from the main plot more than once.  Toward the end, I felt like I was drudging through it.  On the bright side, the author does a good job at creating her characters, and showing their transitions throughout the book.  Overall: 2 1/2 stars.
