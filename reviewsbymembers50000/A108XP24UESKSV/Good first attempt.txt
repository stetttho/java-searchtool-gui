 Captain Nicholas Sidney is a man of honour. So when his crew rescues a young American woman, he feels duty-bound to see her to safety.  Young Julianna Adams has been through ordeal after ordeal. Her fiance recently passed away, she is marooned, and her father is missing (and possibly dead). It's no wonder she is drawn to Nicholas and his kind heart. But will he, and everyone else she encounters, think of her as a wild, rustic American?   I enjoyed Christine Scheel's "A Captain's Castaway." Nicholas was a genuinely good, honourable man, and I could empathize with Julianna in many ways. Still, the characters didn't stand out as much as I would have liked. And the main characters seemed to NOT interact more often than they interacted, which made for some slow pacing at times. Still, there's a bit of adventure, a bit of a mystery, and the ending was very nice (if a bit abrupt). All in all, it's a good first attempt by a new Regency author. 3 1/2 stars.
