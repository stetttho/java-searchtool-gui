 Miss Augusta Oglethorpe, bluestocking and spinster, has just received the surprise of a lifetime.  Her sister just left 3 children on her doorstep!  Augusta knows very little about children, and rarely saw her young nieces and nephews.  She needs to find her sister--AND FAST. She expects to find her sister with Richard, the Marquess of Ardath.  Augusta always thought he was a no-good rogue, and never approved of her sister's beau.  However, Clarissa (her sister) is not with him.  Rather, he has just been jilted by her! Her sister's children seem to adore Richard, who offers his assistance until Clarissa is found.  Together, they try to make the best of the Christmas season with the 3 children.... whose mother may or may not come back. Kate Huntington gives us another charming story, which I can comfortably call one of the best Christmas Regencies I've ever read.  It's sweet, funny, heart-warming and touching.  It's not predictable, and the precocious children are delightful (even the sometimes bratty 4-year-old, Cynthia).  The ending was slightly rushed, but that hardly seemed to matter in light of everything else.  If you only read one book for the holidays, I'd recommend this one.
