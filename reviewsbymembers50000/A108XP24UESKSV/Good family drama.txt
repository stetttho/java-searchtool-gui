 Teacher Lily Robinson is content with her life. Thirty, unwed and unburdened--that's the way she wants her life to be. Suddenly, her best friend meets a tragic end, leaving three orphaned children behind.   Sean Maguire, the childrens' estranged uncle, has now become their guardian. A confirmed bachelor and chronic playboy, Sean is suddenly thrust into the life of a family man. The last thing he needs is a stuffy schoolmarm telling him how to manage things.  Susan Wiggs' novel succeeds in everything it sets out to do. In the beginning, it depresses you. In the middle, it gives a realistic portrayal of children who have lost their parents. And in the end, it warms your heart. Everything wraps up in a perfect bow and leaves you feeling warm and fuzzy inside. I strongly recommend it. 4 1/2 stars.
