 Miles Rutledge, ex-officer in the British army, is heir to his uncle's title and fortune.  Now a marquis, Miles intends to put his uncle's vast land to use.  He wants to help penniless ex-veterans find work. Sarah Iverson lost her husband a year ago.  She and her husband had been working on an archeological dig at a 800-year-old Viking village--that just happens to be on Miles' land! Unfortuntely, the man who could take her dream away from her is the same man with whom she feels a romantic connection.  Even before he arrived, widowed Sarah had dreams about Miles.    Once again, Amanda McCabe delights.  The book is filled with romance, intrigue--and yes, "a touch of magic."  Every single character added to the story in some way.  Only one thing left me highly disappointed.  The secondary romance with Sarah's young sister was often more interesting than the primary one.  Sadly, it was left **totally** unresolved.  I hope we'll learn more about Miss Bellweather in one of McCabe's upcoming novels.
