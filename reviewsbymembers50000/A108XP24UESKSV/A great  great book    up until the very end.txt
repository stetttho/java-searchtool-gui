 When Lizzie Lancaster was 15 years old, she was in love with a man she had known her whole life: Matthew Webster.  When Matthew leaves for war, they have an understanding.  Someday, Lizzie and Matthew will be married. Three years later, Lizzie receives a heart-renching missive from her beau.  Matthew is engaged to another woman--a Miss Teresa Blackwell!  Lizzie is determined to show Matthew she is more worldly than he realizes.  She decides to take matters into her own hands.  With a friend, Lizzie travels to Vienna... where Matthew is. The back of the book fails to mention the OTHER man who becomes a large part of Lizzie Lancaster's life.  Daniel Thoreau, an American, becomes her traveling partner and fast friend.  I enjoyed this book very much.  Every character lent something special to the story.  I especially enjoy books where the heroine is courted by not one, but two (nearly three, in this book) suitors.  It makes the book less predictable.  "An Affair for Lizzie" was definitely unpredictable--and it was flavored with sweeping intrigue. Unpredictable indeed!  I was stunned by the last two chapters.  Actually, "stunned" isn't the appropriate word.  I felt slighted, devastated and heartbroken.  I wish I could have sat down with the writer for a few minutes to tell her to CHANGE THE ENDING!!!  In my opinion, it was incredibly rushed... and Lizzie wasn't with the right guy (I'm not going to say who I think the "right guy" was.  After reading this book, however, I am sure you will agree with me).  It seemed so obvious to me.  *sigh*  Oh well... Had this book ended in an unhurried, APPROPRIATE way, it would have easily gotten 5 stars from me.  It is interesting the whole way through--and it's better than anything I've read from Mona Gedney thus far.  I would recommend it... though bear in mind you might be disappointed.  Why the author went in the direction she did, I have no idea.
