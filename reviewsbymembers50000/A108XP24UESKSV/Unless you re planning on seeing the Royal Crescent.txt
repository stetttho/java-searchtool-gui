 Lord Gaventry is a man on a mission.  He travels to Bath with one goal in mind.  He wants to woo and ruin the authoress of the dreaded novel, "A Rogue's Tale."  That particular book is based on the life of Lord Daventry (with a "D")  And Lord Daventry's romantic exploits, as it happens, are very similar to his own. He believes the authoress's name is Aurelia Kittling... But Gaventry couldn't be more wrong.  Sarah Kittling is the author of the book, not Aurelia.  Sarah is working on revising a sequel to "A Rogue's Tale" when a stranger comes up and kisses her!!  In plain view!  Imagine her surprise when the amorous stranger is actually Lord Gaventry, the man whose roguish reputation inspired her novel! While Gaventry enjoys flirting with Sarah, it's Aurelia he must focus on.  One misunderstanding leads to more misunderstandings... The summary definitely sounds more complicated than it is.  The book (I'm talking about "A Rogue's Revenge", not "A Rogue's Tale") is a lot more stagnant than its synopsis might suggest.  Frankly, I was bored. And I didn't enjoy the characters, especially Lord Gaventry.  I disliked him very much.  He used the "grab-and-kiss" method too many times.  Also, his behavior in the end is nearly unforgiveable. After reading the first chapter, I had a feeling I wouldn't enjoy it.  Gaventry kisses Sarah in public.  Back in Regency times, that would be enough to ruin a girl.  And yet, Sarah keeps coming back for more, and she never seems to suffer any repurcussions for her actions. In short, I wouldn't recommend this one.  Unless you're planning a holiday to Bath, England (which I, conveniently, am), I wouldn't bother with it.
