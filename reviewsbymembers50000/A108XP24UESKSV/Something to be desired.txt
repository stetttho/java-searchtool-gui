 Lord Vincent Yates is a man without a purpose.  He is bored with life, and feels that no one would miss him if he was dead.  To his friends, he is known as a prankster whose sole purpose in life is to seek pleasure. Lord Yates is surprised when he meets Miss Constance Locke, because she is not what he expected from an American girl.  She is wholly opposed to the English aristocracy, and is always willing to share her negative opinions with Lord Yates.  She is smart, sensible, and... engaged. Though some parts of the novel were quite enjoyable, it left me feeling, for the most part, dissatisfied.  I felt extreme sympathy for the hero of the novel, and wasn't quite sure why he was chasing after Constance the entire time.  And I couldn't quite fall in love with a hero whose opinions could be almost entirely changed to suit the fancy of an opinionated American girl.  Constance was a frustrating character.  Sometimes, I wanted to wring her neck and give Lord Yates a hug.  Overall: 2 1/2 stars
