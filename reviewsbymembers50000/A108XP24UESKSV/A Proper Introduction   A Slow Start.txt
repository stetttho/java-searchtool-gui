 Country miss Clara Edwards has no interest in a London season.  She has more practical matters on her mind.  However, a chance encounter with a stranger changes everything.  A small carriage accident introduces her to a very rude fellow--she cannot believe the terrible things he says to her!  The "rude fellow" is Lord Jeremy Carruthers.  After the accident, she sees him again at a country ball.  Though she tries to avoid him, she meets him a second time--and hatches a plan.  Clara decides to go to London, where she will transform herself into a diamond of the first water.  She will become the sort of woman who would attract Lord Jeremy's attention, make him desire her, and then break his heart.  Of course, things don't turn out quite like she planned...  I give this book 2 1/2 stars for many reasons.  First and foremost, the gruueeeeling pace of the novel kept me from enjoying it.  I suppose a more patient reader might enjoy it, because Ms. Locksy (especially for a new writer) has a pretty good handle on the period.  What else didn't I like? The main characters meet in the first chapters, but they don't see each other again until the book is half-way over!  Even then, they rarely converse.  Too many secondary characters (whose personalities were not fleshed-out) took away from the main storyline.  Also, the author went back and forth between Clara's story and Jeremy's story TOO often, which meant you could be dealing with 2 page breaks on a single page.    Lastly, I never really liked Clara, because I couldn't understand why she was so vengeful.  I didn't think her actions were warranted.  Her motivations are never fully explained.  Still, this writer shows promise.  With a condensed story and fewer characters, it could have been exceptional.
