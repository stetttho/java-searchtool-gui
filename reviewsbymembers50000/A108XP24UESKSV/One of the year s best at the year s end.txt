 Handsome Jack Harrow has just become Lord Harrow, a viscount with a wealth of responsibilities.  His first instinct is to hire a new estate manager, as the current one had grown senile. The estate manager's daughter, Olivia Faraday, is less than excited about the viscount's arrival.  Two years ago, she met him during her Season--very briefly.  He represents success and privelege, everything Olivia resents.  She herself is destitute.  Though her sisters seem smitten with the viscount, Olivia thinks he's pompous.  And he thinks Olivia is a prickly gorgon.  But the more they banter with each other, the more they like each other... though neither of them are willing to own up to the unlikely attraction. This book is very, very good.  VERY good. The dialogue crackles with life, and the author managed to breathe a lot of personality into her characters.  There was never a dull moment.  The story is full of wit and charm, and leads up to a wonderful, heart-warming ending.  If you don't smile when you read this, I'll be very surprised.  The characters were very young, but the book is very enjoyable.  I definitely recommend it, especially for the holidays.
