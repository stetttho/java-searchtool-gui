 Lady Sarah Mallory, dubbed "the Welsh beauty" by members of the ton, has high hopes of finding a husband this Season.  Whenever Lord Dunnelly comes near, her body always trembles with anticipation.  Why does he have that sort of effect on her?   After Theo, Viscount Dunnelly, has a brush with death (he was escaping the bedroom of a woman who claimed to be a widow), he decides to change his amorous ways.  He decides to find a wife--but it can't be just anyone.  He wants someone beautiful and exciting, someone who will stimulate him intellectually and passionately.  Does such a paragon exist?  Maybe there is more to shy Sarah than meets the eye?  When I started to read "A Rake's Redemption", there were several young people dancing at a ball.  It was an intriguing, humorous beginning, and I thought an intricate love tangle would emerge.  When one of Sarah's other suitors (appropriately nicknamed "Nasty Ned") came into the picture, I was even more intrigued.  Somewhere before the middle of the novel, the book suddenly lost its steam.  The intriguing secondary characters disappeared.  Nasty Ned didn't come around for at least 100 pages.  Theo fell in love too quickly, and the plot got pretty stagnant.  I was waiting for something interesting to happen, and it never really did.    All in all, "A Rake's Redemption" is a dull novel by a good writer.  Given a good premise, Ms. Carleton can work magic.  This is not one of her best.  It's average at best.  I was just hoping for something better.  After all, the back of the book boasts, "Can He Be Tamed?" (referring to Theo being a rake)  Why, yes he can!  ...After the first 20 pages.
