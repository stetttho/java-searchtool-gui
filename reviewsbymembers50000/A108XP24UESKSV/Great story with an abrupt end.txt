 Marcus Ridley, who will someday be the earl of Fairfax, is handsome, eligible... and a bit vain.  Young ladies are always plotting to trap him into marriage, and his mother is on a neverending mission to find him a wife.  While visiting his mother, he reunites with the childhood friend whom he dubbed "Gnat." That "gnat" is Clarissa Carter, a mere steward's daughter.  As a child, she used to follow Marcus and his brother, acting as their shadow.  She was like an annoying little sister to them.  Now, as a young lady, she's a tomboy of unusual height (And she likes to climb trees!).  Not only is our heroine rambunctious, but she also surprisingly refined--when the situation calls for it.   Clarissa is also in love with Marcus, who continues to see her as the little "Gnat" she used to be.  Even now, she continues to vex him. But poor Marcus is blind to his true feelings. I really enjoyed this story.  It was a bit slow-moving at first, but overall, the pacing was pleasantly relaxed.  Mona Prevel breathes new life into an old concept, giving us a book that is touching, funny & sweet.  I smiled several times, and even had a tear in my eye.  Unfortunately, the ending was very abrupt.  After enjoying the rest of the story so much, I was anticipating an emotional undoing at the novel's end.  But it was resolved in a page and a half. But it's definitely a good book.  In particular, the heroine makes it very worthwhile.
