 Jerome doesn't really know what to do with his 18-year-old sister Willa.  Even if he DID have money to give her a season, her spectacles and red hair aren't exactly in fashion.  When her long-time friend, Sir Daniel, asks her to marry him, Willa almost wants to accept.  But first, she wants to see if he can stimulate any feelings of excitement in her.  She decides to ask him for a kiss!  When she spots Sir Daniel from afar in the garden, she should not have removed her spectacles so soon.  The man she asks to kiss her is actually his younger brother, Alex.  And he kisses her.  Again.  And again.  After experiencing kisses so nice, Willa has second thoughts about marrying Daniel.  And she won't have to, for her aunt asks her to come to London to be her new companion.  I've read some of the best Regencies, and this book is not among them.  The beginning starts off incredibly well.  Willa's first encounter with Alex is hilarious, and their second and third encounters are promising as well.  The book begins a slow descent into boredom (and the characters lose some of their original wit) around the time Willa goes to London.  When their "friends" enter the picture, it becomes a bit jumbled (I would have rather had more focus on Alex and Willa), and the book solidified its fall from my good graces when I was met with 2 chapters about birthing a foal.  Despite its excellent beginning, it quickly lost its steam.  However, Willa and Alex were interesting enough characters to keep me going.  I've read better, but I've read worse.  2 1/2 stars.
