 Three years ago, Emily Clearbrook fell in love with a man.  That man was Jared, now the Earl of Stonebridge.  She was just seventeen at the time, but he left such an impact on her... before he married and ran away with ANOTHER WOMAN.   Now, her domineering brothers are determined to find Emily the perfect husband--she has no say in the matter!  But if that dilemma isn't bad enough, her brothers send her to live with a family friend... and that's where Jared is staying! When Jared sees Emily, old memories come flooding back.  Yes, he was married before.  Yes, he still loves Emily.  Jared has secrets, many secrets.  None of them will stop him from wooing Emily all over again. Well... hmm.  I feel like I should say at least one good thing about this book.  I enjoyed Teresa McCarthy's attempt at humor, mostly in the from of Lord Fennington (Emily's too-determined suitor, a man with an overlarge quizzing glass!) Unfortunately, there is more to dislike than there was to like.  For starters, it took me 2 weeks to read this book.  Normally, I can read books like this in 2-4 days.  It just wasn't interesting enough to hold me for very long.  The characters were bland.  It was far-fetched at times.  The story didn't really do anything for me, and... I just didn't care for it.  It was stagnant for too long. That said, I would recommend that you steer clear of this one.  It's certainly not the greatest of its genre.  In fact, I'll go so far as to suggest another recent release: "The General's Daughter" by Kate Huntington.  That book is as suprising as it is engaging.
