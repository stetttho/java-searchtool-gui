 Lady Victoria Ann Keyes is trapped in a burning building.  She makes a vow to herself: she will marry the man who saves her.  That man is Wynn Ingall, Viscount Ingall (and his dog).  Now, she only needs to convince him of the power of fate.  Will she hand over her diamond key--the key to her heart--to Wynn? The only problem is, Wynn has no desire to marry.  Because of a scandal 6 years ago, he was banished from society.  Now he has a fortune, and he is being hailed as a hero.  He certainly doesn't want to add "Torrie" (lovely, though she is) to the list of females who are begging to be his bride.  A former mistress is desperate to marry him.  A penniless widow is desperate to marry him.  His sister-in-law is eager to marry him off to her prim and proper cousin.  But Wynn doesn't want to take a wife--even though he finds himself growing more and more attracted to Miss Keyes.   Overall, the novel is yet another Metzger delight.  But I've read better Metzger books.  "The Diamond Key" starts with a bang (what could be more exciting than a brush with death?), then loses momentum middle.  Most of the middle consists of Wynn dealing with the other women in his life, and Torrie catching him in compromising situations.  For a period of the book, I was somewhat bored and frustrated.  But the book picks up during the last 100 pages.  You learn to love the characters.  Torrie starts to seems less like a spoiled brat and more like a spirited, feisty woman.  Wynn finally shows his colors as the charitable, caring man that he is.  I loved Homer, Wynn's dog.  (You can always count on Barbara to pen a humorous, heroic mutt).  Even the bumbling villain was worth some laughs.   I would recommend this as yet another light, witty, Metzger read.  (I thought Wynn's struggles with terrible valets were hilarious).  It'll definitely brighten your afternoon.
