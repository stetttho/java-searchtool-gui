 Sebastien Carr, Viscount Langley, is in dire straits.  His father has just demanded that he marry--and he only has two months to find a bride!  So, Sebastian sets out to find an heiress.  A beautiful heiress, at that. While quietly reflecting matters in his garden, a girl falls from the sky--literally.  Jane Rutledge was trying to spy on the viscount from a tree, but she comes crashing down.  Jane is a plain, mousy, sprite of a girl.  And yet... Sebastien finds her intriguing. But plain Jane isn't what he's looking for.  Incidently, he sets out to woo Jane's sister, Penelope--a beautiful girl with a large dowry.  Penelope is very protective of her younger sister and the lack of attention she receives.  In order to impress Penelope, Sebastien decides to befriend Jane.   And then he compromises Jane.  And they are forced into marriage... The book was very nice, engaging, and it always kept my interest.  It moved along at an excellent pace.  Jane was very spirited, humble, and stands up for what she believes in.  Sebastien was a gentleman rogue (only once throughout the course of the novel did he fall from my good graces).  The 3-star rating is mainly due to personal preference.  I'm not a huge fan of marriages of convenience.  Also, I thought Penelope and her beau were slighted.  I would have liked to know more about them. Overall, a very enjoyable read.  And fun, too.  I liked the "lists" that Jane made.
