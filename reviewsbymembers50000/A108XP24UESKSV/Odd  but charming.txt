 Verity Thornrose, like her family before her, has dedicated her life to charity work.  With a nickname like "Mistress Reform", how could she be anything but a spinster do-gooder?  Currently, she invests her time in rescueing less-than-fortunate Irish girls from dire fates.  Her current protege is a girl named Deirdre, who was a terrible habit of running away.    While searching for Deirdre, Verity has a chance encounter with the dastardly Earl of Brathmere, who is as much of a rake as Verity is a saint.  When they part, she doesn't even give him her name.  But the rakish earl is intrigued, and is determined to find her again.  This is a very intersting book, much different from the regular Regency fair.  It has an altogether different style and flair that cannot be explained until you read it yourself.  (I loved the chapter titles).  This book seems to have everything.  Adventure.  Humor.  Duels.  Rescues.  Damsels in Distress.  Villains.  However, the love story of Verity and Alaric (the earl) left something to be desired.  Unlike most heroes, Alaric really IS a rake.  This behavior is somewhat off-putting, but you can't help but admire a guy who is admittedly worst than most.  However, the story of their romance didn't do much for me.  And I didn't care for the ending.  In fact, I much preferred the secondary romance of the Rafe the footman and Deirdre the maid.  Early on, however, it took an unfortunate backseat to Verity and Alaric's story.  This book is still highly recommended by me, especially for someone looking for a book that's charmingly fresh and different.
