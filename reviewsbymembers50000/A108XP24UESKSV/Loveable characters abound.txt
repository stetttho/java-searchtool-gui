 While I didn't read "The Genuine Article", I would like to write a review of "Mad Maria's Daughter," which I give a solid 4-Star rating.  Mad Maria's Daughter is fun, exciting--it's Regency with a twist! Miss Daphne Templeton owes her reputation to her strange mother.  Even though she is prone to a few temper tantrums herself, Daphne certainly doesn't deserve to be labeled as eccentric.  To flee the stigmas of society, Daphne travels to Devon to live with her aunt.  On her way... there is turbulence.  She is nabbed by a masked highwayman (who has earned himself the rep of being the local "Robin Hood").  She loses her ring and a few coins--and demands he escort her home!   Later, Miss Templeton meets Lord Griffin, Gordon.. and can't help but think there's something familar about him.  Is it the voice?  Is it the size of him?  Surely this dashing gentleman couldn't be.. the highwayman?!  Are they one and the same... or does he have a twin?   Of course, I don't want to spoil it for you.  There are many twists and turns in the book, a few laughs, and a whole lot of romance.  The characters are loveable, Daphne has a lot of spunk, and the highwayman is very alluring.  Rhys, a secondary character, also brought a smile to my face. There is even what I'd call a "surprise ending."   I don't know about the second book, but this Patricia Rice book is a keeper!  It would be worth looking into merely for the first 222 pages!
