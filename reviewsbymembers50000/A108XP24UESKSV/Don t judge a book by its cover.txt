 At age twelve, Jacinda Blanchett is betrothed to Andrew Morrow. At the time, Andrew is a mannerless teenager, in love with another girl. Jacinda's fate takes a terrible turn when her father is murdered--and someone is out to murder Jacinda too! Subsequently, she goes into hiding for 8 years.  Since then, Jacinda has been living her life as "Jack," a young boy taking hard jobs. These days, Jacinda's not the delicate little flower she used to be. When circumstances land her in the company of Andrew Morrow (now Captain Morrow) once again, she doesn't know whether to accuse him of her father's murder... or fall in love with him.  "The Captain" is a very enjoyable story. It's full of adventure, especially at the beginning. There's also the murder mystery to solve. Strong and level-headed, Jacinda was a refreshing heroine. I really cared about the characters.  However, when I picked up the book, I was expecting something else. The ship on the cover made me think it was going to be a sweeping epic taking place on a ship. And the back cover boasts "still waters, stormy passions," which made me think it was going to be a little spicier than the average Regency, but that's not the case. "The Captain" is a very chaiste book, with little or no romantic tension for the first two thirds. However, I liked it much, much better for what it was.
