 Twelve-year-old Katy Snow was a bedraggled waif when she arrived at Damon Farr's door. His servants took the silent girl under their wing, and shortly after, Damon went rushing off to war. Duty called.  Six years later, he returns a changed man. His mother's companion is an angelic girl of 18... who he barely remembers from the night his servants took her in. Katy is mute, and her background is a mystery. Even though he knows nothing about her, and she is likely a lowborn female, he finds himself drawn to her.   In my opinion, there are three things that make a good book: good writing, a good premise, and good storytelling. "Lady Silence" has the first two, but lacks the latter. The book starts interestingly enough, but loses momentum quickly. By the middle of the book, I was forcing myself to continue, if only to unlock the truth about Katy's identity.   Still, I'd have to say this is the most interesting of Blair Bancroft's novels. She's my no means my favorite Regency author, but she's not my least favorite either. She's middle of the road--a solid three stars.
