 When Raymond Jeffries visits Shelton-on-Sea, he expects to be utterly bored.  But his boredom is quickly alleviated when he hears of Caroline Sedgewick, a girl who has jilted three men. Raymond remembers meeting Caroline, but... he distinctly remembers that she was a plain sort of female.  Upon meeting her, his interest is piqued by the charming Miss Sedgewick. Because of her propensity to jilt, Miss Sedgewick's name is surrounded by scandal.  Even though she was justified every time, the gossips don't relent.  Caroline is definitely attracted to reserved, gentle Mr. Jeffries.  He sympathizes with her, and seems to understand her better than anyone else.  And the more time Caroline & Raymond spend together, the more they enjoy each other's company. In fact, Mr. Jeffries falls for Miss Sedgewick rather quickly... There was enough going on in the book to keep my interest.  Caroline's determined ex-fiance was interesting.  The dialogue is witty and delightful.  Mr. Jeffries' character is so, SO charming.  He was a wonderful hero.  At times, I thought Caroline Sedgewick was a little too weepy and self-deprecating.  Still, it was good to read about a heroine who wasn't necessarily a diamond of the first water. I enjoyed this novel, and thought it was much better than Joy Reed's last one.  I do recommend it.
