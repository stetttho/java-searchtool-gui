 Maeve Irvine, fledgling artist, travels from America to England to live with her rich aunt.  Maeve herself is rather rich, and decides to keep her fortune a secret.  In her past, she fell victim to a fortune hunter and had her heart broken--now, she has no desire to marry.  Nevertheless, her interest is piqued by Adrian, Duke of Ashton. When Adrian meets Maeve Irvine on the docks, he is intrigued by her, though thinks her behavior borderlines and scandalous.  Then, he finds out Maeve's true identity--she's the cousin of his late wife!  Maeve's aunt think they would make a good match.  Adrian's mother thinks the American girl is an uncouth, unsuitable match for her son.  Adrian's experience with his late wife has also put him off of remarrying, even though his daughter could benefit from a mother.  He is attracted to Maeve, but thinks she might lack moral fiber.  So he decides to keep an eye on her... Generally, this book is about 2 heartbroken people who suffer from a series of misunderstandings. Throughout the novel, Adrian always assumes the worst about Miss Irvine.  I liked the characters, but I sometimes thought the novel was a bit tiresome.  Usually, it takes me about 2 days (3, at the most) to read a book like this.  This book took me six.  That doesn't mean I didn't like it.  I just didn't love it.
