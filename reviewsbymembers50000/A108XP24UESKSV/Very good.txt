 Rosalind Chase is a no-nonsense widow who runs a school for young women.  The prudish schoolmistress has a secret: she's the author of the popular book, "A Lady's Rules."  The book, now the talk of the ton, is a very strict outline of proper decorum.  And Rosalind desperately needs the book to sell... so she can get her no-good brother out of a pinch. All of Rosalind's problems can be traced back to Lord Morley.  Viscount Morley, a poet and notorious rule-breaker, has been a bad influence on Rosalind's younger brother.  Not to mention, it's LORD MORLEY who is hindering the sales of "A Lady's Rule's!" ...But why does she find herself attracted to Lord Morley?  And why does Lord Morley find himself growing fond of a woman who is openly critical of him? "The Rules of Love" is essentially an "opposites attract" book--and it's a very good one.  Rosalind needs Michael (that's Lord Morley's Christian name) to tear down her walls, and Lord Morley needs Rosalind to keep him grounded.  Amanda McCabe does a good job of drawing us into her world and her characters' world.  Another thing I like about Ms. McCabe is the fact that none of her stories are similar.  She brings us something new every time. That said, "Rules of Love" had a few slow moments, and it was generally uneventful.  Still, it's very sweet.  I don't have much to complain about.  I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a light, humorous, feel-good book.
