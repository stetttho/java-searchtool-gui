 The heroine of this tale, Artemis Rose, was thrown out of her estate by her father's family--who were not so accepting of her Gypsy heritage.  Since she was 8, she has lived as a gypsy, learning to read signs and fortunes.  Now she is down on her luck, with a little sister to care for, and no one to care for HER.   That's when she runs into Lord Lindenshire, Orion (or, as she likes to call him: Lord Logic).  He was her childhood friend and rival.  He is just the same as the boy she remembers from her childhood--albeit, a little more handsome.  After having accepted a job as his mother's companion, one misunderstanding leads to another, and everyone mistakes her for Orion's mistress. Artemis was a charming character.  She was a little bit flaky and naive, but she was loveable.  I had a major problem with "Lord Logic", though.  For the first 180 pages, he was such a jerk that... well... he couldn't even redeem himself in my eyes at the end.  He was respectful to everyone BUT the heroine, who he was quite rude to the entire time.  He ordered her around.  He insulted her (he even called her "stupid" in front of many people).  And he had the image complex of a teenage girl.  I couldn't like him. Not to mention, if you hadn't read the author's previous book (as I hadn't) you might been a little bit lost.  Miss Ophelia seemed to be an important character in the last books, but she didn't seemed to be fully fleshed out in this one.  It left me feeling as though I was missing out on some inside joke. -One star is for Artemis.  I really liked her. -The other star is for the book itself, which WAS well-written, even though Orion was so hateful that he made me deduct the other 3.
