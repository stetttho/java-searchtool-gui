 Marcus Redwyck, Earl of Amberley, is completely destitute.  In order to save his family and tenants, he needs to marry an heiress. A friend of the family refers him to Juliana Hutton, a girl who is supposedly very rich and very beautiful.  When Marcus goes to meet Juliana, she has flown the coop.   Marcus then postpones his meeting with Miss Hutton and travels to London, where he meets a beautiful new opera dancer.  She goes by the name of Juliette Lamont, and her beauty is widely renowned.  Juliette is actually Juliana, who intends to go to great lengths to preserve her freedom--even if it means running away from home and pretending to be an opera dancer.  As Juliette, Juliana meets an intriguing man named Lord Dare, who is none other than Marcus himself.  He is in the middle of a masquerade of his own. Of course, this is just the beginning.  Having read the beginning of the novel, I had really high hopes for it.  Up until this point, the plot was really intriguing.  Of course, their mutual ruses eventually unravel... but not before a really racy, inappropriate scene takes place.  After this, I could NOT like Juliana.  She was one of the most deplorable heroines I have ever come across.  Her behavior radiates from scandalous, to cold, to wanton, to bratty, to immature, to ridiculous.  I didn't like anything about her. Poor Marcus spends a good portion of the novel trying to convince her he's not a blackguard.  Well, what about HER bad behavior???  I couldn't figure out why Marcus liked her.  At the end of the novel, I felt really sorry for him.   I'd give this book 1 1/2 stars.  One star just seemed a bit too harsh, for I DID finish the book.  But I wouldn't recommend it.
