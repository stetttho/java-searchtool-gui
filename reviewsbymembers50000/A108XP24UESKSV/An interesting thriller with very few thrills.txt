 Paul Lucas has never had a patient like Craig Cavanaugh. Cool and clever, Craig is a sociopath who wants to believe he's in control. As someone who interviews the criminally insane, it's Paul's job to determine whether Craig is insane... or if love made him do crazy things.  During one of their sessions, Craig starts to recite bits of Paul's personal life. He knows the name of Paul's dead son. He knows the name of Paul's emotionally detached wife. When a murder comes into play, Paul realizes he's in for more than he bargained for. Craig is messing with him.  When I picked up this book, I was expecting something different than what I got. I was expecting something frightening, almost paranormal. But I didn't get the thriller I was expecting. Instead, I got a realistic, insightful look into the makings of a psychotic from an author who is well-versed in the subject matter. The dialogue, in particular, was very good. The conversations between Paul and his patient crackle with life.  However, the few thrills it DID have were often interrupted by Paul's first-person philosophizing. When you're in the heat of the moment, trying to track down a stalker, that last thing you want to read is some metaphor about floorboards. Also, I was hoping for one last big twist, or something to tie everything together nicely in the end. To use a metaphor of my own... I was expecting a bouquet, but I got a rose.  Still, the book in undeniably interesting, and Craig is a compelling character. 3 1/2 stars.
