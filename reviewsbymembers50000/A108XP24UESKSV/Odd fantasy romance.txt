 Wistful Elizabeth Longford, a widow, grew up believing the tales of her grandmother.  Her grandmother used to tell her about the leprechaun residing in her father's estate.  As a little girl, Elizabeth first catches a glimpse of "Shamus," the last surviving leprechaun.  Many years later,  her father wants to cut down the woods where Shamus resides.  In desperation, Elizabeth turns to childhood friend and second cousin, John Blayne (now the earl of Wayneathe), in hopes that he will do something about the situation.  But Wayneathe is not the young man she remembers.  He is now a wicked cad who lives only for feasible pleasures.  He most certainly doesn't believe in fairy tales, and he doesn't want to associate closely with anyone--including his lovely cousin.  If not for the fact that he remembers seeing a leprechaun himself, he would have dismissed her completely...  Did I enjoy this book?  Well... umm... it was strange.  You rarely see fantasy woven into a romance novel, so it definitely scores points for originality.  But was it handled well?  Honestly, I think it took itself a bit too seriously.  If you're a cynic or a realist, you might find yourself rolling your eyes a lot (like I did).  But if you're looking for a little magic, look no further.  This might be the book for you.  It had some interesting elements, but I almost feel like it would've made a better short story.  There were several stagnant parts.  Overall: 3 stars.  Possibly 2 1/2.
