 Theo Winslow is desperately seeking his father's disapproval.  His strange ambition sends him to a brothal, where he seeks to hire a harlot to pretend to be his scandalous fiance.  But Sallie (the woman who runs the whorehouse) is fresh out of options.   ...'Til she turns to Molly Sweet, who works as the cook in Sallie's disreputable house.  Though born a lady, a series of unfortunate events landed Molly in Sallie's employ.  Molly has but one dream: to establish her own inn.  And posing at Theo's mistress would earn her fifty pounds.  With that sum, she'd be well on her way to success.   So, Theo thinks Molly is a prostitute, and Molly plays along with a ruse.  And that's all I'll say about the plot... The characters in this book (secondary AND lead) are great. Molly is a spitfire, saucy little thing.  My heart went out to her.  She is fresh and warm--you just want to embrace her.  Theo was man of many dimensions.  In the prequel to this book (Donnelly's "Proper Conduct") I thought he was quite childish and annoying.  In "A Proper Mistress" he is still a tempermental, boyish, rake-in-training.  But there are so many layers to his character.  Though not quite a gentleman, Theo is certainly not without charm.  And once he is able to shake the hero-worshipping he feels for his brother, Theo turns out to be a great man.   Like Theo, there are many different layers to this novel.  It's funny, it's touching, it's frustrating, it's heart-rending.  It's about love, FAMILY, sacrifice.  It brought a tear to my eye and left me feeling warm and fuzzy inside.  I didn't want to put it down, and I didn't want it to end.  It comes highly recommended by me (and I don't give a 5-star rating to many things).  Thank you, Shannon Donnelly, for a fresh treasure. Note: You DO NOT have to read "Proper Conduct" to enjoy this book.  It certainly stands on its own.
