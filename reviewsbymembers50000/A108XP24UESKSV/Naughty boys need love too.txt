 In "Isabella", we meet our heroine (Isabella, of course) who is a plain girl of six-and-twenty with no hopes of every marrying.  When she travels to London to chaperone her young cousins, it is ISABELLA who is sought after my London's beaux.  In particular, she receives the attentions of two cousins, who could not be more different from one another.  One is Basil Trevelyan, a wily & wicked fortune hunter.  The other is Lord Hartleigh, staid and proper, who is looking for a mama for his young ward. But who will Isabella end up with?  And whose intentions are honourable?  "Isabella" is an exceptional book with lots of surprises and plenty of laughs.  In fact, it was one of the funniest books I have read in a long time.  Both of Isabella's suitors were fascinating (in their own ways).  This book (5 stars) made me an instant fan of Loretta Chase. "The English Witch," the second book in this compliation, features Isabella's rejected suitor from the first novel.  He meets his match in Alexandra, a girl he must rescue from amorous suitors.  I can't really go into great detail without giving anything away, but this book was also a delight.  I'd give it 4 stars.   Overall, this a wonderful 2-in-1 novel that I would recommend to any Regency reader.
