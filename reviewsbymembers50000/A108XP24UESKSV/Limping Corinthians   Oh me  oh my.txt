 It's the last summer before she must take a paid position, and Cordelia Bransford wants to make the most of it. She travels to Lodesham Hall to stay with her cousin, Elaine.  However, Cordelia receives some unexpected news.  Perry, Elaine's husband, has invited three of his friends to fish on his land. And Cordelia is acquainted with all of them.  They called themselves the "Quorn Quartet", and they were terrible pranksters.  Five years ago, one of the four friends, Cedric, almost married Cordelia.  However, she secretly harbored feelings for Lord Matthew Allerton, who seemed to be the least obnoxious of the bunch. When Cordelia sees Matthew again, her old infatuation comes rushing back.  As she begins to spend more time with him, she sees there is more to him than tricks and games.  But is it love? Generally, I enjoy Victoria Hinshaw's novels.  They're always pleasant, and they stories are basically good.  However, they fail to move me in any way.  This book is no exception.  I enjoyed it to an extent... but it wasn't as engaging as it could have been.  I expected more, even from Ms. Hinshaw. So, would I recommend it?  Sure!  It's good, but it's not great.  It's nice for a bit of light reading.
