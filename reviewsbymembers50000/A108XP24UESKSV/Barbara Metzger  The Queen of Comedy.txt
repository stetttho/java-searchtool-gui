 I am a huge fan of Barbara Metzger.  Her books are a delight on every page, and "Miss Lockharte's Letters" is no exception.  I was lucky enough to find a copy of this book: Hopefully, you'll be lucky, too. Rosellen Lockharte thinks she's dying of a fever.  In a moment of delirium, she writes letters to the people who have left impressions on her short life.  Of course... she doesn't die, and the embarrasing letters have already done their damage.  Now, she thinks someone's out to murder her!  Much to her dismay, Lord Stanford (he was the recipient of one of her more hateful letters) comes to her rescue!   The whole book is just a comedy of errors.  It's an absolute riot!  Rosellen has more pluck than any heroine I can remember.  Lord Stanford is dashing, but imperfect (who wants a PERFECT hero?).  The Heatherstone twins (a couple of red-headed cooks) are absolutely hilarious--as is "Buck."  (I don't want to spoil anything for you). Get this book!  I smiled the whole way through, and I laughed out loud!  Let Barbara Metzger treat you to her delightful humor! (For a similar experience, find a copy of "Snowdrops and Scandalbroth" and "The Primrose Path."  Though are also hilarious Metzger novels!)
