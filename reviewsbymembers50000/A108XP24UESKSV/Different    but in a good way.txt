 Cassandra Richards, a rather free-spirited girl, is more than excited when she hears about the ghosts at Royce Castle.  She and her friend, Antoinette Duvall (a Jamaican native) hope that they can reach out to the spirits there.   Lord Royce, Phillip, is her complete opposite.  He's a scholar and a realist, and doesn't have time for all that supernatural nonsense.  But, of course, opposites attract... The real heroes of the story are the ghosts.  Through the course of the novel, we meet humorous spirits, match-making spirits, spirits who pine for lost lovers, and spirits who... DANCE AT BALLS?!  The novel was very light-hearted and fun, but it did get a bit far-fetched at times.  Of course, Amanda McCabe didn't set out to write an informative paranormal piece.  The book reads more like a supernatural satire with a little bit of romance thrown in.  The book wasn't really overflowing with chemistry between the 2 main characters. That was one of my mini-gripes. My other gripe was this: EVERYONE (even the ghosts) received a happy ending in the novel, except for Cassie's friend, Antoinette.  At some point, Antoinette even states, "a love match for me is highly unlikely"... and I was hoping she'd be proven wrong.  She never was.  Antoinette was one of the most refreshing, interesting characters I've read about in a long while.  I agree with what another reviewer stated prior to me: I'd love to see Antoinette in a sequel!  (Though it's highly unlikely) Overall, "A Loving Spirit" is a fun, light read.  It's not perfect, but it is enjoyable.
