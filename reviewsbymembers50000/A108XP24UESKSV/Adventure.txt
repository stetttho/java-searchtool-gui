 Miss Kate Frazer has always been the pinnacle of propriety... until the day her fiance abandons her at the altar.  When Lucius doesn't show up for their wedding, she is furious, and she decides to change her life.  She decides to throw caution to the wind and live for the moment--which is exactly what her disreputable mother would have done.  Kate packs up and heads to London in search of bigger and better things.  Lucius Calfield had his reasons for missing his wedding.  He wants to find Kate and explain his absence, but soon discovers she's flown the coop.  When he meets her in London, Kate already has a male admirer.  Not to mention, she's very different from the meek, sweet girl he used to know.  The new Kate piques his interest... but she's not at all happy to see him.  Lucius (or "Luce," as he's called) will stop at nothing to win her back, once and for all.  The premise of "Miss Frazer's Adventure" sounded very intriguing, and I've liked Debbie Raleigh's books in the past.  It's an enjoyable book, but while I was reading, I felt like something was missing.  I never got a good sense of the characters.  Something about them was almost... annoying after a period of time.  I was starting to get bored with Lucius' constant swooning over the "scent of Kate", and with Kate's constant determination to shun him.  I think the book would've been more enjoyable had there been more developement of Lucius' rival beau (Lord Thorpe).  Overall, it's still a light, enjoyable book that's very easy to read.  It's not Debbie Raleigh's best, but it's certainly passable.
