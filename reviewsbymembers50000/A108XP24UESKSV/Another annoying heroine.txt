 Eric Ramsdell is looking for something to ease the boredom... when he comes across a young woman's diary left in tearoom.  He reads some random entries, and learns a great deal about the widow's (Lenore is her name) feelings.  Intrigued, he leaves his own entry in the diary--he writes her a rather scathing response. Lenore Andrews is tossing and turning over the thought of her missing diary.  If anyone read its contents, it would be scandalous!  When the diary is returned, and she reads the anonymous man's response, she is outraged.  She writes back and gives him a piece of her mind!  So begins their correspondence... At the same time, Lenore is introduced to a man named "Eric Ramsey," a man who is both intriguing and infuriating. What she doesn't know (aside from his real name) is the fact that he's a suspect in her brother's murder. I admit, the premise was fairly interesting.  It was different, and I was interested to know what would happen.  However, it was often dull, and undoubtedly overlong.   Perhaps the thing that spoiled it the most (the same is usually true in all of Maria Greene's novels) was the heroine's illogical behavior.  When she lost her diary the first time, she was so worried about getting it back, lest its scandalous contents be broadcast to the public.  ...When the stranger (aka, Eric) writes back, she decides to leave her diary in the tearoom again.  And again.  And AGAIN.  ...How sensible is that?  Not very.  Not to mention, Lenore seemed to have very little regard for her reputation, and she was very rude to Eric--in her responses AND in person.  I didn't know why he liked her. Also, the author spent way too much time talking about Charlie's (he was a mutual friend of Eric and Lenore) infatuation with a icy twit. It had absolutely nothing to do with the plot. I wouldn't recommend this book.  I've read many books that are much, much better.  This one is barely worthy of two stars.
