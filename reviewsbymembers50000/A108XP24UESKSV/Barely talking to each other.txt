 Shannon Donnelly's latest novel is "Barely Proper" which is filled with characters from her previous novels (including "Proper Mistress" and "Proper Conduct") The heroine of the novel is Sylvain Harwood, the shy, reserved sister from "Proper Conduct."  Sylvain, a gentle spirit, spends her time wandering about the woods, tending to wounded animals. The hero is Terrance Winslow, the trouble-making rogue from Donnelly's two previous novels.  He thinks of Sylvain as his friend, and has known her since she was a little girl.   Terrance, a notorious womanizer, has landed himself in a spot of trouble.  A jealous husband challenges him to a duel... and then winds up dead.  Terrance, now a suspect in a murder case, ends up gravely wounded--and it's Sylvain who tends to him. I was really looking forward to this book, mainly because of sweet Sylvain.  She was always an intriguing secondary character in Donnelly's last novels (and I would recommend both of those).  However, I was a bit disappointed.  I didn't think Sylvain and Terrance interacted enough; therefore, their romance came across as a bit tepid.  Also, their romance was overshadowed by the "murder" plot, which I didn't think was overly intriguing.   But it was still enjoyable, and I'm glad I read it.  And I would recommend "Barely Proper", especially if you've read its predeccesors.
