 Mariel Whitlow travels to London to spend time with her ailing grandmother, the dowager Duchess of Hale.  Mariel, a meek, selfless widow, tells her grandmother about a few chance meetings with an alluring gentleman. Through Mariel's stories, the dowager duchess recognizes the identity of Mariel's mysterious man... and arranges for them to meet. Edward Hadley is a lucky, meddling, charming fellow whose good spirits have made him a popular man.  When Mariel meets him, she's a bit guarded at first (why would he be interested in a widow with a 10-year-old daughter?)... but she is also susceptible to his charm.  Edward is determined to make Mariel his lover before the end of the Season.   The book has its share of twists and secrets, and Mary Blayney offers some good insight into the characters' feelings.  However, I often thought the book was verrrry slowly paced, especially at the beginning. Also, I think I would've benefited from reading the author's previous novels (His Heart's Delight & His Last Lover).  "Pleasure of His Company" is filled with characters from those books. Still, this book is enjoyable, and I really felt like I could empathize with the characters.  Overall, 3 1/2 stars.
