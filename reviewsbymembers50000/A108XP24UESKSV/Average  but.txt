 Miss Sara Whately came from Philadelphia to England with a plan: one that Lord Reath is most definitely not a part of.  When she meets him, he infuriates her.  When she meets him again, he infuriates her.  In fact, all he seems to do is infuriate her... but he also intrigues her.  Her focus, though, is braving London society and getting her hands on a... certain object. Ex-rake Lord Reath (called "Sin" by his friends) has decided to change his ways.  He is determined to right the wrongs in his life... and that includes giving up mistresses and the like.  When he runs into Sara Whately, he is enchanted (and annoyed) by her disinterest in him.  She is a bit uncouth, and has a sharp tongue, but that only makes him want to woo her more. Neither of them realize that Lord Reath may have exactly what she's looking for... This book has a lot of pros and cons.  Had it been the first Regency romance I'd read, I would have enjoyed it immensely.  However, I've read many Regency romances, and this one's a dime a dozen.  It's very archetypal.  The heroine is saucy.  The hero is an ex-rake.  They get into fights.  They go to balls.  They like each other, but they won't admit it.  There's nothing new here.  Still, the beginning and ending were really good.  (The middle was somewhat slow) Most of all, I like the author's unique "out of sequence" style.  She's writing a series based on the love lives of 4 friends, but she's not doing it in chronological order.  Her last book, "Miss Seton's Sonata", takes place AFTER the events of "Miss Whately."  Seperately, neither book shines.  Together, they make an interesting pair.
