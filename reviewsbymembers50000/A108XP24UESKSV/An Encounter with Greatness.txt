 At the age of seventeen, George Frobisher caught a glimpse of his sister's friend... in the nude.  For many years, he has fantasized about her--though he's never met her.  George has an infatuation with an image and a name.   Ten years later, he finally has an opportunity to meet his "Venus."  However, she is not what he expects.  And Olivia Henshaw (aka, Venus) is vexed by George's company. I loved this book.  The characters were well-crafted, the dialogue was great, and the story was touching.  The book captured my heart.  For the first time in a long time, I was very eager to return to the book after I'd put it down.  The story's theme seemed to center around "taking risks."  In a sense, Elizabeth Mansfield took a great risk... you hardly ever see a romance, especially a Regency romance, about an older woman with a younger beau. What a refreshing change!  If anything bothered me about the book (and it's a stretch) it would be the fact that Olivia often seemed over-critical of our well-meaning hero.   There was also a great secondary romance woven into the book.  The secondary romance, about George's crippled friend, was just as compelling as the primary.    I would highly recommend this book.  It was never dull, and I was absorbed by every word.
