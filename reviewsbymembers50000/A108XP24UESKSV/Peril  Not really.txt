 Deborah Woodhurst is tired of being popular simply because she's a twin. She and her sister Diana are very different people, and she wants nothing more than for someone to be able to tell them apart. Unlike her sister, Deborah wants to marry for love, and hopes to find a good-hearted man in her short list of prospects.  Michael Winslow, Duke of Fairfax, is also hoping to find a wife... but not just any wife. He's not going to let his grandmother pick his bride. Michael wants a girl to like him for HIM, not simply because he's a duke. He can't think of a better woman than Deborah Woodhurst. Now, if only he'll be able to tell her apart from her twin sister...  There were things I liked about this novel, but there were also things I didn't like. So I'll break it down into "The Good" and "The Bad."  The Good: As always, Susannah Carleton has a good feel for the Regency period. And she's also very good at characterizations. I liked Michael a lot. It was refreshing to have a beta hero instead of an alpha male. Michael is an average-looking fellow without a lot of experience with women. I get tired of the "grab and kiss" rakish types. Also, Diana Woodhurst was an interesting character. Her snobbishness was amusing. I liked the "good twin, bad twin" aspect of the book.  The Bad?: Susannah Carleton doesn't bring anything new or exciting to the table. Where's the peril? Where's the conflict? If you tire easily, the slow pacing isn't for you. Also, you can always count on Susannah Carleton to set aside an entire chapter for her heroine's exploits to the dressmaker. (That's not a good thing) And... who really wants to read about the upholstries and wall hangings and furnishings all the time?  All in all, "Twin Peril" is a nice story that paints a very realistic portrait of the time period. If you've liked Carleton's previous novels, you'll also like this.
