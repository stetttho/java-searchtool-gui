 Alexander Portman wants no part in his brother's scheme.  Alex's twin brother, Anthony, is the family's heir--even though he's slightly more inclined to bad behavior.  He wants Alexander to pretend to be him while visiting his grandfather's estate.  Alexander wants to decline, but a debt of honor changes his mind. Juliet Moseby has been in love with Alexander since she was a little girl, when he saved her from a neighborhood bully.  Her heart has always been his.  However, she is just somebody's natural daughter; she doesn't even know who her father is.  Because she is in love with Alex, she has always been able to tell one twin from the other.  When Alex claims to be Tony, she sees through the scheme in an instant. For the most part, I enjoyed the book--especially the last third.  The beginning and middle were a bit slow.  The subplot that deals with Juliet finding her father is very interesting, although I saw the "twist" coming from a mile away.  I also enjoyed the ending very much. However, the book seemed to lack something.  I can't put my finger on it, though.  I think Ms. Kirkland could've spent more time developing the romance.  The reader has to assume the characters are in love, rather than see any progression of a relationship.  Also, I don't feel like we got to know Alex well enough, nor do I think he can be called a "perfect scoundrel."  He wasn't really a scoundrel.  He was a nice guy who stole a few kisses and pulled a few childhood pranks (mostly because of his brother).   Overall, I'd give it 3 1/2 stars.  After reading Kirkland's "An Inconvenient Heir" (which was a phenomenal book), I've come to expect more from her.
