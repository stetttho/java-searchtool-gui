 Miss Judith Shelton is desperate. Her uncharitable uncle has not answered her pleas, and she wants a better future for her family. If she marries a rich man, her younger sister will have the opportunity to have a London season. When Viscount Westfall comes to Chesire, she has the notion to get him to marry her... even if that means resorting to desperate measures.     So, Judith throws herself in front of the viscount's carriage, martyring herself for the sake of her family. Her plan works. Westfall invites her into his carriage and asks to see her again.    But there was one thing Judith DIDN'T plan. Another man was with Westfall that day. That man is Peregrine Campion, Westfall's friend and business partner. Peregrine sees through Judith's plan, and they instantly start butting heads. He is a very big hitch in her plan--along with several other little hitches. She keeps coming into contact with Peregrine, who reads her like a book. He gets a glimpse of the real Judith, and she eventually gets a glimpse of Mr. Campion, as a man haunted by his past.    I enjoyed this book very much. How anyone can give it anything less than 5 stars, I have no idea. It's a very sweet story--the best I've read in a long time. This is Louise Bergin's 2nd book, and I think she's THE best new writer out there. She's very intuitive. The way she fleshes out her characters is masterful, and you want to see them succeed. More than once, "Worthy Opponent" reminded me of a Jane Austen book, not only because of the time period. I've read a million Regencies, and they never put me in the mind of Jane Austen. Louise Bergin's way of storytelling is what moved me. The ending was perfect... I only wish it would have been a bit longer.    Highly recommended. (And I'm a tough critic)
