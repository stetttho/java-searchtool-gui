 When Nick receives an invitation to join "Jesus of Nazareth" for dinner, he thinks it's a joke. What else could it be, if not one of his co-workers pulling a prank? Interested, he decides to check it out.   Needless to say, when he finally meets "Jesus," Nick is skeptical. When they launch into a discussion about Christianity and the validity of religion, he slowly opens himself to the possibility: could he really be dining with Jesus?  "Dinner with a Perfect Stranger" is a very short, thought-provoking story. It's definitely worth your time, since it probably wouldn't take long to read it (it's just 100 pages). I thought it was interesting, though not entertaining. It's like "Twelve Angry Men" with a religious twist--there's one scene, one argument, and that's all you get. If you're looking to be entertained, you should probably look elsewhere.  Also, non-Christians might cringe when "Jesus" starts trying to disprove other religions. It even made me a little uneasy. This book won't turn an agnostic into a believer, nor does it make any new revelations. But it won't bore you, either.
