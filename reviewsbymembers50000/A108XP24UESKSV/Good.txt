 Six years ago, Miss Eleanor Milford rejected a suitor... and she never stopped thinking about him.  But she has since moved on with her life, and spends her time running a school for the non-gentry.  Now, she's got another responsibility on the horizon.  She is to guide her silly young cousin, Priscilla, though her Season.   As luck would have it, Eleanor almost immediately runs into the man from her past: Griffin Preston, who is now an earl.  Lord Bromley (that's Griffin) fell in love with Miss Milford all those years ago... and now he's expected to court her cousin!  But spending time with Priscilla is a good cover for spending more time with Miss Milford. Will Griff be able to convince Miss Milford to give him a second chance? There were a lot of good things about this book.  I liked the characters, and there was a nice secondary romance thrown in.  And while Ms. Hinshaw's plot was nothing new, she succeeded in breathing new life into an old premise.  But the book had its slow moments--especially toward the end.  And I was hoping it would wrap up a bit more nicely.  Overall, 3 1/2 stars.  It's a pleasant book.
