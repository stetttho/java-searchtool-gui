 Nigel Manning, Earl of Stratford, is facing a small dilemma.  His younger brother lost a family heirloom, the Manning Mermaid.  According to Nigel's father, the absence of the pendant will evoke a curse on the family.  The pendant is currently in the possession of Emily Winterhaven, who received it as a gift from her grandfather.  She has grown rather attached to the mermaid, and would never part with it.  When she goes to spend Christmas with a friend, Nigel is also there.  She doesn't know who he is (he's the brother of the man who once jilted her!), and she doesn't know he's after her pendant.  As Emily and Nigel grow fond of each other, things start to get complicated.   Other characters add flavor to the story.  Lady Susan and her mother, who are determined to catch Nigel in parson's mousetrap, also join in on the Christmas festivities.  I also enjoyed Nigel's scheming cousin Aubrey.   Overall, the novel was very good.  It had its sweet moments, but it also had its slow moments.  Sometimes, the storyline seemed a bit forced, but it's overall a very pleasant read.  The characters are good, and the ending made me smile.
