 Miss Tabitha Herbert, lover of Gothic novels, has just been asked to catalog books for Lord Latham.  His nickname is the "Black Baron", and he looks like the hero of her daydreams.  Both Lord Latham and Miss Herbert find solace in a library.  She quickly falls in love with the kind-hearted baron, who hardly lives up to his "black" reputation. Lord Latham is immediately drawn to Tabitha.  She is beautiful and sweet, and he enjoys conversing with her.  Soon, he finds himself seeking her opinion on pretty much everything.  As it happens, though, he is betrothed to Lady Susan (a "widget").  And Tabitha herself accepts the offer of the squire's son, Sam Ainsworth (a "clod").  What a mess! I enjoyed this book quite a bit.  As always, Ms. Hendrickson does a superb job of portraying the characters and the time period. Even the secondary characters (i.e. Susan's cousin, Hugh's aunt) lent something to the story.  And what book is complete without a killer swan?   I had one large complaint, though.  The book moved too fast in parts where it could have moved slower, and it moved too slowly in parts that could have been abbreviated.  The beginning and end were unfortunately very short, while the pacing of the middle often creeps.   Still, the likeable characters and sweet, simple story make this a good 3 1/2 star book.  It's a good book for a rainy day.
