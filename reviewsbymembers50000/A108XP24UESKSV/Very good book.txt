 Sir Gerard Montfort just inherited his uncle's baronetcy... but NOT his uncle's fortune.  Gerard was in desperate need of that money.  He needed to pay off his gambling debts, as well as debts to a money lender.  Uncle Nigel always thought his nephew a wastrel, so he willed his blunt to a charitable spinster.  Annette Courtney is just as surprised when she inherits the old man's fortune.  She's suddenly an heiress--and a very popular woman!  Her sole dream, however, is to start a school for a local children.  Miss Courtney loves children.   Needless to say, Miss Courtney's interests are very different from Gerard's.  Gerard will stop at nothing to get back what he believes is rightfully his... even if that means getting the spinster to succumb to his charms. I enjoyed this novel very much.  It was a very sweet book.  More than anything, it was a mature book.  The heroine wasn't a flighty schoolroom miss.  Rather, she was a mature, level-headed, intelligent, kind-hearted person.  I also found myself sympathizing with Gerard.  Despite his actions, he had good intentions.  It was interesting to see their characters develop and grow.   In the future, I'll definitely keep my eye out for Louise Bergin.  Her story brightened by darker days... even if it was a bit slow to start.
