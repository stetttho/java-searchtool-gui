 Alexandra, who was once known by the nickname "Lady Scandal," is surprised when she finds herself thinking about her former lover, Paxten Marsett.  She and her young niece are in France. Unfortunately, they picked a bad time to be there.  Napolean went to war with England, and all English are to be arrested--and that includes herself.  So, she and her niece, Diana, must return to England at once.  Paxten Marsett is also haunted by thoughts of his old fling with Alexandra.  He loved her once, and when their affair ended, she broke his heart.  A wounded man (in more ways than one), Paxten is also fleeing from France... and imagine his surprise when he comes in contact with Alexandra.  His initial reaction is to break her heart like she did his.  But as time wears on, his old flame ignites passion, which may ultimately lead to a second chance at the love they lost.  I was surprised by the extremely positive reviews on this book.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't BAD.  But I've read better, especially from Shannon Donnelly.  I liked how the characters were older, and that they had their flaws.  On the flip side, I couldn't really care about them very much.  A lot of their relationship was very carnal... and it originally began as an extramarital affair.  The book, which fancies itself a sweeping epic, failed to capture me.  There were several times when I thought, "please move along."  On the other hand, it managed to hold my interest, even during its lull periods.  I attribute that to Ms. Donnelly's talent.  I don't think, however, that she'll ever be able to match the charm, originality and wit of "A Proper Mistress."  That was my favorite Donnelly book.  If you haven't read it, give that one a shot.
