 I should start by saying that Martha Kirkland is one of my favorite Regency romance authors.  Her books usually incorporate an engaging blend of humor, romance, adventure and intrigue.  That said, this book does not incorportate any of those things. Miss Olivia Mallory, with her younger sister in tow, travels to London for the first time in 7 years.  While there, Olivia hopes to publish a volume of her deceased cousin's love poetry.  However, she can't publish the poems until she discovers the identity of her cousin's beau.  Olivia's only clue is a single initial: "D" David Crighton is also in town, hoping to figure out who has been pulling disgusting pranks on his uncle.  When his eyes meet Olivia's from across the room, it's nearly love at first sight.  He is determined to find her again... But a series of misunderstandings befall the budding lovers.   Who is "D?"  Well, it's not hard to figure out.  I'd figured out the entire story by the time I reached Chapter 2 or 3.  So yeah, it's very predictable.  The story is slow, and we're introduced to a ton of characters who benefit the story in no way whatsoever.  Even the lead characters seem somewhat... vapid.  On a positive note, the dialogue was good, and I thought the Epilogue was refreshing.
