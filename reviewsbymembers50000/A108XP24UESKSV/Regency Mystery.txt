 Lucas Pargetter, former Naval Captain, is the newly appointed Lord Worthington.  The former rake, who has no interest in his noble title, is determined to uncover the mystery that surrounds the death of Edmund, the previous Lord Worthington.  He befriends a local girl who inevitably ends up helping him unravel the murder plot. For her own reasons, Penelope Lindon is somewhat wary of men.  She is also wary of Lucas (Lord Worthington to her) because of his tarnished reputation.  Penelope was the one who discovered the dead body of the previous Lord Worthington.   Of course, the story is much more in-depth than this.  In fact, the "mystery" plot was rather entertaining.  As a mystery, I'd give it 3 stars.  There were plenty of twists, and Glenda Garland managed to bring some new things to the table.  However, I thought the book was overloaded with characters.  There were a few dialogue sessions where I thought I was reading a watered-down screenplay of Gosford Park.  I lost interest a few times, and I had to re-read a few things. As a romance, this book falls short.  There is little-to-no chemistry between the characters.  Their dialogue has minimal spark.  They had forged a solid friendship, but I don't know if it went much further than that. If you like mysteries, you might want to pick this up.  However... I wouldn't really recommend it to someone who was looking for a good romance.  Overall, 2 1/2 stars.
