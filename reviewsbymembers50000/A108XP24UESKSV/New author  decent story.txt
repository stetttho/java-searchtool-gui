 American heiress Catherine D'Eauville has come to England with one goal in mind: to marry a titled gentleman, preferably an earl.  After all, it is her father's wish.  The first man she comes across is Lord Weyland who, unfortunately, is not on her list.  (Literally, Catherine constantly consults something she refers to as "The List") After all, Lord Weyland is a mere baron... AND he is rich.  For her own reasons, Catherine would prefer to marry a poor English gentleman. Unfortunately, she finds herself attracted to Lord Weyland, who seems agreeable in every way.  And the bookish Weyland is also intrigued by the headstrong American... even though he has no desire to marry.  As Catherine sorts through her many suitors, Lord Weyland offers his advice.  It takes awhile for them to realize that her best match doesn't necessarily meet all of her criteria. The first chapter of the novel is witty and promising... but some parts did fall somewhat flat.  The book had an interesting premise, and it WAS good.  But not great.  Sometimes, Catherine was plucky and humorous.  Other times, she seemed rash and self-centered.  I liked Lord Weyland, but his behavior toward the novel's left me somewhat disappointed.  But there were also things to admire about the novel.  Catherine's plump cousin, Becky, was a refreshing character--I would have liked to see more of her (I felt like she was slighted).  Also, there are a couple of interesting surprises.  Ultimately, I'll be looking forward to seeing more of Laurie Bishop.  She definitely has potential.
