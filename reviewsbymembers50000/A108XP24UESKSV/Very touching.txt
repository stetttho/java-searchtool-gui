 After reading "A Loving Spirit," I was inspired to find another work by this relatively new author.  And I wasn't disappointed. As a young girl, Caroline Aldritch had fancied herself in love.  But the man she married turned out to be a gambler and a wastrel.  When he dies, she is left without a penny to her name... until someone tells her about her husband's last legacy: a gaming hell called "The Golden Feather."  If she could just maintain it for a few years, she would have enough money to keep her younger sister in school--and perhaps give her the come-out she deserves.   Justin, the younger son of an earl, is a bit of a troublemaker.  He fought 2 duels in the last month, and has become quite the hellion in his father's eyes.  Perhaps a commission in India would straighten him out? 4 years later, Justin is Lord Lyndon, and Caroline Aldritch is "Miss Archer."  But she won't have to pose as the masked gaming house keeper for much longer, because she's set to sell the place.  Before she sells, Lord Lyndon and his younger brother, Harry, visit the Golden Feather.  After two brief meetings, Justin (now a straight-arrow) is intrigued by the masked woman.  ...But he won't see her again, of course. Oh, but they DO meet again.  Justin has no idea that the beautiful widow Mrs. Aldritch and Miss Archer are one and the same.  If the truth ever DID come out, Caroline and Phoebe (her young sister) would be ruined.  So why does she find herself increasingly attracted to the handsome earl? There are many parts of the book that kept me smiling.  There was even a part of the book when I said "oh my God!" out loud.  It's very entertaining, sweet, and easy to read.  A real delight!  Bravo, Amanda McCabe!
