 Natalie Whitaker is a spinster living under the thumb of her snotty brother.  She doesn't expect much out of life, and nothing exciting ever happens to her... until she meets Lord Malcolm. Malcolm Chase, second son of a duke, wants to make Natalie (and he just met her!) his daughter's new governess.  At first, Natalie thinks Malcolm is crazy and impulsive.  But then she seriously starts to consider his offer.  But it's not probable for an unmarried lady to live under the same roof as a widower. The solution?: Malcolm wants to marry Miss Whitaker.  After all, Natalie gets along so well with his motherless daughter. But Natalie Whitaker will only marry for love.  Unfortunatly, Malcolm doesn't believe in love.  ...Or will he? Diane Farr gives us an extremely well-written, heart-warming romance, complete with a charming hero and heroine.  The novel goes by very quickly.  Even so... I often found myself wishing something, err... more exciting... would happen.  Still, the novel is thoroughly enjoyable.  I, for one, enjoyed the small, clever plot twists at the novel's end.  But I'm not sure Natalie's brother is worthy of his own novel.  His character was a bit weak.
