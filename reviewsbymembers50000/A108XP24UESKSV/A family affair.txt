 On the eve of her father's marriage to a 2nd wife, Lady Caroline Carlington rides into London with some very important news.  She has lived in a country cottage for most of her life, and has a strong aversion for city life.  When she meets her father's intended, they don't get along. When she meets her father's intended's BROTHER, it's a different story.  Anthony Norville, Viscount Frayne, is everything Caroline wants to avoid.  In an attempt to put their first scandalous meeting behind them, Anthony and Caroline spend more time together, and their attraction slowly builds. In my opinion, however, the real "stars" of the story are Marcus (Caroline's father) and Jen (Marcus' new wife).  What starts as a marriage of convenience becomes more than they expected.  As a whole, I really enjoyed their story. Still, I felt like this novel was lacking something.  The pacing, especially at the beginning, was excruiatingly slow.  I had to MAKE myself read.  However, it did get better over time.  I'd give it 2 1/2 stars.
