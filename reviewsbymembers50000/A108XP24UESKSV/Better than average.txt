 Miss Sara Cobb is on her way to Cornwall to become a governess--little does she know what awaits her.  During her travels, she meets a handsome stranger who cryptically warns her of strange goings-on in her employer's home. Even if governesses WEREN'T disappearing at Tregallion House, she would have enough to contend with, including a bratty charge, a stern mistress, and a handsy Sir Kenneth.  Grenville Martyn tried to warn Sara of the seedy business going on at her new employer's abode.  For some odd reason (maybe the fact that he has a past history with the master of Tregallion?) he deigns to keep an eye on her. Even more odd, he finds himself attracted to the prim little governess...  It's almost impossible to describe the plot without revealing anything crucial. A hint of mystery is always looming.  There were a lot of things I liked about the book, and a lot of things I didn't.  I never truly felt like I got to know Gren's character, and what I did know of him, I didn't always like. The book seemed the drag in parts, and was a bit melodramatic.  However, I did enjoy the mystery aspects. And I enjoyed the unexpected secondary romance, even though it wasn't key to the plot.  Plus, it was refreshing to have a hero who wasn't a rich, titled gentleman.  With Nancy Butler, you really can't go wrong.  She'll always be one of my favorite Regency writers, even if she hasn't been up to her usual standards.  I enjoyed "Kindness of a Rogue", but it's not one of her best.
