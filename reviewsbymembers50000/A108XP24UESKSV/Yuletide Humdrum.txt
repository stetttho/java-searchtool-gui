 On her way to visit her mama's old nurse, Camilla Twainsbury shares a coach with an alluring stranger.  But shy, proper Miss Twainsbury doesn't give him much notice.  Having parted with the stranger at an inn, she trudges off to Nanny Mallow's house--in a snowstorm. When she finds Nanny Mallow, the old woman has taken a nasty fall from her bed (and has been laying on the ground for 2 days!).  Camilla goes to get help.  Before she makes it, she passes out in the snow... and is rescued by the stranger from before, Sir Philip. Camilla and Nanny Mallow end up staying at Sir Philip's domicile for quite awhile.  Sir Philip, a published writer, gets Camilla's advice on his fiction novel.  Lady LaCorte, his widowed sister-in-law, is bitter about Camilla's presense.  There are other characters abounds, such as the dashing Dr. March, and Sir Philip's three neices.   "A Yuletide Treasure" DID have its moments.  For instance, I enjoyed the snowball fight that took place, and I really liked a few of the characters.  However, most of the book was pretty slow and grueling.  A lot of the dialogue didn't seem to add anything to the story.  I didn't really like the ending.  Not only was it depressing, but there was also a BIG surprise that no one seemed too shocked about.  And there were too many loose ends.  (For instance, what about Tinarose's crush on the doctor?).  Overall, I'd give it 2 1/2 stars.  It wasn't bad.  It wasn't good.
