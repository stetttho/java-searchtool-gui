 Brothers Max and Tristram Darby are facing a huge dilemma: unless they marry heiresses, their father could wind up in debtor's prison.  Both brothers journey to London in hopes of finding a rich bride.   However, Max is also facing a smaller dilemma.  He just lost his racehorse, Thunderlight, to an Irish horse breeder (who happens to be his next door neighbor!)  Then he meets the neighbor's daughter, Kate O'Connor, who is penniless but carefree. As they spend more time together, his affections for her start to build.  Unfortunately, there's the prospect of marrying a rich girl always dangling over his head.   Tristram Darby, Max's brother, is also a central character of the book.  He's the focus of a lukewarm secondary romance, which left me pretty disappointed.  Even in Ms. Parks' previous novel ("To Marry an Heiress"), romantical Tristram was my favorite brother.  In my opinion, he got slighted. In the end, the brothers' behavior started to niggle me.  For the longest time, Max insists on marrying an heiress, despite his feelings for Kate.  Tristram's willingness to "step aside" was unnerving (I can't say any more than that--I don't want to spoil it for you).  The beginning of the novel was so unique and engaging, I was really hoping for something better.  Especially for Tristram. I would recommend it, though, especially if you've read "To Marry an Heiress", a book about the first Darby brother's search for a wife.
