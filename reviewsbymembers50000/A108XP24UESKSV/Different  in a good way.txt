 John Caldwell, now a professor at Cambridge, is a man of humble beginnings.  He grew up in Cheapside, and he has little tolerance for London gentry.  When he meets Eleanor Whitcombe ("Lady" Whitcombe, a widow), he expects her to radiant and uppity. However, she is not what he expected.  She aloof, not flashy, and overprotective of her son.  Professor Caldwell is intrigued.  The more he gets to know her, the more he wants to unravel her mystery.  Why would any lady of society choose to tuck herself away in a small town?  Wherever Eleanor goes, her scandalous past seems to follow her.  She made bad judgements in the past, and she desperately seeks a new beginning.  Her long-time friend, Lord De Vaux, introduces her to Professor Caldwell, whose endless questions are sometimes infuriating.  Lady Whitcombe didn't want to let any man into her life... but Mr. Caldwell makes it difficult.  Bottom line?  Catherine Blair delivers another enjoyable story. It is bold and romantic, and very easy to read.  While the characters were not always loveable (they have their faults--especially Eleanor), you find yourself rooting for them in the end. As Caldwell unravels the mystery, so does the reader.  There are little surprises the whole way through.  Overall, very enjoyable!
