 Arabella Swann is the daughter of an extremely wealthy cit... which makes her a very rich heiress.  She is looking forward to her time in London, where she anticipates being courted by a nice gentleman.  However, she refuses to marry a man who is after her fortune.  She will only marry for love. ...Which is why the Duke of St. Fell is NOT suitable.  He is a rake and a cad, and he says the most ridiculous things!  As soon as he meets her, he says he loves her--and he doesn't deny the fact that he's a fortune hunter!  While she admits she's infatuated with St. Fell, she would never fall in love such a vain, self-important man.  Although he does make things interesting... The plot thickens when Arabella is courted by another suitor, the poetic Lord Stonebridge. There are many things I enjoyed about this book.  St. Fell was one of the funnest heroes in a long time.  Every time he opened his mouth, he lit up the page.  The book crackles with wit, and it's hard to read it without a smile. However, there were a few things that were irksome.  Sometimes, the text seemed like it was all over the place.  The book seems like it could have benefited from a little extra editing, unless the author meant for it to read like a stream of conciousness.  Also, there were several times when I thought, "that doesn't seem 100% realistic."  It seemed a bit tongue in cheek (but not necessarily in a bad way).  Lastly, the last chapter went on too long.  It didn't seem necessary. Nevertheless, this is one of the cutest, funniest books I've read in a long time.  I do recommend it.
