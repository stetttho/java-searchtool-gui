 Thirty-four and single, Jessica Monroe is comfortable with her life. She doesn't need a man to define her. When her friends sign her up for an internet dating site, she rejects the idea at first.  And maybe she would have rejected the idea FOREVER! After several bad dates, will Jessica ever find a man to spend her life with?  I have to admit, I was charmed by the first 80 pages. I liked the witty dialogue, and the endless bad dates were certainly entertaining. It reminded me of "Alfie" from a woman's perspective. After the first hundred pages or so... it got old. A real love interest doesn't emerge for a VERY long time, and the book is more about Jessica spending time with her friends & family. For a book that touts itself as a romantic comedy, it had very little romance.  Not to mention, Jessica's attitude started to niggle me after awhile. She'd meet a guy for a date, decide he was too short, and ditch him on the spot. When SHE gets dumped, Jessica (hypocrite that she is) criticizes the guy for judging her based on appearance! If I had a dollar for every time she didn't give a guy a chance based on his looks, I would've been really rich by the novel's end.   In a chic lit novel, you've got to like the characters. In this book, I didn't.
