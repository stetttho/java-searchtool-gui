 Lydia Grenville recently had her first Season in London... and she was most decidedly a failure. Never mind the fact that she had a few proposals here and there. She did not accomplish what she set out to do: capture a titled husband.  The bookish Duke of Winterbourne only recently acquired his title. While strolling along his castle grounds, his comes across Lydia, sketching in the woods. He introduces herself as "Alexander", and she assumes he is the new duke's secretary. And a secretary is no match for a lady such as herself.  Eventually, his real identity is revealed. And Lydia knows exactly what she wants.  "The Winter Duke" is a very enjoyable book. Regency readers will like the traditional plot elements and sweetness, despite the lack of action. While not as strong as Louise Bergin's previous books, it is still an enjoyable read. 4 *'s
