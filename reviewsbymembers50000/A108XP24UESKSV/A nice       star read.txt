 Alex Herbert (the latest hero in Ms. Hendrickson's Herbert family series), a recent graduate from Cambridge, wants to get out and see some of the world before he finds his life's work.  The son of a rector, he was always expected to become a rector himself, or perhaps to manage his own land. When he goes to meet his great-uncle, the Earl of Stanwell, Alex has a chance encounter with Emma Lawrence, an outspoken (but beautiful) young woman.  When Alex meets Emma, she is resisting the advances of her Cousin Claude (who seems very determined to marry her).  While she initially rejects Alex's kindness, she has to be appreciative--he always seems to be there when she gets herself into a scrape! As circumstances would have it, Emma and Alex end up travelling together.  As things progress, her somewhat odd behavior earns her the reputation of a madcap.  Even so, Emma is a wealthy heiress.  Socially speaking, Alex is no match for Emma.  But as their feelings start to grow, will love triumph?  For the most part, I enjoyed this book.  It's uneventful, but realistic.  It's simple, but pleasant.  It moves along at a steady (sometimes slow) pace that is appropriate for the period.  While I can understand why some readers might get bored, I did enjoy it.  It's nothing special or new, but it is still likeable.
