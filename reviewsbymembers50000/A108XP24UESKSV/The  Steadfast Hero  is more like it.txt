 Charles Kirk, a viscount's second son, was sent home from war because of a terrible shoulder injury.  His physical pain is nothing compared to his emotional pain--Charles is a man haunted by his past.  Upon returning home, his brother gives him an estate to manage. While travelling there, Charles rescues a girl from two mysterious pursuers! That girl is Serena Fairchild, the season's Incomparable.  Her kidnappers have held her for four days, and they're still hot on her trail.  Charles is her knight in shining armor.  He stays with her, helping her to avert her captors.  Basically, it's a typical damsel in distress story... with some twists.  There are disguises, strange hiding places, plenty of adventures, and a very deadly adversary.  Serena and Charles both express their uninterest in love and marriage--and slowly change their minds.  I definitely liked both characters.  Serena had a lot of spunk, and Charles was a kind, noble man. The book is very fun and engaging.  It has humor, peril, adventure, romance... However, I thought there were some parts of the book that dragged.  Certain scenes could have been shortened.  That is my only complaint.   Don't miss this book.  It has everything. Also, I challenge you to find the relatively BIG typo in the last 50 pages.
