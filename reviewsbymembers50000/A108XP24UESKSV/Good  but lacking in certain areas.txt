 Penelope Harwood has spent six years putting up walls around her emotions.  After having been jilted by a lover in her youth, she has resigned herself to the role of dutiful daughter, protective sister & spinster.  She always knows what's best for her younger sisters--much to their dismay.  She certainly doesn't want to see Celia, her flightier sister, with one of the rascal Winslow brothers.   Lord Nevin, a half-gyspy upstart, travels to Harwood in hopes of putting aside the bad blood between his family and the Harwoods.  He comes with a business proposition--one that surely won't fail.  (The Harwood father has a knack for picking bad business ventures).  Nevin and his cousin, Bryn Dawes (who always quotes poetry), find themselves caught up in the lives of the Harwood sisters.   Many elements of this book made it quite enjoyable.  Nevin was very alluring.  He was a quiet, handsome, renegade type.  The secondary characters were very well-developed, and I was just as intrigued by them as I was the leads.  There were several twists in the novel, which made it enjoyable the whole way through.  Bryn was an endearing character as well, and provided the means for an interesting secondary romance. Some aspects of the novel left me a little crabby, however.  Celia seemed a bit silly for her age (my age as well), and her ongoing relationship with Theo Winslow was rather annoying.  At times, Penelope seemed a bit TOO cold and TOO reserved.  I really wanted her to open up (which she finally did--5 pages until the novel's end!)  Also, the book seemed to be a bit longer than necessary.   But don't get me wrong, it is good.  More than likely, you'll enjoy it the whole way through.  Shannon Donnelly should be commended on a solid effort.  One can only hope the youngest sister, Sylvain (the shy, animal lover) will be featured in her own romantic tale!
