 This review is based on the first book, "Miss Drew Plays her Hand."  I also enjoyed "Miss Grimsley", though it was more light-hearted and not as mature as "Mrs. Drew." Roxanna Drew was very much in love with her husband, Anthony, who passed away 9 months ago.  She is still in mourning when her brother-in-law comes around with an offer to make her his mistress.  Young widow Roxanna is poor and has two young daughters.  Instead of accepting such a dubious offer, she rents the dower house on Lord Winn's estate. Lord Winn, Fletcher Rand, ex-army colonel, is plagued by scandal.  Polite society no longer accepts him: he is divorced.  Just before Christmas, he travels to Moreland--and is surprised to see a young widow and her two daughters living there.  Lord Winn fits in almost immediately.  He is delighted by the company of Roxanna and her two little girls.   But fate has dealt them both a difficult hand.  Throughout the course of the novel, Carla Kelly makes us laugh and pulls at our heartstrings--in the way only SHE can!  It's sweet, it's touching, it's poignant, it's mature...  Mrs. Drew is truly a magificent, moving tale! This two-in-one re-release of 2 previous Kelly novels would be an excellent addition to your shelves!
