 First of all, let me start off by saying this: DO NOT read the synopsis on the back of the book.  It is totally misleading.  After reading it, I was expecting an entirely different story. Miss Amabel Armstrong's brutal uncle plans to marry her off to the highest bidder.  And while her uncle may be cruel, she does intend to follow his wishes.  But Amabel is uncharacteristically beautiful, and as soon as she is given a Season, she is hounded by a flock of besotted suitors.  Throughout the course of the novel, several of them kidnap her! Max, Earl of Maxbridge, has been in the snares of a fortune hunter before.  He is convinced that Amy (lovely, though she is) is a fortune hunter. And Max's nephew is smitten by Amy.  So why does he find HIMSELF under the spell of the beautiful girl? For the most part, the novel consisted of a whole lot of nothing.  There were too many idle moments, during which there were discussions about politics and character introductions that did nothing to move along the main plot.  Unfortunately, I couldn't stand Amabel.  I can't quite tolerate heroines who make comments like "my beauty is a curse" and dissolve into tears every other chapter.  However, if you can make it past the first 120 pages, the novel does have its wittier moments.  Overall, I'd only give it 2 1/2 stars.  If you have patience, you'll probably enjoy it.
