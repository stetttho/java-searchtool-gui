 Widowed Nell Simmons hasn't had an easy life.  She recently lost her husband (though she did not love him), and her daughter is often sick.  To make matters worse, the new owner of her estate is about to remove her from the premises.    George Blake inherited Meadow House, but he sends his younger brother to do the dirty work.  Charles, the younger brother, hates the idea of asking the widow to leave.  Last time he met Nell, he fears he did not make such a good impression on her.  When Charles meets Delphine, Nell's sickly daughter, the task of removing them from the house becomes nearly impossible.    Charles feels drawn to Nell and Delphine in ways he never imagined.  And Charles is nothing like the man Nell remembers.  He is warm and thoughtful, and her staff falls in love with him.  Can she find love as well?  I really enjoyed "The Gilded Knight."  I think it's Donna Simpson's best novel since her debut.  "Lord St. Claire's Angel" is my favorite book by Donna Simpson, and this one comes close.  The story is very sweet, almost sad sometimes, but definitely touching.  You learn to love the characters, and I think the ending is one of the best I've come across in a long time.  If I had one problem with the book, it would be that it hung around in one place for too long.  The setting didn't change, the activities hardly changed.  But the characters and their problems are so absorbing, you hardly notice.  If you're looking for a sweet, fulfilling love story, look no furthur.
