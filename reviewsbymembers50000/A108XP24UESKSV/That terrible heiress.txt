 When their father demands that they all marry heiresses, the three Darby brothers venture to London in search of prospective brides.  Montgomery Darby doesn't have to look hard, for he falls for the first girl he lays eyes on: Adele Landis, diamond of the first water.   But wooing Adele won't be easy, for she already has a horde of suitors.  To assure that he comes out on top, Monty enlists the help of Clarissa Starnes, Adele's cousin.  Clarissa thinks she's falling in love with Mr. Montgomery Darby--but she still wants to help him.  Her terribly bratty cousin would be able to save Monty's father from debtor's prison. The book was light, witty, fun and enjoyable.  However, I think the secondary characters were the stars of the book.  The other Darby brothers & Adele were just as well-developed as the hero and heroine.  Adele was deliciously awful.  And Tristram was the brother I fell in love with.  At the beginning, I thought Tristram was bizarre and immature.  However, he proved himself to be the most sensitive, most caring brother--and he was the only one with a lick of sense.  I would have enjoyed the novel a great deal more if it was a little less predictable.  I would have liked to think, "Hmm... I wonder which brother she'll end up with."   At any rate, I hope Tristram gets his own novel.   To Marry an Heiress is a fun, thoroughly enjoyable book.  Definitely recommended.
