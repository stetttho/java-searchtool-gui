 Seven years ago, Miranda met the love of her life during her first Season.  She and Evan Langley were caught in a whirlwind romance, and she had promised to marry him... until she married Lord Crandle instead.  Miranda was stuck in a cold marriage with a man 3X her age, and Evan's heart was broken. Now a widow, Miranda travels to the Rothwell estate to help her former governess' daughter, Artemis (a veritable tomboy).  Miranda is to bolster the young girl's confidence and show her some grace.  While Miranda is there, fate lands her in the company of her former love, Evan--now the Earl of Ashbourne.  Miranda starts to wonder if they can rekindle their relationship.  But Evan's hopes are very different from hers.  Evan wants to make Artemis his wife, because Artemis isn't the kind of girl he could lose his head over.  Of course Evan is still attracted to Miranda, but can she convince him to give her another chance? I liked the characters.  Evan possessed a lot of lethargic charm-even if he was a bit pig-headed at times.  I definitely could relate with Evan's feelings, and I could understand his reserve.  Miranda's character transitions were quite believeable.  The hero and heroine weren't perfect, but they were very realistic.  Their thoughts and reactions were very believeable.  Mindel's novel is a strong character piece.   I also enjoyed Artemis, and I thought Evan and Miranda treated her a bit unfairly at times.  Poor, insecure Artemis...  I hope she'll be featured in a sequel where she can find a man who makes her feel worthy of love.  (Perhaps Clasby, Evan's friend?) The book is good.  It's not astounding, but it's good.  It moved along at a quick pace and always kept my interest.  The plot was a bit stale, but the realistic characters made it worthwhile.
