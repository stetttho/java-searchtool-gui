 Alison Pagone committed suicide... or did she? She's on trial for murder, and she's obviously guilty... or is she? These are the tantalizing tidbits of information we are given at the beginning of "In the Company of Liars." Or should I say, the END of "In the Company of Liars."  Initially, I was intrigued by the idea of a murder mystery told in reverse chronological order. Like many others, I loved the movie Memento, and the jacket of this book compares itself to that critically-acclaimed movie. I'm also a fan of Grisham, and the back of the book compares itself to that ultra-famous author.  However, this book falls short. The "tantalizing tidbits" become a swell of fragmented ideas. It's not as clever as "Memento"--the journey backward through time gets old very quickly (did we need to know what happened EVERY day??). And the book isn't as engaging as a Grisham novel, either.   "In the Company of Liars" boasts many fresh ideas, but it's not as unpredictable or fascinating as it would like to be. Overall, I'd give it 2 1/2 stars.
