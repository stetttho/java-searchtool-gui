 Penelope Talcott is all-too-familiar with the rogueish Lord Verwood.  In the past, he dabbled in the lives of her two best friends.  When she happens upon him in Brighton, he is as handsome as ever... though she wants little to do with him.   Somehow, Penelope becomes embroiled in Verwood's affairs.  Someone is out to kill Lord Verwood--and now Penelope is a target!  But, when one problem is resolved, a much larger problem presents itself.  No longer will Penelope live the quiet life she's always wanted, as the wife of a rector.  A scandal makes her reconsider her options. When I reached the mid-point of the book, I was really enjoying myself.  Good story.  Good characters.  I wanted to see what happened next.  At some point, the book lost momentum.  I found myself thinking "what next?"  And, unfortunately, there was nothing left to hold my interest. The story itself is nothing new.  A reformed rogue.  A marriage of convenience.  I've seen it many times before.  However, Elena Greene's writing is what saves it.  I thought this book was better than her previous novels.  The story was more believable, and her characters were more enjoyable.   Overall, I'd say this book is alright, which is slightly less than good.  I'd give it 2 1/2 stars.
