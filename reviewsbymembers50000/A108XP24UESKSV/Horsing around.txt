 Miss Caroline Parker loves her life of freedom and independence, and her ponies are her most prized possessions.  But now her mother is demanding she have a Season--and marry this year!  Caroline has few prospects and no money.  If Caroline is going to catch a rich husband, she'll have to learn how to be a lady from her starchy Aunt Augusta. Captain Thomas Ogden met Caroline while she was still living with her cousins.  They befriended each other very quickly, and decided to brave the Season together.  Thomas is going to acquire a penniless estate, so he is seeking a lady with a large dowry.  He and Caroline concoct a plan: Thomas will give her the scoop on all of the male "Eligibles," while Caroline tries to learn more about the lady "Suitables." Of course, the feelings between the two develop. But Caroline and Thomas both need to marry money.  Will love conquer all? At times, I thought the book was rather dull.  There was a lot of "horsing around."  (And I'm not talking about Caroline's ponies, who made few appearances). Every chapter consisted of Caroline & Thomas meeting, kissing, parting, and reflecting on how they felt.  EVERY chapter.  It was rather redundant, and there seemed to be a lack of substance.  Quite honestly, I spent a large portion of the novel not caring whether the main characters ever got together.  The last chapter, however, was sweet and redeeming.   Overall, I wouldn't give it any more than 2 1/2 stars.
