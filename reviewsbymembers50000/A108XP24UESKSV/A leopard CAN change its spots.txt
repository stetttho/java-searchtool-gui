 Viscount George DeMoray (the villain from Skinner's "Lord Logic and the Wedding Wish") used to have everything.  Now he has nothing.  He has no friends (he's a heartless sort of man), is in debt, and has been beaten up by thieves.  Just when things can't get any worse, he is struck by lightning! Over a year ago, far-sighted Julie Fitz was forced to marry a blackguard in order to free herself from her tyrannical uncle.  Having exchanged vows at Gretna Green, her blackguard husband steals her treasured pendant and sends her on her way.  After that day, Julie never saw her husband again.  Now, she's companion to a sweet, spritely old lady--and no one knows she's married.  One day, a stranger comes to Alderley Manor.  He has no memory of his past, and he calls himself "Christopher Christopher."  She finds herself falling for sweet, gentle "Chris", but the secrets of her past still haunt her. I liked most parts of the novel.  Some parts I didn't enjoy... Pros:  1)A very sweet, likeable hero 2)Lots of witty lines 3)Interesting subplot with an elderly couple 4)Lots of dogs 5)A twist at the end Cons:  1)At times, the pacing of the story seemed to drag 2)A rushed ending (And I thought it was a bit depressing) 3)The main story is very predictable 4)Sometimes, the heroine seemed a bit irrational 5)"Christopher's" wounds seemed to heal too quickly Overall, I liked it.  I'd give it about a 3 1/2.  I plan to read more from Melynda Beth Skinner in the future, and I hope to see more of witty Doctor Brown (who only had a tiny part in this novel.)
