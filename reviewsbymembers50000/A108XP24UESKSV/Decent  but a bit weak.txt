 Lucinda Bromwell can't deny the fact that she's a fortune hunter. Why else would she have married an elderly man like Sir Alaric? He's old enough to be her grandfather! On the day of their wedding, tragedy falls on Lucinda and her new husband. Their carriage is overturned, and Sir Alaric soon dies--perhaps from a poisoning.  Douglas, Earl of Grafton, is the first man on the scene. Having no one else to turn to, Lucinda accepts his protection... even though he doesn't trust her. Grafton thinks Lucinda is beautiful, but she might also be a suspect in her husband's murder. Somehow, he plans to uncover the truth... and to deny his attraction to the old man's widow.  "Lord Grafton's Promise" is the first book I've read in awhile. I decided to pick it up because I've enjoyed most of Jenna Mindel's books in the past. Unfortunately, this one didn't live up to my expectations. Whenever I stopped reading, I just wasn't eager to return to it. The story itself is interesting enough, but I think the characters lacked some spark.  Overall, it's not bad. I've read better, but it's decent enough to pick up and try.
