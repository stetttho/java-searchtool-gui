 At seven and twenty, Cassie Hartwell is firmly on the shelf. Nevertheless, her mama sees one last chance to marry her off. Her mama's bachelor-of-choice, Rodney Gilbert, was unpleasant when Cassie knew him as a child. She can't imagine he's changed. Cassie is content with her life as a country lass, making friends with all the neighborhood dogs.  That is... until she meets Geoffrey Dorton, the new steward of a local lord. Mr. Dorton is handsome and charming, and his kisses are unlike anything she ever imagined.   But Geoffrey has a secret. He's not Geoffrey Dorton, he's actually Geoffrey Dorrington, Earl of Cheriton. And Cassie, as much as he likes her, is just a vicar's daughter. She's no match for a future duke.  I enjoyed "Just Say Yes" very much. It was charming & fun, and the dog scenes reminded me of something out of a Barbara Metzger book. It did get a bit slow at times (especially after a certain dog plot comes into play), but it's still a solid 4 stars. You've got to love a heroine with a name like Caspar Whittley Maria Hartwell!
