 When Lord David Winterbrook first lays eyes on Madeline Graves, it's love at first sight.  He knows he'll love and cherish her for the rest of his life.  Poor Madeline in stranded on the road in snowy weather, and chivalrous David is there to offer his assitance. When they arrive at her cottage, there's a blizzard.  Because of this, David cannot travel.  So he ends up staying with Mrs. Graves for several days, doing chores for her and learning more about her.   David Winterbrook is a widower, and Madeline is a widow--and both of them have very turbulent pasts.  As the days go by, their secrets slowly unfold, and their feelings for each other grow.  More than anything, it's a story about Madeline's trust and recovery (her husband was a tyrant).  Susannah Carleton gives us a story that is mature, tender, touching and... almost enlightening.  Both characters possess a lot of depth, and the author helps us understand their feelings.  I adored David Winterbrook.  He was so gentle, charming and understanding--he was almost saintly. Strangely enough, the climax seemed to occur toward the middle of the story.  The rest of the novel is spent resolving the unresolved.  (But it's not necessarily a bad thing).  I thoroughly enjoyed "A Twist of Fate", and would definitely recommend it.  I look forward to reading more of Ms. Carleton's work in the future.
