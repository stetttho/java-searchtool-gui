 Ursula Roarke, a lovely (but penniless) widow, wants to sell her bloodstock to the Duke of Ardsley.  What she REALLY wants, however, is to charm him into a marriage proposal.  A union with Damien (the duke) would solve all of her financial woes.   Unfortunately, His Grace isn't nearly as intriguing as Will Ridd, the duke's bailiff.  Will Ridd has worked for the Duke of Ardsley for 5 years, and has worked hard to raise the perfect flock--for perfectly soft wool.  Ridd's wool puts bread on the table for everyone in the town of Stranton--the people think of the bailiff as a sort of saint.  Now the Duke of Ardsley wants to take everything away from Ridd!  (But don't get me wrong--the duke himself is not without quirks and charm) The plot is a lot more intricate than I can describe in a few meager paragraphs.  There is a lot going on in this book.  It's full of passion, power, and heart-wrenching moments.  I caught myself tensing up and tearing up throughout the entire novel. Will Ridd is a very different, very intriguing hero.  And Ursula was a heroine willing to risk everything for love.  That's definitely admirable. However, I thought the characters were a bit too irrational in the end.  For a period of 20 pages, I was incredibly frustrated with both the hero and the heroine.  Also, the book got a bit too melodramic, at times.  In addition, I was able to figure out the "big suprise" when I reached the second chapter.   Still, you can't go wrong to read this book.  It's engaging and well-written the whole way through.  Like every other book I've read by Ms. Butler: it's a keeper.
