 Miss Helen Prestwick has journeyed all the way to Portugal to do one thing: to prove her late sister's child is actually the rightful Earl of Camberwell.  However, it's her fear that the current earl, after hearing her story, will simply turn her away.  When she meets Edward Beresford, he is nothing like the monster she expected.  In fact, he is actually quite nice. Mr. Beresford, who has no real interest in his earldom, intends to help Helen prove her claim--even if his entire family thinks her story is too far-fetched.  While he investigates her claim, Helen Prestwick stays in close quarters (she's trying to restore his family's art collection).  The more they get to know each other, the closer they become.   But Miss Prestwick is hiding a secret from her past--a secret she feels might rattle Mr. Beresford's newfound friendship with her. All in all, the story was nothing I hadn't read before.  The lead characters were interesting, if not a bit stubborn.  (I was happy to find a hero who wasn't handsome, or arrogant, or a rake).  The secondary characters were a bit surprising (a couple of them turned out to be better than I had originally suspected).  But the main story is somewhat predictable, and the ending is a bit rushed.  Still, I came across a few parts where I was unable to put the book down.  Overall, Ms. Barbour has given us an enjoyable read.  I give it 3 1/2 stars.
