 I usually don't review movies.  In this case, I just couldn't resist. First of all, the acting is horribly bad.  Could these actors (with the exception of the little boy) BE any worse???  I remember cringing when I saw the previews, and the main character said, "Don't let them put him in the dark."  Could that line have been more poorly delivered? Secondly, I KNEW this movie was going to be awful within the first 5 minutes.  The whole calamity at the beginning could have been avoided if only someone knew how to turn on a LIGHTSWITCH!!!  Ack!  It's called ELECTRICITY, people!  Could they be any dumber?! Lastly, I just couldn't get past the age discrepencies.  Supposedly, Kyle's mother was killed when he was 10.  He returns to the town of Darkness Falls 12 years later.  So, like... he (and Emma Caulfield AND the lawyer) were supposed to be 22?!?  Umm... YEAH RIGHT!!!!  Kyle looked about 35 years old.  Emma Caulfield has reached 30.  And who is a LAWYER at the age of TWENTY-TWO?!  I'm 20.  If I'm that successful (and ancient-looking) in a couple of years... WOW! To sum it all up in a word: Stupid.  Avoid it.  I couldn't even finish it.  (And I don't like to leave things unfinished)
