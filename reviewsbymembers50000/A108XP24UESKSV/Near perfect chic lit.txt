 Samantha Sweeting's life revolves around one thing: her law career. She has no time for herself, and she wouldn't have it any other way. When a partnership at her law firm is within her grasp, Samantha makes a HUGE mistake that could cost her her job. Panicked, Samantha flees London. She hops on a train with no destination in mind, not knowing what to expect.  Samantha ends up at a fancy home in the Cotswolds, and the owners mistakingly think she's the new housekeeper-for-hire. What's a girl to do? She can't very well go back to London, now that her life's a mess. So, she pretends to be a Cordon Bleu chef... even though she knows nothing about cooking. Samantha doesn't even know how to do her own laundry! But her new employers buy into her story... even though the handsome gardener, Nathaniel, is a skeptic.  "Undomestic Goddess," is my first Kinsella book, and it hope it won't be my last. It's as perfect as chic lit can get. It's sweet, but not saccharine. It's funny, and it even brought a tear to my eye. A lesser author might've made Samantha seem like like a chronic liar who's completely out of her mind. But Kinsella makes her sympathetic. And Nathaniel (who I thought was a bit dispassionate at first--I was so wrong!) is everything a hero should be. Sure, the book's a bit far-fetched. But if you're reading chic lit, the last thing you want is a dose of reality.   I highly recommend this book!
