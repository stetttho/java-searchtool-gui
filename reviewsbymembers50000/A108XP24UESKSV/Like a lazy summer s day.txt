 While their parents are visiting Egypt, Caroline and Charlie have been left in the care of their uncle, Lord William.  Lord William, however, is more interested in their pretty governess, Miss Emma Snow.  Emma is everything a gently bred female should be--ingelligent, polite, and charming.  But is she a suitable match for a lord?  Miss Snow finds herself growing more and more fond of the handsome lord.  He is dashing and attentive, even heroic.  And he seems to show an interest in his neice and newphew.  Or... is it actually Emma he's interested in?  This has to be one of the hardest books I've ever had to write a synopsis for.  Why?  Well, to be honest, not a whole lot happens.  The book itself is like a summer's day: slow and idyllic.  The book didn't have an antagonist, and there was rarely any conflict.  The book's focus was clearly the romance between Emma and William... and even those scenes were scarce.  In my opinion, some of the best scenes revolved around the animals.  There are amorous cats, peacocks, and an attack pig--a regular menagerie.  Even if the book was slow, there were still some enjoyable moments.  Overall, it's a 2 1/2 star read.
