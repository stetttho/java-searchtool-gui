 Lady Olivia Cunningham is without flaw.  Everyone loves her.  She's a beautiful, charitable do-gooder, and a darling of the ton.  She concerns herself with the lower classes, and she treats her servants like friends.  When Olivia runs into the Marquess of Sheridan (literally), she decides to find the dour man some happiness.   Drew Benton, Marquess of Sheridan, has no interest in society. His first marriage was a disaster, and his children are away at school.  Drew made his fortune through gambling, and he scowls his way through every ball he's forced to attend.  The indomitable Lady Olivia may be the answer to his megrims.   Julia Parks can write a good story, but this wasn't one of my favorites.  There were too many subplots and a few unnecessary characters, and they ultimately detracted from the main plot.  On the other hand, I liked a few of the sub-characters better than the leads... which is usually not a good thing.  Parks starts to balance it all in the end, and it makes for a fairly enjoyable read. It's not a favorite, but it's certainly not bad.
