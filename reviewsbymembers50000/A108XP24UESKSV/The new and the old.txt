 In "The Defiant Miss Foster", Valentine Debenham (Baron of Newkirk) just received the surprise of his life.  His father was the guardian of several children... and now Val himself is their guardian!  He travels to the rundown Foster estate to find 3 unruly boys, one eager young man, and the boyish Kat Foster (who he originally mistakes for a boy).  Val, a former officer in the British army, thinks he always knows what is best.  He decides to send the boys off to school, purchase a commission for the eldest, and find a husband for Kat. But Kat Foster has other things in mind.  She enjoys her country life--riding horses, wearing breeches and shooting pistols.  She is determined to reunite her family, and will go to great lengths to do so. "The Defiant Miss Foster" DID have its moments.  It starts off with a bang (quite literally), and there were a few delightful moments throughout.  However, I thought Kat's behavior often borderlined on ridiculous.  And I'm not quite sure how (or when) the characters fell in love.  In fact, I'm not thoroughly convinced that Kat was in love with Val at all.  The romantic chemistry between the hero and heroine was nearly nonexistent, but the author's humor makes up for the lack.  Overall, 3 1/2 stars. NOTE: "The Defiant Miss Foster" is a new story by Melinda McRae. The second story, "The Highly Respectable Widow", is a reissue.
