 Two years ago, when Philip Lyonbridge attempted to elope with his brother's fiance, his brother gave him quite a talking to.  Thereafter, Philip decided to join the army and become the man he always wanted to be.  In doing so, however, he leaves behind the love of his life.  At the start of the novel, everyone belives Philip Lyonbridge is dead, including Isabella, who has been harboring a huge secret.  Just two years ago, Isabella Grimsby was a silly girl who would indulge in her every whim.  However, raising her "sister's" child has matured her quite a bit.  When Philip Lyonbrige is in fact NOT dead, she cannot muster any excitment for him.  In fact, she hadn't hoped to see him at all, after the way he left her.  Will time heal her wounds?  "A Hero's Homecoming" is a sequel to Kate Huntington's "A General's Daughter", which was a vastly more entertaining read.  In fact, I would STRONGLY recommend that anyone embarking on "A Hero's Homecoming" should read "General's Daughter" first.  Having read its predeccesor will greatly effect your enjoyment of the sequel.  The background on the characters is pretty essential.  That said, I was really disappointed by "A Hero's Homecoming." First of all, it was too long.  How the author managed to stretch such a simple story into 280 pages, I still have no idea.  It took me a long time to read it, because I could only read it in small increments.  Also, there were times when I thought the book was too modern in its views.    I will have to agree with the other reviewers, however.  The most distracting element was two-year-old Jamie.  Had any REAL two-year-old spoken like this child, it would be a prodigy and a genius.  Every time the child opened its mouth, I wanted to hold my breath.    Overall, I give the novel 2 1/2 stars, borderlining on 2.  I feel terrible for having to give such a low score to an author I generally enjoy, but I have to be honest.
