 Drunk and drenched, and at the mercy of two Cyprians, Lord Pierson has just reached an ultimate low.  And then he finds his salvation: in the form of a beautiful woman.  He spots an angelic woman in a passing carriage, and he vows to meet her and make her his wife.  Through her, he WILL be reformed. The lady in question is Lady Rowena Revington, a spoiled, self-indulging brat.  It is Amy Corbett's job, as Rowena's chaperone, to find a husband for the willful girl.  But Lady Rowena has no desire to marry.  She lives to make every man fall head-over-heels in love with her, Lord Pierson included.  As it happens, sweet Amy is the one who truly has budding feelings for the reforming viscount. I enjoyed this book very much.  Actually, it's better than most of the books I've recently read.  The characters (especially the secondary characters, which includes the charming and crafty Lord Bainsbridge) are engaging, and you really want to know what happens to them.  Romantically, each character ends up with the right person, and the ending is sure to leave a smile on any reader's face. On the flip side, there were certainly times when I wished the book would move a little bit faster.  Also, I thought the characters were a bit superficial at times. Overall, though, it's a really good book.  I enjoy Donna Simpson very much, and I hope she has a story for Lady Harriet (Bainsbridge's bluestocking sister) underway.
