 No one has ever been as unlucky as Maggie Bonner.  On her way to return her mistress's engagement present, she is robbed, drugged, marooned, kidnapped, and maroooned again.  Imagine her humilation when the robber and kidnapper turn out to be the very same man. That man is Gulliver MacGuigan, a man who is more than he seems.  He robbed the Barkin Emeralds from Maggie, and he kidnaps her because he mistakes her for someone else.  He thinks she is Alice Fescue, the fiance of his rival.  And he is determined to think she is Miss Fescue, even as he finds himself growing fascinated with her.   Maggie herself warms up to Gulliver.  He becomes less of a kidnapper and more of a protector. "The Barkin Emeralds" was an interesting book, but it fell into a lot of typical "romance novel" traps.  Can you really admire a man who robs you, kidnaps you, and forces kisses on you?  At times, Gulliver was a bit overbearing and thick-headed.  I would be scared out of my wits.  And how could Gulliver, in retrospect, love a girl who slices his arm?  I just don't buy it.  Not only that, the characters were somewhat archetypal--Maggie being the spirited lady's companion, Gulliver being the brusque sailor-stud.  The book has its high points, but it falls short where it could have succeeded.   It's alright.  I might even go so far as to say its good, but it's never great.  I've read better books by Nancy Butler, the more recent ones being "Discarded Duke" and "Prospero's Daughter."  If you want something different from a ballroom Regency, and you like kidnapped heroines... you might enjoy this one.  Probably more than I did.
