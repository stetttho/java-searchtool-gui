 Since everyone has already touched on the plot, I see no reason to rehash what's already been said.  I simply want to let this be known: THIS IS AN ADORABLE BOOK!  This book has everything.  It has romance (and lots of it!), mystery, intrigue, comedy, adventure.  I hardly ever run across any "page-turners", but this is definitely one of them!  I loved the hero; he was to die for.  And I love a heroine who can hold her own without being overbearing.  Delia is just that.   This is the best Regency I've read this year, and the story is so lovely!  Do whatever you must to get your hands on this book.  You won't regret it!
