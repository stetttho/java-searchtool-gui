 Miss Georgiana Halliday is out walking her dog, Lump, when she runs into an old acquaintance--literally.  Lord Warwick, the man she crashed into, is surprised to discover how much he wants to kiss Georgiana.  So he kisses her.  And they both enjoy the kiss immensely. Never mind the fact that he's married to her cousin, Catherine.  Never mind the fact that Catherine is missing.  Never mind the fact that Lord Warwick is thought to have murdered his wife! This is the twisted beginning to a very twisted story.  Not to mention, it was filled with plenty of colorful characters.  The author was actually weaving 3 interconnected romance plots.  We are introduced to Andrew Halliday, Georgiana's brother (who has a prominent limp).  We meet Marigold, who has been married 3 times (and she's only 26).  Marigold lost her late husband's treasure, The Norwood Emerald. Carlisle Sutton is a man obsessed with India (he is also obsessed with reclaiming the Norwood Emerald).  We are also introduced to Sarah-Louise Inchquist, who has an infatuation with Peregrine Teasdale, a handsome young man who constantly spouts off poetry. If you can make sense of any of that (and if you want to read something vastly unique), you might enjoy this book.  I, however, thought there was too much going on at once.  I thought the plot was pretty jumbled.  However, I did like the witty dog, Lump.  And I thought Maggie Mackeever had a way with words.  Overall, I'd give the book 2 1/2 stars.
