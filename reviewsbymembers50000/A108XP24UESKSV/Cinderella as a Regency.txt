 Luella Sanderson (called "Ella" by her friends) is the heroine of this near-perfect Cinderella tale.  After parting with her close school friends, she is sent to live with unpleasant relatives.  Her aunt (who is as wicked as any evil stepmother) tells her she must earn her keep.  She must rise at 6 o'clock each morning and work as Mr. Banks' personal assistant.  (Mr. Banks is her aunt's brother). After taking the fall for his troublesome brother, Gabriel Crowe, Earl of Shalford, is sent to Surrey by his father.  While he is there, he has a month to chose a respectable, weathly country bride.  She must be a diamond of the first water, for his parents would accept nothing less.  And Gabriel has agreed to follow the wishes of his parents & Society.  ...So why does he feel drawn to Ella, the penniless viscount's daughter? There is SO much to be enjoyed in this book.  There's a misunderstanding between Ella and Gabriel's mother, who hires the girl to be the cook at her garden party.  There are flights in Mr. Banks' hot air balloons.  (I perceive Mr. Banks to be Ella's fairy godmother). There is one snotty cousin, and one very daft cousin.  There are geese.  There are slippers sliding off of Luella's tiny feet.  All in all, the book is 222 pages of pure delight!  In the end, love conquers all!  Break open & enjoy!
