 Miss Drusilla Herbert has taken on the position as a companion--to one of her mother's old school friends.  Drusilla and Lady Brentford get along famously, and Drusilla agrees to help the lady throw a party in celebration of ther older woman's birthday. Enter Lord Brentford, Adrian Richmond: the Lady's son.  He is suspicious of his mother's companion, so he travels to the country to see what Drusilla's all about.  Adrian is intrigued by Drusilla, the beautiful country mouse with a brazen tongue.  And while he's initially against the idea of a party, he eventually consents to it.   Several party guests grace the pages of the novel with their unique presences.  Lord Brentford's friends are dashing (and some of them deserved bigger roles).  Snobby Lady Felicia is delightfully (but not entirely) bad.  Every character adds something to the story--even Mrs. Knight's annoying pooch!  Overall, the novel is light and entertaining. But it's also predictable.  And if you're familiar with Regencies, it's really nothing new.   Still, you should definitely pick it up.  Every word is enjoyable.
