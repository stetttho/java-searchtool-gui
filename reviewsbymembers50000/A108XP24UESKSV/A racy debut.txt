 Harriet Beldon will not marry unless it's a love match. She'd rather spend her time exploring exotic places, not dodging beaux in London. But Harriet has a secret: she's secretly admired Lord Beldon from afar.  Lord Beldon is looking for the perfect wife. She must be beautiful, smart, rich, and a social paragon. Harriet is none of those things. However, they seem to keep running into each other (literally), and he can't seem to get her out of his mind. During their first private outing, Beldon and Harriet have a deliciously scandalous encounter... which prompts him to propose marriage to the woman he hardly knows!  I've been a fan of the shorter Zebra Regencies for several years. The shorter ones always seemed more traditional, if only because of the absence of racy scenes. When I think of a traditional Regency, I think of the kind Jane Austen might have liked: innocent, clever, with manners typified by the era. Respectable women should be respectable women, and lightskirts should be lightskirts. The two should never cross.  However, lines between the longer historicals and shorter "Regencies" are starting to blur. I'm one reader who happens to prefer the sweeter stories. "The Lady is Mine" is a bit racier than I expected it to be; therefore, I'd give it two stars. My rather low score is not based on raciness alone. If I WAS someone who enjoyed the love scenes, I'd still give it 3 stars (at the most). The monotony plays a major factor as well.  On a more positive note: I love the cover.
