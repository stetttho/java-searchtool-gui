 Jillian Ashcroft is determined to lift the curse that haunts her family.  Ever since a witch put a curse on the Ashcrofts years ago, tragic deaths and tragedies have plagued them.  In order to break the curse, she needs to get her hands on the pendant of Laura Endicott--her arch enemy (though she's never even met her).  So she enlists the help of Sir Richard Blackwood, Laura's fiance. But Sir Richard isn't eager to help, for he doesn't want to dupe his fiance like that.  Jillian resorts to blackmail to enlist him.  Very cruel blackmail.  And her character just declines from there... Jillian is a hoyden whose manner of speaking borderlines on scandalous.  She is an eccentric, selfish little tart.  I really didn't like her.  I'm sure she had SOME redeeming quality, but I can't really think of anything right now.  Richard's character seemed rather comatose.  Richard and Jillian spent 95% of the book bantering with each other.  It gets old.  Even in the end, their romance wasn't very convincing.  However, I DID like Laura, Richard's fiance.  She was very sweet, innocent--she was the equivalent of a Regency Snow White.  Laura, the gypsy lady in the woods & Jillian's scheming cousin were the only redeeming aspects of the novel.   I wouldn't recommend it.  It's not unreadable, but there are better choices.  (I'm kind of curious as to whom is featured on the cover of the novel.  Is it Laura... or Jillian?)
