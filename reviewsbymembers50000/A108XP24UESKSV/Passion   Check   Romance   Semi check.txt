 Lord Huntington is on his way home from war with a very nasty leg wound.  He needs to see a doctor, but all he gets is a willful young girl named Charlotte Kittridge, the doctor's daughter.  Charlotte gets the job done, and she surprises him (and helps him) on numerous occasions.  One of those suprises is her age.  He thought she was a mere fifteen, but she's really seven and twenty--a confirmed spinster.  Charlotte, a fan of those romantic novels written by "A Lady", has no hopes of a romance for herself.  And even though Lord Huntington's station is far above her own, his kisses make her hopeful.  She knows she is no beauty... certainly not to Lord Huntington, who, even with his wounded leg, is seemingly perfect.  But Lord Huntingon has a secret.  He may be the heir to a dukedom, but the poor man cannot read.  Charlotte is determined to teach him.  Willful Miss Kittridge quickly becomes the most fascinating woman of his acquaintance.  Having not read Sophia Nash's last novel, I cannot really compare the two.  She has been hailed as a promising new talent.  Still, I can't say I was blown away.  The main characters were the strongpoint of the novel.  However, I don't expect to remember anything about the secondary characters next week.  Considering this novel has a few "racy" moments, I thought it was inappropriate (and misleading) to start each chapter with a Jane Austen quote.    "A Passionate Endeavor" might be your bag... but not if you're looking for a charming, witty, Austen-esque story.  I bought this book on a recommendation.  Frankly, I was a little disappointed.
