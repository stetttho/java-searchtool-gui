 I should start off by saying that I have read and enjoyed most of Amanda McCabe's previous novels.  I am surprised to see myself giving a 2-star rating to this 5-star author. Lady Emma Weston, neice of a Russian Count and Countess, has lived in Russia for most of her life.  She travels to England with her aunt and uncle, expecting it to be exciting, only to find that it is anything but.  Emma has very little patience for etiquette and Society.  Hoping to find the adventure she came for, Emma dresses as a maid and sneaks into the streets of London. While there, she is rescued by a man named Jack Howard, who is dressed as a tradesman.  He says he is a secretary--and she doesn't remember meeting him the previous night.  Jack, who is actually Viscount St. Albans, is intrigued by the dark-haired beauty who claims to be a Russian maid (he knows the truth about her identity).  Jack decides to play along with her ruse.  Together, they spend one magical night on the streets of London. Emma is afraid she'll never see Jack again.  Of course, they DO meet up again... about 1/3 of the way through the novel.  This interesting beginning is followed by a grueling middle and end. "Lady in Disguise" lacked the mysticism of Amanda McCabe's previous novels.  The characters were (in my opinion) rather dull.  I became irritated by the heroine's naivete and impulsiveness.  We were introduced to a mere skeleton of a villain, who barely made an appearance in this overlong novel.  The ending was awkward and rushed. Fortunately, the novel is well-written and easy to read... if you can commit to the 278 bland pages (178, if you exclude the good beginning).
