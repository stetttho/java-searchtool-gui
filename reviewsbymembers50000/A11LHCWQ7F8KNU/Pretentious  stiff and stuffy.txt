 What were they thinking? Whoever put this book together doesn't have a clue about creating luxurious, livable spaces. This book is a turnoff. I'd call this funeral home or hotel lobby design or designing to impress the ladies who lunch crowd. This book is obviously about how to spend a fortune in the process, too. Real luxury is about comfort and unpretentious ease, not necessarily money. Unfortunately, this designer does not seem to get that.
