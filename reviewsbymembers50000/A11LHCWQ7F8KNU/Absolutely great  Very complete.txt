 This book is absolutely great and very complete. I'm so glad HGTV finally got around to doing a decorating book like this. In my house, HGTV is on most every evening. I don't think these are all rooms from HGTV shows because I didn't recognize them. It seems to be all new photos of the befores and afters supplemented with a wealth of information on what was done and how you can do it yourself. This is a great reference book and an amazing value. Thank you, HGTV.
