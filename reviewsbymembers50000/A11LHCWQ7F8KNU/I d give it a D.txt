 I love decorating  books. I go to the bookstore and look at them all. And I buy 6 or 7 of them a year. I admit I did not buy this one. It sounded so good, but open it and it's terrible. The ideas the author, whom I've never heard of, writes about are OK, but they are nothing newl, and they could be summed up in one nice magazinze article.  I buy a decorating book for big glorious color photos as much as for the writing, and this book does NOT have those photos. It's a big disappointment, and it's a surprise in this day and age to find a decorating book that that looks as if it were printed about 30 years ago before color photos were common. The only reason this must sell online is that people love the title but don't realize that they aren't getting much for their money.
