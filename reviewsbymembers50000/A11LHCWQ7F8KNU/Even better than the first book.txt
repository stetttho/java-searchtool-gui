 I'm addicted to Trading Spaces and love their books. I bought the first book which was about the show behind the scenes, and I loved it. But this is even better because it's all about decorating ideas shown in rooms from the show. It's kind of like a freeze-frame look at the show because I can stop and study the rooms from TV instead of being frustrated when the video cameras pan a room too quickly. I am seeing a lot of ideas that went right by me when I saw the rooms on TV. There is great information in here and pix of all my favorite rooms.
