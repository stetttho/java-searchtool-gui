 I should have read amazon reviews before I bought this. The reviewers are right that this isn't a pocket decorating guide but a rundown of decorator's and designer's terms. My reaction as I paged through the book was, "Who CARES?" I feel stupid for buying this and am angry with whoever put that "pocket decorator" title on this book. I can get this book's information in the encyclopedia or dictionary.
