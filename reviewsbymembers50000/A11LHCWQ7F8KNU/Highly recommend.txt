 This book is answering all the color questions I have now, and I know I'll use it again and again in the future. A friend told me about the book, so I bought my own copy. It's excellent. It talks about decorating with color from my point of view. It start with problems regular people have when they decorate their homes (instead of starting from the point of view of a designer who is selling one point of view or someone who is selling a line of paint). The book is organized around the kinds of questions that my friends and I ask each other all the time. This is a refreshing point of view and a really helpful one. No hype but just good information and lots of great color photos showing optional solutions to each question.
