 This book, I discovered after I bought it, is for decorating stage sets, not homes. The examples the author shows are unrealistic looking and have the ambience of showhouses that are created for people to walk by and admire but not to live in!!!This book is a big disappointment. I admit I've never heard of the author, but the title sounded good so I bought this. I'm very sorry I wasted my money.
