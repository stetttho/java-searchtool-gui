 I look at every new decorating book that comes out, and I buy up to 6 or 7 a year. I admit that I haven't seen Lynette Jennings'  TV show because I work, but I've heard of her and have friends who never miss her show. She is funny, fresh, irreverent. She is honest and seems to understand what real people need and want. I am so into her message of doing what WE want with OUR home and not paying any attention to what anyone else has to say. This book is so good. I think it's must reading for everyone who loves her home and wants to make it as personal as possible. What a great message. This book is great to read but it's also filled with glorious color photos. I was glad to see that those photos run the gammut of colors and styles and home types and that Lynette Jennings isn't trying to push one viewpoint on her readers as some decorating book authors are doing. Lynette Jennings makes it clear that I am supposed to do what I want and she'll be there to help me through it. Just great.
