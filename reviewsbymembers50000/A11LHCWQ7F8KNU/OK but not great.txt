 If you can only buy one decorating book, definitely do NOT buy this one. It's ok but not great. It is not comprehensive. It doesn't have a lot to say. It stretches out projects to take up space. It's worth maybe 1/4 of what it sells for. There are many, many better decorating books on the market.. If you like Christopher Lowell's show (I do), then watch it as the entertainment it is intended to be but don't expect a good design book to come out of it.
