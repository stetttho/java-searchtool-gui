 What a waste of money this was. I compared it to the new HGTV Before and After Decorating book I bought at the same time, and I'm sorry I bought this. The photos in this book are what you would expect from Pottery Barn. They are stylish but nothing very new or different and there isn't much information to help me with my own living room. In contrast, the HGTV book has one interesting before and after makeover after another supplemented with lots of information tohelp me redo my own rooms. If you  like the pottery barn look, I think you can just get their catalogs and get the same feeling for free instead of buying the pottery barn book.
