 I've spent a lot of time looking at all the new decorating books for spring. I buy several decorating books every year and love, love, love them. But I am picky.  I love this book which I came across by accident at the bookstore. This is not exactly a decorating book, although I plan to use it as such. It's big and gloriously crammed with color photos of "getaway" homes. The book tells how to go about finding a second home or weekend home but it also writes about decorating and remodeling and so on. Those ideas work for any home. I like nautical style, so I found a lot of that in this book. It shows variations on cabin and seashore styles in both home types and interior decorating. It's great to flip through this book, and I have trouble putting it down. That's what got me interested in it at the bookstore. I finally had to buy it because I kept finding pictures of one room after another that had ideas I wanted to use in our home. Just great. Glorious to look at and helpful also.
