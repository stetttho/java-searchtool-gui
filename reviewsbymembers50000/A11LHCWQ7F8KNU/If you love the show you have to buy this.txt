 I am addicted to Trading Spaces and just wrote a review of the new Make It Yours book, which I love. I also bought this book. Actually, I'm not a big Paige Davis fan at all, but this book is worth it because it covers a lot of behind the scenes happenings that you won't find anywhere else. Whether or not you find Paige annoying, the book gives insights on what happens at the show when cameras aren't rolling.
