 This is the best decorating book. I have the hardback version, and mine is getting a little worn out because I've used it for three years now. I just bought a couple of the paperback copies for friends as shower gifts. I got my copy as a wedding gift. At first I thought that I wouldn't like it because Better Homes and Gardens wasn't a magazine I was reading at the time but I was wrong. I love this book. It has all the big color pix any decorating book has but then it has so much more. I'm learning from this book. It's giving me depth of information so I can make my own decisions. It isn't dictating a style or point of view. This book seems very current in that approach. The proof is that I'm still using the book three years after I got it.
