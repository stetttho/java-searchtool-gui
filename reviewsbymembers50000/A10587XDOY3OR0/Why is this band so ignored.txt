 I'm really picky about the music I listen to. I want it to be *good* and inspired. I want the musicians to pay attention to the sounds they produce. I want good melodies and a comfortable vocalist. I want it all to be intentional and genuine. Typically, this means I'm usually nonplussed with most of the stuff I hear. Radiohead, for example, is all of the above. Wonderful. Coldplay is pretty good, Travis is ok, and Belle and Sebastian are an institution. The Doves deliver on these demands. Lost Souls has at least 6 great tracks, and several good ones, which is more than I usually expect. The music is wistful and powerful. The sounds are all lovingly tweaked and mixed. Certain tracks are wonderfully hypnotic. And there're no bands that really compare to them, in my opinion. Certainly not as well. If you get this album and don't like it, I feel sorry for you.
