 I'd never heard of Faust before a few months ago. I'd purchased a Flaming Lips compilation that featured "It's a Bit of a Pain" as one of the songs, and decided to buy the parent album. Based on the sound of the song, I was guessing it was made in the last few years. It sounded very modern. But, no. It was made in 1973? That's crazy. So were the rest of the songs on the album: a weird mix of synth-punk, pop, and rolling, ambient tunes. What makes it stand out from the electronic/synth experimentation of its day is its amazingly mature, spare use of the computer. The synth elements aren't wielded in a "gee whiz" showcase manner, they just blend in with the traditional instruments (guitar, drums) to create a whole greater than the sum of its parts. True, there are some points where a song will degrade into shrill, sample showcase, but on the whole the sound is very modern. Subtle things, like the vocal shifting on "It's a Bit of a Pain" stand out to me as a precient technique for 1973. The melodies are all quite capable, too. Even little throwaway bridges in their longer songs are memorable. I can see why they never hit the bigtime, though. While certain songs are radio friendly, they refused to bury their apparent love of free-form, angular, reptitive sound experimentation. I don't see a lot of people listening to "Krautrock" from beginning to end. It's just too unfamiliar.  That's their loss. It's just my cup of tea.
