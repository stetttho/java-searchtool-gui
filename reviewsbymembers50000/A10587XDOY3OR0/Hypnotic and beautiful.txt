 First off, if you're the type who gets his hackles up whenever a band changes traditional styles, you'll probably be unable to allow yourself access to this disc. It's a significant departure, musically, from previous Lips albums. It's hard for me to describe this disc. Obvious observations would be: electronica, psychedelia, pop, lighthearted, melodic. The music and accompanying vocals merge together gracefully and poignantly, with basslines and pleading, soothing vocal strains that insituate themselves into your brain. Wayne Coyne is a gentle spirit in an arena of otherwise swaggering, aloof artists. You feel like he cares deeply about things, and isn't concerned about coming off cool. That quality alone gets my attention. It makes the disc like a friend, who's there to skip stones with you and enjoy the breeze. It's uplifting and personal, and my favorite Lips album to date. For those who've never heard them, I'd compare the overall feel of this music to something like Kid A (if Thom Yorke were happy), or maybe a more subtle and modern Deee Lite. Anyway, I'd recommend buying it and listening to it at least several times, and I don't recommend a lot of stuff.
