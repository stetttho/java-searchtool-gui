 ... So anyway... Under the Western Freeway. I think the best way to relate to a reviewer's viewpoint is to know what else they like. To triangulate my location, I like The Flaming Lips, the Shins, Badly Drawn Boy, Nick Drake, Belle and Sebastian, Wilco, and Radiohead. None of those bands have ever made a bad album, and the same applies to Grandaddy. The first Grandaddy album I bought was The Sophtware Slump, which took a while to grow on me, but when it did, it stuck fast. I rotated it through my collection regularly. A year passed, and I needed something new, so I bought this (and the new album) in a spending fit. Again, it took a little while to grow on me, but within a week, I found myself mumbling "I took your advice...", "drink beer, out in the country..." along with floating off in mindless surrender to the instrumental title track. It's pleasant and personal, and I can't wait until my new Dolby reciever comes in so I can listen to it fully.
