 Nick Drake is probably the most fragile, genuine musician I have ever heard. Even if you didn't know about the unfortunate details of his life (and death), his music more than tells the story. It can be said that his music was beautiful, original, melodic, and classic, but I think that the most remarkable thing about it is the depth of personal, childlike emotion he filled it with. Nick Drake's voice had an uncanny ability to translate directly from his mood to your ears. At the risk of being voted down, I'll say that his music is not for everyone. Indeed, it's probably not for the majority of people. His songs were crafted with a minimum of force and flair, and don't grab your attention if you're not listening. They're muted, floating, subtle compositions that don't play well in a public setting. They're also progressively depressing, with Pink Moon as the capstone on a lonely life. Because of this, I find it hard to listen to his music today. I found Nick Drake when I was at a very similar place in life, and the music sounded as if it were a soundtrack to my experience. It was one of the few things I had that I could relate to, and it gave me a friend to commiserate with. Because of this, it frightens me to encounter again, having climbed out of that hole. Music is the truest expression of emotion, to me, and as such it has the ability to tune you to its frequency. Still, you listen for what you feel, and Nick's songs weren't all sombre and lost. Five Leaves Left strikes me as his most upbeat, accessible albumn, and features several of his best songs, appropriate for any mood. Will you like his music? Give it a go.
