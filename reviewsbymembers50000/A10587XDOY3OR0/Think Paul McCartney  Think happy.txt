 I think that what's bothering a lot of people about this album is it's unwavering cheesiness compared to his prior, more subtle compositions. It's bouncy, hopelessly happy, and laced with sometimes sappy lyrics. Have You Fed the Fish is Paul McCartney compared to the previous (Bewilderbeast) Lohn Lennon album. This makes it feel less "cool" to be sure. Any album that posits "Woman, I'll make you a girl" has complicitly relinquished it's right to be edgy. It's kind of a guilty pleasure in this way, and I don't play it at parties. That said, the thing you have to love about Damon Gough is his total inability to produce bad melodies. This guy's head must be incessantly producing melody. He's the Mozart of pop. They just oooze from him. I'm in awe. Being the type of person I am, they stick in my mind for days, and I love them.
