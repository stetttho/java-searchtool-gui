 This is just an incredible album. I've always liked Ween, and have been buying their records since The Pod. Their albums have always had a few songs that revealed the potential they had as song writers, but they weren't usually "serious" musical compositions. They were more humorous than emotionally moving, and were enjoyable in their own right. They were good, but their tone made them inaccessible to those who weren't into the boognish. Quebec is a significant departure, sounding more like Pink Floyd, The Doves, and the Beatles than classic Ween. I'm sure this will alienate those who are mired in their musical past, but should also impress a great deal of new listeners. One of the greatest qualities of this album is the range of styles they employ. A good rock band that makes only rock can become stale and musically incestuous, as there are only so many rock structures floating around in their heads. They're bound to revisit themes more than once, and the whole collection begins to sound uninspired. Ween have an impressive ability to float between entirely different genres, and do so very fluently. It also doesn't sound like they labored to encompass the styles, it sounds like the styles are just many faces of their innate musical minds. Whether they're doing ragtime or rock, they do so in a signature way that can make you appreciate any structure (I dislike country, but I love 10 Golden Country Greats). In this way, they're very Beatle-esque. In short, they're music for modern music lovers of all types. Their more recent songwriting ability reminds me of Badly Drawn Boy, another musician that seems to intuitively understand music in general. My personal favorites from this disc so far: -Chocolate Town (in my head as I write this) -Tried and True -Transdermal Celebration -Captain  You really can't go wrong buying this disc, Ween fan or no. It's ridiculous that this disc isn't garnering more publicity.
