 This album seems like 10 variations on the same song. A lot of bluesy jangling that meanders along with some calm vocal accompaniment, then an energetic freak out with some gravelly shouting, then back again, over and over. It all hangs together, and it's not *bad*, but it doesn't really stand out. The melodies are capable, but nothing exceptional. The vocals sound like something from a Subway commercial. Again, competent, but so what? They do present you with a full sound, and a lot of details, but it's like they did it just so I could say that. None of the touches really accents anything. idk. I bought this disc because Amazon kept pushing it on me. I want to like it, but maybe it's just like a girl that's pretty and all, but doesn't click with me. It's just there, employing some musicians and entertaining those who do seem to like it. Amazon isn't always wrong, though. I loved The Shins.
