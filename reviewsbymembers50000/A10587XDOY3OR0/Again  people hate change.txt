 I can't count how many reviews I've read in various media of this album that lament its lack of "experimentalism" compared to Sophtware Slump. Sopthware is certainly a masterful disc, but is that all people want from thier bands: more of the same? What if the Beatles had made Sgt Pepper's four times over? It gets old. I also sense unease with the prospect of Jason Lytle writing "happy" songs. Is he not allowed to be happy? Just because it's not dark doesn't mean it's instantly blaze and mainstream. Your disconnect more likely means that you're depressed. I for one applaud this new effort from one of our best bands going. The songwriting is solid, and I would argue that the last two songs are the most grand and touching that they've ever made, and my favorites from their entire catalog. For those who've never spun a Grandaddy CD, this is as good a disc as any to start with. I'd say you could best describe them as a rock band with a dash of country, low-fi synth, and one of the more unique, memorable vocalists nowadays. They remind me most of The Flaming Lips, and Pet Sounds-eque Brian Wilson. They're an indie rock band without the anger or self-importance. Find another band like that.
