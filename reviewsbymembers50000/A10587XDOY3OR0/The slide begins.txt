 Alright... Weezer's first album was really good. They had a bunch of great songs, and the sound was new. This has a similar sound (not that new anymore) and a *few* good songs. The melodies and energy aren't as memorable. Of course, I could just be getting older, and less appreciative of this kind of music, but I don't find myself playing this disc all that much. When you play this disc in the background, only a few songs catch your attention. I'll probably burn some of the songs I do like onto a mix CD and put it back on the shelf. Dare I say "one trick pony?"
