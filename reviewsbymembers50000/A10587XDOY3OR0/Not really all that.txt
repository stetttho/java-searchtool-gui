 A lot of the reviews I'd read about this CD described it as being in the vein of Belle and Sebastian, or having qualities of Radiohead, etc. Mainly, all bands I like. Anyway, I figured I'd really like this album, so I got it. Now, if this disc sounds like anything, it sounds like a thinly veiled Travis. It's *eerie* how similar they are. That's great if you love Travis (and The Man Who *was* pretty good). This music just lacks something, though, and it's hard to define. For one, I'm not real impressed with their melodies. The notes they choose in sucession. An example of a great melody disc is Badly Drawn Boy. Take away the words, and you've still got a great CD. This is a lyrical CD. The words just keep coming at you in a consistant, forgettable delivery. The sound is lazy and muted, which I guess they wanted. They sound like they're trying to be sad. If you're like me, you also appreciate a certain honesty and earnestness in your music. Something that sounds genuine and approachable. Turin sounds like they decided to become musicians because they could, but not because they really wanted to. Now, I'm exaggerating for the sake of time, but it just feels uninspired. Like a computer program that analyzed serious, brooding brit-folk and cranked out an albumn. It's there, I guess. It's ok. It just feels unnecessary. It doesn't *move* me. I wish I'd liked this album. I spent good money on it, and it's so hard to find good ones. The last couple songs are ok, if nothing else. Just kind of dissapointing.
