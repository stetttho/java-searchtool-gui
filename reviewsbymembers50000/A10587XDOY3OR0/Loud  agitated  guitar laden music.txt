 I say this because I was expecting different. According to Amazon, this album is appreciated by people who like The Flaming Lips, Wilco, and the Shins. Beyond this, Amazon kept dropping it in my "Boy, you'll like this!" web page.  So anyway, I'm thinking, "cool, some inspired, mellow tunes to add to my collection." I'd downloaded "NYC" and really liked it. Everything looked good. After enough exposure, I finally caved in and bought it (...in a big end display at Best Buy, which should have been a sign). It look little time to appreciate that "NYC" is in no way representative of the tone of the album. It's much more like the White Stripes or The Strokes than the previously mentioned bands. It's a lot of high-energy guitar and fuzzed, shouting vocals. That's not a critique of the album. If you like that kind of music, it's probably pretty good. I've just had enough loud, angry people in my life that I don't need to buy a record of it. I appreciate milder stuff, which is what I was hoping for. Something like The Shins or even Radiohead (yeah, they have some angry music, but it's more tempered and musical). There *are* a few poplike songs on the disc (track 1,3,10). So that's really about it. Just a warning to those who aren't looking for strutting, harsh rock. To those who do, rock on!
