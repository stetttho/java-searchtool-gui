 Advertising- love it or hate it, we have to live with it. Some say it controls our lives. Sometimes, it backfires. For 25 years, Consumer Reports magazine (which itself has been ad-free since its founding in 1936) has recorded the most interesting mishaps or marketing plans in the inner back cover of their monthly periodical. As a long time fan of the Selling It column, I always wanted the people at Consumer's Union to compile these gems in a book. Now, they have. Columnist Leslie Ware, who edits the column for CR each month, seems to have fun with her job. She's written eleven original pieces which start each chapter that basically sum up just how gullible Americans can be. The ad clippings themselves are often surprising. Case in point- a popcorn holder shaped like an ice cream cone. This is advertised to movie theater refreshment vendors and others as a better buy than boxes for kids. Why? Kids pay more money to get what they think is more popcorn- but it actually holds LESS than the standard box or tub. There's misplaced countries ("Keep Americans Working! Made in Thailand"), lazy copywriters ("This [bag] is not a toy, etc."), those wacky sweepstakes, and more. This is a funny read that can be enjoyed over and over. It shows how much advertisers care about us (very little), and is just plain funny to boot.
