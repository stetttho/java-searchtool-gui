 From Abbott and Costello to SpongeBob and Patrick and everyone in between, all great comedy duos have worked with a simple but effective formula: The straight man who sets things in motion, and the source of comedy who is either easily furiated (such as Costello in the "Who's on First?" routine) or dumber than the straight man (such as the bumbling starfish Patrick). Now, animator Mo Willems adds another duo to this long list: Pigeon and Duckling. Pigeon was the star of Willems' first book for children, DON'T LET THE PIGEON DRIVE THE BUS!, in which he interacted with the reader by constantly pleading to drive a bus. Now, he has someone else to play off of, the cute but annoying Duckling. Duckling plays the part of the straight man as he approaches Pigeon, who is ready to greedily eat a hot dog he has found. Duckling distracts Pigeon by asking him a number of silly questions ("Would you say that it tastes like chicken?") Will Pigeon give in? Is there a possible solution to this conundrum? There is a simple lesson to be learned from this book, but it is also unique in its comedic style. An easily angred character such as Pigeon isn't seen very often in books for young children, and is a refreshing change from the goody-two-shoes, Dick-and-Jane type characters who always do the right thing. Children (and their parents) will most likely enjoy this simple story featuring a new comedic team who are sure to go far. Abbott and Costello were able to make audiences laugh with a routine about a baseball team. A routine about something as simple as a hot dog doesn't seem that far off.
