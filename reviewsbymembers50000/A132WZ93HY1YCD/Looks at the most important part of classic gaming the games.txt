 As some reviewers have written, this is not your ordinary video game history book. Many books have been written about the history of video games, and how to beat classic video games. This is neither. Sure, it is a history, so to speak, but not of the behind-the-scenes stories, but of the games themselves. The name "Nolan Bushnell" only appears three or four times in the book. I think this is a wonderful idea-as many books have been written about the history of games like Pac-Man or Donkey Kong, but not about Pac-Man and Donkey Kong themselves. This book is for the fans-those who, in the late 70s and early 80s, used their hard-earned money to see if they could beat their high score by bringing a frog across the road or making a small yellow pie-thingy eat dots and ghosts. Useless, you say? Not to them. Sellers takes a look at 50 arcade games, sorting them first by year, then by alphabetical order. He talks mostly about the gameplay, giving a couple of facts, as well as telling the events of those years in a humorous way to set the scene ("1980: US hockey team tells USSR to get the puck outta here"). Along the way, he interviews Nolan Bushnell, Bucker and Garcia of "Pac-Man Fever" fame, Eugene (Robotron) Jarvis, the curator of Videotopia-a traveling video game museum, and the owner of Twin Galaxies-at one time, the top scorekeeping arcade in America (the appearance on "That's Incredible!" helped a bit); and takes a look at strange video games, movies on video games, and the TV show "Starcade." He ponders why we stopped playing arcade games after the advent of the NES, and why Pooyan is such a bad game. A fun read for anyone who ever popped a quarter into a Pac-Man-or those, like me, who wish they could go back and really do so.
