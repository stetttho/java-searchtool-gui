 Harry Warnow (1908-1994) composed a lot of absurd music in his lifetime. Some of his compositions gained fame after Carl Stalling at Warner Bros. used them in the studio's cartoons. The life of Warnow himself may make a good cartoon: Because his early songs were performed by his brother, he took his stage name, Raymond Scott, from the phone book. He composed songs with titles like "Reckless Night on Board an Ocean Liner" and "Dinner Music for a Pack of Hungry Cannibals." He also invented electronic machines like the Electronium, which could compose music, but not write it down, and the Karloff, which could imitate sizzling steak and a man coughing. But even though he was as good an inventor as he was a composer, and a forerunner of electronic music (He was a good friend of Robert Moog), it is his early music that Scott is most remembered for. His early music performed with his Quintette (though there were six people, if you Scott as well) from 1937-1939 is collected on this album. Most of the music is quite absurd, and I can see why Stalling liked it so much-it sounds cartoony on its own. "Powerhouse," with its two different, yet similar, themes, is probably the most famous piece on the album, which seems to emulate both a wild chase and a busy factory. Some of the ideas Scott has are very inventive and mimic other things quite well (The main section of "Tobacco Auctioneer" successfully mimics a fast-talking auctioner). Scott's music was very much impromptu (He once told a clarinetist to play "Powerhouse" as if it was "something you made up"), but it is very interesting to hear this humorous, but catchy, music. Fans of this album may also like Scott's early electronic music on "Manhattan Research Inc." and the three volumes of "Soothing Sounds for Baby," or the Dutch band Beau Hunks' take on the Quintette's music on "Celebration on the Planet Mars" and "Manhattan Minuet."
