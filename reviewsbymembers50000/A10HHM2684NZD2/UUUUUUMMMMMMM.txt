 There's 2 LOA's, the River Runs Red, and the band they became after. Well, being a huge fan of their first CD, I always found it hard to get into any of their other CDs. I think River Runs Red will always be their shining Star. It just reminds me of the local NYC hardcore scene\ and how great and excitting it was back in the 90s. This is a different road for LOA, just hope they dont stay on it.
