 Team America lampoons the whole action movie genra (Idependense Day, Black Hawk Down, Peal Hardor etc...)  as well as the "F@&# Yeah!" attitude of the US Military. The whole idea that it is done with puppets makes it that much more funny and twisted. You definitley need a twisted sense of humor to enjoy this movie, and I did. Some parts were so funny I nearly cried! Also, do yourself a favor and get the unrated version.
