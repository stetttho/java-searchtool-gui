 I didnt buy into the hype when this released in theaters so I didnt go see it. despite all the great reviews. I thought the 1st one was OK. Spiderman 2 though redeems itself. A more interesting plot this time, with Doc Ock being the highlight. Good paceing and great effects make it enjoyable. Although I seeing the dough-eyed spiderman make all googly eyes over Mary Jane so many times was too much. It made my manhood shrivel up and nearly drop off. But I enjoyed it and it was worth the rental.
