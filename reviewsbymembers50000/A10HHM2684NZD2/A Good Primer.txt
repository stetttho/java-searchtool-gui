 This is a good introduction to becoming a good poker player. Most of the info is basic knowledge but it's good to hear it explained by Phil. I did find it a little bit tedious watching Phil play out 4 other player hands when trying to make a point though. It would have been much better to have other people at the same table while Phil explained instead of having him try to juggle 4 different hands at the same time. I would have also helped in fleshing out the different player types he describes early on. All in all a good lesson for a begginer.
