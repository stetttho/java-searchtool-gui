 There is finally a game that takes the GTA concept and makes it 10x better. Think GTA in vietnam or Iraq. i LOVE this game! Where in the GTA games I quickly got bored after completing half of the missions, in Mercenaries, i've beat the game once and am starting it all over again with another charecter! The maps are huge. You run through the different terrains in one of dozens of different military vehicles hunting down the 52 cards represented by 52 members of the hostile North Korean regeme.   You also can do side missions for diffent factions like the Russians, the Chinese, the South Koreans or the Allied Forces to earn money to buy equipment and armory. You can even buy air support to help you complete a mission! ( imagine calling an air strike on an enemy base and leveling the whole place with a carpet bomb as you run for your life to escape the hail storm!)  Graphics and sound are amazing. They make this game a whole lot more enjoyable. Overall, this game beats GTA hands down in fun factor. Replay value is unbeatable. One game that's actually worth the $50.00 I paid for it. Get it and see what I mean.
