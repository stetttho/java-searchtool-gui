 Nice to see Oshii putting out this great film. As others have stated, it is a slow paced cyberpunk fantasy though done wonderfully. I would like to see the original directors version after reading here that MIRAMAX changed it. English dubbing is very good. Watch it with subtitles for full effect though. If you like Anime, cyberpunk, or other such films as Blade Runner, Ghost in the Shell, Tron (one of the only GREAT disney movies) then you'll love this one.
