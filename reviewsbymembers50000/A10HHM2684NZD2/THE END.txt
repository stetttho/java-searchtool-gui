 .....Thank GOD this series is over! The first 2 movies were a joke but Lucas manages to capture a little bit of the spirit of the original Star Wars trilogy with a satisfying conclusion. (or beggining). The acting was a bit improved over the last 2. "Sith" is much darker then the previous 2 movies, (could have been a bit darker in my opinion, like Lord of the Rings was) My only gripe is the final battle between OBI WON and ANAKIN SYKWALKER was WAY TOO LONG! It was soo long it was rediculous! With them floating on lava, tumbling over each other, etc.....  Also the movie could have used some editing. A little too long at 2.5 hours. I hear Lucas is considering a Post Trilogy..... lets hope this one is better!!
