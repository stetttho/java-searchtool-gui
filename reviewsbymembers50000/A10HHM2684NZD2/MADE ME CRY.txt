 If it was the filmakers intention to bore the viewer to tears, then he made a fantastic film. I like avant garde filmaking and never cared for hollywood wiz bang blockbusters but this film was so painfully boring it made me cry.  Did the filmaker succeed in his goal for the film? In my opinion yes.
