 ... this movie started out with an interesting story but falls apart after the girl is introduced as stated by the previous reviewer. Very good start but falls to pieces by the end. On the positive side the effects are amazing. Blows away anything you'll see in any Matrix film. The cinematography is also top notch! With a strong enough plot this would have made an amazing movie.
