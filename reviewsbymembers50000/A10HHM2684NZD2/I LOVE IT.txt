 I commute an hour to and from work every day by train. I dont have time to play my PS2 anymore... now I can take it with me! The PSP has everything I could ever want in a portable entertainment device! It's a gaming unit, MP3 player, movie player, picture viewer and now with software update 2.0, wireless web browser and much more! The PSP is still a baby. There is so much potential I can see with future software releases like global GPS which Sony has already announced. As for the games, there is a whole new crop of games due out this fall and if it's any indication by the PS2, there will be many many more to come.  The only minus I see is the need purchase for an additional 1GIG stick. The 32MG that sony provides is just useless. Firewire instead of USB port would also have been nice. The MP3 player is very basic, though Sony can change that with future software releases. The UMD disks are OK but a bit slow on the loading. The games too are also a bit pricey but I can see that leveling off in due time. I recomend for an extra 20 bucks going out and buying a screen protector and a rubber skin for the PSP that Pelican makes (similar to the ipod one). Other then these minor gripes, I love my PSP, wouldnt trade it for anything!
