 A look into the home of a white trash hillbilly family taken sometime in the mid 1980's. Most of the video contains clips of practicle jokes a family plays on their slobbenly drunk uncle, "Uncle Goddamn". Jokes like lighting his crotch on fire and taping his head up. Some of it is cruel and hilarious, almost to the point that you feel bad laughing at it. Especially funny are the extra clips of the other drunk members of the family like "Pappy". If you like Jackass, here is their inspiration!
