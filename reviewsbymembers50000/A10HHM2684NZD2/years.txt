 I thought I'd right a review now being 10 years after this CD was released (WOW has it been that long!?) Quicksand influenced MANY bands and pretty much started the whole emo-core scene in the early-mid 90s. It's nice to listen again to this CD and here that it still sounds as fresh today as it did back then.
