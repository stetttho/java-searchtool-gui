 This movie is all about effects. Great ones at that. The story is not up  to par against any of the original Star Wars movies. THe acting was horrible to say the least. Hayden Christiansen was the worst actor of the bunch. The very unbelieveable"love" story was so painful to watch it made me almost embarrassed for the poor kid. With 2 misses in the Star Wars prequil, I dont expect much of the 3rd installment. I'll stick to watching the much better original Star Wars series on DVD.
