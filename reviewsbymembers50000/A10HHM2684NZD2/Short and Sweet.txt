 Ah the memories.... getting my head stopped on by a crowd of crazed adrenaline charged moshers... those were the good ol days. I remember the NYC hardcore scene back in the early-mid 90s... bands like Madball, Bulldoze, 25 to life, Dog Eat Dog (to name a few) dominated the scene. Music has turned many different corners since then. It's always nice to pull out this Hatebreed CD (or Mp3s now)and listen to one of the finest examples of east coast hardcore. Put it on and crank it up!
