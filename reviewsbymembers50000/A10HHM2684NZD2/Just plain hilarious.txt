 I purchased this DVD right after I rented it! I don't play Scrabble and never have  but I found this behind the scenes peek into the Scrabble subculture utterly hilarious and fascinating. Marlon was a great addition to the cast even though many here disagree. He added the comic element.Yes he smoked pot and used foul language but you cant help but laugh. The extra footage is nice to see as well. While the documentary Spellbound was warm and charming, Word Wars was more raw and aggressive and utterly hilarious.
