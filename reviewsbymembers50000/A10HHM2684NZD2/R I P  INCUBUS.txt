 I'm so disapointed at this band. SCIENCE was so fresh and inovative, Finally, a band to replace the mighty Faith No More I thought..... wrong! Every release since SCIENCE has been a turn to radio friendlyness, not that that's a bad thing, put when you have so much creativity and talent as Incubus obviously showed with thier first major release, I would expect them not to sell themselves short by catering to making radio friendly hits.
