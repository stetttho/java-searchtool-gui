 I love japanese film. I really wanted this to be good. Even though I liked the character development and the plot was ok I just couldnt get into this. I actually fell asleep.... twice! The camera work at times can be interesting but some scenes are way too drawn out without really going anywhere. The mood and pace of the film is very monotone and flatline, especially for a film that touts itself as being this grand rollercoaster ride. And in response to another reviewer here, Taranteno does take alot from asian cinema, but asian cinema borrows alot from western culture as well, at this point there is alot of equal give and take. If you want to see an interesting so called "cool" japanese film see Samurai Fiction instead.
