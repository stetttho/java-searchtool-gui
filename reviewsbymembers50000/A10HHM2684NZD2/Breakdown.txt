 I got his CD when it first released back in 93. I remember saying to myself.... holy $H*! this is genious! Crowbar essencially took the breakdowns found in NYC hardcore music, wound them down to 2 miles an hour and turned them into full fledged songs!   I honestly didnt keep up with Crowbar after thier 2nd release. I never realized they released so many CDs. I've heard a few of them but quite frankly their first 2 CDs still stand out as their best efforts.
