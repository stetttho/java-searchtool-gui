 Max is back! An amazing CD from start to finish. I was a HUGE fan of Sepultura back in the day but lost track of anyhting Max did after ROOTS. This is my first time listening to Soulfly (believe it or not) and i'm glad I picked it up! I love all the experimentation , sounds very fresh mixing all the world music styles together. THis is what I imagined what Sepultura would have sounded like if they were still together with Max today. I also love the HELMET cover of In the Meantime... just awsome!
