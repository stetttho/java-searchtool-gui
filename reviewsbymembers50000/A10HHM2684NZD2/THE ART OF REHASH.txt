 Did I just step into a time warp? It's fine and all to be into the old school metal. Hey I loved bands like Testiment and Anthrax back in the days, and dont forget the kings of metal...Iron Maiden! But trying to do what has been done by a million other bands before, and not as good, is just plain boring and just a rehash. Leave this type of metal in the 80s where it belongs.
