 well, at least the effects were good. Actually the story wasnt that bad. Ron Perlman is a great actor and if you want to see him in an amazing fantasy/gothic film check out City of Lost Children (WHICH IS AMAZING!) As for Hellboy, I thouht it could have been much better. I think it could also have had a darker tone. The cinematography was great and so were the effects but the story and the way it was told could have used a little more work. After listening to Del Toro's and Miliola's commentary on Hellboy, I discovered things about the story that there was no way I would have figured it out if the director himself hadnt explained it. The love story was pathetic I thought. Didnt need it in the film. Also, the commentary was very self centered, Del Toro and Miliola constantly refering to themselves in the 3rd person got really annoying, you would have that that Hellboy was this genious creation when in reality it's nothing more then a few other well known comic characters rolled into one. All in all rent it and have fun.
