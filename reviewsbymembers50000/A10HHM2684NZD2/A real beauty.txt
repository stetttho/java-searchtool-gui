 I loved GT3 on the PS2. THe realness was fantastic, but it suffered one problem, after a while it just wasnt fun! As great and realistic as the game is it just wasnt as fun as Need for Speed - Hot Pursuit. Now comes Forza... hands down the BEST racing game I have played period! Adds the realism of Grand Tourismo with the fun factor of Need For Speed Underground.   It's great that Forza has the option of using the left stick for periferral vision too.... but I wished it was smoother looking all the way around the car like you see when looking to the front right and left corners rather then the straight cuts you see when looking back and to the back corners.  All in all a great racing game!
