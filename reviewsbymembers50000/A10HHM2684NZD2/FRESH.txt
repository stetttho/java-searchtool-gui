 My friend turned me on to OutKast knowing I was a HUGE fan of Fishbone. I listed to it and was hooked! I love the fact that they're all over the place... not predictable like alot of radio hip hop out now. Although not as good as Fishbone in my opinion, still great and as innovative a group as your going to hear.
