 A good fantasy movie. Dark and sinister. This DVD was obviously put out at this time because of the success of Lord of the Rings.   The directors cut is better then the US version. The devil isnt shown till the end in the directors cut which makes for more suspense. Plus the US musical score was down right cheezy with 80s synth pop dubbed over. As for Tom Cruise, he's the worst part of the movie (as goes with any of his movies ). Tim Curry is whats makes this film shine. It would be interested to see what this movie would look like if Ridley Scott had done this in the 90s??
