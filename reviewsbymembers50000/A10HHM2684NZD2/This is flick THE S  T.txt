 If you are a collector of old school kung fu then you MUST have this in your collection! One of the best to come out during the golden era of the Shaw Bros. Also make sure you pick up the 1st DVD release as the picture is more acurate to what was released at the time it came out. And the dubbing is more what you came to expect of a great action packed old school flick. The new DVD release is a little too slick and polished for my taste and the dubbing is way off as one reviewer stated here.
