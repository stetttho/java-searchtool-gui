 Not to bemoan the people of small town america but i'm glad I had the good fortune to grow up in a big city. Seeing the insane obession of people who live there lives for high school football is hilarous! If you love football and are from a small town, you'll root through the whole film, if you don't live in a small town and don't care for football, you'll chuckle through most of it. I recommend watching "Hands on a Hard Body" after seeing this, another great doc.
