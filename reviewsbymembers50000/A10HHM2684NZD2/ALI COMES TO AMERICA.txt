 I remember seeing Ali on an import DVD years ago before he hit the big time here in the US. Funny as all hell! One of the few comics that can make my sides split! This DVD is good but if you want to see Ali at his best, try to hunt down his early UK released DVDs. And contrary to what some other reviewer stated here, Madonna didnt discover Ali.... he was already a very successful comic in the UK before hitting it here in the USA.
