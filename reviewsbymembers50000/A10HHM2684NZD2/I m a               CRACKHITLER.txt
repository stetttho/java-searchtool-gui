 I remember this CD coming out at the same time Pearl Jam released their first CD and the Red Hot Chili Peppers released "Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magic". I picked it up and was blown away! Never had I heard anything like it. THis CD would remain in rotation in my CD player on and off for the next 10 years! Every song is a gem. Mike Patton and Faith No More went out on a limb and did their own thing without being concerned about their CD selling to the masses....while influencing a whole genra of music over the last 10 years! If you dont have this, pick it up. This is a classic.  It's great to see also that still to this day, even though FNM is no longer around, Mike Patton is pushing the bounds and still making great innovative music.   PS: FNM reunion tour in 2006!
