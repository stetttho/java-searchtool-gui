 OK if youlike your music ala Limp Bisket, Trap, Papa Roach etc. then go pick up something else. But if you like music with more depth and creativity then pick up this Taproot.Excellent musicianship all around. If you like Taproot then check out Stillsuit...... a fantastic emocore band out of NYC, unfortunatley they disbanded but put out an AWSOME ep"Green Spock Ears" and an OK full length CD called "At the Speed of Light".....
