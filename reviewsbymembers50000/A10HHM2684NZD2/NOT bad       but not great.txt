 The script was ok. It could have been a great movie but fell apart after the big horse race started in my opinion. It turned from what could have been an interesting look at how they made it through the desert ordeal, to a cheesy hollywood script that included him rescueing a princess then going on to win the race with the help of his ancestors.... corny! I'd rather take out my Indiana Jones DVDs and watch them instead.
