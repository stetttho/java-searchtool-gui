 STAIN has been in my CD players rotation now for the last 10 years! No joke. A masterpiece of a recording that manages to alwayts sound fresh and current. Masterpiece for sure. When i heard LC were coming out with a new release I had my fingers crossed. Now I have to say it is no STAIN but very good non the less. Their sound is different. A great experiment by Vernon and the rest of the guys. I cant argue with it. They wanted a unique sound that set them apart from the sound we are hearing today and it works. (Ala Smashing Pumkins with their sound on Siamese Dream) Song wise, LC retain the dark edge from STAIN and pull a few musical inventions along the way. All in all a STAIN is a 10 where this release is an 8.5. Still not bad at all. I can only imagine this CD getting up to a 10 with time.
