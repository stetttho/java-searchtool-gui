 it can use some imrovments. I'll run through them quickly... 1st, there needs to be a way  2 players can chalenge each other for a belt title. THat would up the fun factor scale. 2nd, THey should do away with the 2 different Creat a Boxers. Meaning, that you have to crerat one boxer to play in Career and one boxer for the Head to Head mode. That takes all the fun out of developing your boxer and pitting him up against your freinds Creat-a-Boxer because your friend can put all his stats up to MAX and your let with the weeker figher!! Just ONE Creat-a-BOxer for the career mode would be good enough. Other then that the game is AMAZING! Oh and if you MUST have TYSON in the game, just creat him!
