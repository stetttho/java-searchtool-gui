 .... that should be the Amazon suggestion on purchasing this DVD with another. Just fantastic! I loved Showgirls, it has all the makings of a classic cult film, main stream flop, bad dialoge, campyness that is not ment to be, T & A, please..... what more so you want! Buy this with the movie GLITTER for a real treat!
