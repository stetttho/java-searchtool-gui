 I dont know were to start. It felt like I was watching a cheezy made-for-TV movie! Like I was watching a bad Miami Vice episode or something! I was hoping this movie would have been cool. Even though the first Punisher movie with Dolf wasnt that great either it certainly is better then this. So far the only really GREAT comic book movie Marvel has put out is Spiderman  (1&2)Hulk was ok too. PLEASE! I just hope the Fantastic Four is good!
