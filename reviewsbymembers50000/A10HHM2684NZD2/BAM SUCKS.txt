 The most annoying show on MTV, that's saying alot because there are alot of annoying shows on MTV but Viva La Bam tops them all!! All the pranks they pull on their family was funny at first but after a while it was just lame and predictable. The BEST show ever on MTV will always be JACKASS followed closely Tom Green and WILDBOYZ.
