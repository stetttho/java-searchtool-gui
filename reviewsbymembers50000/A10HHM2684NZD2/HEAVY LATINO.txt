 Great! I just love Puya. For me, there are truely a Latino band playing Latino music, just in a heavy way. While Sepultura did there thing back in the day (and undoubtedly paved the way for bands like Puya) Pua is the only band i've heard that truely puts the latin music center stage and enhances it with heavyness. Ill Nino is good, but I think they are more subtle in weaving the latin sound into the music where as Puya really play Latin music like salsa and merengue and make it heavy. 5 Stars!
