 I thought this was better then HERO. I enjoyed the story more and like HERO, the effects were used only to enhance the mythical story not overwhelm it. At heart this is a love story, with bits a revenge and betrayal mixed in. The production value is outstanding. Great to see this on a good home theater setup as stated by another reviewer. I really look forward to seeing the next Yimou Zhang project.
