 Fantastic game! mixes the best of Metal of Honor: Frontline and Full Spectrum Warrior. If you like either of these 2 games you'll love Brother In Arms. The gameplay is what Full Spectrum Warrior should have been like. Great mix of action and strategy! The unlockables are great too giving the player insight into WWII. A MUST own if you like military style games.
