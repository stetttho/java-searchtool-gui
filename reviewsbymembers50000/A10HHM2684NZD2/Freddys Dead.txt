 I recently decided to buy it having never seen the movie. Although I heard all about it. I have to say this one of the BEST dvds I own! It's down and dirty, big attitude flick that just exudes style. This film has it all... pimps, hustlers, big cars, fedoras, fur coats, nude women, and dont forget the music! The soundtrack is a perfect fit. I love the authentic feel of the whole thing. The film grain and the mono soundtrack help to establish that. The commetary is right on the money as well. The other extras are nice too. GET THIS!
