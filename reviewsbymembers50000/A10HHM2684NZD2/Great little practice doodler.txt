 This is a great little device if you want to take it along somewhere and practice. I wouldnt recomend it as a replacment for an actual drum kit though. If you are really serious about practicing i'd recommend getting the DTXpress III which Yamaha makes as well. It's an excellent replacment for an acoustic kit. Tons of preset and programable drum kits, tracks and voices. Plus it's an actual full sized electronic drum kit so it's like playing an actual kit.
