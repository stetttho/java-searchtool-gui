 JUSTICE FOR ALL is Metallica's BEST sounding record ever! Very raw dry as bone drum and base sound with super thickley layered wall of guitars. Anyone listening to Metal during the late 80's, early 90s will remember the slickly over produced over the top sounds of metal bands of the day. When Metalica released JUSTICE, it was like a big slap in the face. It changed the course of metal for years to come. This record did for Metal what Nervana's NeverMind did for pop rock at at the time. For all you youngins out there, pick this up and prepare to be schooled.
