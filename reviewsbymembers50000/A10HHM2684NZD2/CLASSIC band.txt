 Being from NYC, I had the pleasure of seeing these guys play around town from time to time in the hardcore scene. ORANGE 9mm was one of those really great underground bands that stayed relativley underground for most of it's short career. While I thought TRAGIC was kind of shallow in the musc dept. this CD and their first( Driver not Included) were their best. If you havnt had the pleasure of hearing this New York Hardcore band's music, do yourself a favore and pick this up!
