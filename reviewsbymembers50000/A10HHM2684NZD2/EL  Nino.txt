 The best!!! I remember when these guys were called EL Nino, then they got sued because another band had the same name. All that aside this is the BEST latin metal band, scratch that, They are the best metal band period to come around in a while since maybe Deftones. Hard heavy and great songwriting mixed with the latin flair. Awsome!!
