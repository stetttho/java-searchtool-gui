 I remember back inthe 80s, saturday afternoon kung fu movies on TV, the Kung Fu triple feature matinees at the local downtown theater. These old school films remain some of the most entertaining and thrilling movie experiences to date(even inspite of all that CGI!).   Chop Socky explains the story of how Chinese cinema was born with emphisis on the martial arts movies. It offers a good ecapsulated overview. Taking you through the early 1920s up to the present day. My only gripe is that it was too short. Not enough in the special features. There also should have been more on the Shaw Bros Studios. After all... they WERE fung fu theater during the 70s and 80s! Despite that, this is a must to own if you call yourself a fan of the genra.
