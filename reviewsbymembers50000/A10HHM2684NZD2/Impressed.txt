 WOW, I was pleasantly surprised after renting this! The sci-fi/Anime genra has always been original in asian cinema, no acception here. Homage is paid to films like ET, Terminator, Matrix, the Transformers and even Polterguist (anyone pick up the "they're here" line?) What this movie lacks in originality it makes up for in music, production, special effects and acting. (Yes I said acting!) There is a very strange pace to the whole movie, as any westerner that has ever watched a japanese film will notice, but it makes it all the more interesting. Overall a great movie that will give any hollywood production a run for it's money! Oh, and do yourself a favor and watch this movie in it's original japanese language with english subtitles on... it makes a BIG difference in the overall feel of the movie. Watch it twice, once with subtitles and once with english dubbing and you'll see the difference.
