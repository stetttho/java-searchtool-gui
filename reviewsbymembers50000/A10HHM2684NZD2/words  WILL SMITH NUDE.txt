 The movie starts off with our "lovable" action hero Will Smith waking up from bed completley nude. We can tell right off the bat that this is a typical Will Smith ego film fest. The story is good enough, but the fact that WIll Smith is just a "    " bag, (you fill in the blank) makes this movie unwatchable. A good movie about Man vs Machine is the anime "Ghost in the Shell" or Blade Runner. I-Robot done in another way with another lead actor would have propelled it further.
