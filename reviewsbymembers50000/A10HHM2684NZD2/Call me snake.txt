 This movie spawned one of the greatest movie posters of all time! A classic scene of Snake, the President and the rest of the gang running from the Duke of NY and his thugs with the severed head of the Statue of Liberty in the background. The greatest image in movie poster history!   I remember the image of NYC back in the early 80s was rather scary. It wasnt a place you wanted to be walking around alone at night... and I bet this movie didnt help tourism much for NYC either! Although im my mind, the movie doesnt live up quite to the great image of the poster, it is a great cult classic all the same. The acting was a bit lazy in some spots and the action scenes seemed a little week but the movie as a whole made a big impression on the minds of many people during the Reagan 80's. Dark, Sinister, Comical, Irreverent, this movie made it's mark. If you like this mivie i'd also recommend The Warriors.
