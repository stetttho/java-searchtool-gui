 I greatly enjoyed this! It was like watching an action packed 1940s adventure/Sci-fi comic book come to life! The pacing, the story, the acting, the feel and look all nailed down that whole 30s/40s art deco/streamlined futuristic experience. If you have a huge screen and a home theater system this is worth a buy.  The special features were enjoyable too. Just because it was nice to see how this unknown guy and his brother from nowhere was able to make this dream and vision come to life in a big way.
