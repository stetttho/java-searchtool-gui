 This is a grity movie about the impoverished lives of a gang of youths in one of Brazils poorest districts and how one boy tries to rise above to escape it all. Really a fantastic film with tons of style and very well told. If you can take the reality of the violence, it is a must see.  If you like this film check out Carandiru, Just as good as COG. About Brazils most notorious prison. It could actually be viewed as a continuation of City of God seeing as the end of City of God actually flows into Carandiru.
