 My only comlaint was the length of the film. At 3 hours it's a bit overkill and with an additional 5 hours of footage on the second disk, it's overkill x10. Taking it in doses like I did, is a better way to approach this DVD package. As for the content, it's a first rate look at corporate america, it's history, it's role in society and it's potential harm to our livelyhood and our future. Unlike "Mr. Moore's" documentaries, this one takes a more analitical approach to the subject of corporate greed. Recommended for anyone interested in knowing more about this capitalist home we call America.
