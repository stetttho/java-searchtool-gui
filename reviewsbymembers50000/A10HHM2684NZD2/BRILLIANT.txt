 Being from Brooklyn I can't help but respect these guys. All of them are briliant musicians! Although this CD is more "radio"then their others, it shows another side of them that is new and refreshing. I mean, even the most die hard Canderia fan doesnt want to hear 100% Density all over again do they? And I read one reviewer say that rap is the most hated genra in metal? Well if your from Brooklyn and if you've seen these guys play in Brooklyn, especially in the early days, you'll know that there are just as many "Rap" guys that go to see their shows as so called "metal" guys. Enough of lables, this CD is 100% Canderia. Love it.
