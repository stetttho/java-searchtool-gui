 I had this CD in my collection. Not sure were I picked it up, dont even remember ever listening to it! Anyway I popped it in my CD player. All I can Say is where has this CD been and why havnt I heard this before!? I was a real hardcore kid in the 90s and this CD represents some of the best of hardcore music from the NYC/Tri-State area at the time along with Orange 9mm, Dog Eat Dog, Quicksand, Tree etc..  Super tight and heavy, growling disgruntled vocals with great melody. If you can find this then pick it up and add this to your collection for sure.
