 There are many Nelson and Jeanette CD's out there and this is one of the best. It has duets from all their best loved movies including Maytime and New Moon. There are also a couple of songs from Nelson and Jeanette's solo projects. I never get tired of hearing their beautiful version of Will You Remember or Jeanette singing Italian Street Song. All the songs are winners and the sound quality is excellent!
