 Betty Grable was one of the most popular actresses of the 1940s and unlike many other stars she could really sing! This is a terrific collection of her songs. Many of them are live performances you won't find anywhere else. A couple of highlights are Betty's sweet version of Cuddle Up A Little Closer and a duet with Dick Powell. I play this CD all the time. If you're a fan of Betty you need to get this one!
