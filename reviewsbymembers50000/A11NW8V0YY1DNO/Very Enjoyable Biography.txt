 This is the most enjoyable movie star biography I have read in a long time. If you're a fan of classic movies then you have probably seen at least one of Marjorie Main's films (The Women, Turnabout, Meet Me In St. Louis). Marjorie was one of the greatest character actresses of all-time but until now not much has been known about her private life. This book tells Marjorie's complete life story from her childhood to her unconventional marriage to the rumors about her sexuality. There is also detailed information about all of her movies and lots of rare photos. It is well-written and kept my interest right until the end. You definitely won't be disappointed in this one. After reading it you will want to run out and get all of Marjorie's movies!!!
