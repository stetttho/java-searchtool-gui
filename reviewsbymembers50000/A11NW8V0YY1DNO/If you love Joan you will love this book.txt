 If you are a fan of Joan Fontaine you will definitely enjoy this book. It isn't very long but there is quite a bit of information about Joan's personal life and the rivalry between Joan and her sister, Olivia de Havilland. The book also has excerpts of letters Joan sent to the author and a complete filmography. What makes this book really terrific is that it has more than seventy photos of Joan!
