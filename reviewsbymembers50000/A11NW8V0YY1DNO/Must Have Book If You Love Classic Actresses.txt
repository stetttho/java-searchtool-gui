 This book is wonderful! It really does feature all of the greatest classic actresses - Clara Bow, Norma Shearer, Marion Davies, Myrna Loy, Gene Tierney, Lana Turner, Jean Harlow, Rita Hayworth, Marilyn Monroe, Mary Pickford, Irene Dunne, Joan Crawford, and many more. There are lots of photos and interesting trivia about all the actresses. The book devotes four pages to each actress which includes at least one full page photo. The photos alone are worth the price of the book! There are also complete filmographies for every actress in the back. I would recommend this book to everyone who loves classic actresses.
