 This is a book that any classic movie fan will love. It is filled with gorgeous photos of movie stars modeling swimwear. Many of the photos are in color and I have never seen them published anywhere else. Paulette Goddard, Betty Grable, Carole Landis, Gene Tierney, Marie McDonald, and Marilyn Monroe are among the many actresses featured in this terrific book. There is also a nice forward written by Ann Rutherford.
