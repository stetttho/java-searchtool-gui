 I was very disappointed with this book. It contains hundreds of movies star obituaries and I liked that it featured many lesser known stars. Unfortunately the author gets many facts wrong! For example Jean Harlow did get medical treatment and Carole Landis was born in 1919, not 1917. If you're interested in learning about classic movie stars there are better books out there.
