 I bought this book because it included a chapter about the wonderful Carole Landis. I also really enjoyed reading about all the other Hollywood stars who were born in Wisconsin. This book is very well-written and I learned a lot about stars I didn't know much about before. There aren't many photos but overall it's a great book for movie fans.
