 I have read many books about Joan Crawford and I think Joan Crawford: Her Life In Letters is one of the best. When I bought this book I was expectingit to bejust aseriesof Joan's letters but it was so much more. The book is a combination of a Joan biography and Joantelling her story in herown words. You learn about Joan's career, her marriages, and her rivalry with Bette Davis. The author also does a great job defending Joan against accusations Christina Crawford made in her book Mommie Dearest. There is a nice forward by Joan's grandson and some rare photos. This is one Joan Crawford book even Joan would enjoy reading!
