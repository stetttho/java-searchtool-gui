 This is a terrific book! It's a large coffee table book with rare photos of Jayne Mansfield, Jean Harlow, Judy Garland, Carole Lombard, and Marilyn Monroe in their homes. You get to see Jayne in her heart shaped bathtub, Jean looking at her autograph collection, and Judy singing in her bedroom. There are also some wonderful articles written by David Stenn, Gerald Clarke, and others. The book has some current actors in it too (John Travolta, Diane Keaton). It would make a wonderful gift for a classic film fan.
