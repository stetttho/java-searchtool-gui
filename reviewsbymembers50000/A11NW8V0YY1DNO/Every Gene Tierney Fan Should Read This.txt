 This book is fabulous - very well written and very entertaining! It starts out with a beautiful forward written by Gene's daughter, Christina. The book tells Gene's complete life story from her privileged childhood to her battle with mental illness. You learn about her troubled marriage to Oleg Cassini and her love affairs with a future President and a Prince. Throughout the book there are dozens of beautiful, rare photos of Gene. The pictures alone are worth the price of the book! There is also a very detailed filmography with trivia about all of Gene's films. You get to know the real woman behind the glamorous image. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves Gene Tierney or classic movies.
