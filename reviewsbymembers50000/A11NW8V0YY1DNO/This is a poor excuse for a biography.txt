 I have adored Jeanette MacDonald for many years and I was very disappointed with this biography. This is not Jeanette's complete life story. Too many of her love affairs, illnesses, and scandals are ignored. There is a debate about whether or not Jeanette was in love with Nelson Eddy. Instead of trying to give us a definitive answer the author makes Nelson look like a jerk and makes Gene Raymond (Jeanette's widow) look like a saint. It seems like the only source for information was Gene Raymond, a failed actor whose only claim to fame was being married to Jeanette. I have come to the conclusion that many people who claim to be a fan of Jeanette only like her because they think she was a virginal bride who led a perfect life. Her true fans know she was a human being who had problems and made mistakes. Instead of spending your money on this terrible book I suggest you buy a copy of Maytime and see the real Jeanette.
