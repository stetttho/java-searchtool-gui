 This is a terrific biography that every Carole Landis fan should read! Carole is portrayed as a smart, ambitious, kind, but very insecure woman who made a lot bad choices when it came to the men in her life. I felt like I got to know the real Carole and I understand more about why she did the things that she did. The book reveals a lot about Carole's childhood (like who her real  father was), clears up some bad rumors (there is no proof she ever worked as a prostitute), and gives a very detailed account of her final days. The book has a lot of information about Carole's films (including a complete filmography). There are also many photos I had never seen before. I think all of Carole's fans will be very pleased with this book.
