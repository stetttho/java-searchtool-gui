 If you're interested in visiting celebrity graves you must get this book. There are detailed directions and helpful hints for visiting all the major cemeteries around Los Angeles. With this book you'll be able to spend some time with stars like Carole Landis, Rita Hayworth, Marilyn Monroe, Bette Davis, and Janet Gaynor. There aren't many photos but that's because some of the cemeteries wouldn't allow them. I take this book with me every time I visit California and it's always very helpful.
