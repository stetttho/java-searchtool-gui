 Children Of Hollywood by Michelle Vogel is one of the best books I have read this year! The book is filled with interesting, never-before-heard stories about classic actors and actresses. You get to find out what Tyrone Power, Ruth Hussey, Douglas Fairbanks, and Bing Crosby were really like as parents. These stories all come right from the their children and you won't find them anywhere else. There is a also a terrific chapter about actresses who never had children. The photos in the book are great too! If you're a fan of classic Hollywood then you will definitely enjoy reading this book. It would also make a wonderful Mother's Day or Father's Day gift.
