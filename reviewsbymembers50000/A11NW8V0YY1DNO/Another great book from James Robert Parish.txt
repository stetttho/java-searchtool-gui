 James Robert Parish is one of my favorite authors. His books are always a lot of fun to read and filled with juicy stories. This one has profiles of many great classic actresses including Paulette Goddard, Betty Hutton, Jayne Mansfield, Lana Turner, Jeanette MacDonald, and Norma Shearer. My one complaint is that there are too many current stars featured in the book.
