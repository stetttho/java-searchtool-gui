 This book was expensive but I'll buy any book that includes chapters about Lucille Ball and Joan Blondell. I was disappointed that there wasn't a lot of new information about them. Classic film buffs might find the other chapters interesting. The photos are very nice. I wish the filmographies were more thorough (they don't include character names, studios, or directors). A man must have come up with the silly title because a woman would never call another woman a fruit!
