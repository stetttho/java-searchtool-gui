 Both my 2-year-old and 4-year-old love Little People.  The van is a favorite.  The sounds are pretty quiet.  They cycle through the song, horn beep, and baby cry/laugh.  The new design has a much larger sack of groceries to keep small people from swallowing them.  You can't go wrong with Little People!
