 My daughter got this toy when she was one month old.  She is now 12 months old.  We have had it in her crib since the day we got it.  In that time we have changed the batteries three times.  My daughter calms right down when we put her in the crib and turn on the music and lights.  In the night when she wakes up and rolls against it it helps her get herself back to sleep.  Even when she was only a few months old she would immediately turn towards the lights and watch them until she fell asleep.  Some of the other reviews have complained that the cloth won't stay put.  There is a locking mechanism on the back that keeps everything in place.  Make sure you read the instructions and this shouldn't be a concern.
