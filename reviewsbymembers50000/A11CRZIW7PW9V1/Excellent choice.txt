 We have had this wagon for almost four years now. After heavy use, some abuse, and getting it in and out of the trunk it is still in excellent condition. If you have small children at home or just visiting this is a great item to have. We have taken countless walks with our wagon. It is especially helpful when we go to the zoo or to a festival where the little ones will get tired from all the walking. It will easily seat three toddler to preschool size children. A sleeping baby can happily snooze in comfort.  There are several accessories you can purchase (umbrella, pads, etc) that can help make it even more useful. My children like to pull it around the driveway. When it is empty it is light enough to do this. Dolls and bears enjoy riding in it too! The wagon is difficult turn over if you make a sharp turn because of a wide turning radius. The quality is outstanding.  We keep it in the garage when it is not in play.  As with any wood item it will not handle being left outside too much which is to be expected. To fit it into our car trunk (Dodge Stratus) we have to take off the sides and fold the handle under the wagon bed.  It fits in our van behind the rear seat in the same manner. You can't go wrong when buying this wagon.
