 As with many other reviewers I find some of the spoken letters to be hard to distinguish.  F and S are very hard to tell apart.  The only real trouble is those two letters.  Even with brand new fresh batteries, it doesn't help.  It is still a useful toy though.  My daughter didn't really start to play with it until right around her third birthday.  She now visually recognizes almost all letters.  She learned this in about one month's time. This is an ok toy but expect some frustration with similar sounding letters.  If you buy it at a real store try out all of the ones on hand to see if one sounds better than the next.
