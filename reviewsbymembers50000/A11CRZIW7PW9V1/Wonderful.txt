 My daughter just got this toy for her first birthday.  She likes taking the stars off.  She is starting to try to put them back on.  Each time a star is removed or put on the lights come on and a shimmery musical sound is heard.  When the top piece is put on or pressed you hear a song.  The songs include: Twinkle Little Star Bach: Brandenburg Concerto #3 Vivaldi: Spring Strauss: Blue Danube Waltz (I think..) Here We Go Looby Loo Not only does my one-year-old like the toy but it is hard to get it away from her three-year-old sister.  Fifty-five year-old Grandma tried to keep it too!  It is really cute and sounds nice.  I'm glad to hear the classical music!
