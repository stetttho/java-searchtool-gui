 My daughters enjoy playing with this toy.  It is well made and extremely durable.  Everything functions as it should.  It is also really cute. My problems with this toy come as a music educator.  The first and least important problem is that it only has six notes (Do to La).  This is annoying but not really a problem.  The major problem is that the whole thing is opposite of what it ought to be.  Pianos, keyboards, xylophones, etc all have notes progressing from lowest to highest starting on the left.  This is backwards.  The lowest notes are on the right.  It is extremely annoying to this piano player.  Music education starts with this kind of toy.  It is unconscionable to have this kind of gross error from a company that prides itself on the educational value of its toys.
