 We got this toy as a Christmas present for my daughter when she was 2.  She immediately took to it.  She likes to draw and have us draw.  We work on her alphabet on it.  When she first had it she was a bit rough with the 'pencil'.  There are a few dents in the writing surface as a result.  It should be kept off the floor because stepping on it causes the same results.  All in all it is a great toy.  She is still using it a year later.
