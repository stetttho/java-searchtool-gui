 The toy comes with a male and a female officer.  Either one fits in the police car.  The traffic light can be 'changed' by turning the knob on top.  It is a bit hard for a small child to turn without assistance. This is a good set to use by itself or with any other Little People playset.  The car works well with the Fun Sounds Garage. My 3-year-old daughter has enjoyed all of her Little People toys.  This is no exception.
