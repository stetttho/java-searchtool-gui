 If you are taking a music history course that uses A History of Western Music (Grout) then this would be a helpful study guide.  It has a brief overview of the main points of each chapter.  There are then many questions to answer about that chapter.  It also uses the Norton recordings and Anthology of Western Music.  If you did all the work in this book you would definitely do well in your course.  The chapter overviews do NOT contain enough information to avoid reading the Grout text in case you wanted to be lazy. I would highly recommend this for undergraduate or graduate music students taking a general music history course.
