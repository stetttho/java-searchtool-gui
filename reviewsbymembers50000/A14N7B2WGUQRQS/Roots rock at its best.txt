 I have always been a Refreshments fan, but kind of dropped off when they split and it was a while before I realized Roger was still putting out great music.  I happened to be in Spokane on business this past fall, and saw that Roger and his Peacemakers were playing at the Big Easy.  One of those better decisions in my life deciding to go.  What a great show, and I hadn't heard a lot of his post-Refreshments stuff (although he played plenty of his Refreshments music) but all the songs were instantly likeable and good.  So I got Americano.  Truly an excellent CD.  Now I happen to favor his slower numbers-- "Switchblade," "Your Name on a Grain of Rice" and "Leave an Open Door" are my favorites, but the whole album is great for a rocking, rootsy listen.  Roger's lyrical imagery has always brought me right to the dusty, hot but beautiful Southwest, and his storytelling and heartfelt musicianship are truly superb.  Roger Clyne does not compromise-- he writes and sings exactly what he wants to and what he is good at.  It's too bad he has not garnered more credit and attention, although it makes it kind of nice since he plays at such small, intimate venues and you can actually meet him/buy his band a beer after the show.  I have introduced this album to about a half-a-dozen people so far, and they have all loved it.  It is one of my favorites of last year, and if I ever get a chance to see him live again I will do it in a heartbeat.
