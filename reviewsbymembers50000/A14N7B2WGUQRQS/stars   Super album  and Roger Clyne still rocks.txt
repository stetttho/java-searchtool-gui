 A close runner-up to FFBB, this is an excellent CD.  Although out of the gate, Tributary Otis sounds almost like a Gin Blossoms single, the Refreshments get back to business with classic-sounding barn-burners like Preacher's Daughter and Wanted, before settling down a bit to my favorite on the CD, Sin Nombre, which once again brings you back to the Southwest feeling saddle-sore like the song's cowboy.  The rest of the CD is great.  It's too bad the Refreshments broke up, but Roger Clyne is still rocking with his band the Peacemakers and putting out great music, upholding the quality in the Refreshments' work.  Still, you can't go wrong with either of the Refreshments CD's, and The Bottle & Fresh Horses is a superb listen.
