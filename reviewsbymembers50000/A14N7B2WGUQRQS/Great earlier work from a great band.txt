 Really about 3.6 stars.  I have been kind of working backwards with Alkaline Trio-- I started with Good Mourning, which I loved, then got Crimson, which at first I didn't like as much but now really love, so I got Maybe I'll Catch Fire and am waiting for Goddammit to come it too.    At first listen I noticed right away how far the Trio have come in tightening up their sound-- mostly in the vocals realm as Maybe I'll Catch Fire is almost a little raw and wobbly both in the singers' tone and harmonizing-- but this was 5 years before the polished Crimson CD.    So I think this is a great reference listen for the Trio-- you can see they are building up their musical base and there are some great, catchy numbers here-- "Keep 'Em Coming" is a great opener, "You've Got So Far To Go" sounds like Blink until the vocals come in, and "F$#@ You Aurora" is a classic.    So I am going to continue exploring Alkaline Trio-- every CD by them is great so far, and stands on its own although the formula, which has developed through the records, is standard--  but it is also what makes them appealing musically.
