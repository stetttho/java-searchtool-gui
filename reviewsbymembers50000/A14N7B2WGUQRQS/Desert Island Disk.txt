 "Fizzy Fuzzy Big & Buzzy" is on my Top 5 of all time list-- if it was possible to wear out a CD this would have been gone a long time ago.  This is an album full of superb rock n'roll music, from hard-rocking to slow, with wonderful imagery, irony, humor and sadness-- you can find a song to match any mood.  The up-tempo numbers such as "Blue-Collar Suicide," and the classic "Banditos" are ripping, toe-tapping/foot stomping romps, and the wonderful slower tunes such as "Don't Wanna Know," (one of my all-time favorite songs) "Interstate" and "Nada" are deep and reflective, but you never lose Brian Blush's ripping guitar sound.    The Refreshments capture the mood of being with a bunch of your buddies traveling around the world-- if you've ever experienced S.E. Asia or South of the Border, "Mekong" and "Mexico" bring you right back there onto that Third World cantina bar stool you tipped off of.  And the imagery of the Southwest is superb-- the music brings you right there with the poor soul in "Nada" and you can feel the hot sun, the dust, and the desparation as he runs out of gas and wanders deep into the desert while toting a bottle of Tequila.     Luckily for all of us, even though the Refreshments are long gone Roger Clyne is still around, and his latest album "Americano" is superb.  But "Fizzy Fuzzy Big & Buzzy" is a classic-- I take it everywhere I go and have never tired of it even afer what has to be hundreds of listens.
