 "Hot Fuss" is a fairly solid modern take of a band trying to sound like the best of what the new-wave 80's had to offer.  I think it starts out pretty well, with "Mr. Brightside," "Smile Like You Mean It," (which is my favorite song but sounds like it came straight out of a Flock of Seagulls catalogue) and "Somebody Told Me," being the strongest group of songs (and the obvious radio releases).  But then it kind of gets mired down in average-sounding minor-key semi-goth-synth.  I agree with many of the other reviewers in that the original influences are much better.  If you didn't have the Cure, Depeche Mode or the Smiths playing at your high school dances, explore some of that music-- early Duran Duran ("Rio"), or the "Best Of" Flock of Seagulls album will give you a good idea where the Killers got some of their ideas.  Still, not bad.
