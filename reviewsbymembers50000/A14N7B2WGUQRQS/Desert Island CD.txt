 Having been with Toad since their debut (Bread and Circus), through their demise, I believe this is Toad at the apex of their career-- both musically and commercially.  To put things in perspective, when I saw them for this tour, Hootie and the Blowfish-- who eventually way surpassed Toad in popularity before fading into oblivion-- opened for Toad.  This CD was in HEAVY rotation in my players for years.  It is full of the best of what Toad has to offer-- heartfelt, gentle (but sometimes edgy), superb harmonies, melodies, and it is also the tightest they have sounded.  There is no filler on this CD.  Each song is distinctive and immediately pleasing to the ear, from the first listen to the thousandth.  What I have always been a fan of with Toad was the acoustic base, with Glenn's mellow and reassuring lead vocals, and Todd's ringing lead guitar, and the rest of the band's superb harmony.  This CD has it all, and even a great song sung by Todd (Inside).  There are a few heart-tugging numbers-- Crowing and Windmills are great, soft, sweet songs.  And Something's Always Wrong is a classic.   Overall, you can't beat this CD for pure listenability.  If you are only going to own one Toad CD, this is the one, and it would certainly be a super desert island companion-- it never fades or gets old.  I can't believe its been 10 years since this CD came out, because I still listen to it.
