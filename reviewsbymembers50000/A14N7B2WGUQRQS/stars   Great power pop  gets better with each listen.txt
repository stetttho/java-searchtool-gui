 Somehow this band slipped through the cracks between Interpol, the Killers (this CD is much better than those), and all the other various 80's-influenced acts out there, but this is a really solid CD that gets better with each listen.  You can hear the influences (Echo and the Bunnymen, the Cure, etc.), but the sound is still original and fresh.  "Love and Longing" is a great tune to start with and easily holds its own with all those great 80's anthems those who grew up then know and love.  But the first song, "Lost in Time," will hook you right away.  "Harmonies for the Haunted" is great all the way through, and based on this CD I am going to get their debute, "My Coco."
