 After seeing some of these reviews I had to plug this CD.  It is by far one of the best rock CD's of the past year!  American Idiot blows away anything Green Day has done in the past.  In the great tradition of bands like The Who, Green Day puts together a great concept album, but forget all that.  This album JUST PLAIN ROCKS!  Song #2, Jesus of Suburbia, has the most awesome song opening chords, and it has to be one of the best 8-minute-+ tunes out there.  Holiday is another great thumping tune-- in fact, this whole album is awesome to work out to.  Green Day's music has reached a level of sophistication where they have transcended their "pop-punk" label-- this is a majestic work-- I don't know how they could set the bar any higher for all those crappy clones out there.  And I was even more impressed when I saw them play these songs live on TV and also sounded great!  I've listened to Green Day since Dookie and they have never sounded better.  Highly recommended!!!!
