 I thought this was a very thought-provoking and insightful novel.  The writing style is such that you really crawl into the minds of the characters, particularly Aziz, who as the main protagonist is both innocent and guilty at the same time.  It certainly gives an alternate view of what constitutes a terrorist/terrorism, and explores many motivations for why people do what they do-- from necessity/survival to ideology.    Another thing this book did for me was pique my interest in Algeria.  Not much attention has been paid to this tragic, complex, and brutual conflict-- I am defintitely going to explore more.  The only negative I saw was every once in a while there are cartoonish/stereotypical characters that seem out of place in this otherwise deep narrative-- the rogue Treasury Agent, the fanatical Canadian fundamentalist muslim to mention a couple.  Otherwise, a compelling novel that keeps your attention throughout.
