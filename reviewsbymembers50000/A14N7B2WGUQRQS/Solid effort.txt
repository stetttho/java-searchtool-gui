 This is a solid effort from a band who falls in the genre of Haven (actually very similar to them); jangly, atmospheric, wistful sound that is very listenable and doesn't offend.   First listen was pleasant enough but didn't really grab me, so I did what I usually do with these type of CDs, and turned it down a bit and played it as background music to see if anything would grow on me.  I found myself getting more familiar with the tunes and appreciating them well enough, but this isn't something I would call my friends and insist they buy.  So if you like Coldplay, Haven, Leaves, Athlete, etc., you will probably appreciate this CD.
