 I think if you take about 3/4 of the "hard" CD, and about 1/2 of the "soft" CD, you got yourself a pretty great Foo CD.  No major leaps or bounds here, if you have been with Grohl since the beginning.  He's always had the hard/soft thing going, and this CD is no exception.    There are a few throw-away tracks on each disk, but overall this is a solid effort.  I think the 1-2-3 punch of "In Your Honor" followed by "No Way Back," and "Best of You" is a great opening.  On the second, "Miracle" and "On the Mend" (my personal favorite of the whole album) are the most heartfelt.  I still think The Colour and the Shape is his best, but these songs are new and good and won't disappoint anyone who likes these guys.
