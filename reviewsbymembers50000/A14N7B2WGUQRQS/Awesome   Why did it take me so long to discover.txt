 This CD is absolutely superb.  This beautiful, ethereal music follows in the footsteps of early Catherine Wheel and Cocteau Twins, both of whom I listened to in the early 90's, so I am wondering-- how did I miss this gem?  The songs gently burrow their way into your head and you will find yourself still "listening" long after the CD player is turned off.  Think Catherine Wheel, Love & Rockets and Cocteau Twins all blended together and that gives you an idea of this otherworldy, atmospheric sound.  If you are a fan of the early 90's fuzzy and melodious "shoe-gazing" sound, you will love this CD.  Highly recommended!
