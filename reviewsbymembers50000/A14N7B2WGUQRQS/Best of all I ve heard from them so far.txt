 I actually started my experience with Alkaline Trio with this CD a few years ago, so maybe it's just that I've listened to it the most, but of the three I have so far (I also have Crimson, Maybe I'll Catch Fire...and I'm waiting for Goddammit! to come in), this CD is my favorite.  Every song on this CD is great, and catchy-- a great blend of hard driving rock, excellent vocals and harmony, and scathing lyrics (so not something you necessarily want to listen to with your young kids along).  From listening to their earlier work, too, it is obvious how far these guys have come in tightening and refining their sound.  It is definitely formulatic, typical Alkaline Trio-- but one of those things-- if you like one song, you will most likely like them all.  And after few listens, each song's distinct nuances will start to separate to your ear and you will determine your favorites amongst them all.  And for those who think the Alkaline Trio has "sold out" or commercialized their sound, you gotta get over that.  When I was a teenager, I felt the same way about my favorite "small" band then-- U2-- and stubbornly refused to let myself like their "popular" music for many years before I grew up and finally realized what I was missing.  Bands grow and evolve, stay stagnant, or fade into oblivion.  Just because they get "popular," or "discovered" by the rest of the world, doesn't mean they will necessarily get any worse.  I don't think Alkaline Trio are in danger of that-- their sound follows the same course that will appeal to certain listeners who appreciate and like the genre-- but I do have to say they have become more listenable throughout the years.  Good Mourning is a great CD, and if you only own one Alkaline Trio CD make it this one.
