 I was originally going to give "X&Y" 3 stars, but then I listened to it again and liked it more than I did the time before, and I think with a few more listens it will settle in as a great CD.  There's a lot to discover here, and certain aspects of the musicianship start grabbing your attention after a while.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that Coldplay takes a bit to grow on you-- I also had the same experience with the other two albums.  Still, I feel it is safe to say this CD is not as striking as "A Rush of Blood to the Head," but it almost like a softer, more ambient continuation of that album.    Seems the synth and "filler" sounds are more prevalent on "X&Y", which detracts some because I really enjoy Jon Buckland's shimmering, prominent guitar sound on the previous album.  On "X&Y" the guitar is kind of buried at times under other swirling sounds-- if Coldplay has an edge, it is softened on "X&Y".    But this is still the Coldplay you know and love, so the songs still deliver the gentle, soaring melodies we have come to expect from them.      Highlights for me include "Fix You," which is a nice slow-buildup from mild to anthemic tune, "Talk," which does feature Martin following Buckland's guitar lead, and my favorite, "A Message," which is a great acoustic to swirling atmospheric gem.    Overall, this album will not disappoint Coldplay fans, and if it is your first Coldplay listen it will definitely draw you in to explore their other work.
