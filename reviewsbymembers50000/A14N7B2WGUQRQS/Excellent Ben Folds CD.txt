 The only reason I didn't give "Songs for Silverman" 5 stars is because it can't top "Rocking the Suburbs."  But, this is still a very good Ben Folds offering-- if you are a fan already, it has everything you could want, and if you are just discovering him, it has everything you should hear on first listen.  Ben Folds is an extremely talented musician and songwriter, who I believe has outgrown his early "geek-rock" label and crafts superb, heartfelt, piano-based tunes that stick with you long after you listen.  My personal favorite on this CD is "Jesusland," a gentle, rolling, melodious tune filled with irony.  Whatever the case, Ben Folds forges his own path in the vein of piano-based performers such as Billy Joel or Elton John, but honestly it's been decades since either of those guys put out anything that could come even close to matching the musicianship and heart of Ben Folds today.
