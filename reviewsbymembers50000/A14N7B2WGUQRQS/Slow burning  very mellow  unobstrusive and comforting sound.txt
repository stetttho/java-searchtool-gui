 I am always on the lookout for new bands, and somehow my searches led me to these guys.  I gave a few listens then forgot about the CD for a while.  A couple of months later I threw it in the player again, and found myself singing or humming along to most of the songs.  So this slow-burning effort does worm its way into your brain.  It is mostly atmospheric, acoustic guitar-based folkies that remind me a lot of Neil Young on his more acoustic work.  It does kind of lull you into mellowness, but it is well worth the listen if you are looking for a good CD to chill out with.
