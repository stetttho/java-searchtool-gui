 I had to edit my review-- I am bumping it up to 4.5 stars.  This CD has REALLY grown on me to the point now where I am singing along to every song.  I am not an Alkaline Trio fanatic, but "Good Mourning" is one of my favorite uptempo albums (never mind the downer lyrics) from a few years ago.  The problem with "Good Mourning" is that it is not something you would necessarily want sitting in the family CD player-- the lyrics are just much too ghoulish.      So Crimson's polish and slightly tamed down lyrics, though still incisive, are good in the sense that it is listenable for a wider audience.  I don't think you could call this punk-- it is rock with an edge, but man do these tunes grow on you!  Very catchy.  And I think their sound has matured superbly.  I was first a little disappointed with the polished sound, but now it just adds to the quality of the work.    Very, very listenable, and on the strength of the two latest albums, I have ordered "Goddammit" and "Maybe I'll Catch Fire"-- the Alkaline Trio has made a fan out of me!  Can't wait to listen to all of their work.
