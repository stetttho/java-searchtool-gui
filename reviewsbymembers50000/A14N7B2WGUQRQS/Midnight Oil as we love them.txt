 I agree with all the other reviewers in that this is a fine return to form for the band-- back to the "Diesel and Dust" and "Blue Sky Mining" days.  Somehow I missed this CD when it came out but luckily I caught it and really enjoy it.  My favorite is "World That I See" but really the entire CD is filled with what you would expect for a band returning with all the trademarks that propelled them into the spotlight way back when (I remember seeing them in concert in L.A. in 1988; X opened for them!).  It is too bad that this is the end for them but they have left a great legacy of principled, righteous rock.
