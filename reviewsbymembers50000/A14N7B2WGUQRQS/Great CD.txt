 I bought this CD based on all the positive reviews on Amazon, as I was looking for something new to listen to.  Not sure what thread led me to the Ocean Colour Scene, and I knew absolutely nothing about them despite what I think is a pretty broad music base.  Am I glad I found them!  From the first listen through repeated ones, this is a superb CD.    Although the various musical styles on this CD sound familiar-- lots of classic rock influences throughout-- the sound is still unique and extremely listenable.  Kind of like Moody Blues meets Trash Can Sinatras meets Travis, to my ear-- but standing all on its own.  Great harmonizing, jangly guitars, anthemic tunes, very heartfelt overall, and a very pleasant sound.  This is just a great overall listen.  And I am outside the UK, so at least one listener from distant shores is listening!  I am going to get more CD's from Ocean Colour Scene-- the only question is which one should I get next?
