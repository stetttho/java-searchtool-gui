 This is definitely one of the best books I have read this year.  Once I started it I could not put it down.  Bill Carter gives an excellent account of his personal journey that takes him into war-torn B-H, and tells a well-rounded story that obviously comes from the heart.  No political grandstanding-- you can identify with the point of view of this normal, adventurous guy who has the courage (and initial naivety) to inject himself into a surreal world where people are trying to continue living the best they can in the midst of destruction and death.  Fascinating account of his interaction with U2, and the resulting broadcasts on the world's stage of real human beings trapped inside the insanity of war.  And mixed in is his own struggle with personal loss that leaves him empty but leads him into a situation that ultimately puts everything in perspective.  He magnificently weaves all these elements together for an overall balanced, engaging narrative.  After reading, I also watched Carter's Miss Sarajevo documentary which superbly complements the book.
