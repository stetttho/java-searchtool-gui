 I'm not sure where I heard of the Perishers-- all I know is I found a scrap of paper I had written on (I often do this if I see an obscure video on Fuse, hear something or read about a band in a magazine and don't want to forget) with the name of the band and CD on it so I bought it, just another in my hit-or-miss search for new, good music.  On first listen, didn't blow me away, but a pleasant listen nonetheless.  I had it in my car CD player and just never got around to taking it out for a while because-- well, it was very pleasant to listen to.  Then I found myself humming and singing along, and after I got out of the car continuing to have these songs in my head.  Listen to "Sway" a few times and you'll see what I mean.  These tunes start burrowing into your head, in a pleasant way, and now I'm a big fan of this CD.  They remind me a bit of the Devlins, Mojave 3 and other groups with soft-brush vocals, and they hold it together musically-- it's a pretty tight group of tunes that doesn't stray very far from an atmospheric, subdued sounds that mellows you out but doesn't drag you down.  Give it a try and give it a few listens-- the Perishers will stick with you.
