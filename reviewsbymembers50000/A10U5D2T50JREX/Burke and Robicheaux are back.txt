 The good news is that James Lee Burke is still writing some of the most lyrically beautiful prose in fiction today.  The bad news is that, at least with this Robicheaux outing, he seems to have lost a little of his focus as a storyteller.  The middle section of the book has Robicheaux so self absorbed in his own problems I couldn't quite remember what crime he was supposed to be investigating.  Far too many characters with hidden secrets and agendas of their own weave in and out of the tale with such regularity that it becomes a little difficult to keep them all straight.  While each of these characters are equally compelling they tend to keep the narrative from running on an even keel. As to Legion Guidry....  I'm still not quite sure what to make of him just yet.  On the one hand he is indeed one of the most interesting and evil villains I've seen in a work of fiction for quite some time.  On the other hand I kept thinking that maybe Dave should have rung up Buffy Summers and asked her and the rest of the gang to come to New Iberia and help him out with this one.  The mixture of metaphysics and gritty crime story worked well for Burke with "In the Electric Mist With Confederate Dead" but I'm still not decided on this one just yet. In the end I have to say that if you are already a Burke fan, then by all means read this one.  If you are new to Dave Robicheaux and his world I strongly suggest one of the earlier novels.  I decided to give four stars to this one due to Burke's wonderful prose and his creation of such facsinating characters but I still think that the rambling mid section does not represent the author at his best.
