 There is no need for me to re-hash all the negatives about this book that have already been mentioned in the other reviews.  I think the Bond franchise in both film and book form is in dire need of an overhaul.  Namely in the way of writers.  Surely whoever is in charge of the Fleming literary estate can find someone to carry on the Bond stories other than Benson.  How 'bout someone who actually has experience at writing fiction for a living?  My God, they don't have to be another Ernest Hemingway or anything.  Just someone who can tell a good story and write decent prose and dialog.  Is that really asking too much?  I think Bond fans deserve, and should expect, better quality material than this.  Until we get it, I'm sticking with Fleming.
