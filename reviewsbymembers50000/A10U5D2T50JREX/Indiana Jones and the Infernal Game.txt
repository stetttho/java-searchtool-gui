 I happen to enjoy playing "Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine".  Sure the graphics are a bit dated and some of the puzzles can be infuriating (hey, that's why we have walkthroughs) but still this game managages to be great fun.  I thought the folks at Lucas Arts really were able to capture that sense of adventure and discovery that are so integral to the films and transplant them fully intact within the confines of a PC game.  At times it really felt like being part of an Indiana Jones movie.  For the price this game is a worthy investment and I highly reccomend it.
