 Don't let the Godzilla fans negative comments dissuade you from seeing this film. Don't get me wrong.  I love the Godzilla movies as much as the next G-fan.  But I have to tip my hat to the makers of the newest series of  Gamera movies.  Everything about them; from special effects, acting,  direction to just plain storytelling; is far superior to anything Toho  films have ever done with Godzilla.  In short, this is great guilty  pleasure cinema.  I highly reccomend it.
