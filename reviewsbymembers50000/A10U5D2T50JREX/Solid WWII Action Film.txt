 While "Where Eagles Dare" may not be the epitome of WWII action flicks it is an exhilarating thrill ride nonetheless.  Great locations, wild action sequences and ultra cool performances from Burton and Eastwood raise this film above the run of the mill actioneer. The film does have an extremely high body count compared to the novel and this may put off some viewers.  In MacLean's book of the same name Burton and Eastwood's characters actually prefer to render the Nazi's unconscious rather than mow them down with bullets as in the film.  In fact there is one sequence in the book where the two main characters go out of their way to save a young German soldiers life from a burning building!!   I suppose Hollywood insisted Mr. Maclean (who also wrote the screenplay) up the violence ante to draw in more viewers.  I prefer the way Mr. Maclean handled things in the book. There is a scene in the film where a helicopter is shown and this bit seems to get a lot of comments about being historically inaccurate.  Actually the Germans had been experimenting with various helicopter designs since the mid-1930's and did so throughout the war.  In fact there were several models that saw production and had some limited use in various capacities through out the war. So the inclusion of a helicopter is not so far fetched after all. Bottom line: not as great as "Guns of Navarone" or "Dirty Dozen" but a solid action film nevertheless.  If you don't mind the violence and high body count then be sure to give this one a spin in the DVD player when your looking to satisfy that WWII action/adventure film craving.
