 "Darby O'Gill and the Little People" is Disney live action fantasy at its finest. The film ably captures all the beauty and wonder of Irish folkbelief and transfers it to the screen with considerable charm, it is indeed a film the whole family can enjoy (although young kids may find the banshee a bit frightening).    Kudos to the cast, who really bring this film to life. Albert Sharpe is great as the lay about but loveable Darby O'Gill and the beautiful Janet Munro lights up every scene she's in playing Darby's daughter and Sean Connery's love interest. BTW this is the film that producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman found their James Bond in while casting about for a little film they were making called "Dr. No."    As to the issue of widescreen here is the official word from Disney (as included on a flyer in the DVD):    "Darby O'Gill and the Little People is presented as it was originally shot, in a 1.33;1 aspect ratio. When released to theaters in 1959, the studio recommended projecting the image at 1.75:1, to satisy the public's growing appetite for widescreen movies. To give the illusion of this wider image, theaters often needed to crop films at that time, and some of the picture was not seen. The following presentation has not been cropped, and none of the original image has been lost"    Hopefully that settles the issue of Disney "ruining" this film with this DVD release. So, buy the movie, pop some popcorn and settle in for a grand evening's entertainment!
