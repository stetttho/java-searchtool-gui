 I've recently become interested in historical fiction and after hearing such wonderful things about "I, Claudius" I decided to purchase it from Amazon and see if it was indeed as great as everyone says.  I am pleased to report that this is probably the best DVD investment I have ever made (and being a DVD junkie I've made plenty).  "I, Claudius" is without doubt one of the greatest things television has ever given us.  This story has everything: great characters, intrigue, murder, lust, sex, passion, politics, humor, etc (and thats just in the first couple of episodes).  Sure its production values are a bit stagey but who needs elaborate sets or special effects when you have such a rich ensemble of charcters and drama.  Seldom have I been so absolutely riveted by what was going on my televison screen.  And what a great cast: Derek Jacobi, Sian Philips, John Hurt, Patrick Stewart, and Brian Blessed are just a few of the actors who provide outstanding performances in this production.  I was very sad when the whole thing came to an end; I had become so caught up in this saga and its people I just wanted it to go on forever.  I've talked this show up so much with my friends I now have a waiting list of folks who want to borrow it and watch it for themselves.  Anyway, if you haven't seen "I, Claudius" I can't reccomend it highly enough.  Beg, borrow or buy this DVD set.  You won't be dissapointed.  Now, I'm off to get Robert Graves' novels upon which the whole thing is based.  Oh, and BTW, don't touch the figs!
