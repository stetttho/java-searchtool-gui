 Generally I dislike Japanese anime films.  I suppose this is due more to my own misinformation about the genre as well as the incomprehesible success of the Pokemon phenomena and its ilk.  However there are two anime films that I have included on my personal list of truly great cinema; the first is Isao Takahata's powerful anti-war film "Grave of the Fireflies" and the second is Hayao Miyazaki's "Princess Mononoke".  The film contains some of the most impressive and visually stunning images in an animated feature (or even a live action film for that matter) that I have seen in a very long while.  But make no mistake, this is no family fun Disney film.  The story and its themes are quite complex and you will have to have an above average attention span to fully appreciate it (a little background in Japanese mythology couldn't hurt either).  While I have a long ways to go before I could call myself an anime fan, films such as "Princess Mononoke" have demonstrated to me what the genre is capable of and I look forward to seeing other films by Mr. Miyazaki and other filmakers of his caliber.
