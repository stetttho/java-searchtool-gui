 I usually don't read mysteries, but this one I liked.  It wasn't too serious, but fun.  I love the fact that it's an interracial romance and even though the mystery part is good, the romance developing bt. Des and Mitch is what draws you in.  Mitch is open with himself and others while Des is afraid to do so.  Mitch teaches Des about love and life.  They help each other.  I also loved the other characters in the book who were crazy in both good and bad ways.  I can't wait to read other books in the series and hopes this series last a long time.
