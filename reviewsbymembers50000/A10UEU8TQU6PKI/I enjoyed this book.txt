 This is my third Susan Wiggs and although not my favorite it was worth buying and reading.  What really brought out the book for me was the character of Isabel.  This tortured heroine was strong and brave even when bad things were happening around her.  She makes the story.  I also liked Blue, but I wished Susan didn't have the second story line with Blue's son and the girl he liked just because it look away from the romance of Blue and Isabel.  I also wished there was an epliogue, but there wasn't.  If you like this book you should read The Drifter and The Hostage by this author.
