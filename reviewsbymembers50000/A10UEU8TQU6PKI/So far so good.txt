 I am half way through this book, I'm reading it slowly to be able to take it all in, and I like the advice that I'm getting from the book.  I have been reading a lot of style books lately and I love the fact that the book gives different ways to put pieces of clothing together.  I am pretty familar on what looks good on my body, but I have trouble taking those clothes and making them new and different every time by putting them with other clothes.  This books gives me great advice on that.  The book also helps in telling me the essentials I need in my wardrobe for each type of clothing.  My favorite sections was the shoes, skirts, sweater, and jacket sections b/c I got advice from those sections that I didn't know before.  I am happy I got the book and will continue refering to it in the future.
