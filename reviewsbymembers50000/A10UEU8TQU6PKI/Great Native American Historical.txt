 This is the first book I read by Lindsay McKenna and I have to admit that it is the best Native American historical romance that I've read so far.  She left all the sterotypes that seem to attach themselves to these types of books at the door.  I really felt like Wolf was a Native American instead of a white man in a Native American body.  I liked that she made Wolf the gentleman that Serena/Brave Heart needed after being raped.  Like I said before, she writes these types of books well, unlike some writers who shouldn't write these types of books at all.  I think my favorite part about the book was the fact that instead of Wolf being this warrior type "I am the man, no one is better than me, I have such a big ego...", he was a medicine man who was not only a good father, but husband as well.
