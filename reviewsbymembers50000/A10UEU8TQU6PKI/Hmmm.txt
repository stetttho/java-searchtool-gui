 I agree with the last review. I like the author.  I like her last book.  Yet this book didn't please me as much. It pleased me enough where I read it in one day and want to read her next book that comes out, but with this book I was left with wanting more.  I also agree when the last reviewer was saying how the heroines in Valyan's novels are light with nice hair and so on..It does make me feel bad to read interracial novels with heroines like that, not just in this book but other interracial novels have been like that too, b/c I know I'm not light, with straight hair, and stick slim and as a result can't relate physically to the heroine.  Yet, when a novel is good, who cares how the heroine looks.  It's when a novel is not as good that a reader starts to notice other negative things.   The action in this novel was good, great, but I didn't feel or sometimes understand why the characters were together.  Yeah, the sex was good, but what were doing for each other emotionally. The action kind of over took the romance.  I wish they would have gotten to know each other before sleeping or kissing each other.   I liked the ending of this book and enjoyed all the other characters in the book.  Hope that Chris and Felicia get their own novel.  I also can't wait for Unspoken Promises to come out.
