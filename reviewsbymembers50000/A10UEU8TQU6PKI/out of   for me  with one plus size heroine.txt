 I got this book to read the short story "Against the Odds" by Lisa Kleypas and I wasn't dissapointed.  I was oddly supprised how much I loved "Midsummer's Knight" by Kinley MacGregor.  It was my favorite of the two.  The character Kenna is descibed as being plump yet the hero loved her sooo much.  I fell for the character Simon. This is my second read by Sherrilyn Kenyon and I can't wait to read more.  So, in other words there is something for everyone, but no promise you will love all three stories.
