 I liked this story. Read it in two days.  The love scenes are hot and liked both characters.  I have to admit that the epilogue left me with some unanswered questions and I felt that the ending was wrapped up a little too quickly.  The book, which is a nice size, could have gone on for at least a few more chapters.  Even though I enjoyed the book and am glad I got it.
