 this tells the story of a biracial(black/white) woman who travels back into time.  She falls in love with a white man yet there are dangers that lurk about as she tries to find her way home again.  She goes back to the 1100's and uses her knowledge and strong will to get through her strange situation.  Kit is a woman of her time who is independent and outspoken.  Marcus is also a man of his time.  A true alpha hero.  There is always something going on in the story.  They go through the battle of wills, but once they declare their love they learn to respect each other for being exactly as they are.  The ending is good and the love scenes are hot.  I just didn't believe how easily she was accepted by the people of that time.  Instead of making her a slave or servent, she ended with being treated with respect from the beginning.  But heck, its fiction and this is a fantasy.  I'm reading it for the romance and not so much for the facts.  If you want a little escape and would like to read a different type of interracial romance novel, then this is for you.
