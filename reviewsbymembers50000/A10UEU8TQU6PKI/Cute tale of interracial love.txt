 Ian Beck is looking for a story while Rachel James is trying to find her past.  They come together when Rachel's mentor is charged with helping his students out a little too much and Ian is the one reporting the story for his paper.  Rachel always had to deal with being different, being biracial, and always had to deal with losing those she loves.  But meeting Ian will finally help break down her walls and bring her past to the present.  I liked the book. My only complaint is that I wish it was longer.  Yet, I thought the book had good characterization for just a short novel.  I would recommend it.
