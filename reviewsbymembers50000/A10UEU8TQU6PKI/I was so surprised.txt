 That I like this cd, but it grew on me within two days after listened to it for awhile and really listening to the lyrics.  The lyrics are very deep and talk about things from love, misunderstanding, suicide, and abuse among other things.  I love the background vocals on this cd which bring out the songs and adds to the lovely voice of Amy Lee.  At first, I thought I would just like the songs, Bring me to life, Going under, and My Immortal, which were played a lot on the radio, but other songs stand out on this cd.  Such as Everybody's Fool, Imaginary, Taking over me, and Hello which are my favorite.  I was surprised that they were as many ballards on this cd as there were.  The cd keeps a steady pace and all the songs fit; there's not a song this cd you'll feel is out of place from the rest.  The songs are dark, but not in a goth or angry way. The songs simply refect deep emotions of the authors and are all the better b/c they were written my the group themselves.  If you like Bring me to life, but are not sure about the others you should give it a try.  The songs are like poetry really. I would suggest this cd to people who like alternative/rock/classical(there are a lot of string instru. in the background of a lot of the songs also electro sounds) music that's not too hard. Will be looking out for their next cd!!
