 and that makes the book worth wild!  I loved all the characters from Ruth's short story even the character of the baby.  I just wish it was longer.  I also enjoyed Madeline Baker's short story and will check out her other novels.  I learned things about Native American culture from Baker's story and I want to learn more!  Kathleen Eagle's story didn't do anything for me and I couldn't finish that story.  Yet, I would recommend this book.  You're bound to like one of these short stories.
