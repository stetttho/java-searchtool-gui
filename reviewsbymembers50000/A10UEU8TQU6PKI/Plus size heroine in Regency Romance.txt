 I don't usually read Regency romance novels, but I really liked this one.  The heroine,Emily, was a plus-size woman separated from her husband.  She was overweight, but was comfortable with her body and still had men chasing after her.  Her husband, Baxter, loved her always and thinks she is even more beautiful than ever.  Even though the love scenes were tame, the sexual tension was good and the characters had such great love for each other that I didn't notice a lack of detailed love scenes.   If you enjoy this book, Lady May's Folly, should be read after this one.  It talks about the characters May and Etienne who in this book stand out and the author makes the reader want to get to know them better.  Nice read.
