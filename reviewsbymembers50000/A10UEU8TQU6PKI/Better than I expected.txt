 I read this book thinking that it would be just ok, but it was really better than I thought it would be.  Touching and sweet, its gave me a glimpse of the plight of the Navajo Native Americans that I didn't have before.  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read romance novels with Native American characters, anyone interested in Navajo history, or anyone who wants a quick read.
