 Now, I am really surprised that no one has reviewed this book yet.  This is one of the best interracial novels out to date.  I am really picky with my interracial romance novels and this one was right on the money.  It had passion, romance, action, and suspense.   One thing I loved about this novel was the fact that the woman, Tatiana, chased after the man, Matthew, who felt like it would be best if they didn't get involve b/c he had a lot of problems he needed to solve.  A second thing I loved was the fact that they became friends before they became lovers.  You could tell that they wanted each other, the sexual tension was always there, but they got to know each other first and that was great.  A Third thing I loved about this novel was the passion.  This was truly a romance novel, no question about it!  Heck, I just loved the whole book! If you are a true fan of interraical romance then you need to read this novel!  Your collection won't be complete without it!  Plus, the author, a black woman who loves and is married to a  white man, knows what she is writing about.  Who better to write a interraical romance novel than a person who deals with it first hand.  To the author, you go girl!  I can't wait to read more of your work.   So, in other words, READ THIS BOOK!
