 This book caught my attention when I read that the author talked about body acceptance and body modification such as tattoos.  (I love both subjects).  In the end I learned more about that and more.  I love Yasmine's way of writing, as if she's talking to you over a cup of tea...or coffee.  She doesn't mind giving examples from her own life so the reader can relate.  I also got some new rituals to try in this book and learned more about different gods and goddesses that I never learned about or are not widely known.  As a result of reading this book, I am currently reading Sexual Ecstasy and the Divine by her.  This book is under the Pagan catagory, but can be read by people who are not Pagan.
