 I didn't think I would like this book, but I read it and did not regret it.  The heroine is Wiccan, the hero is sexy and intense with secrets that the reader is dying to find out.  The love scenes make you want to take a shower and the whole novel is the kind where you have to read it slowly in order not to miss anything.  I just wish there was an epilogue.  Otherwise great novel.  I read this novel awhile back and would read it again and again.
