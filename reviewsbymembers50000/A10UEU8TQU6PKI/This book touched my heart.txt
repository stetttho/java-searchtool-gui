 I read and brought this book a few years ago and I love it now as much as I did back then.  It is a very special book that is both spiritual and romantic.  It might not have the ending that everyone wanted, but I feel that if the book had ended any other way, it would not have been as good.  I cried at the end of the book and once in a while a pick it up and read it again.
