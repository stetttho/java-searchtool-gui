 I got the large print copy of this book and liked the cover of that book better. I liked the fact that the heroine was not your typical one.  She was a dark-haired woman, over thirty, strong, independent, and had a job.  Glory, aka Proud One, was the type of woman that makes reading these type of books worth it. Two Arrows was a good hero.  Even though he's an alcholic whose been through a lot in his life.  He and Glory gets a second chance through their love for each other. I have a strong interest in the Native American culture yet I don't read too many NA romance books because I don't like the way the NA's are betrayed.  This book gave me insight to what Native Americans went through and a glimpse at their history.   Two complaints that I have is that the author used the word "sword" to describe the male parts and I thought she could have found a better word than that.  I also felt the author could have written an epilogue instead of rushing the ending.   The love scenes were good and was more about love than trying to be erotic.  On a whole, I would recommend this book, I think you will enjoy it.
