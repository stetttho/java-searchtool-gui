 Now, I love plus-size heroines b/c I am one too!  This novel was the best Rida Allen novel so far!  Even though it wasn't over 300 pgs. or anything it was good!  I read liked both characters.  They were friends before they became lovers and that was great.  Of course I wish they would have made up quicker, but they were both stubborn people.  I could tell they were really close even from the beginnng when they were children.  Of course I love the epliogue!  The love scenes were hot!  And the novel was just great.  I am so glad I read it.   If you love great characters, great love scenes, and a great ended with a plus-size woman, and the lean hamsome man who loves her, you will love this!
