 This book is the best!  I first got it at the library and after reading it, I didn't want to give it back.  A few years later I brought it from (local store) and I'm glad I did.  Since then I have done readings for people and they all tell me how acurate they are.  I enjoy telling fortunes a lot and it has become a hobby that I'll never give up!
