 That's how much I was into this book.  I'll keep it simple with this one.  Read it.  You'll enjoy it...if you like vampires, or like action book with a little romance, or like tourtured heorines.  Or like books where you get to know every character's history in a way where no character is no longer a minor character.  After this book, I am open to reading Erica's next Bombshell book and more Bombshell novels.
