 I love to read about two things: strong yet vunerable heroines and Native Americans.  This books had both.  I not only read a tender love story, but also learned more about the Apache that I did not know before.  The heroine is half Apache and Sioux, while the hero is half Commache.  It was an exciting and quick read.  I just hope that Lindsay McKenna writes more novels with Native American characters.  She writes about them well.  P.S. I especially liked the main character Akiva.  She really made the book.  She grew the most in the book and even inspired me.
