 This is the book for you.  But this book is just an all around great book.  I couldn't put it down.  Read it in two days.  I loved Abby.  She was a nice woman who could not get over the hurt in the her past.  Chase was a dream guy.  He was willing to stay with Abby and help her open up to him and the other people in town.  I really can't wait to read Kathy Love's next book in this series.  This is a first for me because I usually read one or two books from a series, but I want to read all of them.  All of the sisters are people I can relate to.  More books should be like this.  I am so sick of reading books where the heroine and hero are perfect or one of the main characters are.  Nobody is perfect and that should always be reflected in books,esp. romance novels.
