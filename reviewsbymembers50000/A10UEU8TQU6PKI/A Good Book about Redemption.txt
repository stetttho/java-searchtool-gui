 I was attracted to this book because of the fact the characters weren't your usually ones.  They were both suffering.  Holly from being a former hooker and J.D. from losing his family.  They found hope and a second chance with each other.  What made me want to read the book more was the fact that it was a romance suspense and I love trying to figure out who did the crime. The book wasn't as good as Darkling I listen in my opinion but it was worth reading.
