 I'll keep this simple:  Shay was a free-spirit.  Ian was a conservative minister.  They couldn't stand each other at first, but they fell in love. They went through some ups and downs, but eveything worked out.  Love scenes were hot and so were the characters. Wish it was longer, but so worth reading.
