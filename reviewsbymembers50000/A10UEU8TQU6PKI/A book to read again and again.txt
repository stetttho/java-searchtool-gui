 I don't know about other people, but to me this was the best book I read in a long time. It was special. I had already read It had to be you by SEP and I didn't think her writing could get any better, but I was wrong. To me this book was better and so far is my favorite. She so reminds me of my favorite author Jill Barnett, but contemporary. She makes me sigh with happiness for the characters and I love her endings.  People are wrong to say Daisy was stupid because she was not that way at all. She was kind and sweet and sensitive to the world around her. There is nothing wrong with that. She did need to grow up a bit and she did along with Alex. There was not a scene in the book that I didn't like. The love scenes were great and touching and the secondary characters shined along with Daisy and Alex. This book is the kind of book to read when you want to relax and escape for a while then when you're finish, read again. This book is simply a keeper.
