 I got this book not knowing if it would be as good as it was.  I loved Grace's character.  The more I read the book that more I could relate to her.  Grace was real without being conceited or mean.  She didn't have a fit when she gained weight and was open to finding love in a place she least expected it.  I also loved the character of Jonathan.  He was shy and sweet and a real woman's man.  This is my first Red Dress Ink and I'll certainly be open to reading more.
