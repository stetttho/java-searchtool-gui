 When I saw this DVD in the store I knew I had to get it.  I went home and immediately did it all the way through.  I did sweat and did some toning.  It's not a cardio DVD, but fun because it teaches a woman to get in touch with her sexuality and feel sexy.  If you like how bellydancing makes you feel, you'll like this too.
