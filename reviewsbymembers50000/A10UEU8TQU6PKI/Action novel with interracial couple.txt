 This novel is fast pace.  The novel is not that long and only took me a day to read.  I thought all the important characters were well developed and the only love scene good.  I do wish there was more concentration on the romance bt. the black woman( Jennifer) and white man(Sean). I really wish this was turned into a series or was longer.  I think both interracial and suspense readers will like this book.  It's just not as intense as I thought it would be.
