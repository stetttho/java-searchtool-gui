 If I'm not doing cardio kickboxing or bellydancing, I like to try other exercises that will get my heart rate up, but still let me have some fun.  That's why I got this DVD.  It's not easy.  It took me awhile to get the Bollywood dance section of the DVD and the other section is much harder, but its great that by exersicing you'll be able to learn new dance moves from another culture.  I say don't give on the DVD, it'll get easier, but make sure you have enough space to move around because some of the moves really get you moving around.
