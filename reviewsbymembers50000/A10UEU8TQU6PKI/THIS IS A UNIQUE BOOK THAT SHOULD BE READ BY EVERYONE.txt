 I just love this books! I can't say enough good things about it.  This is a novel for people who want to read something different and still romantic.  In this novel, the heroine, Rosie, is the one who is suffering the most and needs the most help and she gets that from Bowie. Instead of the hero taking center stage, rosie does.  You can't help, but feel for her and she just comes alive in the book. Rosie is strong yet hurting and Bowie is the one to come along and help her stop hurting herself. So far this is my favorite Maggie Osborne book and one of my all time favorite bks.  You will not be able to stop reading this bk. once you get started so I recommend you relax and start reading this bk.
