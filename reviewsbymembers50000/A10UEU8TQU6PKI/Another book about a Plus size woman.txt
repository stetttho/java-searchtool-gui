 I love to read...I love to read romance...I love to read a good romance book also.  When I read a good romance book with a plus-size woman in it...well I'm just too happy for words.  The fact that the character's, Alys, size is not the main aspect of the novel, makes it even better!  Alys is a character who is not perfect and she doesn't try to pretend to be(I love imperfect characters).  Simon is a mysterious man who finds out that Alys is more than meets the eye.  This novel is "lighter" than many of Anne's other novels.  You really come to love both characters by the end.  I just wish there was an epliogue.  This is a novel for people who love to read about real women, dangerous men, and read a novel where there are two romance stories in one.  Enjoy!  P.S. If you want to read another book by Anne that has a heroine who is plus-size, I recommend Night Fall.
