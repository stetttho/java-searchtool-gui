 Just finished this book and...loved it!  I didn't know if I would but I was hooked from the first page.  I mean standing at the bus stop reading, forgetting to do anything else, hooked.  This novel is about two people who end up working together when that's the last thing they want to do.  Alayna is trying to support her younger sister and works for Ben "Ice" to make more money.  Ice comes off as an ass, but turns out to much more on the surface. Alayna comes off as a woman who hates white people and see them as the enemy, but turns out to be so much more.  SHe learns a lot throughout the novel.  Alayna and Ice become work associates, friends, and lastly lovers.  The relationship is slow.  They just don't fall into bed with each other.  Situations come up where they get to know each other even when that's the last thing they want to do.  Each scene with them is important b/c it shows how little by little they began to care about each other.  By the time they make love they are comfortable and real wtih each other, not having to pretend. I liked Alayna's character a lot.  She was a real stong person who didn't take any crap and didn't depend on anyone.  I would say she was kind of a tourtured heroine. Ice had his own problems, but was able to help Alayna work through hers so later she can help him with his'.  They became partners is every sense of the word.
