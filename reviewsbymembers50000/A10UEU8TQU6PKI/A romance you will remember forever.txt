 This novel was simply beautiful.  I don't want to give anything away so I'll just say it was a great and fast romance read.  The characters Katherine and Nick were realistic and beautiful characters.  Katherine went through a lot and Nick was always there for her.  Nick is my dream man.  Katherine was a rock on the outside, but inside she had demons to overcome.  Even when Kat tried to push him away, he wouldn't go.  Those two characters shined!  They were truly soul mates.  I would recommend this book to anyone who loves to read a romance that will make them feel almost four emotions at one time.  To anyone who wants to read a book that is truly about loving someone through thick and thin. P. S. The love scenes were great b/c you could feel their love for each other off the pages and there is an epliogue!
