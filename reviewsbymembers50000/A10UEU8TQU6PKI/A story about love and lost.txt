 I was hesitate about reading this book after I read what it was about and then read the reviews.  Some reviews were good and some were bad(saying it was a too much like the movie/book Love Story).  Well, I saw that movie and A crack in forever was a whole lot better!  I cried for three days reading this book.  The ending was the saddest one I read in a long time.  I would say this book is for people who are true romantics and don't mind reading a book that makes them cry.
