 The reason I liked this novel is simple.  It talked about a Native American man falling in love with a plus-size woman.  Even though she lost weight she is not skinny.  I liked the fact that both characters were not perfect.  The hero was a recovering alcoholic who is taking care of his niece.  He is a good man who thinks he is not worth of the woman's love, but he is.
