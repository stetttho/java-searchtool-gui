 from the library b/c I would have missed out on a great book.  Houston puts up walls to keep people away b/c he is disfigured, but Amelia is able to get pass the walls and see the great man behind them.  I like the fact that this book focuses on these two characters and the act of them getting to know each other and falling in love.  The author makes sure they have time together to get to know each other and that doesn't change when they get to Houston's brother's house and have to act as if they never fell in love.  I also like the fact that the love scene didn't come until the end.  The whole novel builds up to this point and no one will be disappointed.  If you're the kind of person who likes a whole lot of action in their novels, this book isn't for you.  If you like romances where the romance takes center stage along with the characters, this is for you.
