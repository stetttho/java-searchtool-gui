 I just finish this book and it was good.  I just happened to stumble upon it and I'm glad I read it.  I love to read about strong heroines, but I can't find too many bks. with them in it so I was happy and surpried to find that this book had one.  I loved it from the beginning and loved Pet!  I can't wait to read the next one in the series, Lady Seer.   My only complaint is that there was a lack of detailed love scenes.  I wanted more detailed love scenes!  I also wished that it hadn't taken Matthew so long to say he loved Pet.  I would have saved a lot of time.   Yet, the fact that the characters were so good, those things can be overlooked.  If you like Medieval novels, like I do, like  strong heroines, like I do, and lke when the charcter development is more important than the sex, like I do, than this book is for you!
