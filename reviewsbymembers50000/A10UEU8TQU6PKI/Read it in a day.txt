 This is a great novel.  I read two chapters of it in the bookstore and knew I had to get it.  I did not regret it.  I could relate to the characters, the love scenes were tender, emotion bt. the characters were high, and the ending was just as great as the beginnng.  I have read this authors books before so I should have known this book would be good.  She has a way with emotions in her writing that is outstanding.  She can describe something big like life and love in the simplest words.  Read it if you want feel something as you read.
