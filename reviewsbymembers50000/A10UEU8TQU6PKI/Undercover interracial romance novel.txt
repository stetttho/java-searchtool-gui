 Yes, it is!  I swear and I quote "He didn't need to see her eyes to know they were the golden brown color of maple syrup....that her skin was the warm tone of caramel" (29).  Hello!  I'm so glad eHarlequin is coming out with more out of the closet interracial romance novels.  This one is about a black woman who lost weight and sleeps with the wrong man, then uses him to pretend to be a fiance.  Very good, short novel.  Danny is lovable and so is Jordan.  Her cousin KEISHA tries to get in the way of their relationship, but love overcomes all.  If you love interracial novels, ever felt bad about your body, or have a thing for sexy firefighters, than this is the novel for you.  Also check out Mia's Red shoes & diary novel, another undercover interracial novel.
