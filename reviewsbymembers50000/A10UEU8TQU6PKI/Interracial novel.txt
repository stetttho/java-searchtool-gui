 I read this book in one day.  I picked it up and put everything else down.  It was really worth reading.  This novel bt. a  woman of Creole heritage named Vashti and and white man named Mark was a good romance that spanded over four yrs.  I like the fact that even though they were of different cultures, no one made a big deal out it.  The important part was about the progress of their relationship.  Both character were not perfect and both played a role in how their relationship was going along with destiny.  The secondary characters added to the book.  This was a good quick read.  Love scenes good.  Begnning of novel will hook you.
