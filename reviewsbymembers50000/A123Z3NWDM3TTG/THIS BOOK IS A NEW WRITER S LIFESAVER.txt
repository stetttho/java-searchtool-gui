 This is the new writer's dream book. Marc Mc Cutcheon tells it like it is. His style and wit, along with humor, puts a smile on your face. This is good reading. He encourages the new writers as well as the old. This book covers everything from: how to write query letters, negotiating your book contract, writing proposals, what kind of nonfiction books you should write, how to choose an agent, and how to be tough when facing rejection. Well done Mr. McCutheon, well done.
