 This video was pretty good, but Jet Li and Aaliyah wasn't quite the Romeo and Juliet type. The emotional feelings between them, were not as convincing as I would have expected. But the fact that Jet Li was labeled romeo, fit the character he portrays. He was a perfect gentleman with Aaliyah. Both Aaliyah and Jet Li had only one thing in common, and that was finding out who killed each of their brothers. Jet Li became a one man army against the thugs who killed his brother and Aaliyah's brother. The Action of Jet Li's martial art is a must see.
