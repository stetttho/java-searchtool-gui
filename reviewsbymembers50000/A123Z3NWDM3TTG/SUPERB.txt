 Delta of Venus was superb. Elana Martin: (Audie England) was a beautiful American writer of erotica who lived in paris. She falls in love with an impecably handsome French novelist of erotica named Lawrence, played by: (Costas Mandylor). This sensual erotic, heart pulsating, thrilling to the senses movie, will leave you in a world wind of passion & emotions. When Lawrence left for N.Y., he kept tabs on Elana through her publisher. He became an anonymous reader of her writings, criticizing the lack of detailed sex in her stories. Still not knowing the identity of the anonymous reader, she continue to strive to do her best in her writings, by experiencing and viewing many kinds of sexual liaisons. After she mastered the art, he congradulated her. Lawrence returned to paris to reveal his love for her. He soon learned that Elana wasn't the same shy girl he had left. The wild passion she experienced in her sexual awakenings, erupt all over Lawrence just before her swift departure from paris. A true love story. I recommend it.
