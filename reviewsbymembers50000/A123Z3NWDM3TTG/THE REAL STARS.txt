 These are the real entertainers on this video. Benny Goodman, at his best, along with Peggy Lee; singing, "Why don't you do right?" The Glenn Miller band, along with Tex Beneke; doing, "In the mood" "SOLID!" Fats Waller, doing his popular tune, "Ain't misbehavin'" Cab Calloway, singing, "The blues in the night" Liberace, Lawrence welk, and many more. Seeing is believing.
