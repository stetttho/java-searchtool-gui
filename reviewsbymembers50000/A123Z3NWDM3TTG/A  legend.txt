 Hey there!..., all you hep cats! Another one of the singing big band leader's toe tapping great songs, is on this CD for your listening pleasure. A few familiar ones you may recognize are on this CD. Mr. Calloway has fun with the slow song, "That old black magic," The song, "Hard times," was sung on Cab's radio broadcast in 1940. The song, "The jumping jive," was the song sung in his movie he stared with Ms. Lena Horne, "Stormy weather." The scatting that he does so well, will encourage you to smile while tapping your toes. These songs are a collectable item, and a must own for your jazz collection. I always highly recommend Mr. Cab Calloway's music.
