 This movie was really very good, but it was the stollen version of "Basic instinct." It starts out with a young blonde woman getting off, on top of an older man. The sex scene will remind you of Basic instinct. Then the next scene is another  Basic instinct scene, where the police stood beside the bed of which the man had died, and the police detectives poke fun  at the murder scene. The movie was very sexual. Madonna was an ok actress, but  she seemed to use more of her own personality then anything. The scene where they were in the parking garage, was my favorite. That scene was very erotic. And Frank, the young lawyer who represented Madonna, and also became her sex toy,         couldn't fake that scene, it was too real. Rent the movie to see this scene for yourself, and you'll see what I mean. :0)
