 I personally like the Andrew sisters, because of their good harmony voices. I also have this CD for my big band collection. The boogie woogie bugle boy of company B, is my favorite. This song will keep you dancing. The song Hold tight is a popular and fun tune also. So Add these sisters to your big band collection, they are a treasure.
