 I've always liked Destiny's Child. From the hit single: No, No, No, to Bills, Bills, Bills. Now this one; Survivor. I like the whole CD. But some songs sound a bit weird at first, you would have to keep listening to get use to them. My favorites are of course, Survivor, Independent women part one & two, Bootylicious, and Gospel Medley. These girls are another Envogue. They have the same respect from the music media as Envogue once did.
