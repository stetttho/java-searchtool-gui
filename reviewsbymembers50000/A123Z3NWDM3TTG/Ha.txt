 This video wasn't as funny as I thought. A lot of swearing and loud talking about nothing from Mo'nique. Her stand up on BET's comic view was better than this. Adele Givens was the funniest of them all. Miss Laura wasn't very good either. Sommore, needed some more funny lines. She was better and funnier on BET's comic view also. Four women on the road, talking about silly stuff wasn't my idea of comedy. Two stars in zee formation.
