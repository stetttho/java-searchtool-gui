 This movie was really very good. The acting was pure and realistic. Paul Muni was actually very handsome. Maybe it's because of the bad boy image. His sister on the other hand, resembled Betty Boop. The characters played their parts very well. It was believable and exciting. This gangster movie is a true gangster flick, and is worth seeing.
