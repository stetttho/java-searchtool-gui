 The beginning was kind of boring, but as it dragged on it got a little interesting. Let's just put it this way, the movie climaxes then tires out. But the fact that it was released in 1973, it had done good addressing the interracial bond between the mother, Marsha Mason and her son, Kirk Calloway. When James Caan, the navy officer stepped in and took on the role of fatherhood, because the mother decided she couldn't take it anymore and bolted out of the relationship; it was a little strange but touching. All in all, it was a good movie.
