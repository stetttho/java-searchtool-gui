 If you have trouble getting to sleep at night, don't take an over the counter sleep drug, nor take any prescriptions from your doctor; just pop this video in your vcr or dvd and get ready to fall asleep. I was watching it and the next thing I knew, I woke up to a blue screen. I had slept so long, that the video had stopped and rewound back to the beginning of the movie.(Boring!)
