 Once again, I am back with a Duke review. And I say, "SUPERB!" My favorite is, "Take the A train" among others. The level of the bass on this song must have been heart pounding when heard live, judging from this CD; I'd say it was very noticeable. There was a hint of old recording crackling in the background when heard through earphones, but the recordings really were very clear. I could listen to this CD all day long. Another great CD I recommend.
