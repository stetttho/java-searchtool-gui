 The Cincinnati kid was (Steve McQueen,) and he was labeled as the best poker player. His aim was to prove it to an older and more experienced poker player;(Edward G. Robinson.) The kid wanted to prove his ability of a good poker player by playing an honest game. I liked the way the film portrays the star's defeat. There's one thing that I couldn't understand about this movie, the setting looked as if it was in the 1920's or 30's; and the character's wardrobe were the style of the 1960's. Confusing as it looked, this was still a pretty good movie; especially for those of you poker players.
