 This CD was given to me for my birthday. I was a bit hesitant in receiving this one, and the giver knew I hadn't heard of him before; but I listened and it was just ok. Some songs were actually pretty good, and others were a bit too high strung. It's like tasting a certain type of food for the first time. It will make you sneer at first, then you develope an required taste for it.
