 I WASN'T TOO IMPRESSED WITH THIS ONE. MS. DANDRIDGE REMINDED ME OF A CHICKENHEAD FROM THE PROJECTS; RIGHT FROM THE START. HARRY BELAFONTE WAS COOL, BUT A LITTLE SQUARE. PEARL BAILEY COULD HAVE CUT LOOSE A LITTLE MORE, I KNOW SHE WANTED TOO. EVERYONE APPEARED TO BE STIFF IN THIS MOVIE, IT WAS A BIT DEPRESSING. THE ONE KIND OF MUSIC THAT I'M NOT TOO CRAZY OVER, IS OPRA. ESPECIALLY WHEN PEOPLE OF THE BLUES AND JAZZ ERA, TRIES TO SING OPRA. IT JUST DOESN'T FIT.
