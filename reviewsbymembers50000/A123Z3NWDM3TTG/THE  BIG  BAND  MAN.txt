 You know me by now, I love jazz and the big band sound. This wonderful collection of Benny(King of Swing)Goodman, is priceless. I really like them all, but if I had to pick favorites, I'd pick: "Stompin' at the savoy," "One o'clock jump," "Sing, Sing, Sing," "King porter stomp," "Bugle call rag," and the list goes on. This is definitely the very best of Benny Goodman, and as you know, I recommend it.
