 Mr.Cab Calloway was one of a kind. I think I was the last person on this earth to purchase this thin paperback booklet. In this book, Mr.Calloway explains his childhood. In his words, he was the most rebellious, stubborn, unrelenting black S.O.B you've ever wanted to meet. In my words, his stubborn ways is what drove him to fame. This book tells how he got started in show business, watching his sister Blanche Calloway while on tour with her and her band. If you are a Cab Calloway fan, and want to learn more about his life and his journey through show business; then this is the book to read. Dempsey J. Travis captured Cab Calloway's true feelings and personality. Mr. Calloway also talked about his fondest memories of being on the road, performing. From the mouth of Mr.Calloway, his philosophy was: People should grab a hold on life and live it to the hilt. Life is a fleeing and old age is a creeping; you got to get to getting while the getting is good.
