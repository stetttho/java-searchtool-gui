 If you aren't the kind of person that likes comedy, then this film is not for you. You have to have a pulse and a funny bone to view this crazy side splitting 1933 comedy. I had never knew W.C Fields was so down to earth with his jokes. When Rudy Valee was singing a rather bizarre ballad, W.C. Fields made a rude remark about his singing. There's another scene in the movie where W.C. Fields drove his car down the outside stairs of the hotel. As crazy as it may seem, it was really funny. (Yoohoo!) This is the word you'll hear when Mr. Fields asks from his helicoptor "What city is this?" (PRICELESS!)
