 Funny, charming, romantic, is what I have to say about this film. "Doris Day" was a smash. "Rock Hudson" was suave and debonair, he played his roll very well. And what a handsome gent he was. "Tony Randall" was a hoot. He was the funniest of them all. Mr. Webster played by: "Rock Hudson" makes up a phoney Idea called, VIP; to throw "Doris Day" off his track in a business deal. He creates a commercial with a show girl, and calls her the VIP girl. "Doris Day" finds out that the product VIP wasn't a real business deal, and demands that Mr. Webster prove his product exists or face the court for false advertisement. A very funny romantic comedy. I recommand it for the whole family to watch.
