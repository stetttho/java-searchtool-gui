 This is the most gory movie that I have ever seen. I wish the  stores could warn the consumers before they buy the products. Some say they hated it and some say they like it, it was the best animated film. It was this and it was that. But I say, "DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE!" To many confusing scenes that will leave you confused. And when you are confused, you can't enjoy the movie. So If you like brain teasers throughout a movie, then this is the one for you. It does have a lot of action, but you won't hardly know why.
