 I'M NEW AT WRITING, AND I PICKED THE GENRE OF EROTIC ROMANCE BECAUSE I LIKE TO READ EROTIC ROMANCES. THIS BOOK BECAME MY STUDY BUDDY FOR A YEAR NOW, AND I'M STILL IN AND OUT OF IT. I WOULD GO OVER THE PAGES WITH A FINE TOOTH COMB, JUST  IN CASE I'VE MISSED SOMETHING. THIS BOOK IS PERFECT FOR THE NEW EROTIC FICTION WRITERS. I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK FOR YOUR STUDY LIBRARY.
