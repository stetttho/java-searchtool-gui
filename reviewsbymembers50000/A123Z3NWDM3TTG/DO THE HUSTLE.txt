 THE MONKEY HUSTLE THAT IS. THESE GUYS WERE SO SLICK. THAT LITTLE KIRK CALLOWAY WAS SO CUTE, WITH HIS HIGH AFRO. HA HA HA!. I DIDN'T QUITE GET WHAT WAS GOING ON, BUT WATCHING THE WAY THE 1970'S LOOKED BACK THEN, CAUSED ME TO REMINISCE. HINT, HINT. I LIKED WHEN THEY WOULD GET A POLICE OFFICER'S ATTENTION TO LOOK AT SOMEONE ELSE, WHILE THE OTHER PERSON STEALS SOMETHING FROM ANOTHER PERSON WHEN THE VICTIMS WEREN'T LOOKING. STEALING TO SELL FOR MONEY, IS WHAT I GOT FROM THIS MOVIE.
