 I liked this film. I especially liked Duke Ellington's piece,(The Mooche,) in the beginning of the film. The music was good, but it seemed to be lacking something; like some ACTION MAYBE! All in all, it's still a must see. Richard Gere really looked handsome in his 1920's threads. of course he looks good in hardly anything on, but we won't go there. Despite of the slow running action, and the misfitted charactors that were supposed to be Duke Ellington, and Cab Calloway, this 1984 film did the best that it could.
