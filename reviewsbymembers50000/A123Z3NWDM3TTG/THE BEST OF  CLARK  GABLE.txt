 This movie is far yet my favorite of Clark Gable's. I liked the way he portrays a drunkin' news reporter, yelling at his boss over the telephone while his drunkin friends cheered him on. I also liked what he said when claudette colbert was standing up over him on the bus as it started to leave the station. The bus moved and jerked her back; down on his lap. He told her, "Next time you drop in bring your folks." That was pretty funny. It's a comedy, and a romance that everyone in the family could enjoy. I recommend it.
