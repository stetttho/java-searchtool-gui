 Duke Ellington in my opinion, was the best composer and piano player since Scott Joplin. He was the man! Duke Ellington; that is. Duke's music was the cotton club's entertainment. After Duke went on to persue new avenues, Cab Calloway took over the cotton Club's entertainment. These songs on this CD are his early pieces, such as: The Mooche, with or without Baby Cox singing vocal. Sweet Mama, Black Beauty, Black & Tan Fantasy, and many more. Another jazz masterpiece for your collection.
