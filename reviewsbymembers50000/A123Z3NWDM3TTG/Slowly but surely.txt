 This movie was slow to the point and lacked excitement. But there was only one scene that I chuckled on, it was when the old hawaiian lady's uncle; chewed on a leg from an animal. As he took a bite, he crunched on the bones of the leg; looking like a wildman with a wild eyed stare at the visitor of the island. Turned out that the old lady's uncle was a cannibal. The only thing that kept this movie from dying out, was the dancing and singing from Betty Grable, and the old Hawaiian lady.
