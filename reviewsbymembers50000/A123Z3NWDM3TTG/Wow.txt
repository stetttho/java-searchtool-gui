 This movie is the true meaning of the old famous hit song, "When a man loves a woman" This is a true love story. David Duchovny was a man who was in love with Brigitte Bako who played his girlfriend. His loving proposal to her for marriage, caused her to search her true feelings for him. She became involved with a blue collard worker, with a bad boy image; played by: Billy Wirth. The soft erotic sex scenes between Brigitte Bako and Billy Wirth, speaks for its self. She was torn between the bad boy who stimulated her sexually, and emotionally, and the white collard highly successful boyfriend. Her confusion became so overwhelming for her, that the bad boy who sold her the red pumps was her obsession; she wrote in her diary. David Duchovny responded to her writings, and acted out his frustrations when he decided to pay the bad boy a visit; challenging him to a basketball game. This gave David the chance to confront Billy face to face, and angrily express to Billy the girl's horrific tragedy. A touching story, I recommend it.
