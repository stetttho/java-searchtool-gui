 The Duke knew he had a sensation, he just never allowed her to fly to new hights; until he encouraged her to go and adventure out on her own. But he had to trick her, in order for her to take him seriously. He knew she would knock them dead with her beautiful singing voice. Ms. Lena Horne did just that. The Duke also knew that he wasn't a good show producer without her. This is a must see film. Done in 1938, the picture is a clear b&w classic.
