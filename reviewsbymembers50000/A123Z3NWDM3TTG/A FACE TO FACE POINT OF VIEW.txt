 This is my favorite jazz CD, I play it almost everyday. Every song is the bomb. The songs have meaning, and are sung by talented voices. His music has so much rhythm, that you would think it's a regular R&B CD. For those of you who are not into jazz music, this CD will convert you; I'll guarantee it.
