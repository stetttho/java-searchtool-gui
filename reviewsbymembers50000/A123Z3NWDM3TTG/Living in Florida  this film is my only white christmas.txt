 White Christmas takes me back to those days when I was a kid. This film was shown almost every year. Irving Berlin's White Christmas, was about two army buddies who sang and danced for the troops of their squad. "Bing Crosby" was superb in honoring his world war two general with the rest of the boys from his army bunker. "Danny Kaye", was the jokester of the singing dual that helped with  setting up the general's ceremony. A touching film, full of emotions & fun; will leave u smiling and singing. I recommend this film.
