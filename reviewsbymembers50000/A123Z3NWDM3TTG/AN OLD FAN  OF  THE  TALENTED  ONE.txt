 Anything to do with Cab Calloway I've got it. I'm a fan of his and always will be. These well organized CD's gives out that crisp sound of the 1930's down home jazz melody; that only Cab can sing out. This is the only CD that gives you all of his hits of the 1930's. The first recording of Minnie the moocher, Kickin' the gong around, you gotta hi de ho (To get along with me) and many more. You haven't heard Cab Calloway until you've heard him in his early years. This is a perfect introduction to your jazz collection.
