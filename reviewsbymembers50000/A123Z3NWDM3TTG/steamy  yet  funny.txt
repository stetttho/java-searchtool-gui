 I borrowed this video from a Library, not really knowing what to expect. It turned out to be a pretty steamy and hilariously funny movie. James Spader was really very sexy, playing the part of an upscale 27 year old Jewish widower. Susan Sarandon really played a convincing part of a poor conditioned living 44 year old woman. Both were lonely people looking for love. This is one very good steamy love story.
