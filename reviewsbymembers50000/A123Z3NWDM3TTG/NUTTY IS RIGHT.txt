 This movie was so stupid, that I laughed so hard. Eddie Murphy is so crazy. The best part that I liked was when the mother and the grandmother was talking in the beauty salon. The grandmother explained why she was experiencing sharp pains in her chest.  All of us natural big breasted women out there can relate to that; only if you're comfortable with the joke. The giant hamster is a must see.
