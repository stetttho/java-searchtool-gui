 If you are in need of a scanner, this is the one to purchase. This scanner delivers the best scanned results, better than any high priced model. First, all you have to do is insert the installation CD, then follow directions to installing the  Programs. Then, hook the scanner's usb cable to your computer,  it's that simple. This was my first time using and working with scanners. I had to take time to figure out how to use some of the programs, and functions to size and resize my photos. The scanner has functions on how to lighten and darken photos. There are functions for worn black and white photos, to touch them up and produce clear finishes. There are functions to scan colored documents, text documents, etc. And there's a function titled, advanced mode, where you can resize your photos to download them on the internet, and to email photos, etc. Don't let the price turn you away, thinking, "Oh, this scanner is too cheap to be any good." This scanner is just as good as any high priced, maybe better. But you be the judge, try it, I bet you'll be amazed of the performance. I highly recommend this product.
