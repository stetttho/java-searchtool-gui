 I've read the stories and loved them all, but my favorite one is, "It's never too late in New York," by, Nelson George. I don't want to explain too much, it's such a short story; I might tell it all in one paragraph. But I will say, I was excited to see slang writing, quoted for the characters. This was an urban story, African-American based. This story and all the others were engaging. In the story, I liked the character, Walter's personality. He had a sexy way about him. Walter mentioned to his friend Dwayne, about a girl whose nickname was Medina, a stripper he met in a club. Dwayne reminded Walter both he and him went to the movies with Medina together, in the past; he also reminded Walter of her real name. Dispite Dwayne's jealously towards Walter, in dating Medina, Walter remained cool about it all. Throughout the whole book, these hot, erotic stories were really worth reading.  I recommend it.
