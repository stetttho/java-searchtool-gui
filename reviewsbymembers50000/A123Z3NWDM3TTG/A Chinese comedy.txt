 I purchased this movie only because I thought the guy from the movie, "The Lover" (Tony Leung) was going to be in it. But this (Tony Leung)doesn't look like him. Anyway, I thought this movie was kinda comical. It was pure Chinese dialog, with English words popping up each time the actors talked. This movie was fast pace, and a bit exciting. It was also romantic. Both stories were good, but I especially liked the first one. The guy was kinda handsome, and witty. He was a cop, but it seems as though he couldn't catch a crook; nor get a date. This made the film comical. The fact that he had an obsession with expired cans of pineapples was silly, but hilarious. The second story was weird, but also hilarious. All stories were romantic in a comical and weird way. At any rate, this was a pretty good movie.
