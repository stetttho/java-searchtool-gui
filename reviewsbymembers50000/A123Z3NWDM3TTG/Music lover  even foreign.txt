 Beloved Chinese songs are songs sung in Chinese, I wouldn't have it any other way. To the other reviewers, the songs may be sung in Chinese and you may not understand them; but inside of the CD the meaning of the songs are explained in English which makes the songs more enjoyable. Listening to these beautiful songs, and melodies; relaxes me. "Purple bamboo" is my favorite.
