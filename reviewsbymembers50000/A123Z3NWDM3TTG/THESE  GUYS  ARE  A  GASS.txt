 Terrance & Phillip are a hoot, when they toot, toot, a poot. They think that fart jokes are funny, but they're not! Says the guy that tries to kill them. This guy teams up with sadam houssain; as sadam tries to take over Canada. (Oh canada, our home and native land,) is the country's national anthem. This is a really funny south park.
