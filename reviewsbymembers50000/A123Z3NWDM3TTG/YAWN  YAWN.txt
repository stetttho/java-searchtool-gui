 WELL, I didn't really care for this book. I don't concider myself to be a shrew about everything, because I pretty much like the stuff I buy, but I really didn't do too well this time with this one. I think I got through the first five pages; that was pretty good for me. The last page that I stopped on, said something about a guy dropping his napkin on the floor, and bent down poking his behind up in another guy's face that he liked, while knowing that the guy wasn't interested. All I know, was that the guy was going to kick his you know what. If you like to read stories like these, then this is the book for you.
