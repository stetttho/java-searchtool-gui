 General Calloway was what the boys in his band would call him. He was a devoted and stern band leader. These songs are what you may have missed on all of the other albums of his. What's not on those are on this one. A few familiar ones, and a few unheard ones. They're all of his great toe tapping creations. My favorites are: "Dawn time," and the fun song: "A blue serge suit with a belt in the back." The song, "The honeydripper," will make you want to twist your hips to the beat. The song, "I got a gal named Nettie," was the song Cab sung in his own movie:(Hi-De-Ho.)Also, "Hi-De-Ho man," was done on that same movie. Another recommendation is deemed for your jazz collection.
