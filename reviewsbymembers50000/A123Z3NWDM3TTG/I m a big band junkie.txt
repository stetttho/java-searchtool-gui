 Crazy for that big band sound. Sure wish that I could play like these cats. These are the best soundtracks I've heard in one collection. All of your favorites are collected and brought together on one CD. Songs like: (Truckin') By: "Fats Waller" Also, "Charlie Barnet" doing his version of (Pompton Turnpike) And "Benny Goodman" in (Goodnight my love)Also, Glenn Miller, Lionel Hampton, Arti Shaw, Duke Ellington and many more. Definitly worth buying.
