 This CD is the best choice, if you've never heard of Benny Goodman. Ken Burns picked a winner with this one. I'm an old fan of Goodman's music, and I've always enjoyed the big band sound as a kid. I especially like SING, SING, SING. This song will have you on your toes. Peggy Lee's, "Why don't you do right?", is another winner. You will enjoy the clear crisp sound of this CD. All songs are in its original format, it sounds just as if you were there sitting in the audience. A great way to start your big band collection.
