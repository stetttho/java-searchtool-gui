 I liked this one, of course I'm a jazzter anyway. Very smooth, along with that R&B touch. I like them all. My favorites are: "Change the world" Originally done by "Eric Clapton." And also, "We fall down," Origianlly done by "Donnie Mc clurkin" These are all very good pieces, and deserve to be heard.
