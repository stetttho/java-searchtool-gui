 I had to watch this movie twice before I got what was going on. There aren't any plots, not that I could spot. (A little rhyme there) Anyway, I only liked one scene, and that was when two Afro American guys were walking out in the woods with a laundry and dry cleaner owner who was playing a role of a chinese man. He was so aweful at it that it would make you laugh out loud. The two Afro American guys were just as funny. The actors of this 1940 film, were bad actors, but the story was so fake that it was hilarious. If you want a good laugh, this is the movie.
