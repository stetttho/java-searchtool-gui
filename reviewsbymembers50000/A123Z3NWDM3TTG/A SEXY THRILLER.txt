 Great expections, was a good film. Although it left me in a world wind of confusion. "What was the girl's problem?" She was really flaky. While fin was a quiet and unusual young boy, he was also that way as he grew into a man. The girl, I forget her name, was a flaky young girl, and grew to be a confused young woman. She seem to be unsure of life and love. And the old woman that was raising her was a real piece of work, she was also weird. The story never tells if the old weird woman was her relative or not. Amazingly enough, I liked this weird movie. "How weird is that?"
