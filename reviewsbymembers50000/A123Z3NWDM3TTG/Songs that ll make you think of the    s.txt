 This CD is an updated version of the 1970's sound. This CD has the soulful sound of Marvin Gaye, the funk jazz sound of Roy Ayers; along with a visual concept of the African American cinema. I love every song on this CD, and has copied it onto a cassette to listen to inside of my car. I like the songs: "full of smoke," "pull it," "where I'm from," "face like yours," and "tonight." I highly recommend this CD.
