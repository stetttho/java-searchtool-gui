 I liked this CD, it was interesting to me. She sort of remind me of a Madonna jr. She dances and sings way better than Britney! The little young woman, with a strong voice, had something to say. She spoke her mind, in this CD, and some folks were intimidated by it. I'm sure she doesn't care, and I say to her; "you go girl!" The key tracks on her CD that I really liked, were: (Get the party started), (Going to California), (Respect), and (Family Portrait.) Keep up the good work Pink!
