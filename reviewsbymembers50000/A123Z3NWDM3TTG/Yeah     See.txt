 This was a very educational bio on the ruthless gangsters of the 1900's. Bugsy Siegel, Dutch Schultz, & Al Capone, are the high lights of this film. Bonnie & Clyde, was also mentioned. I gave the film two stars because of its aweful condition. The sound and picture wasn't great, but the information that I could make out; was very interesting. Should be recommend for school history papers, or school classroom viewing.
