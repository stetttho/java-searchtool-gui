 This movie was good, but the actors could have been a little more excited while acting their roles. Steve Allen was great, he had the real Benny's style and cool wit. The music kept the movie exciting. But God help us!, when it stopped, those actors were like, "night of the living dead" "I kid you not!," anyway, I liked Benny Goodman's music, and that alone kept my interest; it also encouraged me to purchase the movie.
