 The video cover says it all, this is black entertainment. This video is of talented black singers, actors and actresses. I especially like the soundies video, they look like their having so much fun singing and dancing. That era sure looked like fun. The only objection to one scene that I've viewed in this film, by me being a woman, is, the smack down from Jimmy in the 1929 film St. Louis Blues. It's not just that, it's just the way Bessie Smith handled it. She made me kinda mad, and I became disappointed in her character. But, I suppose that was the way the script was written.
