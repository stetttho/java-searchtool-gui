 The book, "The black man according to God," was outstanding. Every significant detail Dr. Womack shared, followed by the scriptures of the holy bible were the most encouraging by far. The book mentions the names of black men, who played important rolls in biblical history, thus revealed in the King James version of the Holy Bible. This book would be perfect for every black history class, or to display for consideration at a black history gathering. I recommend it.
