 I borrowed this video from the library, and viewed it only once. Once was all I could take. I never knew too much about bojangles, nor did I wanted to watch any of his movies. But I found his biography very interesting. Gregory Hines was superb in this video; hats off!. I saw the real bojangles in the movie "Stormy Weather," and he was great. This movie was very moving and a bit depressing; but that's the way it was for the starving African Americans of the entertainment era. Thus proven by historians of the African American history.
