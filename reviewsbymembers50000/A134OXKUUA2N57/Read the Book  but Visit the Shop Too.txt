 I had the good fortune to work within a few blocks of Buttercup Bake Shop and often stopped in to take oodles of cupcakes back to my ever appreciative coworkers -- a lovely tradition.  These baked goods are to die for.  (It did get annoying that they would limit how many they would sell at a time, but if I had another coworker there they could get the extras I couldn't by just getting next in line -- it was annoying.)  That's my ONLY fault with this place though, and now that I'm back in California I'm thrilled to at least have the book so I can make some myself.  If in the neighborhood and you're a cook, check out Bridge Kitchen Ware as well -- they have a wonderful catalog.  ENJOY!
