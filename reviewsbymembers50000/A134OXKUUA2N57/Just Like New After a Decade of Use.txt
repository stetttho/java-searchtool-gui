 Easy to use, takes up no room, everything about it thought out well and executed well.  I literally bought one in 1996 and it's still working (and looking) like the day I bought it (this despite several moves all over the country during that DECADE).  A marvelous item and even better it's half the price now that it cost ten years ago.
