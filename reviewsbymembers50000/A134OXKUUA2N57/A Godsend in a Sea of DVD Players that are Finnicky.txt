 After a truly dreadful experience with another Panasonic DVD player (also reviewed online here) that I just couldn't take anymore after less than two months of use (it routinely rejected DVDs, etc.), I got online at amazon.com and epinions.com and other places and narrowed the field on what would be reliable.  Sony models all seemed to mention great image quality but sometimes unwillingness to play discs.  This model pretty much mentioned it played most all discs it was asked to -- very important to me.  Reluctant to buy another Panasonic at first, I am happy to report it has worked flawlessly, plays discs other DVD players won't, and meets my expectations.
