 I enjoyed this.  I enjoyed Lindsay Duncan as Annie Mayle having seen her prior as the looney blond in "Under the Tuscan Sun" -- totally different woman here.  Having done renovations recently, I also completely identified with the ongoing kitchen renovations and other things.  I confess I've only partially finished the book after 10 years of owning it.  I always get busy and it seems episodic and not terribly compelling to continue with.  The DVD, on the other hand, I enjoyed, but felt it might have been slightly wackier in tone like the books.  I don't know what's up with the baker story at the end but it's a complete ripoff of Marcel Pagnol's "The Baker's Wife."  Maybe it seemed like a good idea on paper, but it left me searching for the remote to fast forward through these sections.  As for Provence, this isn't picture postcard Provence like we're used to but real Provence, complete with telephone poles in frame.  It reminded me a lot of California farmland.  This is enjoyable but it's not stellar.  In the end I'll keep memories of Lindsay Duncan, the beautiful house they chose, a few scattered moments here and there, and little else.  But don't get me wrong.  I liked it, I just wasn't captivated by it and maybe that's really in the writing and especially the direction which is a bit pedestrian considering the book is so almost universally loved and is of a different tone than this more even-keeled film version.  The second disc, by the way, is excruciatingly bad when seen as a whole.  Except for the petanque storyline, one finds himself turning on this series as extremely contrived and resents that yet again for the 100th time too many it seems the Mayles are called in to save the day for the French, as if they haven't been doing it on their own just fine for some time.  The sense of superiority is annoying.  Go home to England TV versions of Annie and Peter Mayle.  Your fish out of water story has run out of water and leaves just a little too much fish.
