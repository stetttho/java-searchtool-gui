 John Saladino is often referred to as the "designer's designer" and I have followed with pleasure his designs from the 1980s through until today.  I have also had the pleasure of visiting more than one Saladino interior and showhouse room on multiple occasions, as well as his showroom in New York, and can say with certainty that the images in the book don't begin to capture what they are in reality and how important the quality of light is on the materials selected.  While I was a little disappointed with the way the images appear in this book (the paper stock doesn't seem conducive to showing the interiors at their best compared to glossy magazines), I have seen many of the same rooms in truly glossy publications many a time and they are stunning and always refreshing for their bold and assured mixing of antique and ornate with simple and modern (and if the negative reviewer below read the text he would know that Mr. Saladino appreciates objects for their beauty no matter their pedigree -- even simple things that aren't expensive mixed with long time precious treasures [one of his design signatures found again and again, for instance, is to use scientific volumetric flasks used as long-necked vases with a single delphinium -- total price, about $13-$26, including the flower]).  Thumb through and enjoy the pictures, but also read the text and you will get an education in design like nowhere else, and be able to apply it to your own space and life and even the way you see.  I was somewhat underwhelmed with the images (again due to the dullish paper stock) but the text was wonderfully informed (and didn't come off as snobbish at all to this reader).  If you can find old issues of Architectural Digest (in which Saladino NEVER appears anymore for years and years, probably because he didn't kiss up to Paige Rense and often shows his interiors in competitors House Beautiful, House & Garden, etc.) you are in for a treat, but better still, in this book you're in for an education.
