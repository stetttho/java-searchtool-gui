 I bought and used this DVD player for fewer than two months before I just couldn't take it anymore. I found it routinely rejects DVDs (tells me I have to clean them or they may be scratched) that other DVD players play just fine. I clean them and usually that fixes them, but not always, and keep in mind, this means they always have to be perfectly clean or they just won't play at all in this machine, where they will in others. The OTHER problem this player seems to have is a basic design defect -- it has some kind of buffer that fills up and at that point it quits playing your DVD after about an hour or so. Eject the disc and restart from the same place and it plays fine again even at the same place it quit, so it's not a problem with the disc. (Apparently a buffer [memory buffer?] becomes filled up during normal play of a 2-hour disc and the machine then just quits, and the only way to get it to play again is to eject it and restart the disc from that chapter.) It also seems to hang up A LOT on the transition from when you click a menu item to going to the place the menu is supposed to take you. Note that all contact to Panasonic about this has, to date, been ignored, even though it's on warranty. This has truly been a hassle for me and I cannot recommend this machine to anyone in good conscience. (The VHS worked fine but the image quality is rather poor even for VHS.) Clearly there are majorly substandard parts used in this machine, coupled with defects in its very design in regard to the DVD player. After reading several reviews online I found a DVD player that reviewers said again and again worked reliably with DVD discs -- the Panasonic DVD-S27. I was reluctant to buy another Panasonic, but the DVD-S27 is superb and inexpensive and reliable.
