 According to Stephen Collins who stars in the film this isn't a movie of a Danielle Steele book, rather the movie script came first (written by someone else) and Danielle Steele was hired to write the novelization of the movie script while the film was being made.  (Now she lives in the old Spreckels manion across from Lafayette Park in San Francisco and wouldn't need the money.)  I remember this film fondly for the score and for Kathleen Quinlan's smokey good looks and voice (Beatrice Strait's and Stephen Collins' performances too), and it's been a pleasure over the years in San Francisco to have driven by the old fire house they used as Kathleen Quinlan's photography studio in the film.  The whale mural on the side of the building next to the Bank of America parking lot faded over the years, and sadly, finally they've started building on the parking lot next to the fire house and no more whale mural in the lot where "Marie" parked her AMC Pacer (remember those?), but it was there for years and is immortalized in this film, and the fire house is still there on Oak Street near the DMV.  Really silly and schmaltzy flick made for people into romantic fantasy than anything even remotely approaching reality, but it has its pleasures.
