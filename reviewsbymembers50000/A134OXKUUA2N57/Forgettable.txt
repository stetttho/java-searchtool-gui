 This film did little for me.  It looked nice (France).  Charlotte Rampling is still a pleasure to watch (fully nude here, but pointlessly, so it made me feel ashamed for her that she had to do this for the role, as it wasn't an integral plot point and could easily have been done without [far more classy too]).  The French actress (Ludivine Sagnier) is good (she's also Tinkerbell  in Peter Pan [2003] and one of the daughters in the film 8 Women (...)Lots of female nudity, nice scenery, but my sense was the story ran out of gas and it went from being one film to shifting gears into something else just so it could wrap up.  In the end, I have no desire to see this again.  It was okay, but it didn't make much impression on me.  You could easily miss this and never really miss anything.
