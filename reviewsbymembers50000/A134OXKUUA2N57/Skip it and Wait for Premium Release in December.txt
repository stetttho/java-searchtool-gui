 According to the New York Daily News:        Rhea said HBO is planning a "super-premium" set of "Sex and the City" to hit stores before Christmas.        "I think there is absolutely a super-premium collector's market," she said about "Sex and the City."        Though all seasons have been released in separate installments, Rhea said the complete collection, including additional content and DVD extras not available on the originals, is being developed with "an eye for the collector," including new disc art and lavish packaging.        "It'll be kind of showpiece that you might want to own and preserve, and not use as your everyday set," Rhea said. "I guess it would be kind of like the good china. Or the good shoes."
