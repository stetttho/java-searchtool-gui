 This is one of those DVDs I put in again and again.  I knew absolutely nothing about it when I bought it except I was told that it was hilarious. The first time I viewed I didn't even realize that such a diverse group of characters was, for the most part, played by three very funny, very talented, very well made-up comics, and I still don't know how one transforms into the puffy nutty third-rate businessman.  While not every characterization or group of characters are hilarious (I don't much care for the businessmen nor the Greek Pops and his newsvending sons -- boring, to me), the rest are incredible.  I especially like Edward and Tubbs and Pauline and her "job seekers," and how can you go wrong with a butcher named H. Briss and a pair of prize frogs named Sonny and Cher?  :)  Then there's Dr. Chinnery the unlucky veterinarian and Barbara the pre-op transsexual cab driver and the ultra-anal retentive aunt and uncle and their two demonic twins in the mythical and askew town of Royston Vasey.  So much more -- don't miss it!  WHY OH WHY is there no release in the U.S. of Series 2, the 2000 special, and Series 3?  Everyone who has seen this finds it hilarious.
