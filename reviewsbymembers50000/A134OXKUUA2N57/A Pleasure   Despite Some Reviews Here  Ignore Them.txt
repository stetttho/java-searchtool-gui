 Why do we read this type of text except for a vicarious thrill and the gleaning of little details of French life?  I can't understand the sometimes negative reviews here.  This isn't a work of fiction and these people seem to be reading it in the wrong spirit if they expect it to be.  For what it is, a chronicle of one woman/family's life in France, I found it enjoyable and would recommend it.  If a few readers are by now jaded thinking it yet ANOTHER Peter Mayle, Ann Barry, et al. tale, well then they need to move on and read something else instead of expecting to find magic over and over in sameness.  Enjoyable.  And it has some recipes.  Buy it.
