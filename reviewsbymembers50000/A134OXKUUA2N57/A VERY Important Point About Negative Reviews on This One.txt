 Please note, the KF550 was released around January of 2004.  If you're seeing reviews (and espcially negative reviews) prior to that time it's because reviewers should have been reviewing the similar KF510 which preceded this one but the KF550 had reviews on amazon.com for months before you could even order it so people were simply adding reviews to a similar looking but different machine.  By all accounts the KF510 made FAST coffee -- too fast.  This improved version (KF550) makes it slower for better flavor (longer contact between water and ground beans).  So watch for reviews on this one AFTER January 2004 and ignore any before.  The problems with the KF510 have been fixed and this is by all accounts one of the most stylish (and tasty) coffee makers you can buy.  ADDENDUM:  After usign this for several months it's still a great coffee maker but I notice we pay the price for the gorgeous/shiny coffee filter basket -- the plastic seems to be coming apart in layers after this time due to heat of washing in the dishwasher.  If you're going to buy this coffee maker you may want to wash the filter basket manually.  Also of note, when you want to replace the filter basket you can ($5 to $10 online) but only in black or white, not in the slick, rich looking silver color that came with the coffee maker and was one of the reasons I liked it.
