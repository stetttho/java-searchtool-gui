 What a mess this thing is.  It clogs continually (I have to dig out the little chute with a shishkebab skewer two or three times each grind session), makes a huge mess, the timer never worked (was broken when box opened) and I have to repeatedly press the on button to grind just one hopper-full.  This is absolutely one of the worst products I've ever bought and to make it worse Black & Decker knows it's junk because the grind ring does fine, medium, and coarse, but the directions tell you not to use the fine setting, so they know about the problem and this thing is useless for espresso.  What a rip-off.  Don'tmake the mistake I did by giving this company your money.
