 What an enjoyable book -- warm and not too condescending as can be Peter Mayle and others who write this genre. Initially off to a slow start, I felt, once I was a chapter or two into it I was hooked, and toward the end I didn't want it to end.  Now I'm off to the UK version of amazon (amazon.co.uk) to buy the followup by Annie Hawes called Ripe for the Picking, which apparently hasn't been published in the U.S. just yet. FOLLOWUP:  I've now read the sequel, Ripe for the Picking, and I'm happy to report the writing and good humor just gets better and better.  Of all the books in this genre of "travel memoir" that I've read, I believe I've enjoyed Extra Virgin and Ripe for the Picking the most.  Great humor, an affectionate look at the locals, and a healthy dose of wish fulfillment for us all.  Under the Tuscan Sun has nothing on this.  Enjoy!
