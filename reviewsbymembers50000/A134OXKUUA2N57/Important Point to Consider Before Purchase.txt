 This model does not feature UV protection on the glass door so it's useless for storing wine long term except in a garage or basement.  If you plan on installing in your kitchen, get something else with UV protection.  Haier has a higher end model that does feature UV glass.  Too bad because I think it's very stylish and understated and actually nicer looking than the higher end model. The main thing to remember here is that you need to either situate this in a dark place (a basement would be better than a garage since your electric bill will be less) or you need to plan on using it only for short-term wine storage -- very important fact to remember in deciding on models to purchase.
