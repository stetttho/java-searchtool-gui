 This item never worked as stated right out of the box.  The timer never worked at all and the only way to get it to grind was to press in the button, then after a bit it would stop and you'd have to press it again.  You couldn't just walk away for 20 seconds or whatever, you had to stay and keep pushing the button.  It's also very messy and clogs frequently.  The grind quality is uneven, and even in my trusty $600 Gaggia espresso maker this refuses to grind beans in a way that will produce crema.  Do yourself a favor and skip it.  It's horrible.
