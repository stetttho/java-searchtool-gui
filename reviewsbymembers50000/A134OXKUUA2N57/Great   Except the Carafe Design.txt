 This was a design icon of the 1980s and is still produced today with minor changes.  I have no complaints at all with it except for the carafe.  It's amazing that Braun has made this for over 20 years and the carafe design is STILL, after all this time, prone to spilling much too easily.  And the flavor saveor (little plastic hinged sealer thingie) seems to just get in the way, especially at dishwashing time.  I'd love it if they replaced the carafe, but having been annoyed with it for over 20 years (with and without the flavor seal) I'm moving on, even though it's over 1/3 less than in the 1980s when it cost $60+.
