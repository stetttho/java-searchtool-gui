 Thierry Lhermitte and Karen Allen are both quite appealing in this film.  It has memorably beautiful production design (Paris and country French, Mr. Lhermitte's 80s Jaguar and stylish clothes) and a nice score by John Barry (Somewhere in Time, etc.).  Mr. Lhermitte has never looked more stunning than in this particular film (the eyes, the hair, the bone structure, the smile, the refined city-man elegance) and few men on Earth look this beautiful (yes, that's the right word for it) except maybe Gregory Peck.  The plot is silly -- absolutely silly and contrived -- but accept it for what it is and enjoy the visual feast.  This film works on the level of wish fulfilment like those paperback novels one sees secretaries reading on subways and realizes they'll never get to the place they're dreaming about because it doesn't exist.  As mentioned in another review, there is a moral issue here, but you don't really believe ANY of this so it's easy to overlook and just enjoy the rest (that issue, an extramarital affair, is just a contrivance to keep the couple apart).  Christopher Cazenove in a supporting role is just as "smarmy" (unintentionally) as he appeared to be as Blake Carrington's (surprisingly English-accented) brother on TV's Dynasty.  This is a cream puff.  A guilty pleasure with no nutritional merit.  Enjoy.
