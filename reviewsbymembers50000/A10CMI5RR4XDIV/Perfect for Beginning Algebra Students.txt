 I used this as a textbook for an Abstract algebra course I took recently.  It was surprisingly readable, and more importantly, there are plenty of examples that illustrate the definitions and theorems they've given. Just a single complaint:  There are times when important definitions are introduced in sections that are marked as examples, so it's not really safe to skip over the examples.  This can be a little frustrating until you catch on, but it's not a big problem.
