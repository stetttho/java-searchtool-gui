 I'm no audio expert, but these are the best headphones I've ever owned, and I've been through a couple of pairs in this general price range.  I've found these to be very helpful in my noisy office enviroment.  They produce sound so clear and eliminate outside noise so well, that I'll occasionally slip them off for a second, just to make sure they're not loud enough to disturb my officemates (which they never are). Strongly recommended.
