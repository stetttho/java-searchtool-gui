 You can't expect anything more from a book on this subject.  It is suitable for a beginner that doesn't know a thing about LaTeX, but also includes details on important advanced features like BibTeX and makeindex.  Perhaps most importantly in the long run, the excellent index and detailed appendices make this a valuable reference.  I use LaTeX all the time and this book is never far from my side!
