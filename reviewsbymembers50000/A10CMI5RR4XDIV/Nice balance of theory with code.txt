 This book was pleasantly surprising:  I had expected to see code presented with minimal motivation or discussion of the underlying ideas -- something of a "Computational Geometry for Dummies" sort of book.  That's not the case at all.  This is a bona fide textbook on the subject, suitable for an undergraduate course. It covers all of the the "classical" topics: convex hulls, line segment intersection, polygon triangulation, Voronoi diagrams, motion planning. The mode of presentation -- supporting a discussion of the theories with implementable code -- is actually a bit refreshing.  For comparison:  Other books, when discussing the line segment intersection problem (ie: Given a set of line segments, find all of their intersection points) simply assume that computing the intersection of a pair of segments can be done in constant time.  This is not an especially difficult problem, but the discussion seems more complete with a brief description of how this might be done.  The same can be said about other primitive tests and operations in other algorithms. Overall, this book can stand alone as an excellent introduction to computational geometry, but a serious student in the subject will want more: perhaps Preparata and Shamos or de Berg et. al.
