 This is cable and the accompanying software are in theory quite powerful.  The software allows you to synchronize information in your phone with other sources -- most notably Outlook and Palm Software. Don't even bother trying to run the TrueSync software that's including in the box -- it is so poorly designed and buggy that it is unusable.  Motorala offers an upgrade to TrueSYnc 3.1, which is so far superior that it feels like a whole new product.  Just install the old version (the update refuses to install otherwise) and go to the Motorola site for the update. Be prepared to spend a little bit of time setting everything up to begin with, but once you get going it works great.  With due deference to the experiences of other reviewers, the software works great with both Palm devices (although you need Palm's HotSYnc software for things to work) and Outlook.  I simply plug in my phone and my PDA, click a button and within a minute or so, all of the information in my phone, my PDA, Outlook, and Palm Desktop are synchronized with one another.  This is highly recommeneded if you need these features. Also, it is rumored that with thisd cable you can dial your phone into an ISP to connect to the internet.  This feature hasn't worked yet for me and I haven't been able to work things out with the tech support people at Motorola, so I can't recommned this product for that purpose.
