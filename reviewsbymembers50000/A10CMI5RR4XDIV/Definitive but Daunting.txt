 It is with good reason that these books are so well-respected in the field.  These books have enough depth for several years of careful study and will be quite rewarding for anyone who takes the time.  Still, there are a couple of things to keep in mind before jumping in: (1) These books are not for the mathematically weak-at-heart.  The first section, of over 100 pages, is on mathematical preliminaries.   While it is true that there are many later sections that can be understood without this background, to truly get the most from these books will take some mathematical maturity, (2) The algorithms and programs in the book will be difficult to understand to the modern reader, since they are written in an unstructured (i.e. GOTO-centric) style.  Program code is given in assembly language for a fictional computer called MIX. Knuth may have his reasons for sticking with this form, but the reader should be aware that some extra work will be required to follow along. Aside from these caveats, these books come highly recommended.
