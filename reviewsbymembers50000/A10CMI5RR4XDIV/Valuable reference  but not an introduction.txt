 This book claims to be an "introduction" to the study of algorithms, but for comparision, it's used at my university as the textbook for a course for senior undergraduates and beginning graduate students. It's a decent reference book for answering questions like "What's the best algorithm for..." but not for basic questions like "What is an algorithm?" If you're interested in algorithms but think you're not ready for this book, I'd recommend Knuth's "The Art of Computer Programming" for readers that aren't afraid of math and Sedgewick's "Algorithms in C++" for queasier types.
