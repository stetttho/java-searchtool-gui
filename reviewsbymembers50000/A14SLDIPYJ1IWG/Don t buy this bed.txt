 I bought this bed for my two year old daughter because it looked cute and she loves precious moments. When I put it together I could tell it was cheeply made. It was alright for about a week. Everything started coming loose. A screw fell out and my daughter tried to put it in her mouth, and two bars fell out 3 days apart. She was very upset when we had to return it, because she loves precious moments. We ended up getting a noah's arch bed from wallmart. This bed is dangerous, don't buy it!
