 With 5 children we've used many different carriers and this is the best. I would not usually spend this much, but after reading all the good reviews and hearing good things about it at work, I decided to buy it. It is so easy to get on and off and my son always seems comfortable in it. It's also easy to adjust. Even our 17 year old babysitter was able to figure it out with no directions. If you are going to buy a carrier, spend a little extra and get a Baby Bjorn carrier.
