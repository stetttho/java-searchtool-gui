 For [the money] I didn't think these stilts would be anything great. My daughter begged for stilts for her 9th birthday, and these were the cheapest pair we could find. I was surprised at how durable they are and how easy it is to adjust the foot rests. It was easy for her to learn how to use these, and she had them up as high as possible after a week of using them.
