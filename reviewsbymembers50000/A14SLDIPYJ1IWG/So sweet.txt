 My daughter loves this book. She thinks it's funny when the little boy makes a mess of the bathroom, and when hes a teenager she thinks he looks silly. This book has helped her to understand that I will always lover her no matter what she does. I cry every time I read it, and I don't think this story is weird at all.
