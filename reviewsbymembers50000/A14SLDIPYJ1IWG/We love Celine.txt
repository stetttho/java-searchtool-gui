 I have been a fan of Celine Dion for as long as I can remember. I usually prefer her French music over her English, but this is definitely an exception. The 2003 version of "Sorry For Love" is better than the first, and "Coulda Woulda Shoulda" is a great new style for Celine. Don't worry, It's nothing like "Treat Her Like a Lady". If you like this album please go see her show in Vegas. My husband and I went to opening night and are going again in August. It's an amazing show!
