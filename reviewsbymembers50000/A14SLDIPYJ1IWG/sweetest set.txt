 We chose this bedding for our youngest son. After 5 kids and my Pooh Bear obsession, we had been through 3 different Pooh crib sets. This one was definitely the best. It's so cute and so soft. It matched just about every Pooh thing we already had, and even looked great with the already yellow walls.
