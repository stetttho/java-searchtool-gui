 My daughter is ten months old and loves the Baby Safe Feeder. She has been using it for five months and it has been a life-saver.  We bought a bunch of replacement bags, and I think they are a little expensive, but still worth the money. We have two bags that we use just for foods that stain. She started out with softer foods like bananas and kiwi. Now that she is older, she can eat those foods on her own, but I still love the Baby Safe Feeder for carrots, pears, and strawberries. I wash it in the dishwasher so I don't have to worry about germs. I usually put her in her high chair to use it, because the juice leaks all over. It has been great to take to restaurants. She loves to try new foods, and usually ends up with some vegetables from Mom and Dad's salads. Overall this is a great product!
