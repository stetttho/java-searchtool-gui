 We bought this stroller while we were on vacation in Texas. We had taken down our old umbrella stroller that we used when our older son was a baby. On the second day of our vacation the stroller broke. a wheel fell off and the thing basically collapsed. We had to get something fast and cheap. This was it. We took it everywhere and my daughter seemed pretty comfortable. I was surprised at how well it held up. We still use it when we go to the park or for a walk. This is worth the money.
