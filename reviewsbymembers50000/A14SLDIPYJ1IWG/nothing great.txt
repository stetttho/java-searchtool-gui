 The Light and Sound Galaxy Gym and Playmat is nothing special, but I guess it got the job done. For 30 dollers I wish I had gotten something else. The playmat was very thin, so when he was still really little we tried to put a blanket under it, he still got bored or uncomfortable because he started crying in about three minutes. We waited a few months to try it again and he still seemed bored with it. It would hold his attention for short periods of time, but was nothing special. We finally sold it at our garage sale for fifteen dollers, and put the money toward a walker. I would not reccomend this product.
