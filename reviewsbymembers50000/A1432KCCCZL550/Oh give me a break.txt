 Where do these guys get off thinking they have the right or the talent to remake a Pink Floyd song?  Before I get too far into this review I'll just say if you only want the radio songs go ahead and get this.  That being said they should NOT have remade a Pink Floyd song.  Don't get me wrong I liked this band, and still do.  I really have no interest in hearing anything new by them but their older stuff is good.  Even Untouchable had a couple good songs.  That being said they're nowhere near as talented as Black Sabbath, Pantera, Megadeth, Iron Maiden, Led Zeppelin or Pink Floyd.  I've got a better idea for miss banwagon a-hole who has no taste in music and probably sits on his a-- all day watching mtv, what a crappy network.  Why don't you retire from writing reviews from albums.  This way people don't have to waste their time reading your pointless nonsensicle ramblings.  I also don't get why they have a remix of freak on a liech.  I guesss at least they put the origional on there too.  I really hate when bands put alternate versions of songs on their greatest hits.  That's what cd singles and soundtracks are for.  If you like Korn's hits but don't want their extra songs, of which they have a few good ones not on this album, then buy this.
