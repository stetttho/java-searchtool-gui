 That's the best way I can think of to describe this cd.  Another reviewer wrote about how he/she felt nothing when listening to this cd and I have to agree.  The songs are definately catchy and I feel relitavely well written, at least vocally, but I too felt nothing.  I knew Drag you down and First time when I got this one and I thought by the heavier somewhat guitaring in the choruses of both songs that they'd be a hard rock band.  I wasn't expecting Slayer or anything, but when I got this cd I was disapointed to realize that they are just like every other band to come out in the last ten years or so, not including raprock which was just awful.  The songs musically are so formulated it's almost laughable.  The intros vary from heavier to soft, mostly soft if I remember correctly.  Next you have a soft verse, either containing wierd electronic effects, just drums and bass, or soft electric guitaring.  Then you have the typical heavier chorus followed by the generic bridge consisting of guitar riffs vocals or just drums and bass again.  Pretty much bridges to songs have gone down hill since guitar solos went out of stle.  Very few bands come up with anything origional or awh inspiring to put there so this is what you usually get.  And of course no one wants to put a guitar solo there because either their guitarist sucks and can't play on or since it's not popular bands are too scared to put it in there for fear of being dropped by their record companies.    Basically if you like formula based rock, that's not really rock, then you'll probably like this band.  They sound like something that would get a lot of radio play.  It's strange that they didn't.  If you want something different then look somewhere else.
