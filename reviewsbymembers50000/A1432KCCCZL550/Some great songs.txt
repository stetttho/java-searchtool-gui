 Ok first off I have to say, of course people are going to be bias when reviewing this or any other album.  That's the whole point of these online reviews is to put our opinions out there to help people in their buying decisions.  I am an Alice in chains fan, and I do really like this album.  My only complaint is that it's too short.  Well, that hidden track was pretty awfull too.  I read a few reviews saying that Am I inside was a bad song, well you're wrong.  That song like the rest is an incredible song.  The guitars, vocals, etc sound great.  If a reviewer was correct who said that there's a cd with this one and the jar of flies songs I'd recomend saving money and getting that, asuming it has all of the songs, except the stupid hidden track on this one.  Otherwise, I definately recomend this cd.
