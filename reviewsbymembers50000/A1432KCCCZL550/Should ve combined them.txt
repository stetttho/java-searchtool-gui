 The songs on here are pretty good.  I just wish they had put them on their Headtrip to nowhere album.  If they were concerned with time they could take off that stupid crackballs song.   Anyways if you have their other album then this is a must.  My favorites are Bleak, actually along with Blind world and Cavalry Bleak is in my top three favorites by them.  It's almost worth the price alone.  Mind alone is also a very good song.  Outlived and Freeze up are decent songs.  They're definately worth owning.    If you haven't heard this band then get their full length cd first.  I can't think of anyone they sound like.  They're kinda similar to the hard rock coming out around 99 to 01.  The good thing is they don't sound like creed or godsmack, or Alice in chains, who I still say godsmack was copying.  They don't rap.  It's just a good hard rock band and this cd has some good songs from them.
