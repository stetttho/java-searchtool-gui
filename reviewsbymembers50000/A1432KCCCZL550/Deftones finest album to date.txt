 The Deftones have been one of the better metal bands to come out in the last ten years.  This is without a doubt their best one.  Many fans prefer their first one, but for me it's this one.  It has a great sound, great songs what more do you want?  Some favorites of mine are My own summer, Around the fur, Lhabia, Rickets, and Be quiet and drive.  There's not a bad song on this one, which you can't say that about bands these days.  If you're new to the Deftones then this is the one to check out.  They definately won't play them on mtv, cdourse they don't play videos on mtv.  If you like the Deftones and don't have this one then I suggest gettting it.
