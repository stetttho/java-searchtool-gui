 Well that pretty much sums it up.  As another reviewer said they've been heading in this direction for some time.  I think they had more good songs then that person thought but the point is this album's crap.  Every song is a pop song.  If you're looking for hard rock you won't find it here.  I'm all for progressing, musically, but this isn't progress.  Yeah as another reviewer put it it does sound more modern, that's because it is.  That doesn't mean that it's good.  Trust me and others on this site, stay away.  This boy band album sucks.  Oh and when did slayer or Pantera sell out?
