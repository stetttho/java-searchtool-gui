 I can't rate this cd too low because if it wasn't for this collection I wouldn't have known as many JP songs as I do.  This cd would have been perfect but for some songs that were missing in place of some really average songs that could've been left off.  The songs that should've been on here are the Ripper, Running Wild, Diamonds and rust, Green manalishi, Hot rockin, Riding on the wind, and Take these chains off.  There were a couple from painkiller I liked too but they weren't that memorable.  These songs would've made this a perfect compilation.  I don't know how they put bloodstone or devil's child on there.  Take these chains and Riding on the wind are far better songs from the same album.  The rage, and solar angels are ok but not worthy of being on a compilation.  Freewill burning was another average song that has started to grow on me a little.  That being said this cd still has some great songs.  It introduced me to songs such as Victim of changes, Painkiller, Nightcrawler, Exciter, and many more.  Disc one is the better of the two.  The only bad song is devil's child.  There's an acustic song that isn't great on this disc but it's started to grow on me as well.  Disc two contains most of the songs I complained about earlier, including the worst song on her, bloodstone.  Or was devil's child the worst, ah they both suck.  If you want to know more by an awsome band such as Judas priest without getting all of their cd's then this is a good start.  I'd suggest getting another compilation or two to go along with it.  The live album Unleashed in the east has four of the missing tracks while a couple more should be on a greatest hits.
