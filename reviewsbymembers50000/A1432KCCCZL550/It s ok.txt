 First off I'm glad he put the unreleased material from the box set on here.  I personally don't feel like buying an extremely expensive cd collection which consists of songs, most of which, I already have.    Now that that's out of the way, the cd's not bad.  If you're an Ozzy hater then you'll hate this cd.  My advice when reading these reviews is to look past the obvious Ozzy haters and the Ozzy fans who blindly give everything a five star rating.  The songs that stand out for me are Rocky mountain way and Mississippi queen.  The rest of the cd's ok, but nothing really special.  I got a little tired of songs with piano, and while ok Sunshine of your love sounded a bit too cluttered.  I never bothered with sympathy because I like the GNR version.  I like Hendrix's version of Fire so I didn't give that one a listen, and For what it's worth was done well by Rush so I skipped that one too.  I don't understand why his cover of stayin alive wasn't on here.  That was an excelent song that should've been on here.  If you're an Ozzy fan, then check it out.  As others have said keep in mind it's a cover album.  If you hate Ozzy then what are you doing reading this?  I don't get the Ozzy haters or understand why they even listen to this if they don't like his music.  When I don't like a band or artist, I don't listen to their music.  I avoid the radio all together so the chances of hearing someone I can't stand is limited.
