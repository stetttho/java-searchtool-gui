 When I bought this one the only song I knew on it was Bring your daughter.  I liked that song a lot and liked other maiden discs so I gave it a shot.  The disc kicks off nicely with a great and one of my personal favorites, Tailgunner, a great song along with Bring your daughter almost make this cd worth the price by themselves.  Hooks in you was the only song aside from the previous two i mentioned that really stuck with me at first.  Most of the others grew on me.  The only song that's just awfull is holy smoke which I only say that because the lyrics are just stupid.  The title track could've used a chorus either a standard one or a better musical one, but it's ok.  The assasin took me a while.  The lyrics in the chorus aren't that great and I hate the background vocals.  That being said it grew on me, unlike holy smoke.  The remaining tracks are all pretty good.  I recomend this album to any Iron Maiden fan.
