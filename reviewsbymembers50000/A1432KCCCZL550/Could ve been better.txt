 A couple of other reviewers already said what I have to say, but oh well.  I did like Ripper's vocal ability.  Listening to this one and the follow up, demolition there are times when I can tell he's got great potential.  Sticking with this album, I feel most of his potential was wasted.  He doesn't really sing very much or use the high pitched scream both of which he can do.  Aside from the vocals I was mostly disapointed with the drumming.  In fact I'd say this album contains some of the most boring drumming I've heard in a while, post metal metallica and staind not included, they really suck.  Cathedral spiral is the only worthwile song on this album.  It's a true masterpiece.  Death row has a good chorus and the first verse is ok.  I didn't know the title track jugulator had a chorus much less a bad one.  Aside from the first two songs I mentioned the rest of the album is worthless.  Abducters had some potential, but fell flat, bullet train could've been better.  This songs''s a perfect example of what I was talking about with the drumming.  It starts off well, but I expected it to get faster before the vocals kicked in.  Instead it's slow and boring, not that I mind slower songs but this one should've been faster.  Download Cathedral spiral or buy this one for $4 or less.  Spending any more money then that is a waste of time.  Oh yeah the lyrics were awfull in most of the songs.  I think ripper should work on his songwritting.
