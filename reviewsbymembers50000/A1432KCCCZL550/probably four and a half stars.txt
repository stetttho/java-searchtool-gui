 While this season wasn't as good as the first five, it's still better then seven or eight.  Danial's gone for most of the season.  Jack has a reduced role, not as much as in seven or eight.  Carter and Teal'c are awsome, and Jonas is ok.  I think with Jonas most people love him or hate him.  I'm kinda neither.  I thought he was ok, but I wasn't sorry to see him go in season seven.  I liked the fact that they introduce him in season five.  I hate when shows just bring a character from out of nowhere and expect the audience to like him/her.  Anyone remember the last two years of the x files?  I think they should've put the first two episodes as one.  They're a two part episode.  I think it would make things a little easier.  I don't like how the have the previously part before part two.  I could understand if it had parts of episodes other than the first part, anyways it's just a minor complaint.  The two part episode is pretty good, although part one gets a little dull at times.  Decent is a great episode.  The three episodes with Danial are awsome.  The Mayborn episode is good.  The episode that takes place on the alpha site dealing with the alliance is one of my favorites.  The episode with Nierte is good.  Many of the other episodes took a couple of times seeing to get into, but I liked them once I saw them a second time.  The worst episodes are probably the two without Jack, the one with the interdimentional creatures and the one where the Prometheus gets stranded on another planet.  Neither of these episodes are bad though.  All and all this is a good season of the show.  I can see the show's decline in this season, but it really didn't start to hit untill the next season.  If you have seasons one through five then definately get this one.  It's not as bad as some people would have you believe.
