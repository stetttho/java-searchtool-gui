 This might be my least listened to GNR album, even less than a unreleased song cd a friend made me which if you're a huge gnr fan and can download you should check out.  They do great covers of heartbreak hotel, dead flowers, dust in the wind, jumping jack flash, and of course sympathy for the devil.  Anyways this album has nothing to do with that.  It was the last one I got because I didn't know anything on it.  I didn't know the songs were all covers.  First off this album is a little different then any other gnr album.  That being said all of the songs are great.  I wish someone other than duff sang new rose and you can't put your arms around a memory.  Songs like that are the reasons why it seamed a little less like guns n'roses to me.  They were still good songs though.  Human being was an ok song.  Axl's vocals on the verses of the song kinda bothered me because I couldn't tell what the hell he was saying, the chorus was great.  My favorite songs on here were Hair of the dog, Since I don't have you, Down on the farm, Ain't it fun, and Black leather.  I can't understand how gnr fans don't like these songs.  Hair of the dog sounds like a gnr song as does black leather, to me anyways.  If you like Guns n'roses, not just the hits but their extra songs too, then definately check this one out.  It's a little different but well worth it.
