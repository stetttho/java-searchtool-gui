 Led Zeppelin was an outstanding band, and this album was one of their best.  I'm not saying they were the greatest band ever, although they were one of them.  Every song on this album is good, try saying that about today's music.  Don't tell me that the doors, bob dylen or the velvet underground are better then Led Zeppelin.  They're totally different types of music, good music, and the crap bands you mentioned.  I've never heard a vocalist as bad as Dylen, well untill staind, nickelback and creed. Another reviewer writing about metallica never having heard of them, well I've seen some of your other reviews and so you can't be taken seriously, by the way metallica's probably too busy suing people.  Led Zeppelin rocks and this is one of their best albums.
