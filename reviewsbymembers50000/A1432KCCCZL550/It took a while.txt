 This album seamed to take a while for me to truely apreciate.  It's very distorted except for Heanen beside you and Over now.  All of Layne's vocals are distorted.  After listening to this one I always feel like I'm in some drug induced state.  Despite that it's a great album.  My favorite tracks, and the ones that grabbed my attention are Grind, Brush away, Heaven beside you, Head creep, Again, and Over now.  Theise songs are incredible.  The remaining songs took me a while to grow on me, but they're pretty good as well.  I wish they did a song with Layne on vocals where he didn't distort his voice.  He has an awsome voice.  This is definately a must for Alice in chains fans.
