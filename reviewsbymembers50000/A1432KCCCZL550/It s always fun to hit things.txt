 But to do it over and over?  There are a couple of reviews that sum up most of what I think of about this game however neither mention the fact that once you've gone through all of the pointless stages in the game, you have to go back through them again.  I utterly hated the prison and the apartment "worlds".  Just terrrible.  In fact that's where I stopped playing, when I realized that fact.  Why can't they put killable enemies here?  As another reviewer said the ghosts just get annoying.  I don't like the Resident evil style inventory system and you can't even combine items like bullets to save space.   How is this guy stuck in an apartment?  Can't he break a window or something?  Maybe one of those mysterious holes that pop up in his apartment will show up in place of his chained up door and he can just walk out.  I loved the first three silent hills but this one was just terrible.  Can anyone tell me the suposed connection to the SH2 plot because I really don't feel like finnishing this.  Oh and another thing, why do I have to keep checking that stupid box to certify that I'm over 14?  I haven't been a teenager in over six years.
