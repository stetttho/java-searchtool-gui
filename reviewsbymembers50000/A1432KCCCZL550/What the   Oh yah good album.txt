 First of all I'm from Texas, and if AC/DC was too you can bet I'd be proud of it.  I like this band and this is probably their best cd.  One little thing though, they're not from Texas.  Don't worry I'm getting to the review.  Good Texas bands include Galactic Cowboys, don't let the name fool you they rock, ZZ top, Pantera, Pushmonkey etc.  AC/DC rocks.  This albun starts off perfectly with the classic Hells Bells and never lets up, well Shake a leg is kinda hard to remember at times but still a good song.  Every song on this album is great.  Can lim bizkit or blink 17 ah whatever say that.  Mtv sucks people who like mtv mu or what they call music suck AC/DC is cool.  Ok let's see AC/DC has been a popular rock band for over 25 years.  Con anyone name a blink or bizkit song to come out in the last five?  That reviewer is entitled to his or her opinion but he/she/it's an idiot every day of the week.  If you haven't heard this band before this is a great cd to start with.  It's the first with Brian Johnson at vocals.  Buy it, or download it.  Hey I didn't just encourage downloading music.  This band rocks mtv and mtv fans don't.  P.s. limp biskuit and linkin park aren't metal bands they suck and slipknot needs to try playing real music instead or growling all the time.
