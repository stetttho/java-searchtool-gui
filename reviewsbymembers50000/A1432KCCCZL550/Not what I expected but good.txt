 I didn't know anything on this album when I got it.  It was the first one I got because people kept telling me that Patience was a good song.  I was surprised to hear live songs and just as surprised that the end was all acustic.  Wreckless life is a good song to start the cd on.  It's a live straight up rock song that may take a few times listening to to like.  Nice boys didn't really do much for me untill recently.  I just don't like the name nice boys for a Guns n'roses song.  It's just me.  The song is another live straight rock song.  The chorus is repedative but still good.  Move to the city still isn't that great of a song.  It's ok worth listening to but nothing special.  Mama kin, an Aerosmith cover, in my opinion is better then the origional.  It's one of my personal favorites on this disc.  The only great straight up rock song on this disc.    Patience was the hit from this one.  It's an acustic song that for the longest time I didn't know that was axl on vocals.  He did a great job on it.    Used to love her was a little repedative, but a good song none the less.  For those offended by this one they say in the booklet that it's just a joke.  Don't take the lyrics seriously.  You're crazy is a remake of their song from Appetite.  I would've prefered it if they had wrote different lyrics or something for this one.  That being said it does have a nice sound to it.  One in a million is just awsome.  Another song that may offend some people, but if you just listen to the song it's really good.  The problem with people here in the US is that they look too hard for something to be ticked off about, and unfortunately it's never anything important.  Lyrics in a song aren't nearly as important as the fact that we had a pile of crap vs another pile of crap for presidential candidates.  Bush and Cary suck.  This albgum does not.   If you like Guns n'roses then definately get this one.
