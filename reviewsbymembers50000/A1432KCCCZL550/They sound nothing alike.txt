 Like another reviewer on here I know most of their songs through friends or family.  I don't like Creed and never will.  I don't know, however, how people say they're a Pearl Jam rip off.  They sound nothing alike.  Pearl Jam came out with really good rock music, mostly in the early to mid 90's.  Creed cant do a song with anything other then drop d tuning, for non guitar players drop d tuning makes some chords really easy to play, thus you get a crappy talentless band called Creed, or nickelback or godsmack, I would put staind in here as well but I think they use some wierd tuning.  I was just looking at this out of curiosity.  I got an email from a friend telling me about an idiot revviewer of an ac/dc album.  I cracked on the idiot there and now I've come across them again.  This person's reviews don't even make sense.  What does laughing at Pear Jam fans have to do with this cd?  Pear Jam will be in the rock n roll hall of fame, whereas you wouldn't know rock music if it bit you on the A-S!  To summerize Creed sucks, anything they do sucks, and mtv fans also you guessed it suck
