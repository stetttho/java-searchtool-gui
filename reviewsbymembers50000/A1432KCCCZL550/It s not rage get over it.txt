 First off I'm sick of both reviews and people I've heard talking about this bandbitching that it's not rage.  No sh--, rage broke up.  The music may be a little similar but it's a huge improvement over some guy rapping.  Don't get me wrong I like some of rage's songs and I would rather have seen soundgarden get back together but this cd is worth the time for anyone who like good rock music.  This disc has some great hard rock songs as well as some great slower ones.  The musicians are great.  The only flaw in this cd is the last track which is a little disapointing.  I will admit the first half of the album is probably better then the second but the same can be said about most albums.  If you like Soundgarden I think you'll like it, although it's NOT Soundgarden.  Definately check this one out.
