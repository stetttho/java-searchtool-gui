 I have no need to purchase this since I owne all of their albums and have many rare songs and b sides.  This is a solid collection of theri hits.  I can't think of a song I've heard on the radio that isn't on here except for Porch which I  don't think was a single.  An [...] reviewer out there claims that Pear Jam [...], which one might be able to take seriously untill he said great grunge music included creed hubastank staind and disturbed.  He got Nirvana right but the rest no.  I like Disturbed but they're not grunge.  This is just further evidence of this person's ignorance.  Creed, staind nickelback are all corpaeate crap rock wanna be bands with no talent.  Grunge bands consist of Pear Jam Stone temple pilots Nirvana, and other early 90"s rock bands.  This person must be completely brain dead.  Also Pearl Jam did sell out.  Remember ten, vs, and vitolagy?  Albums that really rocked.  I don't believe in coincidence so you can't tell me that when yield came out during the time where mainstream radio played no rock music and bands like matchbox 20 and third eye blind were considered heavy for radio that it's a coincidence that Pearl Jam came out with a soft album at this time.  Granted they don't rock like they used to but at least bineural and riot act never sounded a poppy as that album.  I'm not forgetting no code which was just a bad album.  This album is a greatest hits.  It's not a rare song compilation and it serves its purpose although I'd like to know why they remixed some of their songs, that dowsn't fit a greatest hits purpose.
