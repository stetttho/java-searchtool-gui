 Ok this cd's missing so many good songs, so why did they put two versions of plush on there.  The origional was good enough.  I really don't care about the acustic version.  It wasn't bad, but not nearly worthy of being on a greatest hits.  If they wanted to release this song they should've put out an acustic cd.  One ANGRY reviewer out there pointed out that they were missing a lot of good songs.  I get that there would be a lot of missing songs on this cd, but come on Dead and bloated is an STP classic.  Heaven and hotrods was another good one missing as well as Unglued and Tumble in the rough.  I know they would fit on the cd because I made one for a friend of mine and fit all of their best songs on it.  I didn't have anything from shang re who cares.  They could've done a lot better.  If you don't have any STP cd's consider checking out their first two, Core and Purple.  Tiny music and Four aren't bad either.  Scott's voice changes for the worse in their later ones.
