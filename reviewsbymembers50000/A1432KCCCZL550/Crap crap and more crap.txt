 This season was about Chris Carter and Fox trying to hold onto past glory and make as much money as possible.  This show should've ended in season 7, although season 8 had 4 or 5 ok episodes.  The show was about Moulder and Scully.  It was bad enough when Moulder left, but Scully was pretty much absent from this season.  I thought her baby being some kind of freak child was rediculous.  The super soldier story was pointless, and should've never been used.  After learning the truth in season 6 the writers should've spent the rest of that year and year 7 on concluding the alien takeover idea and ended the show.  Then came the long and I mean long awaited series finale.  They spent most of that episode in a courtroom.  I guess it was an ok episode, but it wasn't the blowout a show like this needed to end on.    As far as Dogget and Reyes go, I didn't really have any feelings one way or another.  Dogget had a few moments in season eight where he was kind of likeable.  They might have been able to pull off a spin off show, I really don't know.  I probably wouldn't have watched it.  I would've given it more of a chance then I did them calling it the ninth season of the X files. In stead of having an 8th and 9th years of this show they should've had a 4th and 5th year of an equal if not better show Millennium.  Don't buy this set.  Don't allow them to profit from this crap.
