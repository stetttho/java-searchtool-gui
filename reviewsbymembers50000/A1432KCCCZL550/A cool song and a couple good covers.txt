 First off let me just say contrary to what another reviewer says I'm listening to Perfect strangers right now and Bruce Dickinson is not doing the vocals.  It's the same singer that's in every other Dream Theater song except their first cd.  Now that that's out of the way,  The first song on the cd  A change of seasons is almost 24 minutes long.  I kinda think some of that could've been shortened, but it's still a cool song.  I can tell they were going for an epic with that one.  The first two covers Love lies bleeding and Perfect strangers are cool songs.  The last two tracks are just a combination of songs.  They'll do a bit of one song and then jump to another.  I can't really get into these songs at all.    So basically if you get this cd you'll get a really long origional song, that's still pretty good, two good cover songs and two useless live jam sesion tracks.  I'd recomend buying it used or just downloading them from itunes or something.
