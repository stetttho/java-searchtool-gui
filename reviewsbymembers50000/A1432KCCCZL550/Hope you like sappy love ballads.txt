 That's a majority of this cd, sappy love ballads.  I like Def Leppard, but they came out with some real crappy songs, and three of them are on this one.  I'm ok with them having 2 steps behind, they should've had the electric version.  It was probably the hit from that album/ a bit of a stocker theme song.  Miss you in a heartbeat, Have you needed someone, and the unreleased song should've been left off of this one.  They don't have a single song from their first album and they're missing Too late for love and Let it go.  I thought greatest hits albums were supose to have the band's best songs and none of their crappy ones.  I don't need to hear some guy crying about not having a girl.  This guy's had plenty I'm sure.  Hell I remember the behind the music.  They talked about getting chicks a lot.  That and the drummer losing his arm.  If you want a collection of Def Leppard's best songs, find someone who has the cd's and a cd burner and make your own.  This one isn't worth it, well maybe if your girlfriend is mad at you and you need a sappy song to dedicate to her.
