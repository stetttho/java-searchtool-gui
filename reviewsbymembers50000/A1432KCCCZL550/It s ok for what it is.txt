 First off this cd isn't as bad as some dislexic reviewers might say.  It's also not as good as others might.  Before I get into my review I have to say unless puddle of mud had a tone of cd's that I don't know about, and we're talking late 80's here, Nirvana came and went before they were even concieved, the band not the band members.  Second p.u.m. was so copying Nirvana.  Third Seether is NOT copying that no talent puddle of crap band.  This person should check their facts first.  Oh and there's nothing legendary about that Nirvana clone.  Uh anyways, this cd.  I like a lot of people checked this one out because of the single, Fine again.  It's a great radio friendly alternative song.  I guess they're doing what they love, or what'll make them money, but I'd like to know why rock bands now don't have any or at least very little heavy guitaring in the verses of their songs.  It's usually soft verses with a somewhat rocking chorus and a bridge.    That being said for a radio friendly alternative cd it's not bad, except for a few lyrics here and there that get on my nerves.  I liked Gasoline the first time I heard it.  I found out later that it was a single.  I love the verses to Driven under.  Broken is a decent acustic song although the chorus is a little weak.  Of course Fine again most people probably know, in my opinion it's the best song.  I'm not sure what else to say, most of the songs sound alike which can get old.  I think at some point whenever they put out a greatest hits that might be worth checking out but we're probably years away from that.    Bottom line if you like radio friendly rock then you'll like this cd.  Oh and they're better then creed or nickelback, and staind.
