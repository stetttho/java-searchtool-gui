 This is a great little collection of rare songs from a great metal band.  Every song is good on this one.  It even includes the song Angry again which I remember getting radio play back in the day.  The only complaint I have is that they had a couple of demos that I think were around at this time that they could've put on here, fortunately I came across copies of them so it's not that big of a deal for me.  There are no weak songs on this one.  Eight great songs.  If you're a Megadeth fan then get it.
