 First off if you like this band, they have an ep with a few different songs.  They also do a song called Green iron fist on the heavy metal 2000 soundtrack.  I liked this album right away.  It's not as catchy as some band's albums, but it's a good one.  You've got it all in this one, heavy metal, Stain softer songs like Monster and the single Now you know.  One of my personal favorites is Blue green day.  It's an awsome song.  This band came out around the time that Godsmack, staind, creed, and Sevendust were popular.  It's too bad the other bands weren't the ones to break up and that this one didn't stick around.  I did like Sevendust, and Godsmack is ok if not a litttle repedative.  This is a must for hard rock/grunge/metal fans.  I love that they don't stick to one genre on this one.
