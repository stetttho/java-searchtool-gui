 This season of the show just seamed to lack something.  First off the replacement dax sucked, you went from one of my favorite characters someone who could fight in who wasn't bad to look at and someone who was cool to a child who did nothing but complain about being confused and things making her sick.  Where was the Defiant?  There was not even one episode that took place primarily on the Defiant.  Then they blew it up.  What was the point of that?  They could have had the ship get away.  Sure it would've been cheesy, but not any more so then them not blowing up the escape pods.  I thought this season could've used another big battle episode or two.  They talked about how this war was very bloody and millions of people were dying.  They should've had a little more of that.  I did like the idea of section 31 and them puting a disease to kill the founders.  Great idea.  The episode where Sisko and others helped defend a base against jem hadar soldiers was really good.  I liked how they showed at least in one episode how badly the war was effecting some people.  The last episode was good.  I liked the ten episode story arc.  Over all despite those complaints there are episodes worth watching on this season, except for the baseball episode.  I thought the features were ok.  The prices of these and other star trek box sets needs to come down dramatically.  Stargate, a much better show, only costs $50.  The best thing is to buy this used.
