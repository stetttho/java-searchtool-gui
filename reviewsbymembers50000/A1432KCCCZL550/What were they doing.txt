 First off I liked Van Halen with either singer.  They were different, but at least you didn't hear Sammy mid song start rambling about Got knows what untill you hear someone say in a nicer way shut the hell up Dave.  I did like the sound of their guitars better with Dave, in fact it wasn't untill balance that they had a decent guitar album with Sammy.  What were they doing seperating Eruption and You really got me?  First off they should've made them one track when they put them on cd to begin with, but don't seperate them.  Pretty woman sucked.  I don't know why that stupid song was put on here.  Poundcake isn't a greatest hits worthy song.  They should've put Dream is over.  Why'd they leave off Amsterdam and what love can do?  They were better songs from balance that weren't ballads.  I never heard not enough on the radio.  Why'd they put live versions of songs they already had on the cd on here?  I hate when bands put two versions of songs on their greatest hits.  I guess it's better then putting the alternate version only.  There was a good reason for Gary's work being left off.  The songs with him sucked.  Probably because if I heard correctly Eddie was more responsible for writting the songs for that one.  This album's a waste, unless you want the radio songs only then it's your best bet.  It just could've been better.
