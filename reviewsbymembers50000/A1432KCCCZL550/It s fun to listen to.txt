 This album had to grow on me.  There's not a lot of depth in this one.  I knew Over the wall and Alone in the dark when I got the cd and had heard live versions of a couple other tracks.  Alone in the dark is the only song on here that, in my opinion, is a really good song.  That being said there isn't a bad song on this one.  The songs are just a little repedative.  Raging waters is one of my favorites, but I wish they kept the opening drum beat throughout the verses of the song rather then switching to the typical super fast one.  It just would've been nice considering the whole cd is full of really fast songs, it's not like it was a slow one anyway.  It's still a good song.  All complaints aside if you give it some time, it will grow on you.  Once it does you'll never want to take it out of your cd player.  Testament is one of my favorite bands.  They're very underrated, but if they got a lot of comercial attention I probably wouldn't like them as much.
