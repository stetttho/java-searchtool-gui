 This book falls somewhere between David Koenig's "Mouse Tales" and Stephen Fjellman's "Vinyl Leaves". It leans a bit more toward the former and seems to have been intended as a critical assessment of  Disney, Disney World, popular culture, consumerism and more. It is written  in the form of a vacation memoir that tries to weave together the  perspectives of academics, parents (some of the authors ARE parents who  took their children to Disney World), photo essayists (there are 50  photographs in the book and a handful are noteworthy), Marxists, and  feminists. Perhaps this breadth - or lack of focus - is one of the reasons  the book failed to really engage me. There are some insights but I  struggled to get at them since the writing was a bit verbose and the  authors did not provide footnotes on several references. My overall  impression of the book was that of a well-intentioned but poorly-written  thesis. I did not come away with the impression that the authors disliked  Disney or Disney World. As someone who has visited the parks, I can easily  agree with some of the criticisms and frustrations noted in the text.  Unfortunately for me, most of the messages that the authors where trying to  convey to me got lost in the style. For academic insight, try Fjellman's  book which, for all its deep thought and length, was actually much easier  for me to follow. For an easier read about backstage goings-on at the  mouse-house, try Koenig's book which I found most enjoyable and reasonably  well-documented.
