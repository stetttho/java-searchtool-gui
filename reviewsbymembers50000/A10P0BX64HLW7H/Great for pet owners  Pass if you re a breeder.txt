 This is a good comprehensive guide for the beginning hamster owner. It has no information on breeding and its writing will be beyond the abilities of small children (the ASPCA guides published in conjuction with DK books are better for children). The book focuses on your interaction with your hamster albeit it does also provide all the usual information in selecting and housing the little fellows. I gave it four stars since it's not an all-encompassing tome on hamsters and it's a little weak in the area of dwarf hamsters. As a pet-owners guidebook for Syrian hamsters, it's pretty much all that you'll need. The chapters are: 1.Pre-Pet Preparations, 2. Hamster-Hunting Homework, 3. Teach you hamster to welcome your touch,  4. Knock, knock, who's there? 5. Can hamsters be trained not to gnaw? 6. Potty training, 7. Make the cage a hamster heaven, 8. Out to the playground for recess? 9. Practice sessions in the play place, 10. Leash walking, 11. Roll-around balls, 12. Fun time, 13. The traveling hamster, 14. Handy hints, 15. Making the grade.
