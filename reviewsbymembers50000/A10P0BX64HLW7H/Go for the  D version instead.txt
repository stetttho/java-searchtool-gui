 My daughter was a veteran of Disney's Magic Artist Classic and the current Disney's Magic Artist. She unfortunately had problems with this program and the problem is translating the user-interface into something kids can understand. The 2D versions of Magic Artist followed the lead of programs like Kai's Power Tools by using image metaphors for the tools. Want to spray-paint your canvass? Pick up a can of spray paint. Want to have a crayon-like texture? Pick up a crayon. Alas, there are no metaphors which work well in 3D artistry so the buttons and tools in this program are not immediately intuitive. You REALLY have to read the manual to understand how to use the program. 3D Artist is also a bit of a resource hog. Even with 128MB of RAM, the program will stop us in the middle of a creation to tell us that we've run out of memory (Yikes!). You can also add only 1 color and 1 texture to each element of an object. You can color Mickey's head and his nose but you can't paint eyes on him or draw his face-mask. Animation of objects is also limited to a few sets of actions (spinning, hopping, zig-zagging, etc.). I should note that my daughter and I managed to deal with these problems and limitations because I've done 3D PC art before. My advice to you is to wait until Disney Interactive comes out with version 2 of this program.
