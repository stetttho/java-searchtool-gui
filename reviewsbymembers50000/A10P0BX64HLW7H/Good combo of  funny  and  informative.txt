 I picked this up for our daughter at the Monterey Bay Aquarium's Splash Zone exhibit. I had some reservations at first but they were quickly put to rest after my daughter started laughing and quoting facts about penguin behaviour and penguin species (for about 1 hour of our drive home). The book is nicely done with a combination of simple cartoons, jokes, beautiful photographs, and natural science information. I'm hoping that the authors come up with more of this series. I've already put in an order for their other book, "Cat Nap". Nice job folks!
