 There are so many kudos for this camera that have already been expressed and I don't know that I can add more. I've been using it for six months (and about 22 rolls of film) now and am very happy with it. I had been assessing this camera for 4 months by reading the reviews in most of the trade mags and on Photo.Net. It didn't take me long after I bought it to become a satisfied customer. It's plusses are: (1) sharp, contrasty, & fast lens, (2) splash-resistant, (3) as compact as most APS cameras but with a larger film area, (4) simple to operate, and (5) close-focusing range. The one problem that I encounter is that the auto-focusing can be fooled at close range or when the main subjects are well off-center. To rectify that, just use spot-focusing. This is an excellent travel camera that so easily slips into your pocket for all those unexpected moments. Use it with ASA400 film for sharp outdoor photos with great depth-of-field; or with ASA800 film for indoor shots where flash photography is not permitted (like some museums).
