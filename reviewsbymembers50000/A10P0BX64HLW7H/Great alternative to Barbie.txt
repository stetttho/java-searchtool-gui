 We got this toy for our daughter this Christmas and she loved it even more than her huge Harry Potter Lego set which she had been asking for. She was playing with it for most of Christmas day doing imaginary slam dunks with it in her room. She thought it was great that the doll came complete with all the gear shown, that all of its joints could move, and that the doll could stand on its own (in balanced poses, of course). The gear is VERY detailed and a lot of design work seems to have gone into this toy. She's been playing basketball all Fall and is very much into the sport. She thinks it's better than Barbie who has a "squishy" head and "walks around on her tippie-toes". I've already ordered her the Skylar snowboarding doll from the Get Real Girl line for her upcoming birthday.
