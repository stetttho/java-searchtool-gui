 I bought this book based on the two earlier recommendations and am glad that I did! It's a much better book for beginners than Keola Beamer's (which is more suitable for skilled guitar players). If you're just starting out, use this one. This is Volume 1 of a 3-part series. Volume 2 should be released in 2003.
