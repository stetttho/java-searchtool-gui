 Reviews of this book seem to be all over the map. Well, I raised about 20+ hamsters (I lost count) since I was a child and I had a small library of books on them. I suppose I can claim to be experienced and well-read at the very least. Mark Evans's book covers a broad range of owner-breeder topics at a level of reading which is excellent for young pet owners. The book is well-illustrated and reasonably thorough for its targeted audience. It focuses mostly on the care of hamsters than on the breeding of them. It is probably the best hamster book for new and young pet owners and it is endorsed by the ASPCA. If you're getting a hamster as a pet for your child, buy this book for your child; but to round-out your knowledge as a responsible supervising parent, buy yourself a copy of "Hamsters" by Otto Von Frisch (if you're getting a Syrian) or "Dwarf Hamsters" by Sharon Vanderlip (if you're getting a dwarf). Incidentally, I gave the book four stars because its advice sometimes gets too demanding and a reasonable amount of common sense needs to be applied for moderation.
