 The audio-cassette which accompanies this read-along book is narrated by Karen Dotrice-Nell who played Jane Banks in the movie. The program combines her narration with dialogue excerpts from the movie which creates a very  authentic atmosphere. It is, of course, a short book intended for young  readers but it is also beautifully adapted for the intended age range. I  was at first skeptical about these Disney read-alongs but am now inclined  to check out a few more for my daughter.
