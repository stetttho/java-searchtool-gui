 This is my third acquisition of Tomoko Fuse's books on unit origami. This book is best suited for the intermediate to advanced folder. If you are a beginner, I would direct you instead to Fuse's "easy" books or  book-paper-kits. As with all her other books, the procedures are  well-illustrated.  The results of many of the folds are quite literally  "fabulous" particularly if you use some of the finer papers.  Samples of each fold are shown in full color pages. Although paper-bound,  this book would equally be suited to sit on your coffee-table.
