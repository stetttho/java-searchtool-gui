 The author, Mr. Mai, needs to rework the sub-title of his book since most of the sites recommended are not exclusively for tent-camping. It's misleading. But since you're reading these reviews, you won't be among the misled. He has selected campsites that are a bit more out-of-the-way so you have a better likelihood (but by far NO certainty) of avoiding campers with loud stereos. This book is for car-camping. It is not for backpackers (a point Mat Glaser made in his review). A second edition is now in the works and due to be released in September. We'll see if the author takes our comments into account.
