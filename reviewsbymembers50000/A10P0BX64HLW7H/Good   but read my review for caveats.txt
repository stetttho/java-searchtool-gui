 De Wolk and Swain put together a very helpful book; but I think Swain decided to take on a bit more artistic license. Some of his photographs are of locations far from the campgrounds (but still within the defined area). For example, the photos of Yosemite Valley were taken about 23 miles away from the campground mentioned in the book. Other photos are of the more "select" campsites like at Samuel Taylor State Park. What you'll see is not necessarily what you'll get. There's also a debate going on about this book on whether toilets are mentioned or not. A cross-check with Stienstra's "California Camping" book on a sample of 10 camps, plus De Wolks own preface, shows that they recommend camps that have toilets unless mentioned otherwise in the text. What isn't mentioned with consistency is whether or not the camps have hot showers. The contact information and fees for the parks need to be updated as well. Some of the telephone numbers don't work and there's no forwarding service. Still, this is a good book if only because it provides a bit more detailed information on these 50 campgrounds than any of the camping bibles. It's NOT the only book I use when choosing a campground for my family but it is a good starting place to get ideas. If you're into family car-camping, you can start with this book and cross-reference the data with books by Foghorn Outdoors (author Tom Stienstra), Menasha Ridge (author Bill Mai), and Frommers guide books. BTW, some of the campsites mentioned in this book have grown crowded since its publication date. A revised edition is definitely called for.
