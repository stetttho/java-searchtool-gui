 I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 5-year old who had tried out a few scenes at Disneyland's Innoventions exhibit. Overall, she enjoyed the game and made her way through the scenes with just a little help. The programmers could have made the interface a bit better, though. The "hot zones" (where the pointer changes to allow for an action) are a bit small for some items so it gets difficult to position the mouse over an object to pick it up. Sometimes the pointer doesn't change at all. The system requirements are a bit high and we got just a "good" performance on my child's 300Mhz PII with a 32x SCSI CD-ROM. There are a number of bugs that we found as well. Mickey starts slanting at a 45-degree angle at the pond if you have him repeat a few actions. Music cuts out intermittently at a few scenes. There's also a problem with some earlier revisions of this game and it won't load if your system date goes past 12/31/2000 (a fix was posted to the www.disneyinteractive.com website recently). Overall, this was a decent try but I'd hope that Disney Interactive does a better job next time. I saw the earlier reviews and they seemed split 50-50 between "fantastico" and "thppth". If you think you're PC-savvy enough to deal with these bugs and if your system has the horsepower, this program won't be excessively problematic.
