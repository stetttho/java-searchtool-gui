 Jerrold Connors has written an excellent introduction to the ukulele for children which is also appealing for musically-challenged or beginning adults. The book is extensively illustrated with his own characters and comics. Our daughter enjoys using it as her reference for her soprano ukulele. The book works well for all ukuleles except baritones (which are tuned differently). The book begins with basic single-note plucking and then goes into strumming and chords. Adults who aspire for greater proficiency might want to instead consider some of Jim Belhoff's books or videos.
