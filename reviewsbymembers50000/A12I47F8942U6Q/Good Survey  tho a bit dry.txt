 In general, an excellent survey of women in policing and police administration with several profiles of women as police chiefs and sherrifs.  Suffers a bit from repeating itself -- some facts, such as the English and Dutch origins of "sherrif" appear in several chapters, as if the author did not expect a reader to read through the whole book, but instead to read chapters.  The tone is a bit dry -- there are some fascinating narratives and personalities, presented in a very matter-of-fact manner. Interesting reading.  The focus is on women as chiefs, but an aside on the various womens' precincts and units, such as the NY women's unit would have added to the historical discussion.
