 I finished NiC in a day. Good Points: The were-relationships and Anita's realization that cooperation instead of in-fighting is the solution. Richard's characterization and weaknesses are consistent, if frustrating. Bad Points: The bulk of the book is about Anita's sexual woes as a result of more tightly bonding with Jean Claude and Richard -- it seems that Jean Claude's incubus is contageous, you see. . . . And the sexual scenes mean Anita leaves Nathanial and Gregory in considerable danger while she has sex. Not the Blake I prefer. There's a plot under there somewhere, trying despirately to come out -- why Nathanial and Gregory are threatened in the first place, for example -- which Anita totally ignores while in the midst of her sexual adventures. As it stands, the plot is basically a thread between sex scenes - like a bad porn movie. Too many new characters. You'll probably need a score card to recall who's who, who's sleeping with who, and why you should care about the casualties of various fights. Too many loose ends and minor digressions. The subplot with Belle Morte, for example, seems to be foreshadowing for the next book - and could have been much shorter. I second the folks who say this series badly needs better editing. There are some clever ideas here. An interesting universe. But less sex, more plot!
