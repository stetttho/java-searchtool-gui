      The idea of using Batman to discuss forensic pathology is quite clever. (Indeed, one can easily imagine a CSI-Gotham City series.)      Moench does a good job intermixing research and storytelling. Much of the research is well done and interestingly told, although the interested reader might wish to consult DiMaio & DiMaio's Forensic Pathology regarding analysis of knife wounds and drowning deaths, where the textbook differs from the information in this book.      All in all, a good read and a good introduction to forensics.
