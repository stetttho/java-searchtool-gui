 As the disclamer notes "The procedures in this book are presented _for information purposes only._"  The author specifically notes in the concluding pages that he has left out information in an effort to prevent the book's misuse by criminals. Anyone actually attempting to use this book for reference or for practical purposes should take those two disclamers to heart.  Readers should also note the copyright date (now 12 years old) and note the significant changes in criminal procedure and practices in the past decade. Tests that were too expensive for a routine investigation in 1992 are often cheaper, easier, and much more common now.  Some of the advice is likely to increase a prospective reader's chances of getting caught. Very useful generic advice, such as never waiving one's Miranda rights or consenting to a search are not even mentioned. As a reference work, it utterly lacks any footnotes, endnotes, or even recommended reading or indication of the author's creditials in crime scene investigation.
