 Boyos is a slice-of-life novel about two up-and-coming brothers in South Boston. The dialog and sense of place are first rate -- and should be as the author is writing from experience.  The problem is with the plot and pacing. As a work of fiction, it doesn't build well to climax. There's several possible climax scenes -- does the big score work, do our heros confront Mary Fallon, are they caught by the feds, does Jack abandon his life of crime for his girl? None of these come together smoothly for a novel.  It feels like Boyos had not decided whether it was semi-autobiographical -- essentially non-fiction with names changed to protect real people; or a work of fiction which should follow a novel's plot structure. And that indecision weakens the story.  Read the book for a sense of characters you might meet on the South Boston strees and for the sense of place. Experienced mystery readers will see the plot twists coming chapters away. Other readers may feel some anti-climax in the resolution.
