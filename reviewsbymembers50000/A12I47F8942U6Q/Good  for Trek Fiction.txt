 Trek books are a guilty pleasure, bubblegum for the brain, a good book for a plane flight or train trip. Cox's book fits into that pattern. Nothing challenging, but worth the read. Geeks will enjoy spotting the plethora of Star Trek, comics, tv show, and movie homages scattered through the book. I suspect I didn't get more that 60% of what's there. On the downside -- the author wears his politics on his sleeve, especially when dealing with one of Khan's brethern, a paranoid American who creates a militia "cult". While a distaste for conservate politics and for law-abiding firearms owners is likely good Trek-politics, the book takes gratiutious slams by lumping all firearms owners in with a few over-the-top folks. This is especially grating when Gary Seven gives a speech about trusting to ordinary human ability and judgment and the risk of folks who think that because of their DNA they are "better" than others. The same should apply to those who think that just because they are alien-spy-agents they are more responsible with firearms than average folks. Some of the global political material was also shallow, but one should go not to Trek books for deep thinking on current events. I would have liked it better with less modern politics and more allegory.
