 As a criminal defense attorney, I have great sympathy for the work Stephen Jones was called upon to undertake for McVeigh. He tells the story of his representation well. When it comes to making his case about why McVeigh could not have acted alone, however, I was gravely disappointed. The book lacks a good index, footnotes, endnotes, dates, people, places, copies of reports, and other information vital to anyone truely interested in the case who is not willing to just take Mr. Jones word for what he saw, learned, and believes. It quotes infrequently from some documents and tapes, but those points are far too few and far between. As an book advocating his point, it falls short of what one would expect from experienced counsel who had been prepared to argue these very issues in court and presumably has references to all the 302s, photos, auditotapes, depositions, transcripts, and reports near to hand. Documents that are classified could easily have been identified at least as to date and source so they could be referenced by later researches if and when they are unclassified -- the author seems willing to quote from sealed records, why not make his audiotapes and correspondence public now that McVeigh is deceased.
