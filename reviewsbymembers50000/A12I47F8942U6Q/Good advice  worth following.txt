 Well written and amusing guide to avoiding trouble with law enforcement with repeated emphasis on using the right to remain silent and insisting on a lawyer. If more people followed this advice, criminal defense attorneys would have much easier jobs. As noted in several places, the book does not substitute for the advice of an attorney, it is merely legal first aid to prevent fatal mistakes before the attorney arrives. I would disagree with the authors on some minor details, but not on the critical details. I would likely even more strongly warn against representing oneself (p.175) in any but the most minor cases. I would also note that co-counsel or advisory counsel to a defendant representing himself is often very limited and the defendant needs to understand those limits before waiving counsel. In sum, well worth reading.
