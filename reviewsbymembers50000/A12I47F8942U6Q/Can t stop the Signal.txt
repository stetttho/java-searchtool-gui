 Having seen the movie in previews, I strongly urge folks to see the movie cold -- DO NOT READ THIS BOOK FIRST. There are a number of moments you do not want to be spoiled for.  After you see the movie, tho, read this book.  For those readers who have never heard of Firefly or Serenity, this is the novel of a movie that should not exist. Firefly started as a TV series (now in DVDs). It was cancelled in its first season. Hollywood does not make movies from failed TV shows. Until now.  Serenity, the novel, stands alone. You can start here, knowing nothing else about the universe. DeCandido does more than just summarize the movie, he ties together elements from the TV series and the bridging comic book. Newcomers to the setting will understand a bit more about who these characters are, how and why they fit together, and the significance of the movie's events. Fans will appreciate a chance to hear internal monologues form the characters, including River and Jayne, and the backstory of some of the new characters.  DeCandio adds in some material, likely from deleted scenes, which helps fill in a few of the gaps in the movie plot, including a few tidbits about Book. Among other tidbits, he gives the reader Book's first name and the full names of the characters who hadn't been fully named in the series.  Read the book, but only after you see the movie.
