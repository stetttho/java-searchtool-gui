 I general, I enjoyed the book a great deal. Many of the everyday details were quite nifty. Unfortunately, my radar perked at pages 240-41 with a wildly erroneous description of "Dungeons and Dragons" and the hobbists that play it. I am deeply troubled that the agent _in charge of_ this part of the Unabomber investigation badly misunderstood what she was investigating. There several points where the narrative moves around chronologically with few signposts to keep one oriented in time and place.
