 The concept of this British publication is so obvious I wonder why there isn't a US counterpart. It is, essentially, a Criminal Defense for Dummies for the novice (or experienced) lawyer covering everything outside of the actual courtroom. Topics include going to the police station (discovery issues, what's in a typical police file), disclosures from the prosecutor (what's required, what to ask for, what to do when you don't get something), mandatory disclosures to the prosecutor (different in the UK from the US, but quite interesting), how to analyze statements to for discovery and cross-exam purposes, how to interview witnesses (yours, the prosecutor's, and alibi witnesses), and lots of other useful topics. About a third of the book is specific to UK readers and of limited use here -- the rest has a series of valuable insights for attorneys and attorney-trainers.  Worth reading, tho hard to find and a bit expensive to import.
