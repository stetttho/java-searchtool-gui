 I picked this up on a whim and was surprised at how well it blends a near future setting with the police procedural mystery style. A good novel for fans of both genres. Rauch plays fair with the science and the mystery. Since the reader is privy to information from three different investigators, he or she may well solve plot points ahead of the heroes, but not so far ahead as make the story slow or unsatisfying. Certainly worth a read in these dog-days of summer.
