 Branca's book is a good overview of self-defense law, but not a substitute for the reader researching (or hiring counsel to research) the specific law in his or her jurisdiction. The book introduces fundamental legal topics for the lay reader, while also laying out significant cases for the specialist. The layout is unimpressive, but the information is worth the investment of time and money.
