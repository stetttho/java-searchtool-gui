 Miyabe's Crossfire is more a thriller than a mystery. The story is told through the eyes of a Japanese arson detective and a young vigilante with the ability to start fires with her mind. The murders themselves are a framework for ruminations on the causes of adolescent violence in Japan.  I was thrown off by an early technical error, where a character is "lifted into the air and flung backwards" by a handgun bullet. Later, a character is "blown backwards" by another handgun shot. Handgun bullets simply can't do that, outside of Hollywood action movies. See, e.g. [...] Thus, I was expecting to learn that the character firing the handgun had telekenetic powers and was subconsciously using them to replicate the effects of Hollywood guns. Nice theory, but not true.  This relatively simple error, which first occurs within the first 20 pages of the novel, left me wondering about factual errors in other parts I did not know about, like the ruminations about Japanese police procedure and its criminal justice system.  This error aside, it was an engaging read.
