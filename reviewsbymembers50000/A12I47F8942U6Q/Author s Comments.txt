 This isn't a review, per se; it is a description. Take the stars with that grain of salt.  Cops is about portraying a police officer, detective, or federal agent in a role-playing game setting. The tone is dramatic (think NYPD Blue or Alien Nation), but cinematic play (Lethal Weapon, Supercop) is possible too.  Chapters include:  A short history of policing and police duties  Campaign set-up, departments, sample police agencies (US, UK, Japan, Soviet model), types of officers and agents, and adventure ideas.  Character templates, equipment, and notes on adapting GURPS to a police adventure or campaign.  Typical adversaries, crimes, and other adventure ideas.  A guide to solving crimes including basic crime scene investigation, interviews, and interrogations.  A guide to trials in an RPG context, also a quick guide to doing time, jailbreaks, and extradition.  Four densely packed pages of sources and recommended reading/viewing.  Cops was published in December, 2001. It was in final editing on 9/11 and does not address the significant changes in policing caused by the war on terror, the Patriot Act, and the creation of the Department of Homeland Security.  The book is designed as an RPG supplement, but may also be useful to writers and those interested in police and crimes.
