 I had hopes for The Case of the Colonist's Corpse. The book did inspire me to want to re-watch the episode, Court Martial, two of the characters are based on.  The book follows a classic cozy format -- set up a closed world of a frontier colony, give several characters motive to want to kill the victim, and turn the detective loose to ferrit out their secrets. Unfortunately, the cozy style depends on characterization, and on good interplay between the detective and the suspects. Here, the interplay seems forced and dull. I had hopes of a good Christie-style twist in the unmasking, but was disappointed. The reader may be better served reading some of Gardner's better Perry Mason novels, Christie's better works, or some Rumpole of the Bailey stories.  The authors ostentatiously display their mastery of Trek triva, working in references to dozens of TOS, NextGen, and ST:Enterprise worlds, people, and events. The book itself is sandwiched between Return of the Archons and Trouble with Tribbles in the ToS timeline. The triva references swiftly become grating. And the authors don't wrestle with problems in the canon, like the truth-detector used in some ToS episodes.  The courtroom scenes could have benefited from more consultation with a practicing attorney. Gardner was a lawyer, and knew what corners he was cutting with Perry's courtroom theatrics. Here, the authors don't take liberties with the coutroom aspects, but in a way that doesn't seem credible. Shaw's loss if pre-ordained, but one doesn't get the sense of her preparations, and Cogley having to overcome an experienced opponent.  All in all, an average mystery in an interesting setting. A sequel, perhaps by other authors, could be fascinating.
