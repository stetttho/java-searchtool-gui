 Johnson's research into Japanese criminal justice, and specifically Japanese prosecutors, is an eye-opening resource for discussions and debates about criminal justice in theory, and the U.S. system in particular. Johnson exposes the strengths of the system in its focus on victim's restitution and criminal rehabilitation. He also discusses the weaknesses in the system, especially in its response to sexual harassment and violence against women, political corruption, and white collar crime.
