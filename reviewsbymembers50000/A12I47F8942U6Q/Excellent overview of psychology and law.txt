 One of the best overviews I've seen of witness psychology, memory, and perception as it interacts with police investigation and courtroom dynamics. UK oriented, but much of interest to US practitioners.  The text is a bit dry, and the citations a bit more sparse than I'd ideally like (often a page of endnotes and recommended reading), thus 4 out of 5 stars.
