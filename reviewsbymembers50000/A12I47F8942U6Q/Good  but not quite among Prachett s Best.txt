 Thud!, like many of Pratchett's books is a mystery, a comedy, and a commentary on modern society. Here, Prachett returns to some of the themes of _Fifth Elephant_ when he explores issues of dwarven tradition, resistance to modernization, and fanaticism. There are clear echoes of Marching Season in Northern Ireland, and of integration of ethnic minorities in English cities.  (As an aside, this may be the first novel that does not mention the Disc, or Discworld, itself.)  The Watch are among my favorite characters and it is good to see Carrot, Angua, Colon, Nobbie, and Detritus all get some time in the spotlight. Sadly, Colon and Nobbie are underused -- they are assigned to an art theft early in the book, but that plot element then vanishes for several chapters before reappearing. A new member, a vampire, is added to the watch -- she gets some very good scenes with Angua, but I found myself wishing for a bit more about her and the other members of the Watch.  The book's weaknesses, here as in _Monsterous Regiment_ arise in the resolution. Vimes does not act as much as he is acted upon. Characters who know more about what is going on, and have every reason to want Vimes to know more, are obstinately mysterious. It feels like there is a radical change towards the last quarter of the book -- as if it were building to some other resolution, then Prachatt changed his mind. The resolution seems to go on too long, and is followed by a long post-script, which is likely a set-up for an element of the next novel (for a hint, pay particular attention to the mine-signs, then think about their London counterparts).  All in all, better than _Monsterous Regiment_, but not quite among the best novels, such as _Night Watch_. Certainly worth one's time and attention
