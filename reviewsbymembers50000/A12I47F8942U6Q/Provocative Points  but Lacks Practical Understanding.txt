 Lee's thesis that the "reasonable man" standard is biased against women, GLBT persons, and members of racial and ethnic minorities is provocative and well supported with history and case law. Her suggestions for race-switching jury instructions raise questions about the reader's own biases and assumptions. The problem comes in Lee's understanding of use-of-force issues especially issues relating to reaction times (which can result in shots to the side or back), stress hormones and memory (which can result in fragmented memory), stress hormones and fine muscle control (which makes it hard to practically shoot to wound), and the ability of handgun fire to penetrate standard building materials (which makes warning shots dangerous). Lee's book should be read in combination with practical self-defense and use-of-force articles by respected writers like Masaad Ayoob and Phil Messina.
