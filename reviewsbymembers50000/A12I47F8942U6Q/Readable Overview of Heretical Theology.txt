 Lambert's _Medieval Heresy_ provides a surprisingly readable overview of the major European heretical movements of the Middle Ages. Readers interested in Church history and the development of Catholic and Protestant theology will find useful insights. Historical heresies also have a surprising resonance with modern charismatic cults.      To cover the vast array of major heretical movements over several centuries, the book assumes a basic grounding in medieval history and culture. It is readable without such a grounding, but may be more confusing.       A short glossary of heretics is provided. A timeline of major events would have been useful.
