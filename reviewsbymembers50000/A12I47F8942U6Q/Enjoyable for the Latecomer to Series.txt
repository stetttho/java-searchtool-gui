 I received Last Precinct as a Book on Tape for Christmas, never having read any of the prior books. As previous reviewers have noted, it is indeed introspective. But it is not so self-referential that a novice cannot pick up the details of the characters and their complex interrelationship. My only qualms were what seemed like a deus-ex-machina at the end which saved one character from otherwise certain death. Figuring out the plot twist about the cause of Kay's woes a tape and a half from the end. A nagging urge to want to strangle some of the more evasive characters who Kay muses are hiding things from her but from whom she does not demand clear answers. The forensic and investigative details had a good feel of verisimilitude. As a criminal defense attorney, my only caution to readers is that this kind of careful detective and forensic work is not often seen in routine cases. The castigated James City County detective is closer to the norm that our heroine and her inner circle.
