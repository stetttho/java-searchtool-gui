 The title is a bit of a misnomer -- the stories are as much about private eyes and criminals as about police in the future. Most of the stories have a strong disoptia tone, which can be wearying after nearly 500 pages. A few stories have clever ideas or societies that I would have liked to see more of, but many seemed typical of the genre. With 30+ stories, quality varies. I didn't find much that stuck with me after putting the book down, but there was enough variety to keep me reading until the last. For the folks who like this sort of thing, this is the sort of thing they'll like.
