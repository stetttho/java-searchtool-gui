 I was unaware of Alexander until I encountered this book at the Smithsonian's gift shop. It is a well-written biography of an important figure in biology. Alexander was not merely the patron of two natural history museums at U.Cal Berkeley, she and her partner collected thousands of animal, plant, and fossil specimens for it over the course of decades.  Worth reading for a portrait of turn-of-the-century collecting, science, and the role of an extraordinary woman at that time.  The text does meander a bit at times in the time periods discussed in each chapter and it could use a few more maps, but it is otherwise well researched and well-written.
