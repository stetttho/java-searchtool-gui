 Each section discusses a specific poison, its chemistry, historical and modern uses, and famous cases of it being used as a poison. This makes a fine reference for mystery writers and perhaps those involved in forensics (tho one is unlikely to see most of these poisons in modern cases).  One does come away with a certain feeling of paranoia about medicines, health food supplements, and worry when one's spouse or partner insists on preparing meals.  The only technical flaw I noted was in the discussion of compartive bullet lead analysis, which fails to mention the controversy over whether the method actually yeilds a meaningufl comparison. There was certainly dispute about this in 2004 (book was published in 2005). The National Academy of Science published a report highly critical of the FBI's test in late 2004. In early 2005, the New Jersey Appeals Court overturned a murder conviction, holding that compartive bullet lead analysis was essentialy junk science. (The FBI has since stopped doing this test.)  This flaw made me wonder if Emsley was not unaware of criticism of flaws in other forensic tests when discussing the cases of famed convicted poisoners.
