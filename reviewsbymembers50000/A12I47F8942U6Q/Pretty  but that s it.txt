 The special effects are quite good. The plot, pacing, acting, internal consistency, and internal logic, much less so.  Even fantasy must have some internal logic to maintain willing suspension of disbelief. It needs some tension, some drama, and some surprises. Dinotopia lacks much of this.  Most of the plot twists are foreshadowed well in advance. The major suprises mostly come from hopelessly illogical acts by the major characters. (An example, someone tries to kill a character, in Waterfall City. The victim survives and is rescued. Not only does it never seem that any charges are brought against the villain, he reappears later and is accepted warrily by our heros.) The plotting is obvious, when it is hoplessly muddled. There is foreshadowing about a major secret of the dinosaurs, a missing commandment on the obilisk of "rules". When revealed the secret is an anti-climax. The motives of the carivore villains are unexplored -- are they as intelligent as the herbavores? Why are they guarding the entrances to the underground ruins -- tradition? Even the "suprise" appearance of one character is too well foreshadowed to be a surprise. More of a "huh", thought so.  No explanation is given for the one bit of driving tension, why the mysterious sunstones are wearing out, and why anyone would expect those underground not to be failing at the same rate.  No explanation is even remotely tendered for how a 200 mile wide island of such diverse terrain could possibly be hidden in the Atlantic. (Given the wreckage and the islanders' knowledge of a war with Germany, the Atlantic makes more sense than the Pacific.) Even a nod towards time travel, dimentional portals, etc. would have been handy.  All in all -- the pretty pictures aren't worth 4 hours of your time.
