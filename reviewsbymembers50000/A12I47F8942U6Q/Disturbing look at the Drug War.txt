 A fascinating look at the war on drugs, but deeply disturbing.  The author's confession to assaulting and effectively soliciting the  attempted murder of "Billy Degnan" is disturbing. Much earlier, the author confession to violating DEA informant procedures with "Romeo Fragone". The author paints his motives in a sympathetic light, and a reader may be tempted to sympathize with his vigilante actions. However, one also becomes tempted to wonder if the author would perjure himself or frame a suspect if he felt it necessary.  This is the sort of ends-justify-the-means reasoning that has plagued the Boston FBI office in its relations with the Winter Hill Gang and has plagued the Boston Homicide unit's former star Sgt. Detective Daniel Keeler.  This book should be read as a cautionary tale of the moral cost of the War on Drugs on those fighting it, as well as on those who use drugs.
