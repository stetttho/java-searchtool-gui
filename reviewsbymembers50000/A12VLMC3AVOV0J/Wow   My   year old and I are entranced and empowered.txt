 I got this book out of the library yesterday and read it to my daughter.  We both loved it.  And to cap it off, the book ends with a lyrical listing of girls' names.  My daughter, who has an unusual name, literally screamed with joy to see her name in a book for the first time.  "I want to keep this book forever and ever," she told me so I am here on the site today buying her her own copy.  Highly recommended.  Julie.
