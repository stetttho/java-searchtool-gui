 I read this book over the weekend and have already sent out a mass email to parents I know telling them to read this book!  This book succinctly and honestly answers questions that I'm always hearing on the "parent circuit."  Not only about about teasing, but about all social skills, popularity, being ostracized, girls worrying they are fat-- you name it, it is probably addressed in this book.  And the authors do a wonderful job of letting you know when you are worrying too much, or too little about an issue.  A must read!
