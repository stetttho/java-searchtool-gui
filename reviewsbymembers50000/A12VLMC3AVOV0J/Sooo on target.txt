 I really enjoyed Sloppy Firsts.  And I was enjoying the first part of Second Helpings, where Jessica is attending a summer program.  And then I read on to the part of the book where she goes back to high school for her senior year... and as I was reading I started thinking to myself, this book is beyond just good, it's incredible.  This is the BEST and most honest observation of high school I have ever read. And funny, and fun to read and.... I've already read it twice, it is THAT good.  Trust me, even if you're out of high school, you'll love this book.
