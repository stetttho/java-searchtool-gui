 If there is anything that this book teaches, it is that we have the ability to change reality with the power of our own thoughts.  This is one of those books that no matter how many times I read it, will never fail to  amaze me.  It's the kind of book that leaves you speechless, unable to do  anything but think, and wonder.   Presented in the form of a charming  parable about a seagull's education in flight, Jonathan Livingston Seagull  is about far more than the life of one seagull.  It is about each and every  one of us, struggling to find the answers, to reach something higher that  we are not even yet aware of.  We are all a little bit like Jonathan, and  when we read Bach's story, we realize that we all have the same power  inside.  That we can do anything, be anything that we want, if only we can  believe in ourselves.  Bach's message is a powerful and timeless one that  stretches across all barriers to reveal the simple truth that we all, at  one time or another in our lives, knew: the most powerful force that exists  is that of belief, especially in ourselves.   I can't tell you exactly  why you need to read this book.  It's not about something as simple as plot  or writing style.  There is a rare magic in the words that cannot be  conveyed by any other means than the experience of reading the book.  All I  can say is that once you read this book, you will understand.
