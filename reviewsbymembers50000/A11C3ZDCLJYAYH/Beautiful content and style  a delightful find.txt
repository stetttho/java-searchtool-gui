 I loved The Little Prince, and thought that I would give Wind, Sand and Stars a try.  Lucky for me that I did!  A different kind of book than the children's-tale quality of The Little Prince, Wind, Sand and Stars is  nevertheless magical in its own way.  St-Exupery's ability to blend  philosophy with his fairy-tale renditions of the life of a pilot are  inspiring to more than one kind of person who seeks to reach the stars.   Well worth reading, this book is a delight for anyone who seeks beauty in  the written word.
