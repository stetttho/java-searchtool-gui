 I picked up this book on a whim, seeking to learn more about creation  myths and the relation between science and religion. An English major who  typically favors literary fiction, I was pleasantly surprised by what I  found within its pages: a very compelling narrative about past and present  views of the universe and the people who contributed to our understanding  of it - all in a language that even the most physics-phobic reader can  understand and appreciate. Gleiser is an eloquent and entertaining writer  whose writing style does much to support his arguments that science and  reason are not necessarily devoid of emotion and spirituality. His obvious  enthusiasm for the knowledge he imparts is infectious and although other  works may be better at explaning the mechanics of the universe (e.g.  Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time), anyone who has ever suffered  through the unwieldy textbook jargon of an introductory physics course can  appreciate the way which he makes this book not only educational, but  *readable.* By weaving together information about how the universe works  and the people who made those discoveries, Gleiser's book reads less like a  scientific explanation of the universe and more like a story populated with  fantastic figures and propelled by amazing discoveries. An excellent,  well-written book on a subject the author manages to make fascinating to  even this scientifically-numb reader, I find myself intrigued by the  subject and eager to learn more.
