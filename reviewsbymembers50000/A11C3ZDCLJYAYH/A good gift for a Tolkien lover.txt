 I received this book as a gift from my sister, and I think that the basic idea for the work is a very good one.  However, I don't think that the book on its own merits is enough for anyone who is not a serious fan of Tolkien  and most especially of Lord of the Rings.  The pictures and descriptions  are enjoyable to look over for those who have read the trilogy, but I am  afraid that I had hoped for more.  The stories that Tolkien wrote are  breathtaking, and I had wanted to experience that same kind of emotion when  looking upon the paintings.  But despite the talent of the artists, I found  most of the art to be rather repetitive and rather uninspiring, save maybe  one or two.  I don't think that they come close to doing justice to the  sweeping landscapes and noble figures which Tolkien described in his work.   However, I have no idea what kinds of art and artists exist from which to  choose, or if there are any comparable books on this subject.  I don't  think this is the book for you if you are seeking paintings based on  fantasy worlds - there are much better ones.  But if you are looking for a  book for someone who likes Tolkien, I think it's a nice companion to the  trilogy and a good addition to any bookshelf of a Tolkien-lover.
