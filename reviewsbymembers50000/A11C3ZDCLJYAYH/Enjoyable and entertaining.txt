 I'm not an avid romance reader (yet ^_^), but I picked up this one to help me pass the time on the commute to and from work.  Much to my surprise, I found myself staying up late finish it!  I haven't read all that many books  in this genre, so I couldn't tell you how it rates specifically as a  romance.  But on its own merits, I thought it was pretty enjoyable and  entertaining.  The plot is well-developed and draws the reader in, although  I did feel that there were some weak points - especially in the earlier  interactions between Holly and Austyn.  The two main characters are pretty  interesting, but they lacked the depth that might've made me give this book  the fifth star.  The romantic scenes are pretty few and far between, so if  you prefer more steamy writers like Stephanie Laurens, then this probably  isn't for you.  Some of the physical interactions might be a bit much for  the more sensitive reader, although put in perspective with the time  period, I suppose Holly could have received a lot worse treatment.   Although Medeiros's character development could use some work, her ability  to render a gripping plot is very much exemplified with this work.  I  especially liked her twist on the ugly-duckling theme, and enjoyed this  book more for its overall plot rather than any aspect of romance it  contained.
