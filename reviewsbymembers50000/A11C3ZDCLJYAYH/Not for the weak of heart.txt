 "The Forgotten Halocaust" is an extremely appropriate subtitle for this book, and I am shocked that I had never heard of these events before picking up this book.  Even moreso because there are so many books  written, both fiction and nonfiction, about the Jewish Halocaust, and I  have never so much as heard a word about the Japanese invasion of China.   Indeed, few people know of Japan's role previous to the bombing of Pearl  Harbor despite the influence that it held over China.  It is frightening to  contemplate the nature of man which leads him to both commit the crime and  deny its occurrence.  Iris Chang has taken a bold step towards finding the  truth, and the importance of her work can not be overstated.   I found  this book to be a well-researched work that should be read by anyone who  seeks to know the truth about what happened during WWII.  It is  well-written and neatly structured, and I appreciated her use of various  viewpoints to give the reader a more well-rounded and accurate view of  events.  Her explicit descriptions of the atrocities that took place  highlight the need for this story to be told. I urge anyone who has never  heard of the Rape of Nanking to read this book, if only that it may not be  forgotten.  Although I especially connected to Chang's message due to my  Chinese heritage, I feel that her book has more long-reaching implications  about the very nature of man when subjected to a certain type of  environment.  It is an important work which will hopefully pave the way for  future research and inquiry into what took place in China during WWII.
