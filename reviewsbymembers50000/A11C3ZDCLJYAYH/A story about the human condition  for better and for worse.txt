 Dickens has written a beautiful tale about the human condition, in both its glory and its downfall.  It is a quiet masterpiece that describes the things that people will do for love - for love of people, of country, of  family, of themselves, and most especially for love of those who never know  how much we love them until it is too late.  I cried when I read the  ending, a juxtaposition of beauty and of madness.  I was both shocked by  how horrible mankind can be in his need for vengeance, but at the same time  amazed at the fortitude and generosity that can be instilled in an  individual by devotion to something greater.  A classic of timeless truths.
