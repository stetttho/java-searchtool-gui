 I, like so many of the other reviewers here, am an incredibly loyal reader of Brian Jacques' books - even if the themes do sometimes get a little repetitive. Not so with Taggerung! It was unpredictable and exciting from start to finish, with a refreshing cast of characters led by one of Jacques' most admirable creations yet. A departure from his usual renditions, it brought me back to the magic in the his earliest books. It has been over ten years since I became a fan of Brian Jacques, but this book just goes to show that he still has what it takes.
