 I first had this book read to me by my third grade teacher, and begged my mother to buy it for me soon thereafter, that I might read it for myself.  It was my first "favorite book" (for all those  what-are-your-favorite-book questions), and it continues to be a treasured  classic on my shelf. The story follows the journey of Milo, a boy bored  of basically everything around him.  One day he receives a mysterious  package that turns out to be a tollbooth.  For lack of anything better to  do, he puts it together and begins to play, only to find himself driving in  an entirely different world.  There he meets all sort of curious creatures,  from a giant watchdog (literally, a dog whose body is a watch) and a humbug  the size of a person.  Juster plays with words as if they were tangible  objects to juggle, and continually surprises the reader by turning ordinary  events into magical occurrences.  This book very much exemplifies the quote  (and I apologize for not naming the speaker, who slips my mind at this  moment) "The universe is full of magical things, patiently waiting for  our wits to get sharper." Although Norton Juster's tale will  probably never receive as much wild acclaim as the Harry Potter series, The  Phantom Tollbooth nevertheless exhibits its own quiet charm.  It is full of  original characters and entertaining events, and I heartily recommend it  for any child, or adult for that matter, who would like to be amused for a  few hours on a rainy afternoon - especially if you think there's nothing to  do!  It is a wonderful book to read to a child, and the simple black and  white drawings scattered throughout the text belie the vivid pictures that  Juster paints with his words.
