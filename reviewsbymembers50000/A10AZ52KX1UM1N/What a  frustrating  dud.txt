 My daughter received this toy for Christmas a year ago.  She has tried to play it many times with us and with her friends.  It always looks so fun on the box.  The problems with this toy are multiple.  First, it comes in four pieces-which will NOT stay together long enough to play the game.  It is a frustrating game because it is so hard to score anything!  Now, I've had kids from 4 to 43 try this thing and it is tough!!  The gopher which pops up broke shortly after arrival and it no longer pops up.  (I guess we should be glad that it didn't get stuck in the up position!)  To top it all off, getting the pieces back into the original packaging ain't no easy feat either!  I would save my money and stick with the Silly Bowling game.  It is a lot more fun and a lot more durable.
