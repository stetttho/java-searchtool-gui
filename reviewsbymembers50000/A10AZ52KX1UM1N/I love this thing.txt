 I received this camera for Christmas and I've had a ball with it.  It does have a serious learning curve to it because it has so many whistles and bells.  I don't understand all of the complaints about low light.  I have taken about 40 and they've turned out great!  My batteries last me a good long time-probably because I can't get used to taking a picture from the view finder.  I tend to use the eye piece.  The only complaint that I have is the speed with which it downloads a picture to the card when using the High or raw mode.  I've found both of these modes-expecially high- take far better pictures but take 30-40 seconds to download it onto the card.  It also takes them at 8" X 10" instead of 35" X 24" in the fine mode.  (Is there even a printer out there that will print 35"?)  We did buy a 512 mb card-very necessary on any camera.  It's got a nice comfortable grip to it and weighs very little.  Downloading them onto my computer is a snap!  When I pull them up in Adobe Photoshop, they need little or no tweaking for quality.  The autoflash is easily replaced by a sanp-on flash which would help eliminate any low light problems-if I have any.  The zoom is amazing, although you do lose some quality-as you would with any camera.
