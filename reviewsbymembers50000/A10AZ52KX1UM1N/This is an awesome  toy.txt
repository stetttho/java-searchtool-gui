 They think its a toy.  You think its an educational gem.  Everybody wins!  My daughter got this for her birthday and she LOVES it!  (So do I.)  This particular pad includes a wrting tool which is not fancy but it does get the kids to write in the books where they are supposed to.  (Just imagine!  They are allowed to write in this one!)  The books that are available-at a fee-will allow you to expand on anything your child has an interest in.  They have books on music, Disney characters, reading writing, arithmitic, geography, science-you name it.  The pages are so interactive and enticing.  They even have some popular children's stories from The Magic Tree House series and the Magic School Bus series.  Most pages feature games which are just plain fun and compliment the lessons on the page.  The very best part is the fact that, with this leap pad, you can keep them learning from preschool to 5th grade (since this pad also accepts the older Quantum Pad books.)  Each child can have tremendous control over what they will or won't do.  The pad will read to them, define certain words, play games-all at the will of the player.  Highly recommended!!!
