 My daughter received the Leappad Plus Writing for her Birthday in November.  She has used the writing features on it on many occassions but it is not her favorite aspect of the toy.  She loves the ease with which she can change the books and cartridges and the control she has over what is fun today.  She loves the sweet Disney stories and all of the games that they come with.  But she also loves to switch to "...Music Maestro" and can now tell you the history of Chopin, Mozart and Beethoven.  She'll then switch to "Dinosaurs before Dark" from her (current) favorite book series and play games that teach her so many things about dinosaurs.  I think that the variety is the very best part about this series.  Whatever your child has an interest for-Leappad makes a book.  And if you want to find a way to help a child who is having trouble in a certain subject area, these are worth a shot.   They are fun.  If the kids are having a good time, it holds their interest, (i.e., they'll learn something) The toy is an excellent source of entertainment for children that, coincidentally, teaches them volumes of info.  I think this is mainly because they have so much control over what goes on while playing.  It is user friendly, always positive and provides hints for those times when the child is stuck.   I liked it so much, I bought 4 more for my nieces and nephews for Christmas.  So far, they are getting rave reviews, too.
