 This is a great addition to any child's library.  It's packed with pictures and simple definitions.  It give enough information to be very helpful but not so much detail for one word that the child's eye's glaze over!  The most amazing thing to me is the number of times that my daughter has picked it up for casual reading!  The pictures are that engaging!   This dictionary is a great value and a wonderful tool.
