 Can I just say that I LOVE this movie!!! This is now my favorite romantic comedy!!!!  Drew and Adam's chemistry is perfect!!!    I loved almost everything about this movie.  The only thing I didn't like was Rob Schneider (?).  He was funny, but kinda silly.  Anyways, the premise of the story is cool.  Lucy was involved in an accident and it affected her ability to remember ANYTHING past the day of the accident. Adam's character does not realize this at first, but when he does, he tries EVERYDAY to help Lucy cope with finding out about the accident.    What follows is absolutely the SWEETEST thing you could ever imagine someone doing in this situation. He helps her find out what happened to her every day and proceeds to make her fall in love with him everyday.  I'm not sure how realistic the injury is portrayed, but even still, the patience he uses to make her feel comfortable with him is incredible.  Gosh, this movie was so darn sweet, I could go on forever!  I am also glad that the writers and producers didn't cop out.  That would have been a MAJOR letdown.  The movie ended in the best way...a way I would have never imagined...hence the "bittersweet" in my review title.  Btw, the theme song for the movie is the Beach Boys' "Wouldn't it be Nice."  I, a primarily RnB kinda girl, ordered a BB's greatest hits ONLY for that song!  It fits the movie perfectly and I had to have it!!  LOL  THUMBS UP TO DREW AND ADAM FOR FIFTY FIRST DATES!!!!
