 17.99 for eleven tracks!!  Glad I didn't buy it!!  Not that I would have. My friend played this in the car and I still do not understand why she rushed to the store to buy this crap.  Pure garbage.  I guess this is the group's attempt at a more mature sound, but ugh!  Gimme a break.  The songs are lame and although I know it's common practice to not have everyone sing the hook...it would have been nice to hear Michelle and Kelly on a hook instead of Beyonce.  I mean, really, if we wanted to hear her singing an entire song alone, we'd listen to her cd!  And Michelle, I've got questions for you!!  It's kind of weird to know that she just released a gospel cd and a few weeks later is singing suggestive songs.  Kinda makes me wonder...  The lyrics are lame..very juvenile sounding and the beats are nothing special.  It amazes me how ppl get turned on by songs entitled "T-shirt" and "Soldier."  Guess I'm the only one who doesn't want a thug, huh?  Or hear songs about thugs.   I am only 21, but I guess I matured way too much.  These empty songs do nothing for me.  Heck, the picture alone makes me want to go buy a Supremes' cd.   All in all, don't buy this tripe.  Buy a Jazzyfatnastees cd instead.  Now those LADIES are classy!!! [...]
