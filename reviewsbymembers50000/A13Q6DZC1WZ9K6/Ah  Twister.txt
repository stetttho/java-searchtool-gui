 LOL, this movie is on now, and the older I get, the cornier the movie gets.  This movie is way Hollywood and it makes me laugh The effects are cheesy and the story is predictable.  I didn't know a tornado provided the perfect backdrop for renewing an old flame </sarcasm>  all in all, this movie is lame, but it helps pass the time.
