 I enjoyed this movie.  I've seen it about 5 times.  The story is pretty simple.  I didn't know that this movie deviated so far from the book, so my next step is checking out the book.  I can see where those calling the movie simple and dated are coming from.  B/c it really is.  But on the good side, at least a remake wouldn't work. I practically loathe remakes.  There's no way that this story can really be "updated" without turning it into a Hollywood yuckfest.  All in all, check it out. Worth several viewings.  But read the book also.
