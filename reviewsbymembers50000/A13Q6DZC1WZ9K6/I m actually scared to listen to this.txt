 The, uh, excuse me, DA Band performed at my school back in October and maybe it's because they're new and all, but for me and the majority of the people at the concert, they reeked.  I try not to be one of those people who buys music off of The Hype.  Which is why I didn't purchase this cd. I'm not a rap fan, and I think for me, Da Band's popularity is greatly due to MTV. I think if that show ends, Da Band ends.  Ness and Sara are the only two I like.  Although, I feel Sara is very out of place as the only singer the group.   I heard that Da Band has a new album coming out soon. We'll see how that goes.  I don't see them going but so far with this.  I think this is an example of Sean Combs' (who I now can't stand) ego trippin' out
