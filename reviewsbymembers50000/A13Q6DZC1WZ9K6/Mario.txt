 I second the poster's opinion who said that Clive knows how to pick them.  Whitney, Luther, 'Licia, and now Mario!  He is truly a cute little boy.  All of his songs are typical for his age which is good..compared to B2K who always wants to Bump, Bump, Bump and whatever else they sing.   Mario caught our attention with Just A Friend, and I liked this song so much, while I was at work that summer, I sent my younger brother (who would be embarassed to be caught buying this cd) to Target to pick it up for me.  Pick this cd up.  He's got a good voice for a kid and I wish the best in his later efforts. 1. Just A Friend--this song is tight.  A remake of the Biz's song.  The video is cute and he's doing what little boys do: trying to get at girls without being over the top. 2. C'mon--one of my favorite tracks.  A true dance song. Now I don't really do fast songs, but I dance around my house to this one!  Way better than the remix used for the video 3. Briad My Hair--who didn't like this one??!!          4. 2 Train--skippable 5. What Your Name Is--cute song.  Despite the grammar issues, lol  6. Holla Back--skippable    7. Could U Be--I can picture a kid sitting in a classroom passing notes back and forth. cute song           8. Put Me On- 3.5/5           9. Chick Wit Da Braids-- this one is ok. but just ok           10. Never--very nice song.  Mario has a very nice voice.            11. Girl In The Picture
