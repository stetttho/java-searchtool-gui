 OK, I am not a HUGE New Edition fan, but I do enjoy their music.  One Love is a great cd.  I'm listening to it as I type. I don't know much about the group, but I think this is a good follow-up to Home Again.  Can't stand Diddy, but kudos to him for getting this released.    My favorite songs are Hot2Nite, Best Man, That's Why I Lied, Newness, Rewrite the Memories, etc.  I think it's a pretty solid cd.  You would enjoy it.
