 But I like it alright. If you are a fan of Vivian's debut like I am (HUGE fan), then you waited patiently for this one only to find the date had been pushed back. Well, it finally debuted on June 28th, and I must say, I am a little disappointed. I was expecting an album that showeda progression from the first, but this one seems like a step backwards. Don't get me wrong, there are some songs that I really like, but this time around, it seems like I have to keep playing the disc in order to convince myself that I love it just as much as love story.   Another thing that made it interesting was that I think many of the songs chronicled the last year or so of Viv's life...including maybe a split from her hubby?  Well anyway, he is the cousin/brother/something of one of my fave gospel artists of the moment, so hearing some of the songs + seeing his name NOT mentioned in the album notes like it was in Love Story, it made listening to the songs a little bit weird. JMO of course.   This is an ok disc, but Love Story is much better.
