 This is one of probably two movies that I like seeing Halle in.  She made a suitable "Dorothy Dandridge." I liked the format of the story: Dot being on the phone with her best friend, while making a collage and we're basically being told a story through the snapshots.   Fascinating story.  I've been reading a book on DD written by a man who had contact with her sister...much better than the movie, but nevertheless, the movie is ok for a beginner.
