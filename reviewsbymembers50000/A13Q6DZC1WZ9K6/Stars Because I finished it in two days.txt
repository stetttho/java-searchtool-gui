 I was looking forward to this book.  I had never heard of the author, but I do enjoy reading books by new authors.  Resurrecting Mingus was a complete letdown.  Like others have said, loose ends ruined this book for me.  The way she hooked up with that guy was too bogus for me...seemed like the author just wanted her to end up with a black man.  I didn't see how he was better for her than the white officer.  I actually was hoping that something would come out of that moreso than with the black guy.   I just finished reading this book two days ago, but it is easily forgettable.  This book was a debut, so hopefully the second time around will be better.
