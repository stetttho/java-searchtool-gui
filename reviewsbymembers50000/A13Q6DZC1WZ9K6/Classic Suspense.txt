 It is my opinion that classic B/W movies win anyday over anything that is around today.  Give me a Friday night, a bag of popcorn or ice cream, and an old movie...and you've got one happy camper!! The first time I saw Laura was on AMC.  I taped it.  This movie had me hooked!!  I never expected what happened midway to have happened!!  This was a great "who dun it?" movie.  No one is left unsuspected!! I loved this movie so much, I even made myself an audio cassette tape to listen to!!!  And you know what, even w/o the visual, it still holds the same suspense!!!
