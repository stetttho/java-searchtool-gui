 this album is no good...at all.  I bought this spur of the moment while in Best Buy with an urge to just buy some jams.  I saw this cd and said, what the heck, lemme give a new artist some royalties...  Incredibly disappointed! I couldn't even listen to the entire thing.  I maybe listened to three songs tops.  The lyrics are cool b/c I read the booklet, but her voice was just not to my liking. I'm mad that I  bought it, b/c I'm having a really hard time getting rid of it.  Listen to Amazon's snips (wish I had done that).  Don't buy it til you've heard it.
