 This movie was sooooo funny!! Denzel was awesome in this one.  I truly enjoyed going to the theater to see it.  The audience energy added to the greatness.  The way the guy came up with and was trying to cover up was priceless!!!  I wish I could think that fast. I wasn't really surprised by the turn of events.  Somehow I still saw it coming, but it was still a treat to watch.   Check it out.
