 I love animated flicks.  Toy Story, Shrek, etc. I love them. This movie had one of my friends and I buckled over in laughter for the entire movie. I loved the plot and the realism of the animation.  It's amazing what can be done with computers.  Everyone else has already said it all,so all I can do is highly recommend this film. Perfect for youngsters and adults alike.   P.S. was I the only one who was able to confirm that Frozone was Sammy L Jackson when he was yelling at his wife??  That man can yell like no one else. LMBO.
