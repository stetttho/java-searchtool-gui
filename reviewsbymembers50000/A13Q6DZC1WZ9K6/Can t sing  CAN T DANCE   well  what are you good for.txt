 I really have to say that this cd was incredibly overhyped.  Her hooks to JaRule's and Fat Joe's songs were ok, but how many hook singers are actually capable of a solo attempt? There have been plenty, I know, but Ashanti clearly misses the mark. When Foolish came out, everyone in my dorm would crowd in front of the tv to watch the video.  And then, it got overplayed.  Radio-wise and television-wise.  Plus it was out long before the cd, so ppl got irritated.  Same w/Baby.  She's not saying much of anything in that song.  The only song I like is 'Over.'  That is the only one I like.  A girl who used to sell cds let me hear it to test it out and it was pure ...!!!  She has the image of a pop star, but that is as far as it goes.   I agree w/those who think she wants to be Aaliyah.  Definitely!!  Just check out her new video for her new cd!!  The water, the drenched hair...can u say Rock the Boat? Aaliyah had much more than Ashanti---style, grace, they are both beautiful, Aaliyah was definitely more original.  In memorial, she should have gotten the Aretha award instead of the newcomer who has YET to prove herself.  She's a fad, she'll fade out in the next couple of years. Don't waste your hard earned money.  I don't even care if you can get it for [$$$] off of this site.  If you are hard pressed for good music, check out Tweet's Southern Hummingbird, or Vivian Green's Love Story---listening to that right now!!! Don't buy this tripe.
