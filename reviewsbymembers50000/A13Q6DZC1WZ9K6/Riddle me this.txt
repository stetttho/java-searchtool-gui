 If a woman can adopt children for the sake of making herself a certain way to her fans, then why is it so unbelievable that a child can be horrifically abused? I, for one, do not think that CC is lying.  How can you tell someone (when you were not there), "Oh no, your life did not happen that way."   And I have not seen many of JC's movies, but if she comes across the way most people say she did onscreen, why is it hard to accept that maybe, just maybe, that demeanor did in fact exist outside of the studios? And the fact that both Christopher and Christina were left out of the will has to say something.
