 Pretty crappy book.  Too much designer name-dropping for my taste.  The writers seemed to happy to make sure they advertised expensive designers than writing an interesting story.  Also the storyline was bogus, weak, predictable yet unbelievable.  It's hard to believe that two seemingly bright women got duped so easily.
