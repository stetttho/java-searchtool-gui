 But incredibly predictable.  I am from MD and I know some people who went to TC. This movie is actually typical Hollywood...very preachy and very sappy.  After seeing this movie, I researched the real Titans' history and I was surprised (well not really) that the director and producer exaggerated the racism. The article quoted one of the players and he said that things were not as the movie made it seem.  Their problems weren't so much race-based as they were the problems of two different schools trying to combine football teams.  Basically two teams used to having things done their way.    I wish the movie had stuck to what was real...but then, where's the drama in that? </sarcasm>  Check out the true history of TC Williams and you'll appreciate that WAY more than this movie.   BTW, I agree with the reviewers who had to distinguish NoVA(Northern VA) from Southern Virginia.  I totally know where you're coming from.  I have friends who live in NoVa and they are NOTHING like my friends who live in Va Beach or Newport News.  There are big differences between the "two Virginias" if you will...  Ok I'm done.
