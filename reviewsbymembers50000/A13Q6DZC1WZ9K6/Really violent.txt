 I knew that this book would be about spousal abuse, but whoa!  This book to it to a level I wasn't expecting.  That being said, I did enjoy the book somewhat. The story, although unbelievable in some areas, had me interested until I finished.  I probably won't buy the sequel though, I'll just rent it from the library.
