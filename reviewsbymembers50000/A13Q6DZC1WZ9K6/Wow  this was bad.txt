 This was my first Tim Green book, and although it's a quick read, I did not like the story. This makes the second not-so-good book in three days for me.   Aside from the computer stuff, did anyone else notice the "Law for Dummies" vibe of the book?  Some of the lines read like a "we lawyers do THIS for THIS reason."     Just bad.  I agree with previous reviewers about how characters change for absolutely no reason.  Shouldn't Sales have been charged for kidnapping?  Or did Casey have to press charges in order for that to happen? Either way, there were too many gaps in this book.  I thought it was interesting to reveal the killer in the middle of the book, but I lost interest after a view unbelievable conversations.
