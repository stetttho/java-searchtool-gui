 Where's the other dimension of these two-dimensional characters??  Where's the rest of the book?  It ended so abruptly. Where's the logic behind the actions of these people?    As you can see, I did not enjoy this book.  Connie Briscoe truly dropped the ball with this one.  The only reason I had for reading it was that I reside in PG County. Have for my entire 22 years. I found the characters in this book to be horrible representations of the people here.  Yes, I know, it's a book meant for entertainment, but come on!  I've noticed that a few reviewers live in the County with me, so I know I do not have this opinion on my own.  1.Every single woman in this book had serious self-esteem issues: 1)Barbara--staying with a man that cheated on her repeatedly, 2)Jolene--money grubber...adulterer...skank, shall I go on?  Cheated on her husband with 2 men (1 was Barb's hub) and felt that a man was only worth something if he had $$.  What type of example was she setting for her young daughter?  3)Candice--main Caucasian woman in the book.  Disturbed that her daughter, Ashley, whom she has encouraged to accept people regardless of race, status, etc, is dating a black man.  4)Pearl--disturbed that her son is dating the said white daughter.  By far, the most racist person in the book as far as I was concerned.  5)Lee--some random character that popped up every five chapters or more.  Added nothing to the book except for a overly dramatic ending.    This book did nothing for me. Pearl and Candice's resistance to their children dating was ridiculous.  Somehow though, when Candice found out she was black (according to the ridiculous 1 drop rule), their relationship is all of a sudden something that is accepted!  And what was the purpose of pointing that out to Lee? No sense at all.  Lee's popping up added ZIP, NIL, NADA to the story!  I could write more, but I really don't feel like it.  Do like I did.  Buy this book for no more than $1.50.  Or rent it from the library.
