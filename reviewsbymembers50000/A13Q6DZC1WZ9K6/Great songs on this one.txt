 I love 112.  They are my fave RnB group along with Dru Hill.  I think this is a pretty good cd.  Most of my favorite 112 songs are on here. I'm a slow jams type of girl, so I instantly prefer the slow tracks over any of the faster ones 1. Room 112 (Intro)-- I usuallly skip intros 2. So Much Love (Interlude)    3. Be With You--I really like this song.  The intro is hot and the chorus is on point. I like Daron's voice a lot and Slim, while his voice is an acquired sound, doesn't sound too bad on this one.     4. Love Me--this song is ok, but is somewhat repetitive.  I usually either skip over it or end up changing songs halfway through.    5. Only One - Lil' Kim    6. Anywhere--ok intro to Anywhere            7. Anywhere--Anywhere was hot when it came out.  I really really like Anywhere waaaay more than Peaches n Cream         8. Love You Like I Did--this song is so great. Another one featuring Daron.  Slim comes in on the bridge            9. For Awhile--I like this song featuring Faith Evans.            10. Don't Go Away (Interlude--This interlude is hot.  I don't know if they all sang on this one, but if they did, the harmony is hot.             11. Stay With Me           12. Whatcha Gonna Do           13. Crazy over You--MY FAVORITE 112 song EVER!!!  It's so sweet and simple. Great song to tell someone how you feel about them             14. Funny Feelings--playable but also skippable            15. Never Mind--skippable            16. Someone to Hold            17. All My Love            18. You Are The Only One (Interlude)            19. Your Letter--the first time I heard this, I was quite surprised at the ending. Totally unexpected from my angle.  But it's a great track.
