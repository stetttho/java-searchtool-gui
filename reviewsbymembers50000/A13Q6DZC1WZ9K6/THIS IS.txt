 I don't know about the other reviewers, but I like to pretend that "Hot and Wet" never happened.  When I heard that the title was "Pleasure and Pain" I immediately got excited because I knew that meant they were taking it back.  This is 112!!  This is the 112 that I know and LOVE!  They are definitely the best of all the male R&B groups out there (except Dru Hill).  Even Slim is doing his thing on this album. These are true RnB jams.  You will not be disappointed.    My favs:  Intro-112 does the best intros/interlude no question Let This Go What If U Already Know (even tho it's explicit) Last to Know I'm Sorry-another interlude My Mistakes Why Can't We Get Along THAT'S HOW CLOSE WE ARE-my favorite on this cd!  This song gets to me like This Is Your Day (112), Crazy Over You (Room 112), and Missing You (Part III).   God Knows  All of the other songs are ok, but these are the instant replay ones.   I guarantee that you will love it!  It is total 112.  They took it back, y'all!  P.S. I L-O-V-E Mike and Daron!!!!
