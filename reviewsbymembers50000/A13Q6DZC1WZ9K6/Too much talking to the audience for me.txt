 And what was up with those rules?  Anyone operating like that is bound to get dissed.  The ten rules was a bit much for me.  This movie was no different from the laundry list of black predictable films.  We want to be taken seriously in Hollywood, but movies like this are the best we can do?   I dare any black director, producer, or writer, to take this movie, the likes of Brown Sugar, Baby Boy, Kingdom Come (what the Heezy?), Deliver Us From Eva, and ALL of the movies that follow this pattern to the Academy.
