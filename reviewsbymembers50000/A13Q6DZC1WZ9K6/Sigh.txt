 Not the TRUE Tempts, but that's neither here nor there...   There is no doubt that these guys CAN SING, but my MAJOR gripe is whomever WRITES for them needs to REMEMBER that these men are MATURE in age and NOT 20-something!!!  The cd is ok, but when I hear them sing a lyric that they are too old to be singing, I cannot take them seriously.  I do like Hurt So Bad--despite the lyrics, and 4 Days, Lady, and So Easy.    I would rank this cd after Legacy and Ear-risistable and Phoenix Rising.
