 1. Silent Night   2. Now Behold The Lamb    3. Jesus Is The Reason For The Season   8. The Night That Christ Was Born      The above songs are my personal faves, but the entire album is wonderful.  My church sings number two ALL THE TIME (not just Christmastime) and it never fails to bless.  This is not just a Christmas album although that is the general theme. Each track can bless all year long!
