 HOWEVER,  In MY world, there's no way that I'd meet a guy and end up spending every single day of the next two weeks with him.  No freakin' way!  That did bother me about this movie. And I'll be doggoned if he meets my family within those same ten days.    This movie was pure fluff.  Very predictable from start to finish.  I hated how everything ended so nice and neatly at the end.  Also, I hate how when women decide to leave and do what they want with their lives, a 5-minute speech from a guy just changes their mind.  That crap makes me sick.  The same thing happened on Deliver Us From Eva (I LOATHE THIS MOVIE) and several others that we all have seen.  I wish I knew how to change the stars, because my true rating is 2.
