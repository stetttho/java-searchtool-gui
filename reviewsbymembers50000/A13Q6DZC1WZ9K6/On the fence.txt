 I give this book 4 stars b/c it kept me interested, but this is just not my type of book.  I was in either middle or high school when I read this, and this was the book that everyone was talking about. I just can't get with stories like this.  I prefer more cleverly written stories than this one.  It is an interesting read though.  I also read For the Love of Money and feel the same way.  I just think these books have a certain predictability to them.   You might like it.
