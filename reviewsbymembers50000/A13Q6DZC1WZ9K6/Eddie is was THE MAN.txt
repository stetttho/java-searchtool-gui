 I am only 19, but since I am quite turned off by the music of my generation (hiphop, rap,pop), I am heavily interested in teh sounds of yesteryear. The Classic Temptations are my favorite musical group of all time!! Their harmonies are tight (I live for great harmony), and their moves were crisp and cool (of course all I've seen of this are tapes, but you get the idea).  My favorite Tempt is Eddie Kendrick! I am in love w/his voice. The only person of my generation who even comes close to Eddie is Maxwell. Many accused Eddie of losing the falsetto, but even in his later years, you always knew it was him. I like Keep on Truckin' and I find it cool and humorous that rapper Mr. Cheeks sampled that song. Can I is the perfect song for any girl. I love putting on headphones and having Eddie sing in my ears. I even ordered from them the Live at Club Kabana cd and I am "patiently" waiting for it to get here!1 I say all this to say, you won't be disappointed.
