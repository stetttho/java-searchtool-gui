 I thought I was getting the first cd, but apparently not.  I bought this cd last week, thinking it would be pretty good.  Ever since she joined DC, I thought her voice was pretty unique (compared to Bouncy and Kelly's).  Unfortunately, I fell asleep while listening to this.    Like others, I expected this cd to be "gospel," but it clearly wasn't.  These songs are, at best, inspirational.  And to make sure I was hearing them right, I read the words while listening.  One person said it best:  these songs could easily be about her new man or some of her friends.  It left me empty.  And it's kind of hard to take her seriously when you listen to "Destiny Fulfilled."  Pretty racy there...seeing how these albums were released within a month or so of each other.  I'm really interested in where her heart and her loyalty really lies.  With God or with the World?  The answers may lie in DC's newest videos: Soldier and Lose My Breath  I'm selling this one on Ebay.
