 I bought this video from Hollywood Video a couple nights ago, and I enjoyed watching it.  Diane Keaton (true, she does overact) and Jack Nicholson were awesome and had great chemistry in this.  I liked watching a movie with some "old skool" actors in it.  LOL, I felt bad for poor Keanu in the end.  But all in all, it was a very amusing movie.
