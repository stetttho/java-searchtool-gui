 I have not heard all of the songs on Beyonce's cd, but I think I have seen her in the media enough to say what I am about to say.  Beyonce has a great voice.  I never doubted that she would be able to do a solo album.  My thing is this: for all the CLASSIC female singers that she (among others) claim to emulate, did any of those women EVER, and I mean EVER, have to come out the house looking like they were ready to walk 14th Street in Washington, DC???!!!  I feel like this, I'm not certain whether or not her cd was aimed more at men or more at women, but I do know one thing, it does absolutely nothing for me (a female) to see her as naked as she usually is.  Is that what you have to do to be accepted? Forget the voice, just parade around in next to nothing.  Hey, I guess that's what is keeping Ashanti from taking her 'Rain' back to Glen Cove. I just had to vent.  I know nothing about this cd aside from the songs that have been released.  I'm waiting for my friend to burn me a copy.
