 It's a shame that Amazon does not have a button for 0 stars.  I am watching this movie right now (borrowed from a friend) and I am barely paying attention to it.  I am not a fan of remakes, but I do appreciate some of them (i.e Sabrina, Miracle on 34th St, etc).  This, however, was an idea that should have stayed in the boardroom.  This movie is awful.  It's long and drawn out, and it tried to make itself more than it really is.  It's way too violent.   Like another reviewer said, this is just going to drive viewers to see and purchase the original. Now that was creepy!  I was actually afraid of my closet!  I am only 21, but I have read plenty about the Cold War and McCarthyism.  The original made sense. This version does not.   SPOILER:  BTW, what happened to the Queen of Hearts?  The secret code from the original was WAY more clever than hearing "Sgt. Raymond Shaw."  Pathetic.  I am really disappointed in Denzel.  I hated Training Day, John Q, and now this. Meryl Streep is NOWHERE near as creepy as Ms. Murder She Wrote, and Liev did not make me feel sorry for him like I did the other guy. I just didn't get the hype of the movie. I found it to be very anti-climatic. Not saying that I want a remake to be an exact copy (look what happened with Psycho), but the changes were too much.  Especially the ending.  Try again, Hollywood.  Or better yet, DON'T!!
