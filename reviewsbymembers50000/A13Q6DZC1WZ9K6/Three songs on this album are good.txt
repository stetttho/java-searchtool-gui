 I actually rec'd this album from a girl in my dorm, freshman year, whose boyfriend sold cds.  This was before the whole "we'll sue if you burn" phenomenon.  Anyway, she asked my roommate and me to watch her cds and she told us we could pick one out for free. Ashanti was hot at the time, but not to me.  I chose this one. All I have to say is that the sister can sing, but the album is rather mediocre. The only good songs are:  Nothing In This World--duet with Avant.  These two compliment each other's voices really well. This is their second duet.  This song whenever I play it has automatic repeat status.   If Only You Knew--remake of a Patti classic.  I love Patti's version, but I think this one is an adequate tribute.  Patti's is softer and smoother, but KeKe hits those notes  Don't Take Your Love--sort of uptempo.  Has a decent hook  The lyrics could be better on other songs, but it's worth a listen.
