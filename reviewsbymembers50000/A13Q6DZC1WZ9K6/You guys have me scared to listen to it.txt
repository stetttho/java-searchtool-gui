 OK, I just heard her first single on the radio for the first time...it's OK, but just ok.  I like Tamyra.  Sweet spirit, beautiful girl, but that song was not hot.  It was ok..in that American Idol "pop star" kind of way.  Oh, and I agree with all those who say that these AI people try to emulate Mariah and Whitney cuz I could hear it in that track Anyways, I like TG so I gave it four stars. I wish her the best.  But, I'll probably wait til the price is next to nothing before I buy it.
