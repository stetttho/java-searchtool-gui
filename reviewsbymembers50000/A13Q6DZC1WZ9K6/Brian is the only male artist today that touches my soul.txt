 John Legend is almost there, but his work does not compare to Brian's 10 plus years.  What can be said about BMcK that hasn't been said already? The man's vocals, production, and writing skills are amazing.  This cd is definitely classic Brian in my mind. I have all of his music except for the cd before this one and after Superhero. Every song on here flows for me. The only thing I can do w/o are the rappers on my R&B! LOL.    My favorite songs:  1. Stay With Him (Intro)-very catch and old-skool intro 2. What We Do Here--It's a good song, but definitely too much airplay 3. Everytime You Go Away--sounds like Let's Get Married by JE, but I love it 4. Grown Man Business--LOVE this song 5. Everything I Do--THIS SONG GETS TO ME LIKE "LOVE OF MY LIFE"  6. Here With You  7. All Over Now 8. She   9. Stay 11. Watcha Gonna Do? 12. Your Song  13. Me & You    Gemini is definitely worth the $12.99
