 I wanted to like this book.  I really did...mainly because I paid for it. I hate buying a book that I don't want to keep.  However, this book left a lot to be desired.  I had just finished reading two books that had me enthralled, so I thought I was on a streak.  Read this...streak ended.  There was just way too much unexplained stuff going on in the book.  For me, the characters had no real depth.  Relationships formed (aside from Kristen and Rafe) that just seemed all to convenient.    I also agree with the reviewers who claimed the book was too long.  It really was.  And I don't even feel like I rushed through the book.  Several times, I went back and reread parts just to make sure I got them.    Nice try, Mrs. Ray, but no.  I will check out your other books from the library from now on.
