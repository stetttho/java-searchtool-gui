 Next to Alex Haley's Queen, this is the best IR love story I have ever read.  Haley's was more historical and biographical, and The Color of Love, as far as I know, is just fiction. Both I read in one night.    This book is AWESOME!!!  And I really mean that. I thought the story had a natural build.  Apprehension, getting to know each other as friends, and then the progression to lovers.  I had to chuckle at their first love scene coming on page 204 b/c any other author would have had them sleep together by page 89.    Anyway, the only gripe about the book for me is how Leah handled her sister...and her sister, Gail, never really apologized for her betrayal. And I thought some of the B/W drama was a bit over the top, but I think Ms. Kitt brought it full circle in a believable way!   Sandra Kitt ROCKS and I will be checking out more of her stories!
