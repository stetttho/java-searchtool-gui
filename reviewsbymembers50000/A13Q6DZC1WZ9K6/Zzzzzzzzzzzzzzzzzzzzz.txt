 I thought this movie was pretty bad.  Firstly, because I do not have an appreciation for Nick Cannon's work.  I think he is a very corny actor, rapper, whatever.  I don't know any remakes that are as good as the original, but this one was bad.  I only went to see it b/c I was outnumbered by my friends (I'm mad about my $6).  Anyways, the 80s version is multiple times better.   I'm so glad that the original is on Oxygen's favorite movie list.
