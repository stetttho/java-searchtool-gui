 I just rec'd my dvd earlier this week, and I love it!!!  I love to see EJK and Ruffin onstage. I own the Street Gold Original Leads tape, and these two were made to perform!!!!  EJK looks delightful in that suit.  The Tempts are one of the reasons I wish I was alive in the 60s.   EJK has so much stage presence and he could barely keep still.  There was a discussion on a messageboard that said he wasn't a good dancer.  Are you kidding?  This man can groove.  Someone explained it as dancing is too easy for him, and I am inclined to agree.  Especially during the I'm Losing You part!  He is really having fun.  I liked the sense of brotherhood between him and Ruffin.  In the Emperors of Soul box set, Shelley Berger mentions that in 85, Eddie's voice was shot.  I personally feel that was quite tacky and downright rude, tactless, and wrong to say.  To me, and believe me, I know when someone's voice makes me cringe.  I knew that it was Eddie and he sounded fine. Sure his voice was failing due to the smoking, but you know it's Sweet Eddie up there.  He looked good, y'all!!!!  And believe me, I would rather have a weak voiced Eddie sing Just My Imagination or any other of his songs WAY MORE than I would any of the guys that followed him.  Same with Ruffin. Can't nobody sing My Girl, Ain't Too Proud to Beg, I'm Losing You, etc. LIKE HE CAN!!!! I haven't watched Mary Wells' segments yet or Martha Reeves', but if you are an EJK fanatic or a Ruffin fan, you GOTTA own this!!
