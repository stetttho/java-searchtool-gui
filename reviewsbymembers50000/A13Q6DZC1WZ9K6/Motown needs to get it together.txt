 I love Eddie Kendricks. I am a 19 yr old fan. His voice was and IS very beautiful and addictive. The only other male artist who comes close in my eyes is Maxwell.  [...].  You can buy it if you want, but it'll really leave you wanting more. It's mainly a repeat of the Ultimate collection and the Essential Collection. Lucky for me, my copy was a gift from the EJK Memorial Foundation when I attended this year's EJK Day.  Any Eddie fans in the Washington DC Metro area  should really try to go.  It's a great tribute put together by Jimmy Dougans of the Young Senators, Eddie's traveling band.   I give it five stars for Eddie, but not for the Millenium part of it.
