 When I first saw this on HBO, I found it to be quite devastating.  It's a shame what happened to these children.  If I can say this, I cosider myself very blessed to have not been alive in those times.  I sometimes wonder if I, or anybody I know would have survived.  My parents were kids in that time, but where they lived (Northwest DC), I don't think they were affected like others.  Or at least, they haven't told me anything. What happened to these girls as well as Emmit Tille disturbs me beyond control.  I got a library book about him, and I could not get past the page where they described his condition after his death.  I took the book back.   I am glad that this movie was not a dramatization b/c the realism of it just made it hit home harder.  Hate is never cool.  Watch this movie and get a lesson on the effects of prejudice and unwarranted happenings.
