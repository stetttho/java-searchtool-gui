 112 is a pretty decent group.  My favorite member is Daron.  This cd is pretty good with a couple of exceptions.  My favorite tracks are 2, 3, 6, 9, 11, and 15 1. 112 Intro--skip this one    2. Dance With Me--this is a cool song.  easy to dance to     3. It's Over Now--I like this track a lot.  The beat is hot    4. Peaches & Cream--I think I am one of the few people who is not impressed by this song.    5. I Surrender (Interlude)--nothing special about this interlude, but I do think it is a great lead in to Missing You   6. Missing You--I love this song!!  I think Mike did very well.  Nice slow jam.             7. All I Want Is You--don't like this song.            8. Don't Hate Me--don't like this song at all           9. Q, Mike, Slim, Daron (Interlude)--If you are available...           10. Player---Player is ok, but the message is kinda screwy           11. Sweet Love---I love this song!!!  Very slow and sensual sounding.  Kinda freaky, but way better than PnC           12. Smile--this song is ok, but it's clearly filler           13. Caught Up--very skippable track           14. Do What You Gotta Do--skippable           15. I Think--great track           16. Still in Love--filler track I think. Not strong enough to end the album. All in all, pretty decent.  I listen to this cd on a weekly basis.  You can't go wrong here.
