 if you haven't seen it yet, you have no idea what you've been missing!  This is by far one of my Top Ten funny movies!  I love Coming to America.  I watched it this past weekend for the first time in a while, and my brother, godsister, and I LOLed the entire time!  It was great  The best moments:  1.Anything Soul Glow 2.The Reverend ("AMEN, Praise the Lawd") 3.The scene with Samuel L. Jackson 4.Mr. Randy Watson ("Sexual Chocolate" hahahahahaha)  this movie had too many great moments to type.  Oh, and to the reviewer who doesn't get the scene at the end with the soup: no sense of humor whatsoever.  Everyone knows that he was telling the waiter that he had no spoon. Good geez.
