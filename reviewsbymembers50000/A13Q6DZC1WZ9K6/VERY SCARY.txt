 I watched this movie late one night...creeped me out!  After it went off, I proceeded to go downstairs to my family room to watch more tv.  I was carrying more than a handful of videos down with me.  Saw Carrie covered in the pig blood...and the tapes fell and I followed them!!  That's all I will say!!!
