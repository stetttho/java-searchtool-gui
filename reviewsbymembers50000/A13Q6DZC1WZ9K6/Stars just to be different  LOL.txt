 Anyways,  I like Mario.  I think he's a good-looking, good-sounding teenager.  I have his first cd and I was highly anticipating his followup.  What do I think of it? I think it's pretty decent...for me, it was a logical followup to his release when he was 15 or 16. It's not over-the-top "I'm such a ho, I got a girl pregnant...These are my Confessions..."...crap like that. Newsflash: he still is a child, y'all.    Anyways, the best tracks are Let Me Love You (he sounds way mature on this one), Girl I Need, Couldn't Say No, and several others.  My personal fave is Nikes Fresh Out the Box.  Now I'm 21 years old, and while a song as silly and assinine as "Yeah!" causes me to want to cut my ears off, NFOtB is hot.  And I mean hot. It's such a cute song.  And the high notes are way unexpected.  Speaking of "Yeah!"...to those saying he's trying to be like Usher...you sound as lame as everybody who thinks every female artist wants to be Beyonce.  NEWSFLASH:  neither one of them invented a thing, so please REFRAIN from using them as PILLARS OF ORIGINALITY!  They are both overprocessed POP stars.  They will fade just as quickly as they came.  I actually know someone who thinks Mario has more of a Tevin Campbell-vibe (VOICE WISE!!!) which says a lot since Tevin can blow way better than Usher.    Anyway, check out the album. Support the young man on his "journey to manhood." I expect his junior effort to follow the trend of his growth.
