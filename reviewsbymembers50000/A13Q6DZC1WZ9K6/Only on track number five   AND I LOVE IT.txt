 Wow!  Trina is awesome!   I first learned of her reading these reviews here on Amazon. I found this in Best Buy today (the last one!) and I am taken aback!  Was listening to Jon B (*swoon*) earlier and popped this in.  Talk about soulful! This is what I like to hear!  None of the overprocessed vocals that are running rampant in the music business today!  Why I haven't heard more about Ms. Trina, the world will never know.  My favorite track so far is the title track Still the Same Girl.  This album has so many different sounds---nothing sounds regurgitated or familiar...yet it all flows so beautifully.  Her lyrics and vocals are so smooth that you can bump it in the car, in the hosue while you're cleaning, or when you're lulling yourself to sleep.  Just wow!  If you are a lover of smooth soul, RnB, rock, etc...pick this one up!
