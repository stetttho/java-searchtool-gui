 I was home on Christmas Break, and my mom had recently added On Demand to our cable system.  I was up late one night and I saw TWN listed as one of the movies I could watch.  So I clicked on it.  I started watching and I laughed for the first ten minutes!! I decided that I wanted my roommate at school to watch with me so I started the movie over and watched again from the beginning taping it this time. This movie was quite hilarious!  Hugh Grant and Sandy Bullock had great onscreen chemistry.  Hugh's accent is to die for!!!!! Of course this is a typical type of story, but it was a pleasant rehash to view.  I am not the type who likes ultra-predictable romances (which most are), but this one is great!   Rent it today!
