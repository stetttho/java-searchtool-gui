 This is the movie that Secret Window tried to be!  This is how it should be done!!!  This movie reminded me of Psycho b/c you don't know until THE END!  There's no figuring the movie out 20 minutes into it or from the previews *cough cough Hide and Seek cough cough*.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I love watching the reactions of people who haven't seen it.   Haley Joel Osmond was really good. He deserved that Oscar!  1999 was his year.  Bruce Willis was good also, as well as the actress who played the mom.    Pick this one up!  It's excellent!
