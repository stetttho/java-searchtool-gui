 OK, before last fall, I had never heard of the Last Dragon. So I was talking to my friend one day, and he mentioned it, and I asked if DMX (the rapper) was in it.  He, in turn, laughed at me.  So it is because of his laughter that I watched this movie.  I, along with my roommate, set up for a night of movie watching.... What a mistake! First of all, we talked all during the film about how corny and stupid it was.  I know I'm going against the rest of the reviews, but movies like this do nothing for me.  And then the part where we found out who The Master was....talk about WACK!!!!  All in all, I wouldn't recommend it, but if you like corny 80s stuff, you may enjoy this.  I, on the other hand, really want those two hours back.
