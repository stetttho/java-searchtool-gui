 THis book was predictable from start to finish.  FIlled with stereotypes that blacks cannot seem to let go of.  I am black, and this book was embarassing.  The way the black characters feel is this book gives the idea that anything black is good for you...and EVERYTHING white is EVIL.  Well newsflash:  Not every white person is out to get you and not every black person has your best interest at heart!  People who view the world this way are doomed to shut doors for themselves that would otherwise be open. IMO, no one looks at race more than African Americans and that to me, a young black woman, is incredibly disturbing.  I must say I was turned off by the author's way of writing both Lee and Porter...Lee began as very condescending...as did her friends.  I am all for black pride, but blind racial loyalties are dangerous.   The end of the book was very predictable.  The big climax or whatever you want to call it was so predictable.  To have someone like Porter, who seemingly based how he treated people on their individual qualities, do what he did (two separate incidents) was nothing more than a copout and some sort of justification for the author's viewpoint. I did not find this book enjoyable at all. Save yourself the trouble.
