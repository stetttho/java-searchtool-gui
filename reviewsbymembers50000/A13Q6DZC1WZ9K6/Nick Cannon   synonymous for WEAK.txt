 What can I say about this?? I only needed to hear two songs to know that this cd would NEVER find it's way into my collection.  "Ya Pops" and that "Gigolo" song are equally awful.  Nick Cannon is the corniest actor/wannabe rapper that I have seen in a while. The only thing worse than his music are those globs of saliva that are always in the corners of his mouth.  Save your $$$.
