 I am a HUGE Classic Tempts fan.  I can listen to them all day, every day.  Forget the My Girl compilation and the Ultimate Collection...EoS is what you need!!!  This compilation is like a story...it reads from the beginning:  the non-hits (but good songs just the same), to the first hit The Way You Do The Things You Do and it takes off from there!!!  You can even tell the different points from which David and Eddie made their departures from the group. The Voices of Paul Williams, Eddie Kendricks, and David Ruffin were and still are powerful and wonderful to listen to. There are even songs on here that were previously unreleased!!  Any Tempt fan should have this in their collection.   Dennis Edwards shines also on this set.   Sadly, I haven't listened to discs 4 and 5.  To me, it's a different group.  Buy this set and you'll see what I mean.
