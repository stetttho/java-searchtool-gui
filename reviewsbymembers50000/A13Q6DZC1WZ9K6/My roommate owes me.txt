 She ordered this from On Demand and we attempted to watch it one night. I fell asleep due to extreme boredom and a comfortable corner on a bed. I woke up at the very end when the girl's father took her out of the apartment.   And what's funnier. I slept thru the whole thing, my roomie watched it and when I woke up, we both had the same level of confusion. Go figure.
