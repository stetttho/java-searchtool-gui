 I love this cd.  Almost from start to finish.  When Olivia Foxx was on the Russ Parr show, she said that the singles that Tweet put out did not reflect the quality of the cd.  She was right!!  Obviously those songs were to grab a certain bunch or whatever but if it wasn't for Olivia, I probably wouldn't have checked it out.   Fav songs include Smoking Cigarettes, Best Friend, Complain,Beautiful (oh so sweet), and Motel (which is teh song I sing to my boyfriend when he makes me mad. he hates it!) If you get this cd, you will not be disappointed. Just skip over Call Me and Oops.
