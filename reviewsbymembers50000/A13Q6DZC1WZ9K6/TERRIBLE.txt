 I usually enjoy MHC's books, but this one is AWFUL!  I borrowed it from a cousin, thank the Lord, or I'd be right at the bookstore returning this. This book was not only boring, but predictable too. Not a good combination.  And I totally saw the "union" at the end. Just terrible.  the pieces fell together to cleanly. It was so bad, I was wishing that the heroine was positively wrong in her assessment of who killed her sister. The website thing was a bit much too.   Don't read this...if you must, find it at a library!
