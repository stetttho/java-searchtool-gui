 I really don't know what to say about this book. This book was just a rehash of what we already know from the various stars' memoirs.  A lot of what he took was from Berry's book.  He did reveal some things about Motown's business practices that were eye-openers.  He also talks about what happened to flow and that whole situation was a crying shame. I found the parts about Hollywood Motown to be interesting.  The failure of some of their movies just proves the point that everybody can't do everything.   I did read this book, start to finish, in two days though.
