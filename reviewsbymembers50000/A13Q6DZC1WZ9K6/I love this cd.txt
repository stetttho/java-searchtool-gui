 This album grew on me when my cousin let me hear Stand Still when I was about TEN!!!  Our choir at church began to sing this song.  I have been hunting down the cd and I finally found it!  WC is AWESOME and more importantly ANOINTED!!!!  God has truly been using them to get me through my last year of college...especially with Stand Still (Until His Will is Clear).  This song brings TEARS to my eyes!    Buy this album before it is out of print!
