 I was in either middle or high school when I read this, and this was the book that everyone was talking about. I found this story to be incredible boring and a very bad follow up to Flyy Girl (even tho I didn't really get with that one).   I just can't get with stories like this.  I prefer more cleverly written stories than this one.  It is an interesting read though.  I also read Flyy Girl and feel the same way.  I just think these books have a certain predictability to them.   You might like it.
