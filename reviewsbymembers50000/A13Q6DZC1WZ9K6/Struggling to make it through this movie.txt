 as I type. It's not even suspenseful.  It's pretty crappy from where I stand.  The story is VERY dated, and the whole "bad neighborhood practically condones bad behavior" is NO GOOD in my book.  Also, this movie highlighted reasons why the evidence was possibly wrong, and barely gave the viewer a chance to sufficiently weigh that against the evidence produced.  All you hear is the jurors bringing up a piece of evidence and refuting it.  Example: we never saw the old man walking, so we have to take Henry Fonda's word at how slow he was going.    We also, at the beginning, saw the boy looking all downtrodden in the beginning---a BLANTANT attempt to sway the viewer from the getgo. We never see the witnesses or anything.  All we're left with is what these jurors say...no room to make your own judgment call.  Also...I'm not sure how the law was back then, but Henry Fonda's character going to the boy's neighborhood and then buying the knife was DEFINITELY grounds for dismissal from the jury.   The same thing happened in the Scott Peterson case--with the woman who did her own internet research--she was dismissed.  Now, with the foreman (in the movie) being so pressed about laying ground rules, I find it hard to believe that he would not have reported Fonda's character.   Now, I understand how "reasonable doubt" works.  But something about this movie is incredibly off where I'm concerned. It just seems to put together and too "scripted" (if you will).  Struggling to make it through this junk.  And the fact through Henry Fonda I see Jane Fonda...that only adds to the unbearable factor.     Definitely not a classic in my book.
