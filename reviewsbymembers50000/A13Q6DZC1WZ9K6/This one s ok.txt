 I'm not overly impressed w/the Copa part of this cd.  They just don't seem to be enjoying themselves as much. Which may be a reflection of what was going on in the group at this time. Now, on the Temptations LIVE!, now that one rocks!!  I really wish I was there!!  You can hear them doing the claps that go w/certain dance moves (for example My Girl).  The audience is going wild and it just seems like a more fun and personable show. I love Dennis, but I love David more, so I was quite happy to hear him on AWLOS.   Cool two-fer, but if u want real live action, get Temptations LIVE!  I might have to buy another one if I wear mine out!! Edit:7.23.03 **I so take back my previous statements!!  While this show doesn't have the same live feel of Temptations LIVE!, it is still a great show.  I believe it was Den's first w/the group.  He slides right in.  He doesn't try to be David...he's Dennis and he was on fire!!!  I love the improv stuff he does during I Could Never Love Another.  Paul is great, EDDIE IS GREAT (Check out You're My Everything, With These Hands, and Please Return Your Love to Me).   These guys were the masters!!!  I am a young fan at 20, but these guys envoke more out of me than ANY group of my generation that I probably SHOULD be listening to! I can't speak about the current crop.as I am a Classic/Hall of Fame Temptfan, but purchase anything with The Voices (David, EDDIE, Paul, and Dennis) and you will NEVER be disappointed!!! The With A Whole Lot o' Soul cd is classic also. I'm Losing You is the perfect opener for the disc.  I love hearing Cornelius Grant on the guitar and Ruffin's heavy breath saying "Ooohooo. Your LOVE is fading!"  It sends shivers up my spine!! I read where people said things are missing from the original Copa LP.  I wish they would have left whatever was missing on.  I am a sucker for live shows. It shows what a group is really made of. So cop this one.  You're in for a treat!!!
