 In high school, I tried to convince our African American STudies teacher to plan a field trip to see this movie.  He rebuffed me, and when I saw this movie on tape, I knew why.   I am glad that I am not the only one who knows Spike Lee is a racist.  And a slick one at that.  He does these movies and black people go see them (I am black, so don't attack me).  Do The Right Thing was horrible, Jungle Fever (he ought to be ashamed) all in the name of "eye-opening" filmmaking.  Give me a break Bamboozled...I don't know what to say about this movie. Stereotypes, senseless violence, just downright shameful.  There was no message here...except that, we, as black people, sometimes do it to ourselves (ex. Soul Plane? same problem). And helping this man, for the sake of a paycheck is deplorable.   Please spare yourself of this film.
