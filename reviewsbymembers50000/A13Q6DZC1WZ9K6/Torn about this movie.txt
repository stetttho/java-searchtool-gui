 I liked it, but I can see how some may find it boring. The beginning dragged on WAY too long.  And the effects were SO LOUD. Maybe that was a movie theater problem, but I had to cover my ears during all of the action scenes.   Katie Holmes served no purpose, and Cristian Bale was a really good Bruce/Batman. I have always liked him.   I cannot 100% recommend this movie, but in a few months, it may be worth a rental from BB or Hollywood.
