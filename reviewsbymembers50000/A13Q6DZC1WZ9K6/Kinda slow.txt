 I have been reading this book since October 2003, and it's been a struggle.  One of my friends told me about this book, so I went out and purchased it.  The premise of the book had me intrigued, but the pacing and structure is making it difficult to read.  Several times, I've found myself picking up other books and being able to finish them, while fighting to get through a couple of pages of this one.    I applaud the author for trying out a different genre, but he dropped the ball on this one. It's not exactly a "page turner."   FINALLY MADE IT THROUGH THIS BOOK....AFTER TWO YRS!!!, August 18, 2005 Reviewer: Lynnie "Lynnie" (Bowie, MD) - See all my reviews  It took me two years to finish this book. I had to get the audio ABRIDGED cds to help with this process. I heard that it was on the best seller list. Could not get into it, and I really REALLY tried. It is so obvious that Mr. Carter is a nonfiction writer and a law professor. There are too many words an details in this book. You can write a great story without it being so overdone. I totally agree with everyone who discussed the editor or lack thereof. This book was way too long. The characters were vapid and quite possibly the most unsympathetic ones I've ever read about. Too many things going on in this one.   I bought the cds (which I am promptly selling) to help me get through it and that was still a struggle! This one left me completely unfulfilled and it could have been so much better.   I cannot recommend this book to anyone.
