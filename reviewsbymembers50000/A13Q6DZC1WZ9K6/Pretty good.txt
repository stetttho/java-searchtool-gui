 It's a shame how Hugo was able to play on O's fears and feelings and drive him to do what he did.  This is why it pays to think for yourself and don't let others get into your head.  O and Desi seemed to have a trusting relationship...why the heck would she be messing w/his best friend?  These are questions O should have asked himself.  This whole story is a tragedy and it was very well acted.  You could just follow O's sinking into despair.  I recommend this one.
