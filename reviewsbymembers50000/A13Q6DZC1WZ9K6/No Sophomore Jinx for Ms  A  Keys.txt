 I will be the first to admit that I bought her first cd solely b/c of the hype surrounding it.  I hated it!  So when they started playing "You Don't Know My Name," it took a while for it to grow on me.  The day this album came out, my friend went to pick some up for some people. I told him to pick me up one.  I almost told him not to worry about it.  And I'm so glad I did. This album is good and worth a listen.  A. Keys gets you from start about the middle of the album. Yeah, the second half, after Diary, is pretty much a downer.  My favorite tracks are Karma, Heartburn, If I Were Your Woman/Walk on By (nice cover of Gladys), You Don't Know My Name, If I Ain't Got You/With this cd, she definitely made a believer out of me.
