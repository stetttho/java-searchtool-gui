 Because I play this disc NONSTOP!  I agree with whomever said that Kirk shows out on this project.  I think this is the most personal cd yet.  Hearing this cd and then watching him on Oprah brought it all home for me. This cd is wonderful for anyone dealing with various issues in life.  Addictions, esteem problems, family issues, etc.  I think whatever you're situation, you can find comfort in at least half of the tracks.   1. Intro-    2. Looking For You---5 of 5...I pump this all the way to work 3. Hero---this song is so great. Love Dorinda and the lyrics are powerful   4. Interlude--I absolute adore Fred Hammond.  I could really feel this one   5. Let It Go    6. The Process   7. Imagine Me--my favorite track right now. Listen to the words carefully.    8. Could've Been--#1 jam.  My two fave new artists (Tye and J) are on it     9. Better   10. Afterwhile    11. Brokenhearted    12. Without You   13. Keep Your Head   14. Why--Stevie Wonder will always ROCK   15. First Love--very nice    16. The Appeal    17. Brokenhearted (Reprise)   18. Interlude   19. Sunshine   20. Outro      The beats and arrangements are amazing. I could easily listen to an instrumental version of this cd.  You will defintely enjoy this.
