 O my gracious, this was the worst movie that I have seen in I don't know when.  Peer pressure is NOT cool because that was the only reason they got my $6.  This movie was beyond awful...B2K is the weakest thing to hit the music scene. They are always in our faces and it gets even worse with a movie.  The only thing that saves this movie was the dancing.  Seriously. I spent this entire film talking about how crappy it was.  The acting was horrible, the plot was ridiculous (can you say Bring It On? And it probably goes further back than that!), and it should have been refused by the studio. The ONLY funny part in the movie was when the girl from My Wife & Kids tried to show us how "down and hip" she was.  Only it backfired when she couldn't say "trippin'" and said "tripping."  I bet theaters everywhere laughed at that moment and only that moment.  And let's not forget skanky Lil Kim and her botched lipo-job.  Ugh.   Anyways, this movie was horrible.  Do you self right, and buy or rent something else.
