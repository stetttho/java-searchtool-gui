 I watched this movie for the first time last night!!!! FINALLY!!!  I'm glad I caught it on Turner Classic Movies.  This movie is awesome.  I am a 21 year old ADDICTED to the Classics, and after one viewing, I have fallen in love with this movie. Great Dancing, Funny Plot...what more could you ask for?!  I even was able to get my bf to watch with me!!    I can't wait to get the DVD!!!
