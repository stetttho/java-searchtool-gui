 This was one of the many books I read when I worked at a library in high school.  Pretty interesting read.  Reminded me of several other books of it's type, although I will say, that due to the lifestyle of the main character, I thought the situation she has to deal with was realistic and added something to the story.   It's ok, but I've read better.
