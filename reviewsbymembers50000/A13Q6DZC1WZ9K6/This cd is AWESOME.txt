 Out of all of Kirk Franklin's "non-Family" groups, God's Property is the best.  This cd is awesome and their message is great!  I love probably all but one song!  I used to blast this over my cousin's house.  This cd is a sure fire way to get riled up in the Spirit...don't take my word for it. Get this album today!
