 This was my first Motown book and I am glad to say that.  I enjoyed Dancing in the Streets more than I did Mary Wilson's books.  Now we all know that all of the spurned Motown artist feel burned and are out to get what's owed them, but in reading this book, I did not feel like that was the driving force behind its conception.  Martha tells it like it is!  I commend her for this effort!  I hope she writes another one!! I highly recommend this one!
