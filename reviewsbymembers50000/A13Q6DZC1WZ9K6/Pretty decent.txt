 I didn't realize that the author of this book was the same woman who wrote First Wives Club until just now!  I am sitting here reading an article on her death.  I saw the name on this book, but it just didn't click.   This was a pretty good novel. Story was really good.  I wanted each of the women to succeed.  Funny at times.  Sad at times.  But an overall good story.  It's been a while since I read this book, but I don't recall putting it down!!  You won't be disappointed.
