 This book was ok.  I bought it a couple of weeks ago and took the time to read it this week.  I will say that this book kept me interested til the very end.  I do not think anything that happened was far-fetched.  I'm not one who enjoys books that are overly-sexual, so that was a drawback for me.  Especially since a lot of the sex was loose and very irresponsible.  That being said, I think the book (storywise) was interesting and I enjoyed the round up of the characters at the end.    My only gripe is with the character Johnny and how his story wraps up nicely at the end. It just tickles me because it reminded me that if you write a novel, you can have it end anyway you please, LOL.  Read the book and you'll find out.
