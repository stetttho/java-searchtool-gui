 This book was actually very boring.  It's taken me forever to read it, and now that I am, I'm skipping over pages like it's nothing.  I have 130+ pages to go, and I doubt I'll make it through.  And I'm sick of the stereotypes.  Everything that happened in this book was too typical for me to take seriously.    Spare yourself this one.  Ms. Bowman's Dark Secret was a much easier read.
