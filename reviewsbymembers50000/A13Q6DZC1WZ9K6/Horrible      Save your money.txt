 This book was AWFUL compared to teh first!  The storyline was both predictable and ludicrous!    I am going to spoil the book b/c I really REALLY want you to consider this before you buy it: FOR SOMEONE TO REGRET CHEATING ON HER HUSBAND ONCE (SHE CHEATED ON BRICE IN TEH FIRST BOOK AND NOW CHRISTIAN IN THIS ONE) SHE CERTAINLY DID IT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN!  GIVE ME A BREAK!  SHE CHEATED ON HER HUSBAND AGAIN RIGHT AFTER HE FOUND OUT!  AND THEN HE TOOK HER BACK AT THE END.  I GUESS LIFE REALLY IS HAPPILY EVER AFTER!  And Mia falling for someone who BEAT her tail within an INCH of her life made this book worse!    Ugh, this book was pathetic.  I was really anxious to read this b/c I surprisingly LIKED The Ties That Bond. In that book, things made more sense.  And I'm upset that Ms. Parks allowed Brice cheating w/Mia to cause Kree to stand up for herself.  This book was awful and will be going on my half.com inventory list!    UGH!!
