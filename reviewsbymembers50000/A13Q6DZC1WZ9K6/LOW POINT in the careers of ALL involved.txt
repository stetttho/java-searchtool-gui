 Now, I will admit.  I did go see it when it first came out, but this movie is a pure joke.  Not a horror film and not a comedy either. Murphy looked ridiculous w/all that stuff on.  Angela, Kadeem (who's acting is mediocre already), and Allen...you guys could do so much better. I don't think I can say much more.
