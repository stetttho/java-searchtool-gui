 First off, I wanted to see this when it was in theaters, but I never got around to it. I bought this movie from Hollywood Video a few weeks ago and I was very disappointed.  this movie was 1.highly unbelievable and 2.incredibly violent.    It took too long to get to the climax.  I saw a different ending from the one in the theaters, but i heard about what happened in that one.  All I want to say is that I'm glad I didn't b/c that is too violent, and I am sure I would have been offended to the utmost.  Save your money.  This tripe should have never made it.
