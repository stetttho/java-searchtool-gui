 Talk about too much hype.  The sample thing has been done before (did he go broke paying for all those beats??) so I wish people would stop acting like he's the 2nd Coming.  Also, I'm mad that the radio stations are playing his entire album.  No need to buy it, just grab a tape and record!  Oh and that whole, "I hate college stuff" is really annoying and it only back up Bill Cosby's rant.  Sure, Kanye is not responsible for kids educating themselves, but he could show a little responsibility.  He may not have liked it, it is definitely not for all, but why does he add such a negative connotation to it? Young kids are so impressionable these days.  "College was not for me" is a FAR cry from " College sucks!"  He's not that hot. And if I hear him featured on ONE more person's track, I will SCREAM!!! Yo "Music Biz" stop shoving these people down our throats!!!  We're choking!!!
