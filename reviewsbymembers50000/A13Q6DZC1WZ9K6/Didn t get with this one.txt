 I give this book 3 stars b/c it kept me interested---for a while, but this is just not my type of book.  I was in either middle or high school when I read this, and this was the book that everyone was talking about. I just can't get with stories like this.  I prefer more cleverly written stories than this one.  It is an interesting read though. Halfway through I started skipping around and then was confused at the end.  I just couldn't completely enjoy this book.   You might like it.
