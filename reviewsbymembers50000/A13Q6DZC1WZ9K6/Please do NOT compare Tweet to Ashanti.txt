 Because it's not TRUE!!!  I love Tweet. I have her first album, and it has been one of my regulars since it's release.  I love her voice.  It is very smooth and she never over does it.  She has the right amount of riffs--just enough to keep you guessing. I have been anxiously awaiting this release and I am MORE than pleased.  This album is very consistent with Southern Hummingbird.  Tweet is a true artist who writes her own lyrics and plays a key part in production. Gotta love that.   Favorite Tracks include 1. Intro/It's Me Again  2. Turn Da Lights Off 3. Iceberg 4. Could It Be  5. You 6. Cab Ride 7. Things I Don't Mean  8. My Man 9. Sports, Sex & Food  10. Small Change 11. Two of Us  12. Where Do We Go From Here  13. Steer  14. I'm Done  15. Bonus: We Don't Need No Water      LOL, I just listed all of them. Cab Ride is AWESOME--the sample from Taxi just flows like you've never heard before. The entire cd is great. Well worth the money.  I really hope this go around she gets her due, b/c she deserves it.
