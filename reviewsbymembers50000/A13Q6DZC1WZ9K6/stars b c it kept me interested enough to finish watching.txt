 I thought this movie reeked!  Angela, you can do so much better!!  Probably the best AA actress today.   Anyway, this movie was terrible to me.  I couldn't figure out she hooked up w/the white man.  What was the point?  A lot of loose ends.  And why do most movies about interracial relationships have to end w/somebody dying? See it on Showtime or HBO--whichever it is.  Don't buy it.
