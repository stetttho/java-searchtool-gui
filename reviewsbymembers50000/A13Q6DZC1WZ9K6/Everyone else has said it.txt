 But I truly enjoyed watching this movie on HBO when it first premiered a few years back. I love stories about unlikely heroes.  This movie is excellent, and while I'm not sure if it is 100% historically accurate, it did prompt me (an extremely casual baseball fan) to do my own research on these two legends.    Enjoy!
