 Now, I am a HUGE skeptic of any other Tempts aside from the Hall of Fame Six, but I will say that Legacy is an awesome cd. My favorite tracks are Stay Together, Something Special, 50/50 Love is ok, All the Wrong People, and Baby It's Me.  G.C. is a great addition to the group.  His raspiness is what was lacking with Bo.  I went to see them perform in August and he stole the show.  Terry is good also.  Joe is another great addition.  I think this is my fav "new-Tempt" lineup.  I was actually able to deal with Ron, lol.  My only gripe is that some of the songs could have been produced a little bit better. And I don't really like how they have these older men singing lyrics meant for artists my age.  I wish they would keep them in their age bracket. It kind of makes it laughable.  Other than that...I listen to this everyday!  Enjoy!
