 I, too, like a much earlier poster read the book A Night To Remember.  This was a truly touching book.  It broke down the entire tragedy.  I found it particularly sad that the band kept playing, trying to keep the people calm.  I think what did it was the ship being "unsinkable even by God."  Don't test the Master!!   I also saw a movie w/Clifton Webb from the 50s.  Far superior to Titanic.  I think Titanic's biggest problem was that the love story dominated the ENTIRE THREE HOURS!!  That is just too long.  My first time seeing it was at a sleepover and I fell asleep. I just didn't feel up to watching the second tape.  We all went to sleep and woke up the next morning and finished it. I am not down for overly sappy stories.  Especially when it's fiction added to tragedy.  I don't think the actual tragedy was held high enough in this flick.   My fellow reviewers have done a good job of getting the point across already.  If you want to see a real Titanic story, see teh Clifton Webb version.  You won't be disappointed.
