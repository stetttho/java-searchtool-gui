 I've seen maybe 40 minutes of To Kill A Mockingbird, and those 40 minutes were WAY better than the 2+ hours needed to view this film.  This movie basically glorifies revenge killing.  That's it in a nutshell.  And the "insanity" plea is so hard to get a jury to believe (ask all the women who kill their children), so you know this is straight Hollywood.
