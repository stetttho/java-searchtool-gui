 I read these books about a month ago, and they were good.  It was nice to see the Cinderella story of the Primettes turned Supremes although I am not a huge fan of girl groups.  I enjoyed Dreamgirls way more than the second book though.   I liked that she mentioned her humongous crush on my favorite Temptation, Eddie James.  Also that he was one of the first people to visit Flo when she fell on hard times.  It's nice to have others say nice things after you when you are long gone Now about Flo, that was such a sad situation.  I can only imagine what it was like for her to bring Diana into the group and slowly watch her push herself to the front---and then have BG push her along. I applaud her for standing up to them, but I am sorry that it didn't work in her favor.  It seemed like Mary was too passive in the situation though.  If she and Flo had stood up to BG, things might have been different.  Flo had so many fans.  the parts about her are incredibly sad.   People say that Flo died of a heart attack as well as a broken heart and I am really inclined to agree.   All in all, a good book.  I recommend this one.
