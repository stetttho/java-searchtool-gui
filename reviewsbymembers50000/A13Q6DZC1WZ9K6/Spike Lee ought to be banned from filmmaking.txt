 This is one of the absolute worst movies I have ever seen.  Spike Lee is not a brilliant filmmaker.  He clearly has racist views that he feels the need to display on film.  Jungle Fever is the story of a black man who has an affair with an Italian woman.  When their affair is found out, everyone is up in arms.  The woman is accused of stealing the Black Man.  Black women sit around dissing her when Flipper's (Snipes) wife needs to be questioning her husband.  Last I checked, the ring was on Flipper's finger.  The very idea that these women can sit around dogging white people and it be deemed ok is deplorable to me.  As a young black female, I was disgusted at this image.  Queen Latifah's portrayal of that waitress was even worse.   This movie is disgusting and it is a very good example of irresponsible filmmaking.  This does not promote racial unity or racial tolerance.   Avoid it at all cost.
