 it's just too hard to try and listen.  "Confessions" is NOT Usher's best cd.  My Way and 8701 are supreme compared to this.  From that awful "Yeah" to all the other songs being played on the radio.  It's quite sickening, and the overplay just highlights how average this cd is. Also, I don't care if they deny it, I don't believe that this cd is completely separate from Usher and Chili's relationship.  Uh Uh.  Can't fool me.  And this makes the cd very unlistenable.  Who wants to hear about their ins and outs?  Not me!!! Very average cd.  Usher has a nice voice, but he needs to dig a little deeper next time.
