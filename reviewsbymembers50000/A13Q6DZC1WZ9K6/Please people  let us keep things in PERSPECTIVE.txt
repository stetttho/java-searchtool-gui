 While this is definitely NOT one of Mariah's greatest (I am somewhat let down by this one), LET US NOT PRETEND THAT SHE WAS NOT IN THE GAME LONG BEFORE BEYONCE!!!  NOTHING IS ORIGINAL ABOUT BEYONCE.  PLEASE LET US ALL ACCEPT THAT.  While I am disappointed that Mariah thinks she has to be like Beyonce, Mariah should remember that her legacy and string of bonafied HITS is much longer than Ms. Knowles'.    This cd is OK, but for classic Mariah? Check out something before Butterfly.  Oh, and to the reviewer who said Mariah copied Beyonce's skin color?  Please, reread what you wrote, and think about it....just a suggestion.
