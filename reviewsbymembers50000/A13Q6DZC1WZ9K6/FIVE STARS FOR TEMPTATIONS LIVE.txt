 I'm a very young Temptations fan (19 yrs old), but let me tell you, if I was alive back then, I would have been FRONT ROW at the Roostertail!!  This is a wonderful cd!  Can I just say I love Eddie Kendrick!!  His vocals are crystal clear--just listen to "What Love has Joined Together", the opening medley, etc.  And Paul Williams just SHINES on "I Want a Love I Can See" and "Don't Look Back".  I would love to have had him sing DLB to me!!!  And David Ruffin---the man was a master at his craft.  The only thing better would have been a video!!!  I would be first in line for that!! This lineup of Tempts was the best and no other lineup will ever be close to the Classics!!  Classic Tempts forever!!
