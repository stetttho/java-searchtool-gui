 Nothing about this movie was interesting.  To write a long review would almost imply that I was interested enough to pay attention to detail.  The football scenes didn't even make it interesting.  All I learned from this movie was it's ok to lie to my folks and sulk through my sister's special day b/c I couldn't make a match.    Too predictable for more words than this.  If you are in teh mood for a crapfest, watch this.
