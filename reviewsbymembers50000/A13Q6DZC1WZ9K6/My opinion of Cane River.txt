 I do not know why, but I could not really get into this book.  I usually enjoy narratives such as this, but I just could not enjoy it to the fullest.  I think it took me almost a week to finish it (I read Alex Haley's Queen in a matter of hours!).   My recommendation is read it, and draw your own conclusions.  I am not sure if this is Ms. Tademy's first book or not, but if it is, I'm sure her 2nd try will be better :-)
