 Before I STARTED READING these reviews, I noticed the very visible and VERY RARE announcement of how restrictions have not been placed on the reviews of this book.  Now, I've reviewed books myself and NOT had the reviews posted and I didn't find them to be bad (my reviews were based on the content of the book)! And now I get here and have to weed thru 1,900+ "reviews" most of which have nothing to do with the book!  I am a college student has spent several hundred of her hard earned dollars on Amazon for both educational and entertainment purposes. I have also turned many people on to Amazon. I agree with all those who are in protest of this.  Suffice it to say, Amazon has taken a stance that is extremely bogus and after I receive a book I ordered (before reading this hypocitical policy) I will be terminating my Amazon account.  I shall not make a seller suffer b/c of the owner of this site. Amazon should be ashamed b/c it is clear that many are giving the book a 5 to assist in countering the 1 star reviews.  This should not be allowed b/c it gives a contrived "average review" of the book in question. It is WAY too easy to post anything on this site.  This book should have NOT been singled out.    If Amazon would do this for all of their political books then that would be a different story  By the way, I am 21 and this is my first election, and I am neither a Rep or a Dem, but it is MORE than clear who Amazon wants me to vote for.  I'll pass.   Gee, so many choices: Barnes&Noble, Borders, Karibou books, Booksamillion, The Shop Around the Corner...
