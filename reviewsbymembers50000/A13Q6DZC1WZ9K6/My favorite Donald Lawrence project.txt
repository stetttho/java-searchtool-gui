 I echo the viewer that says this is for any age.  This is a perfect cd for a Tiny Tots Sunday school class!  Every song has a Bible passage attached to it and each song is anointed to the fullest!   Best Tracks:   2. Stranger   4. A Message For The Saints   6. Come Lay Your Head On Me     8. Oh Peter  10. Great Things   11. When Sunday Comes with Darryl Coley: BEST TRACK ON THE ALBUM!!!    12. Didn't It Rain
