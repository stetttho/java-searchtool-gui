 I have an earlier version of this product. (It is, in fact, all green) Since I have numerous pets, it is a life-saver for cleaning up the inevitable little carpet messes. However, mine leaks also and I must take care to leave it on linoleum after using - until it has finished making its puddle on the floor and dries up. I have no experience with similar products on the market, but think that when this one finally breaks, I will buy some sort of replacement from another manufacturer.
