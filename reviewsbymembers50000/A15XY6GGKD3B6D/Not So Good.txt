 My experiences reading Tanith Lee have been rather hit-or-miss, and I'm afraid I would have to classify THE CLAIDI JOURNALS as a miss. It is very hard to care about what happens to the diffident Claidi on her journey through the strange world of hers. I wouldn't mind a moody teenager as a narrator if she was a more descriptive moody teenager, who let us into her mind and heart.
