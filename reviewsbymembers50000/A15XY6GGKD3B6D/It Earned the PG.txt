 REVENGE OF THE SITH makes me ask again and again "WHY?".   Why, George Lucas, did you waste the prodigious talent of Natalie Portman who only has a few scenes in this movie, crying like the heroine of a Lifetime movie of the week? Why did you use the execrable Hayden Christiansen, who has less acting ability than your average cabbage? And why did you make Darth Vader's reveal so funny? (I'm sure the dramatic resemblance to Frankenstein occurred to more viewers than me.) And why did you make such a super-duper CGI action movie so violent that I would honestly not recommend anyone take their Star-Wars-crazed kids to see it?  P.S.-Anakin, for the love of all that's holy, WASH YOUR HAIR!
