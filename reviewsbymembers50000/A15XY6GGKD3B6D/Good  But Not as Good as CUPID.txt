 THE FAMOUS STANLEY KIDNAPPING CASE finds the same characters from Snyder's classic THE HEADLESS CUPID in Italy. Molly has inherited a little money from an uncle and they decide to spend the year in Italy so she can explore art. The story is told from the children's point of view, mainly David's. Tesser, Blair and Janey act exactly as before, almost stereotypically so. However, there is no recurrence of the spooky happenings from Blair that made CUPID so wonderful. Amanda has reverted to teenage surliness after her about-face at the end of CUPID and is (again stereotypically) a real pain about the move she doesn't want to make.   The kidnapping takes place after Amanda brags that her father is a rich movie-maker in California to impress the Italian kids in school. Instead of just Amanda, the kidnappers end up with all five Stanley children and find it is much more than they can handle. The children finally free themselves mostly by frustrating the kidnappers to no end. An enjoyable read, but not as good or memorable as THE HEADLESS CUPID.
