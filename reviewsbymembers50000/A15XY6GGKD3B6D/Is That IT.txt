 Mary Lawson is a very good writer. I was instantly drawn in by her prose and could feel why the main character, Kate, was so emotionally withdrawn; myself the product of such an austere, WASPy upbringing. I kept reading impatiently to find out what exactly was the big tragedy that befell her beloved brother Matt so many years ago. Only to find myself exclaiming aloud "THAT'S IT??!!" What a big disappointment! I feel gypped, like the author has violated the unwritten contract between author and reader.
