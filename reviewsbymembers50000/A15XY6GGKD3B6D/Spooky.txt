 Amy Poloski and her parents have been living with her aunt in a small California town ever since Amy's father broke his back. Since it is 1938, there is almost no possibility of Daniel Poloski getting a job with his disability, so they must live off charity in this small town full of gossipy, nosy neighbors.  Amy knows how to handle herself in town and at school; how to act and what to say to fit in. But one day there is a new boy at school, Jason Fitzmaurice, who does not and seems doomed never to learn. At first Amy thinks he is crazy, then feels sorry for him when the school bully repeatedly beats him up. By surreptitious means, Amy helps foil Jason's attackers and inadvertently makes a friend.  Jason is not scared of the abandoned shack in Stone Hollow where several people have died, and everyone in town is sure is haunted. Jason drags Amy up to the hollow, where they find a megalithic stone in a grotto. Jason says the stone is a focus of some mysterious power, and he claims to see Indians and the people who once lived in Stone Hollow. Is he telling the truth, or is he crazy as Amy first thought?
