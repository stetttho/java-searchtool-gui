 I never like the invidious comparisons between novels and the movies made from them, but in this case, it is hard to escape. This movie version of Isabel Allende's mesmerizing novel of the same name contains most of the same plot elements, but is sadly lacking in soul and resonance. A stellar cast and sweeping South American scenery still could not make this film more than a sub-par period piece. A pity.
