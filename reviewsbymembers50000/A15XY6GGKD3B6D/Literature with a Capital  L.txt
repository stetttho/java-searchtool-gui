 It should be shouted from all the rooftops in the land that A.S. Byatt is an author of true insight and genius. She manages to create the present, the past, and the all the characters therein AND their poems and letters, each with a distinctive voice. Sure, the plot seems to stop dead at points where pages of someone's epic poem are inserted, but read them, they are SO worth it! (And they provide powerful insight into the character's mind and prowess as an author.)
