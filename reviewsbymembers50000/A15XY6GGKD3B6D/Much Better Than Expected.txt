 I would not have picked this movie because I generally don't like Adam Sandler's juvenile humor. My husband rented it and I found myself watching with interest until the very end. Drew Barrymore exudes beauty and charm, Adam Sandler comes across as an above average guy-next-door any woman can fall in love with. There are some gross walrus vomit bits, and some juvenile sex talk from Rob Schneider's character, but overall a charming love story.
