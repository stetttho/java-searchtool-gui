 My mother gave me this book when I began to quilt. It gives great basic instructions on overall quilt making, from design to completion. There is even a section on the criterion by which quilts are judged at shows. Except for the classic pieced designs, this is incredibly dated now. (Some of the 70s-80s designs and colors featured look hideous and downright laughable.) Because this was written before the invention of the rotary cutter, the quilt piecing instructions are dated, too. But if you want good instructions on traditional pieced blocks and hand quilting, this is a good source. A well-loved favorite on my bookshelf.
