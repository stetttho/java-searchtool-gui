 Olivia Dunne, reeling from her mother's death during World War II in Denver, Colorado, takes rash and hasty actions with a soldier and finds herself pregnant. When's Livvy's minister father finds out, he ships her off to an arranged marriage to a bean farmer, Ray Singleton. Ray is a quiet, lonely man who loves Livvy almost immediately, for reasons the reader cannot fathom. Livvy is diffident and stand-offish, out of touch with her feelings, but eventually falls for Ray, also for inexplicable reasons. The dialogue is stilted and strained, so it is hard to suspend disbelief with this improbable romance. The author instead spends much of the novel's time on the improbable sub-plot of Livvy's friendship and eventual betrayal by two Nisei sisters from the nearby Japanese internment camp. I forced myself to finish this and would not go out of my way for any more of this author's works.
