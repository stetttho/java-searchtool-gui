 This is a romance for viewers who like complicated, deep characters. Every time I see this movie, I see another aspect about male-female relations I missed before. Hubble (Robert Redford) is the beautiful goyim boy Katie (Barbara Streisand) falls in love with. She lives entirely on the outside of her skin and is always pushing, pushing for the causes she believes in, if only to lack time in which to think about her own failings and insecurities. Everything for Katie is black and white, but no so for Hubble. He comes from the WASPy, privileged set, and is intelligent enough to see the hypocrisy and falseness of his peers. He also knows he would not fit in if he let on what is going on in his brain, so he holds back and goes with the flow, always doubting his ability to stand on his own. Not many authors could pull off a believable romance between two such disparate characters, but this movie does it admirably due in no small part to the acting abilities of Redford and Streisand who imbue every look and line with the desperate longing Hubble and Katie have to be together and to make this relationship work.
