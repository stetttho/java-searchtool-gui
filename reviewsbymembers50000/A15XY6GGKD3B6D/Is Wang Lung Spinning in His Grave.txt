 SONS is the sequel to the famous (and thanks to Oprah - newly popular) THE GOOD EARTH. The story begins just where the previous book left off, with Wang Lung a dying old man, hoping his sons will handle his legacy wisely. Of course, they do not.   The oldest son, Wang The Landlord, turns into fat, greedy man who sells off much of the land to pursue hedonistic pleasures. Wang the Merchant, the second son, sticks more to the letter of his father's wishes, but is an opportunistic skinflint who loves silver above all else. These two think always of their position in society and how to advance it, and care more about how they appear in others' eyes than the actual substance of their lives. Their children are spoiled and worthless, just as Wang Lung saw the old lord Hwang's sons become in THE GOOD EARTH. The reader gets the feeling Wang Lung would be disgusted.   The majority of the novel follows the wild, rebellious third son, who becomes known as Wang the Tiger. He ran away from home as a teenager to be a soldier, and this book finds him a young man planning to escape his master and establish his own dynasty in the north. With his trusted companions, Wang the Tiger fights his way to becoming the controlling warlord of a region in the north, and he finally falls in love with a fierce robber girl. (These scenes painted vivid pictures in my mind reminiscent of the movie Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.) Much to his bewilderment, the years go by and his life does not work out as he plans. He ends up with a son he does not understand, just as his father did not understand him.   Pearl S. Buck's plodding, biblical phrasing is not so easy for the modern reader, and I confess that while it was a good story, every page seemed like two or three, and I found myself groaning aloud "Isn't it over YET?"
