 Donna Cross does an admirable job of fleshing out the legend of POPE JOAN. In this tale the future pontiff is born in Frankland to a tyrannical English canon and his Saxon slave wife. Joan persuades her older brother to secretly teach her to read, starting a life-long love of scholarship. When the opportunity presents itself, Joan hides as a male to further her education, even forsaking the knight Gerold, the red-headed love of her life. Joan's tale, in keeping with the legend, can only end badly. A few of the plot elements stretch credulity, but overall this is a good read with bright, vibrant characters. I always love a tale where an oppressed woman breaks away from the system and realizes her full potential.
