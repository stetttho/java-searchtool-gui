 I recently saw the movie version of this, which prompted me to dig out the tattered and much-loved paperback of `A Wrinkle in Time' which I have kept since grade school. This is the story of Meg Murry, a misfit at school, her brilliant little brother, Charles Wallace, and Calvin O'Keefe, the unlikely star of the basketball team. These three meet an odd assortment of bedsheet-stealing old ladies, Mrs. Who, Mrs. Whatsit, and Mrs. Which. The ladies are not what they appear, and whisk the children away on a quest to find Meg and Charles' missing father on the far-away planet of Camazotz, where everyone is perfectly alike, to their detriment. L'Engle's deceptively simple prose evokes the warmth of love and the chill of fear with equal facility. If you have not read this, you are never too old.
