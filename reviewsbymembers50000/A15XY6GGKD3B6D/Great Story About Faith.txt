 I loved this movie, unlike my husband who thought it was a complete rip-off and waste of money. He is a sci-fi fan and wanted answers on where the alien invaders came from, what was their objective, how their technology worked, why the crop circles, etc. All very valid points, but I am still in love with this movie because I love character pieces. To me, this was an excellent character piece about a man who loses his faith and finds it again, and all the alien stuff was merely window dressing. You could have the same story of a minister losing his faith anywhere and I would still love it, but the alien invasion does gives the story extra zing.
