 Lucifer, aka Satan, is the first person narrator of this deliciously witty tale. Old Scratch gets an offer from God to test-drive a mortal body for a month - the recently vacated corpse of writer Declan Gunn (an anagram of Glen Duncan-in case you didn't notice). After one month, if Satan decides to stay mortal, he may be eligible for re-admittance to heaven under the normal rules.   Glen Duncan's brilliant writing shows Satan as Legion, indeed, forever getting lost in digressions and asides, altering his own story to fit circumstances, lying to the reader, himself, and anyone else who will listen. It's like Satan as played by Eddie Izzard. (If you haven't seen him-check him out in the DVDs-hilarious) The story is rich with irony as Satan loses his head in the same hedonistic pursuits for which he has ridiculed humans, and increasingly falls prey to Declan's emotions. A story to read again and again - each time picking up something you missed before.
