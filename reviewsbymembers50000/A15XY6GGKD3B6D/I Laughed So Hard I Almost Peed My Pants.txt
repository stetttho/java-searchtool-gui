 Eddie Izard pokes fun at the entire history of Western Civilization in this seemingly stream-of-consciousness soliloquy. He is quite possibly the most hilarious person I have ever heard. If you are not up on history or take offense at people ridiculing religion; Beware - this is not the comedy for you.   I have sat here pondering, but there seem to be no good words to describe Eddie Izard. He is a self-proclaimed "executive transvestite", which means he is not weird and is into girls. I hate to tell you Eddie, but even if you wore nothing but feed-store clothes, you would be classified as weird by most of my southern-fried relatives and neighbors.
