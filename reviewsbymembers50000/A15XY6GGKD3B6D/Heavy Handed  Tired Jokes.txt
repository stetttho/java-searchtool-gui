 Of course, Steve Martin is a joy to watch in almost anything, and I was expecting a reprisal of his role in the wonderful PARENTHOOD. Sadly, this was not. I do not think he makes a believable football coach.  But most of all, I was bored to tears and a little disgusted by kids bratty behavior being the centerpiece of the jokes. If you come from a large family, or know someone who does, you know that discipline is the cornerstone of that many people living together. I find it incredibly hard to believe that a parent of so many offspring would calmly accept or condone any of their behavior. I wanted to spank all twelve of them (and the parents for letting them get away with it).
