 This book is Barbara Moss's memoir of growing up dirt poor, with an abusive alcoholic father and a co-dependent enabler mother in rural Alabama in the 60s and 70s. Reading this story is like watching a train wreck; the kids starved, the dad sold the Christmas presents for booze, Barbara's face was deformed - probably because of malnutrition.   Every time you think the depraved father cannot possibly do anything worse - He does. I wish Barbara had spent more time on how her life turned out after she was on her own and had plastic surgery. If you like stories of brutal poverty and abuse in the rural South, read the haunting THE THIRD LIFE OF GRANGE COPELAND by Alice Walker.
