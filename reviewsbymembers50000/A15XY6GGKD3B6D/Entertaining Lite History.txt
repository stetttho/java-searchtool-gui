 This book of Gregory's could be seen as a sequel to The Other Boleyn Girl, covering the time period after Henry VIII's death until Elizabeth's ascension to the throne. I like this book better that TOBG, because I am interested in the conversos of Spain and their journeys throughout Europe to find refuge. However, I fear that many of the fans of TOBG will not find this book as satisfying because Hannah Verde is not one of the "beautiful people" of court, even though as the Queen's fool, she is privy to an astonishing amount of information and action. Gregory again delivers a work in modern language about the sex, intrigue, and conflicting loyalties of the English court. A real page-turner, but serious history buffs probably need not bother, it would only frustrate them.
