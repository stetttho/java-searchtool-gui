 Robert J Sawyer again delivers a great story. The best kind of science fiction, the "What If?" In this novel he raises the question: What if the consciousness of everyone on Earth was suddenly twenty years in the future and everyone glimpsed their future lives for two minutes? The ramifications are staggering from a psychological perspective. Is everything pre-determined or do we have free will?   As in Sawyer's other novels, the characters discuss all the scientific theories and ramifications of this accident in great detail that frankly will go right over the head of some readers. (My friend found these parts mind-numbingly boring) Boring or not, I am really surprised at the extent and length of the griping other reviewers have done over the viability of the science. It's FICTION! This is not a textbook or instruction manual.
