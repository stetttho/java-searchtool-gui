 I was not familiar with this movie (it was released before I was born), but wanted to see it after reading THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL by Philippa Gregory. Gregory portrays Anne as the scheming seducer, but in this movie Anne and her sister Mary are both portrayed as the victims of Henry's lust and the rules of the society in which they live. I am not familiar with Bujold's work, but was impressed with such a young woman meeting Richard Burton on even ground, and even stealing the scene. As for Burton, I found it rather hard to believe him as Henry VIII, especially since the film-makers did not attempt to give him Henry's famous red-gold Tudor hair. It was hard to see him as anything other than "The" Richard Burton. All in all, a good re-telling of the story of Anne and Henry, not just your average costume drama.
