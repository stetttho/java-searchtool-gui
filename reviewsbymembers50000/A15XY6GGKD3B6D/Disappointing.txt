 The original Matrix should have been left as a classic, stand-alone movie. Is there any effective follow-up to a messiah tale? (I know Frank Herbert fans would argue vehemently against me.) But Hollywood always wants to capitalize on commercial success and squeeze every dollar possible out of a concept. So many story arcs and sub plots started in the second movie are abruptly dropped or never pursued in this final installment of the trilogy. It is as if the movie makers suddenly said "Oh @$%, we gotta finish this movie - QUICK!" The plot shift is so drastic and unbelievable as to be almost comical.  My Advice: See and love the first Matrix, then never, ever watch the following two movies. You'll be happier.
