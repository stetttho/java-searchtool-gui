 The imminent release of the movie made me dig out my copy and re-read this novel. Chiyo is sold to a geisha house by her poor father after her mother's death. She is a maid at first, tormented by the evil geisha Hatsumomo, until she is taken under the wing of another geisha, Mameha. A subtle war ensues, as the young woman (now re-named Sayuri) and her mentor fight to rid themselves of the evil influence of Hatsumomo.   When they finally triumph, all the spirit seems to leave the book. The part about Sayuri's residence in the country during World War II was stilted, and the conclusion with the Chairman I found unbelievable. Overall, though, a fascinating look at the sub-culture of the geisha houses.
