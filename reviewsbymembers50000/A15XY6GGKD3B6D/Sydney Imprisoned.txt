 SHADOWED finds rookie SD-6 agent Sydney Bristow in her sophomore year of college. Sloan sends her on a mission with Noah and two new agents to recover KGB intel from a storage facility in Berlin. The mission is a success, but Sydney finds herself slapped into a SD-6 prison cell. To her utmost shock, Sydney is shown herself on surveillance video stealing sensitive information. It will take all of Sydney's cunning to spring the trap and exonerate herself.   A good entry in the Alias series, I would rank it as perhaps the second best story line of these books I have read. Good entertainment for Alias junkies, but would probably not appeal to those who are not already fans of the show.
