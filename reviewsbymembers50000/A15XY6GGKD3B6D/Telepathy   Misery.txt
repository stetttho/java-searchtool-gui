 This book opens with the death of Gail, beloved wife of mathematician Jeremy Bremen. (And no - it doesn't get any more cheerful.) The story of the two telepaths' too-perfect married life is told in a series of flashbacks interspaced with chapters of Jeremy's grief-stricken downward spiral, and a strange, omniscient voice who is observing their perfect love.   The series of ever more bizarre and violent events that befall Bremen as he slowly kills himself are reminiscent of Dante. The flashbacks are as much occupied with the mathematics of Jeremy's work as his life with Gail. (You can tell without looking at the copyright that this book was published in 1991-1992, because chaos theory was the big fad in mathematics then.) Although a lot of time is spent describing Gail, it never feels like she's a fully-realized person of her own - she's just "the wife", a shallow reflection of the protagonist's (or author's) desired mate.   If you like this book, I bet you'll like REFLEX and JUMPER by Steven Gould.
