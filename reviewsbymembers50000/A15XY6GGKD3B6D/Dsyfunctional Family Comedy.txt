 I?ll admit it, I love this movie and bought the DVD. It?s like Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, but this movie features a mother-daughter con artist duo. The two vixens part men from their money using a lot of savvy and cleavage, but things go wrong when they are conned by the mother?s old partner and the daughter falls in love with a local bar-owner who is interested in astronomy.
