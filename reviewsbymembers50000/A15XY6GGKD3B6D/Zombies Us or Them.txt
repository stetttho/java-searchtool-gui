 This clever British spoof on the zombie movie features the less-than-brilliant Shaun and his friends, all capitalist zombies working at McJobs, faced with the prospect of battling the undead. Guns being out in England, they use cricket bats, golf clubs, shovels, and in the two most memorable scenes of the movie; record albums and pool cues. I think it takes a particular black sense of humor to appreciate whacking zombies in time to Queen music, so if this does not sound funny, this movie is not for you.
