 This book answers the how, where and why questions of Sydney's recruitment into SD-6, so is great backstory for hard core Alias fans like myself. The writing was ok, but could be better, and would probably not be of any interest to those who are not fans of the TV series. I was disappointed that the book did not go into what is alluded to in later installments, that Sydney had know Arvin Sloan before this meeting.
