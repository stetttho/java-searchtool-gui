 Stewart Lee Allen's delightfully crisp prose makes a trip through the history of food a rare treat. In this compulsively readable book, he presents the religious and social origins of food taboos - many of which have been carried forward to modern societies all over the planet. I found his insights into the derivations of many popular words and phrases to be fascinating. However, his irreverent attitude may be seen as heretical by people of various religions, Christianity being the main focus of his humorous finger-pointing. If you are not thin-skinned about hearing less-than-angelic things about your religion's history, I think you will find this book fascinating.
