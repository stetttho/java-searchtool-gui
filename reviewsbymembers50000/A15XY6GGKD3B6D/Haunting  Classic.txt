 I first read this book in junior high school, and it has stayed with me ever since. I think of it often and dig out my tattered paperback to re-read it and always pick up something new.  This is the story of Margaret Redmond, who dies of asthma at the age of seventeen in the year 1900. She finds herself in a strange "heaven" where she meets Paul, a member of a large Chinese family who lives in a great compound. Paul's grandmother, the matriarch of the clan, has predicted that Margaret will destroy the compound. Margaret does not understand this, or anything else at first. She begins to remember other lives, one as an Indian slave, Zawumatec; another as a sailor's wife named Elizabeth; and finally the life in ancient Sumer, where she was a doomed prince named Tirigan. Margaret must confront the lessons learned in these lives and the curse and hatred that have clung to her throughout the centuries before she can find peace and learn who "Paul" really is. A moving tale of reincarnation and the power love and hate have in shaping our destinies.
