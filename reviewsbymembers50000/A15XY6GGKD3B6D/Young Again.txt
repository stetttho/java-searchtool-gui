 In 1988, Jeff Winston was a 43-year old radio station news director who died of a heart attack. To his amazement, he wakes up in his eighteen-year-old body in his college dorm. It is 1963 again, and Jeff is young and full of memories of the events of the next 25 years, like who won the World Series. Jeff lives a very different life the second time around, financially secure and health-conscious. However, he dies at 43 again.   And Again. And Again.   In one of his many "replays" Jeff meets Pamela Phillips, who is also repeating the years between 1963 and 1988 multiple times. Together they find love and try to change the future world they remember. Jeff and Pamela's journey to enlightenment reminds us of the joy in simple things and the beauty of life.   The concept is fascinating, but the writing seems alternately stilted or excessively descriptive of mechanical processes which do not enlighten us about the characters, merely their movements. Jeff's ambitions seem like puerile misogynist male fantasies at times, but the book kept me turning pages to find out what ultimately happens to him.    If you love the Jeff character, I think you will like JUMPER and REFLEX by Steven Gould, the adventures of a young man who discovers that he is telekinetic and what he does with this ability.
