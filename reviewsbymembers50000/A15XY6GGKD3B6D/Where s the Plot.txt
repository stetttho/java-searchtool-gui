 The protagonist of this tale is Raphael Taylor, the perfect golden boy and product of a charmed childhood. After his father's death, Rafe stays at home for a couple of years and attends junior college to appease his clingy mother before going off to university. There he meets his bizarre roommate, J.D. Flood, aka Damon, the dissolute scion of a wealthy Grosse Pointe family.   Damon leads Raphael into debauchery with an older woman, the end result being that a drunken Rafe crashes his car into an oncoming train. As a result of the wreck the former football hero loses his left leg and is emasculated. All this happens in the first couple of chapters. The rest of the book is taken up with Rafe's recovery and rehabilitation, full of frequent rants about social services and their corrupting programs. Rafe is settling into his new life, mainly watching the antics of his poor neighbors, whom he christens "The Losers" when Damon comes breezing back into his life again.   I kept waiting for something to happen, but the whole plot (such as it is) is not revealed until the last chapter, as a reminiscence after one of the main characters is dead. Would not recommend this unless you want to reinforce your negative beliefs about social workers, WIC, AFDC, food stamps, and the people who use and administer these services.
