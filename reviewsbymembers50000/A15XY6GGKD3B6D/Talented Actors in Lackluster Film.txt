 I'm still wondering how so many talented actors got suckered into doing such a turkey of a movie. After watching the deleted scenes, I think they would have rounded out the characters more and made them more believable. But the science, puh-leeze! What a joke! (And not a funny joke) I'm glad this was a rental and I did not pay a hefty admission fee to see this.
