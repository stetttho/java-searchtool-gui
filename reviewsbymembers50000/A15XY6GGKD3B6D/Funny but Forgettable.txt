 Adam Sandler plays Paul Crewe, a washed-out, drunk NFL has-been, who is sent to prison for spectacularly wrecking his girlfriend's Bentley and an absurd number of cop cars. There he encounters the football-crazy warden (James Cromwell) who forces him to play a game that pits the cons against the sadistic guards. Chris Rock plays the comic sidekick to Sandler's sarcastic straight man, and the movie is full of faces football fans will recognize. The ending is predictable, even if you haven't seen the original. Like most of Sandler's movies, The Longest Yard will make you laugh, gross you out at some point, but will be forgotten as quickly as the popcorn you ate while watching it.
