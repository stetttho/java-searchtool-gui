 Thomas Windom's only sin was being born an illegal child in this Malthusian nightmare set in the not-too-distant future of an overpopulated Earth. Tommy is thrown into a brutal work camp with other illegal children, a place filled with unspeakable brutality and the aching sweetness of first love. He inevitably turns to studying the system which has enslaved him and discovers the key to the prophecy made by the all-knowing computer, Mac III, which runs this frighteningly believable world. The ideas and images remain with you long after the book is over. Unforgettable.
