 While I will freely admit that this film is almost nothing like the book, I still love it. I'm afraid the book doesn't translate well to the modern reader, so most would feel as I did - that they want to throw the book out the window. What Michael Mann has given us instead is a grand, romantic adventure set during the French and Indian Wars. Two brothers, one white and one the son of the last Chief of the Mohicans, fight to save the women they love. Great cinematography, stunning soundtrack, can't say enough good things about it. Dialogue that would sound cheesy from anyone else rolls eloquently and believably out of Daniel Day Lewis and Madeline Stowe's mouths.
