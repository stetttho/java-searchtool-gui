 Frank Abagnale admits he is (was) a con man and a swindler. In this memoir, he recounts his teenage years spent as a con artist. Frank had brass you-know-whats to even attempt, much less succeed, at some of the capers he pulled off. He traveled the world, seduced beautiful women and wrote thousands of forged checks, usually while impersonating a Pan Am airline pilot. He did short stints impersonating a doctor, a professor, a writer, and a lawyer, among others. (I was especially impressed that the high school dropout studied for and passed the Louisiana bar exam in nine weeks.)   I was delighted when I ran across several copies of this book in my local used bookstore. (This is no doubt due to the popularity of the movie.) It is impossible to put down, a fast, high energy read that gives the reader the vicarious thrill of pulling off the perfect crimes. I was glad that Frank also included a description of his first few stays in prison - Yikes! I am watching my Ps & Qs the next time I'm in France!
