 In JUMPER, sixteen-year-old Davy Rice learns that he can teleport during a beating episode with his drunken, abusive father. He does all the things one would expect a callow teen to do with this ability: run away to New York City, rob a bank for money, get revenge on his father and other abusers, pick up girls, hang out back at his old high school and try to impress former acquaintances. (... well, maybe not that.) The premise is interesting, but I couldn't help but feeling that this book fell into the trap that is the downfall of so many science fiction novels, namely that the author spends too much time on the "gee-whiz, neato" concept, and not enough time on character development. I could never get a clear mental picture of Davy, and all the other characters, such as his drunk father, seemed like the barest of stereotypes.
