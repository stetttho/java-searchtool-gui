 This entry in the Dirk Pitt series starts out with an exciting prologue, the story of a harrowing shipwreck off the coast of New Zealand, whose survivors found a mysterious diamond empire. Dirk Pitt stumbles into their web when investigating mysterious deaths at sea. The author gives away the who, what and why a little under halfway through the book, a mistake in my opinion, there was no incentive to read further.
