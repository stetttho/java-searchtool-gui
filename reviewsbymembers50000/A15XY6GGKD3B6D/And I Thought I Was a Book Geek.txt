 Lucas Corso, the protagonist of this mystery, is an ethically flexible dealer in rare books. He takes an assignment to validate the authenticity of a satanic book which leads him all over Europe. Plenty of twists, turns, red herrings and action.  Not at all like the movie The Ninth Gate, starring Johnny Depp (which is pretty darn good by itself). I need to re-read THE THREE MUSKETEERS. (Why was it called The Three Musketeers when there were actually four of them?)
