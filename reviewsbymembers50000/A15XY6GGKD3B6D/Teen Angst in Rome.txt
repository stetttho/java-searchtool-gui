 Jeremy and Amanda Solter live and go to school in L.A., but they spend their summers working with their parents in an alternate timeline, one where the Roman Empire never fell. When a medical emergency calls their parents away, the teens are suddenly on their own. Then the transmissions from home stop and an invading army is at the city gates.   Predictable plot aimed at teens, only interesting aspect is the look at how Romans lived day-to-day compared to modern society.
