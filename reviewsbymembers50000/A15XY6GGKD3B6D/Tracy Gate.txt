 In 1992, America is torn apart with the political wrangling for the presidency, and so is Winwood High School in New Jersey. In the center of all this adolescent angst and raging hormones is Jim McAllister, the social studies teacher who is the faculty advisor for the student body presidential election. Jim's life is falling apart... and everything points back to Tracy Flick, a pushy over-achiever. Two years ago, Tracy had an affair with her English teacher, Jim's poker buddy. When the resulting firing, disgrace, and divorce are over, the lonely ex-wife comes onto Jim.   On the miserable day of the school election, Jim has been thrown out of his house, and the friend he used to confide in is now working at a hardware store. So, when the opportunity comes, Jim impulsively throws away votes for Tracy, thereby throwing away his own teaching career. Tom Perrotta convincingly tells this tale from the points of view of each character involved in the sordid, blackly humorously tale. Couldn't put it down.
