 Fans of Bradley's masterwork, THE MISTS OF AVALON, will find little to recommend this retelling of another famous legend. FIREBRAND tells the story of the Trojan war from the viewpoint of Kassandra the shunned prophetess, who is nothing like the deep and resonant characters of King Arthur's realm. Bradley's interpretations of some of the supernatural events of the tale (either more divine or more prosaic than in the legend) are interesting, but hardly worth reading the whole long, at times very boring, tale.
