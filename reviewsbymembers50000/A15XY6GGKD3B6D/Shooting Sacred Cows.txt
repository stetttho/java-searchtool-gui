 I am really surprised by the immense popularity of this book because the author has the courage to challenge some popular beliefs: attending Head Start programs or parents reading to kids really doesn't make much difference in how they turn out academically; a swimming pool at your house is 100 times more likely to kill your child than having a handgun in the house; legalized abortion is the biggest contributor to lower crime rates in the 90s; teachers cheat; drug dealers do not make much money, etc. The author makes his arguments in language readily accessible to the layman. In fact, I'm sure many academics will see this book as having been "dumbed-down for the masses". I found it a thoroughly enjoyable, fast-paced read. My only regret is that the book did not have another ten chapters.
