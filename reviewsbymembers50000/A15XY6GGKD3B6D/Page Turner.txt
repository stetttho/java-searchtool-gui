 A different take on the story of Anne Boleyn, this novel is told by her overlooked sister, Mary, who was Henry VIII's mistress before he became besotted with Anne. Gregory uses modern language and expressions in her writing, so this novel does not drag a modern reader through a field of Thees and Thous, which IS more historically accurate, but frankly I am not interested in reading a novel that I have to translate. Lots of sexy court plotting and intrigue make this a page-turner perfect for beach reading or a rainy weekend, but I'm afraid serious history buffs will not appreciate the modern take on the story.
