 I (HEART) HUCKABEES is the bizarre tale of geeky environmentalist-poet Albert Markosvski and the executive from Huckabees (something like Wal-Mart) who is out to ruin his life. Albert is helped by a pair of existential detectives, who are attempting to spread their message despite the negative influence of a French woman who is their disgruntled former protge. Mark Walberg, Jason Schwartzman, Jude Law, Dustin Hoffman and Lily Tomlin spend a lot of time talking about the meaning, or lack thereof, of everything and zipping people into body bags or smacking each other in the face with large rubber balls. (I'm not making this up)  While it is very tempting to say this movie is complete crap, this would not be entirely true. All the actors give fine, spirited performances and were perfectly believable as their insane characters. It is the plot, however, which left me wondering what the writer(s) had been ingesting, and if perhaps some of it would make me enjoy this movie.
