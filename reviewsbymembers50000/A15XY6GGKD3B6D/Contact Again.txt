 This Sawyer book could have been the result of a writing contest. I have a mental image of him pulling two pieces of paper out of a bag, and he must write a novel about these two things. One paper says [Man unjustly accused of molesting his daughters] and the other says [Earth receives message from outer space]. I found the novel very enjoyable, a quick read, but not dumbed-down like a lot of fiction these days. I couldn't help but notice the similarities to Carl Sagan's CONTACT: a message from an extraterrestrial civilization with instructions for a machine to be built. In fact, this is the fourth or fifth Sawyer book I've read and I dimly recall him mentioning Sagan several times. I must agree with other reviewers that the characters were flat and cliched. Sitting here now the only character I can remember with any distinction is Cheetah, the artificial intelligence computer.
