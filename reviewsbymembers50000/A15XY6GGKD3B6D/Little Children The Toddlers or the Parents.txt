 Did you ever wake up one morning and wonder: What happened to the endless summer afternoon of my childhood? How did I end up here in suburbia, paying a mortgage and watching endless repeats of Thomas the Tank videos? This is what seems to have happened to the characters in this darkly comic novel.   Sarah, a feminist bi-sexual in college, marries an older man for financial security and finds herself stuck in the endless hell of playground snack-time with a demanding three-year-old. Todd, the handsome former frat boy, slipped easily enough through college and law school, but now cannot pass the bar exam. These two seem somehow personally offended that real life should encroach on their lives, and in a last ditch effort to avoid adult responsibility, they begin a love affair. (Perrotta does an excellent job of using their affair to allude to the story of MADAME BOVARY, the book that is read in Sarah's book club.)  Thrown in the mix is Larry, the angry former cop; Mary Ann, the uptight Martha Stewart clone; and Ronnie, the recently paroled pedophile whose presence brings the simmering summer heat to a fiery explosion. An excellent read whose pages are as easily and quickly consumed as the cute little goldfish crackers pictured on the front cover.
