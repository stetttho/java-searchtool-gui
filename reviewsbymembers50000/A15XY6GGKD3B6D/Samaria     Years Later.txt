 Jovah's Angel is the "sequel" to Archangel, with a believable evolution of Samarian society after 150 years. The citizens are more industrialized now, but nowhere near the technology level of their ancestors, whose knowledge has been lost throughout the centuries since Samaria's founding. The characters of Caleb the scientist, Alleya the reluctant Archangel replacement, and Delilah, the fallen and broken former Archangel, are all fully developed, and their stories are rich and compelling. Another great read from Sharon Shinn. Too bad she can't write them as fast as I can read them.
