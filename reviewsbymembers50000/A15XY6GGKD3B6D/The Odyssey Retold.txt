 Penelope, the devoted wife of Odysseus, stays at home weaving all during the Trojan War, then patiently and faithfully waits for her husband to come home to her and rescue her from the suitors who want his kingdom.   Not! Margaret Atwood gives us an irreverent, cheeky account from Penelope, eating asphodel in the afterlife, of a girl-bride who fought and schemed to keep the kingdom together while her husband was off chasing tail and treasure all over the Aegean. Atwood delivers another classic.
