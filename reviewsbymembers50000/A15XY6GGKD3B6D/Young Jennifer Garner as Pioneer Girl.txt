 I read and loved the Julie Garwood book, and did not expect the movie to live up to it. Good thing I prepared myself, because this adaptation is almost nothing like the book, except that it emphasizes the family relationship of Mary Rose and her unconventional brothers (which was my favorite part of the book anyway). I am a big Jennifer Garner fan as well, so I liked seeing her in something pre-Alias. I like this movie, but would not recommend it for fans of the book, as they will be disappointed.
