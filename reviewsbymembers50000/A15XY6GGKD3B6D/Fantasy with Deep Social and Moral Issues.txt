 This book overlaps the first book in the series, BELOW THE ROOT. It is told from the point of view of Teera, the Erdling child who was rescued by Neric and Raamo and taken to Green-sky. The book starts back at Teera's home in the caverns below "The Root" and shows how their society is marred by strife and hunger. The food allocation committee decides her pet lapan (something similar to a rabbit) must be killed and eaten for food. Teera, desperate to keep her pet, runs away from home and wanders down the endless corridors until she is hopelessly lost, then squeezes through an opening in the root into the forest above.     At first Teera is enchanted by the green forest and the abundance of food, but soon is full of homesickness. Just as she is about to give up hope, she is found by Raamo and Neric, novitiate Ol-zhaan priests from the cities of Green-sky high in the trees. Raamo can hear her telepathic cries for help, and also through telepathy (pensing) calms her enough for the trip up into the city of Orbora. There they place Teera in the care of Raamo's family, where she immediately forms a deep bond with Raamo's sister of the same age, Pomma.     Teera tries to keep the secret of her origins, but her hosts soon find out she is not a child from their city who fell, but was born and lived below the root. Raamo's fellow initiate, Genaa, learns that her father is not really dead, but was imprisoned below the root by the evil machinations of the secret society within the Ol-zhaan priests called the Greets-kel. When Genaa leads a party to the forest floor to make contact with the inhabitants of the caverns, chaos is let loose in Green-sky.
