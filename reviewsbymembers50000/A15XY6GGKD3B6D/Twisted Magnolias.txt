 This novel follows three modern Southern belles from junior high school to the University of Alabama. Sarina Summers is beautiful but deadly, a sociopath encouraged by her psychotic mother to fulfill the socially accepted pattern of Tri-Delt to wife - at any costs. Nicole Hicks lives across the street, Sarina's devoted follower, relegated to the role of "the pretty girl's friend". However, Nicole's slavish devotion turns twisted and obsessive after Sarina betrays her. Caught in the middle is Bitty Jack Carlson, a poor girl from the wrong side of the tracks whose life is ruined by Sarina's machinations. The story is a train wreck you cannot put down until the last page, a murderous conclusion at the Alabama Homecoming game.
