 I started to read this book in third grade and was prevented from finishing by the school librarian. Having finally found it again in my thirties, it is even better than I remembered. I love the riddles solved in dreams and the references to Transcendentalism that I would not have understood as a child. I especially liked Eddy's palindromes, a really believable character quirk. (For another great palindromist character, read The Poisonwood Bible.) Still captures my imagination, exploring a rambling Victorian house to find hidden treasures.
