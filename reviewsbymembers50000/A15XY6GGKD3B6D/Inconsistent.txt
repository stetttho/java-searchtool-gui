 This book has its truly good parts, but quite a bit of it is boring. A big disappointment after the previous books. It's almost as if the two main characters are now together and settled, so the author does not know what to do with them. (Why fairy tales say simply `They lived happily ever after' - What's more boring than two beautiful people gleefully changing diapers?)
