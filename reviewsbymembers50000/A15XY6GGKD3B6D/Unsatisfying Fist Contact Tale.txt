 Jake Holman and Gail Cutler head the expedition to colonize the new planet, Greentrees, with paying colonists from Earth. Among them are New Quakers, Cheyenne, a deposed Saudi royal family, Gail's rich eccentric family which includes the DeBeers, and assorted scientists of all stripes. They soon find that the planet is inhabited by kangaroo-like mammals, which they name "The Furs" who have been genetically engineered by another plant-like species, named "The Vines". The humans are captured and dragged all over the galaxy, caught in the crossfire of this species war.   Nancy Kress is the author of one of my top ten EVER favorite books, BEGGARS IN SPAIN (If you haven't read it - run and buy a copy!), so I wanted badly to like this book but just couldn't. I could barely force myself to finish it, and then the up-in-the-air ending made me throw my paperback across the room.
