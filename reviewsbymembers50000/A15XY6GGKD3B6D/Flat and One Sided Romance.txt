 I saw the movie long ago, and frankly, I thought the movie was better. There is an old axiom that romance stories by women end in happily-ever-after and romances by men end in death, and that holds true in this case. I found the romance cloying, flat and one-sided. Suspension of disbelief is one thing, but a virtuous 1896 woman sleeping with a man she's known one day is another. I know this book is the precursor that laid the foundation for all the modern time travel love stories, but I still couldn't like it.
