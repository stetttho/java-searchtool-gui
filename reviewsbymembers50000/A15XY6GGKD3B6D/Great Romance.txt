 The Awakening is my second-favorite Jude Devereaux novel (after The Princess). Smart, touching and very funny characters in a quasi-`The Taming of the Shrew' story. But Amanda Caulden is no shrew, just impossibly isolated and ignorant of the outside world. Leave it to a Montgomery man to shake up her world and wake her up. Great Reading.
