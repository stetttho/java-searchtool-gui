 I found this book in Perugia, when I was desperate for new reading material in English (besides the copy of Dan Brown's hideous ANGELS AND DEMONS someone left in our hotel). Had it not been for the dearth of reading material, I would have never finished this book. I thought at first it was a problem of translation from Spanish to Italian, then Italian to English, but that was not it. This book is written for young people, but seems to assume young people are terminally stupid. Would not recommend this, even if you are out of reading material. Read your guide book again.
