 Elizabeth Gilbert presents a mesmerizing, cheeky portrait of one of the most fascinating men in America today, Eustace Conway. I freely admit that Eustace, a man who lives (mostly) as if he were in the nineteenth century, and is on a mission to covert the rest of the nation, may not be fascinating by most people's standards.   But I was fascinated by the unflinching honestly with which Gilbert described his loves, values and skills, as well as his flaws and emotional crises. Eustace wants to change the world by teaching people how to live like their ancestors, but is ironically crippled by his dysfunctional family history. (He wants everyone to learn from history, but he cannot learn from his own.) What makes the most impression, however, is Eustace's incredible, manic DRIVE. This brilliant man could be a captain of industry, find a cure for cancer, or be the commanding general of an army, yet he lives in the woods and gives all his energy to living the natural life as diligently and perfectly as possible. Gilbert provides plenty of background information, but it is up to the reader to decide how they think Eustace became this driving force.
