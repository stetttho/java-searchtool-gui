 From the outside, they are a perfect, WASPy, upper-middle-class family. But look closer and you'll see the domineering father (James B Sikking) and the cold, superficial mother (Bebe Besch). Their three children are cracking under the pressure to live up to the parents' impossible standards. Jim Carrey gives a fabulous straight performance as the alcoholic son, William McNamara is the secretly gay son (Why is he not a huge star?), and Jayne Brook is the daughter who marries beneath the family's standards. If you liked Robert Redford's ORDINARY PEOPLE, you'll like this movie.
