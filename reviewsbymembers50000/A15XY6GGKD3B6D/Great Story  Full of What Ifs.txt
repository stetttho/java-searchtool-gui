 You will not enjoy this novel if you looking for a little light entertainment, an amusing bit of sci-fi fluff to pass the time. As you can guess from the title, CALCULATING GOD is filled with weightier matters. An alien lands on Earth and begins a series of investigations with a paleontologist from the Toronto Museum. Their discussions are satisfyingly deep and far ranging: paleontology, cosmology, biology, genetics, theology, evolution, faith, morality, friendship. The human scientist, Tom, is dying of terminal cancer, which lends extra weight to his introspection, and the alien, Hollus, is thoughtful, sensitive, and a lot more three-dimensional than many characters in fiction (expecially science fiction). A very satisfying read, which will have me pondering some of it imponderables for a long time to come.
