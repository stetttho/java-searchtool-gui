 I've seen these books everywhere, (That should have been my first clue - truly excellent books don't end up in the dollar resale bin) so I was looking forward to reading this when it turned up on my book club list. If you ever find out you have two weeks left to live, move to Mitford because every day is a freaking eternity! I would not have finished this incredibly boring, preachy, plotless book if it wasn't required reading for the book club. Needless to say, I'm not interested in the rest of the series. If you want to read about a bunch of lily-white, holier-than-thou, cutesy, unbelievable small-town folks (who must have some secret income somewhere, because their jobs and their lifestyles are completely incompatible), then this is the book for you. I thought it was one long snooze.
