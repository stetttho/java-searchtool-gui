 I was beginning to think Jude Devereaux didn't have a good, funny romances left in her. But ta-da, here is Temptation, a return to the "old" style of romance and humor I loved. Sharp, believable characters. Why can't she write more like this instead of the supernatural crap she's trying to put out nowadays?
