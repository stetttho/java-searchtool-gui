 This book covers practically the entire lives of its main characters, Henry and Clare. Henry suffers from "Chrono-Displacement Disorder", so from the age of five on, he jumps randomly back and forth in time. His jumps seem to center around a few locations or catastrophic emotional events. In a large number of jumps, he ends up in the meadow outside of Clare Abshire's house. So, Clare knows and loves an older Henry, whom she has known since she was six. But in Henry's timeline, he does not meet Clare until she is twenty. Confused? Sometimes it is, but also very compelling and hard to put down. If my husband had not forced me to go to bed, I would have read this in one sitting.
