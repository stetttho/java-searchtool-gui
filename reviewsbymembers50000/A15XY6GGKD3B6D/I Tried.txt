 I really, really tried to love this book. It hadn't hooked me by page 200 or so, so I don't think it ever would. I echo the sentiment of a previous reviewer that it is sad that Maude had her crown stolen by Stephen, and now her story as well. As far as I could tell, the story was more about Stephen, Geoffrey, and Maude's multitude of brothers. The subplots galore and the cast of thousands (with similar names) made the storyline very hard to follow, to say the least. When I caught myself grimacing at the thought of slogging through to the end, I gave it up.
