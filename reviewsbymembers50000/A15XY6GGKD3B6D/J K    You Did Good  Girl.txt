 This entry in the Harry Potter series kept me interested from beginning to end, and unlike book number five (which had numerous mistakes and contained 300-400 unnecessary pages in my opinion), this book appears to have had a competent editor. I was really mad at the ending, but then pleased that the author could manage to make me mad at a book - something which has not happened in a long time. Besides, it's not my story to tell. I am happy that she did not succumb to pressure from fans and tack on a Scooby Doo ending like those of the first few books (I would've come back to rule the world, too, if not for you meddling kids). Way to go Jo! I'm waiting expectantly to see how it all ends.
