 Priscilla "Hutch" Hutchins is a star pilot who is fed up with everything and ready to retire. She agrees to one last mission, ferrying a group of rich members of The Contact Society out to chase a mysterious signal that was picked up four years ago around a neutron star. To everyone's surprise, the signal leads to a series of discoveries of long-dead alien cultures and an unknown group who is monitoring them. The rules in McDevitt's universe are vastly different from what we are used to in other sci-fi tales; the amateur SETI hunters run around trampling and poking ruins, cutting through hatches, and instigating first contact with alien races, all without waiting for official back-up. McDevitt delivers plenty of action, danger and sweeping interstellar vistas, but little is ever learned about the ETs.   So why did I give it such a low rating? I kept thinking of the crew as "Gilligan's Island in Space"; there is the millionaire, the professor, the movie star, the funeral director, the artist, etc. A lot more character development, and much more diligent editing would have been in order (In one especially memorable scene, a character who died a gruesome death a couple of planets ago takes part in the conversation.) The POV shifts incessantly in the latter half of the novel, seemingly in an ill-advised attempt to fill out the characters. McDevitt uses the acceptable method of POV hand-off, but it still gets old really quickly. If you prefer action sequences, as I believe most sci-fi readers do, perhaps the razzle-dazzle will make up for these faults. But personally, I would have preferred more about the archaeology and the origins and motives of the aliens.   If you like tales of interstellar archaeology, try THE SHIP WHO SEARCHED by Anne McCaffrey.
