 I thought a glass of wine might help take the edge off of Julie Gregory's brutal autobiography of growing up as the victim of Munchausen by Proxy. It didn't.  Julie Gregory is incredibly brave to lay herself out for public scrutiny. I hope this tome will help raise awareness for this condition. This book is impossible to put down until the last gut-wrenching page.
