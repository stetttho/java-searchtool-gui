 Alias could be classified as a controlled substance. It is a spy drama, with soap opera and sci-fi-ish elements. The main character is Sydney Bristow, super hot spy chick for the SD-6 organization. Her fiance is killed in the first episode, and she finds out SD-6 is not really part of the CIA as she was led to believe. Vowing to take the organization down, Sydney goes to the real CIA and is put with handler Michael Vaughn as a double agent. Vaughn, with his cute, hangdog puppy eyes is obviously Sydney's next romantic attachment. Sydney soon finds that her father and her mother were both spies, as well, and everyone is trailing after artifacts from Milo Rambaldi, a 15th century cross between DaVinci and Nostradamus. Confusing? Yes, but a lot of fun to watch a really hot chick kick bad guys butts.
