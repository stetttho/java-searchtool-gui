 Menolly is the youngest daughter of the tyrranical Yanus, Holder of Half-Circle Sea Hold, and Mavi, his no-nonsense wife. Menolly is a gentle and sensitive girl who loves music above all else and is a brilliant composer. Her parents, especially her father, cannot understand this and only value inhabitants of the hold for how long and hard they work.   Menolly's only friend is Petiron, the hold's ancient harper, who makes Menolly his quasi-secret apprentice. After Petiron's death, Menolly's life goes from hard to unbearable and she runs away from home to live in a cave on the beach. As it turns out, this cave is also used by fire lizards, mythical kin to dragons, and Menolly manages to impress nine hatchlings.  Menolly's abuse and injustice at the hands of her martinet parents is gut-wrenching and keenly felt. This book is a favorite for teenagers, especially girls.
