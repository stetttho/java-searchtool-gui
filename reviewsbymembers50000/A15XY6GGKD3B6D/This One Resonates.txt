 I first read this book almost thirty years ago, and it still touches me just as deeply. This is the story of how the shy and chubby Martha, who feels that she cannot measure up to her superstar family, meets Ivy, the free-spirited, imaginative daughter of the town's most notorious family. Martha becomes Ivy's home and family, and Ivy brings Martha out of her shell and helps her to see her full potential. A story that is truly timeless and everyone can relate to - whether the reader is currently experiencing the painful awkwardness of childhood or simply remembering it. Everyone can remember how it feels to not fit in anywhere, and innocently do things that you are ridiculed and teased for. I think everyone knew a rich bitch in school, someone who was sweet as sugar to adults, but a little two-faced sneak to other kids. Too bad everyone couldn't have Martha's wonderful experience of having a friend like Ivy.
