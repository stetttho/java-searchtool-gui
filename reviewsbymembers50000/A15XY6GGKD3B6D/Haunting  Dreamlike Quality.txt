 This book is a perennial favorite, especially as my father is a Civil War buff, so I grew up hearing the facts and stories. I love it when the main character, Jeff, refuses a job studying the long-term effects of the Vietnam War because we haven't properly studied the long-term effects of the Civil War. Too true. And I agree with a previous reviewer that it has an incredible last line (However, I still think the last line of The Great Gatsby is the best ever.)
