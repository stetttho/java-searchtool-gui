 Jodi Picoult is my all-time favorite author. I get her e-mail newsletter (wonderful) and the owner of my local independent bookseller knows to keep a copy of her latest novel for me. So....I can't believe I'm saying this, but.....  I had to force myself to finish this novel. The only other book of hers that left me less-than-giddy was SONGS OF THE HUMPBACK WHALE, for which I made the excuse that it was her first novel. This book starts out well, but I was expecting more mother-daughter, father-daughter emotional interaction. Most of the middle is taken up with the father, Andrew, and his experiences behind bars. I thought his actions were out of character for the man previously described  (and I really hope that was not the actual recipe for meth he describes using cat litter, pie pans and moth balls - more than I want to know). The ending goes back to the story-telling I expected, with the Picoult twist at the end which keeps you thinking long after the novel is finished.   So, I'm sorry Jodi, but I really couldn't get into this one. I am waiting expectantly for THE TENTH CIRCLE.
