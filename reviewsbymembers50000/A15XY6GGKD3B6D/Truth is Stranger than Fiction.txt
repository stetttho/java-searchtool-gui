 John Krakauer again shows his prowess in telling the stories of people who are driven to extremes in UNDER THE BANNER OF HEAVEN. The book begins and ends with the analysis of the motives behind the murders of Brenda and Erica Lafferty in 1984. The murderers are Brenda's brothers-in-law, members of a Fundamentalist sect of the Mormon Church. Krakauer goes through the history of the church since its founding, showing the long history of violence, extremist sects, and charlatanism. A fascinating read that is no doubt very unpopular with members of the church.
