 TO YOUR SCATTERED BODIES GO is the first in Farmer's classic Riverworld Series. The protagonist is the swashbuckling Victorian hero, Sir Richard Francis Burton, who dies of old age in England, only to wake up naked and hairless on the shore of a great river, returned to age 25. Burton is not alone, because seemingly all of humanity has been resurrected in this place with alien constellations in the night sky. They soon come to the conclusion that someone or something has artificially resurrected them for some unknown purpose. Burton, Alice of ALICE IN WONDERLAND fame, a Neanderthal, and a science fiction writer battle against Herman Goring, grail slavers, etc in search of the source of the river and the solution to the mystery. An entertaining but ultimately dissatisfying novel because of little character development and no solution to the mystery of the planet.
