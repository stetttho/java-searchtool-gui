 Picoult displays her usual masterful prose in this deeply felt novel about the power of love. Jamie McDonald turns himself in to his cousin, Wheelock sheriff Cam McDonald, for the mercy killing of his terminally ill wife Maggie. Cam's wife Allie, the local florist, has never gotten over the fact that Cam was the golden boy in high school - while she was a nobody - and always feels she is not attractive or good enough for him. Picoult does the courtroom trial very well, but I was most fascinated by her exploration of Allie's low self esteem and her covetous obsession of Jamie's love for his dead wife.
