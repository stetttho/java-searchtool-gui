 Although I didn't like the main character, Emma, I was sucked into the story and kept turning pages to see if it was a ghost or a stalker. The mathematics I found very interesting (of course I would), the soccer scenes I did not. I thought the red herrings were good, but I'm afraid I must agree with previous reviewers that the characters are clichd. But none of this dissuaded me from finishing and going back to read certain parts again.
