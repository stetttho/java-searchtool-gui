 It's been quite a while since I've read Philip Jose Farmer's RiverWorld books, but I didn't think this movie was quite up to snuff. The premise is the same, the dead from all periods of history find themselves resurrected in RiverWorld. Gang fighting, Lord-of-the-Flies-type stuff ensues. My main attraction to the books was the protagonist, the dashing explorer Sir Richard Francis Burton. (Found the source of the Nile, first westerner into Muslim kingdoms, translated the Arabian Nights and the Kama Sutra, etc. He was the real-life version of the Victorian hero all those romance novelists try to recreate.) This movie has Brad Johnson playing an astronaut as the main character. Mark Twain is kept as a character, building Mississippi paddle wheelers to navigate the mighty river, but sadly John Lackland (Former King of England, Richard the LionHeart's brother - you know, the evil King John from the Robin Hood tales) has been changed to Nero, probably because the average TV viewer would say "John who?". Still, not a bad watch, could make an interesting series - the abrupt ending is obviously a set-up for a potential series.   If the concept interests you, I recommend reading the books instead. TO YOUR SCATTERED BODIES GO, THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT, THE DARK DESIGN, THE MAGIC LABYRINTH, and THE GODS OF RIVERWORLD, all by Philip Jose Farmer. And if you're a Sir Richard Francis Burton junkie, read THE DUCHESS by Jude Deveraux, a funny and delicious romance with a Richard Burton clone as the protagonist.
