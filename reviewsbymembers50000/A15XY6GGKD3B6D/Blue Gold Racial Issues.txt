 HEART OF GOLD is Sharon Shinn's very obvious attempt to make socio-political commentary about the racial clashes in our society. However, her book is set on some other world where blue people, "Indigos", are the bigots that hold all the cards, and the "Gulden", yellow-skinned people, are the downtrodden race exploited by them. There are also some Albino people who are only mentioned in passing. On the cover, this is marketed as a love story, so I was eager to read it because I loved her angel books and Jenna Starborn. However, this book started very slowly and I found it very hard to "get into it". It has Shinn's typically thorough character development (perhaps hurt a little bit by preachiness), but I never could make myself believe the love connection between Nolan and Kit.
