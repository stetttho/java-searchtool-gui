 Unlike Donati's previous novels in this series, it took me a while to get into this one. The characters made so many oblique references and inside jokes that could not be understood until you read farther into the story where they are explained. However, once hooked, I missed sleep to finish it. I was a little disappointed in the lack of details in Lily and Simon's romance. (Some of the wonderful wooing like that between Elizabeth and Nathaniel in the first book would have been more in order.) I also would have liked it if Hannah found peace, but it is not my story to tell, and I am satisfied with the cliff-hanger ending - eager for the next book.
