 This is a great love story that transcends the label of science fiction. Full of deep, believable characters, and plenty of teen angst from Jane. It is every teen's delusion that their parents are repressing them and keeping them from reaching their fullest potential, but in Jane's case it happens to be true. She finds a timeless love in the most unlikely place. My copy is a tattered favorite I first read over 20 years ago. I can't believe a new edition hasn't been published! Truly a classic love story.
