 In the 1820s, little Miss Rose Old Loveall is the sole heir of Love Hall, one of the richest estates in England. There is only one problem... Rose is a boy, whose adoptive father and mother raise as a girl for their own bizarre reasons. However strange this may sound, Rose is probably the most normal member of this family of psychopaths, cross-dressers and child molesters. This sounds like an exciting, titillating novel, but it is not. At one point Rose (the narrator) even tells us if we want that kind of book we should seek elsewhere. To be perfectly blunt, what other reason is there to read a book about confused gender identity than voyeurism and titillation?  Some books make you wish there was more of it. For MISFORTUNE, I kept hoping fervently for less. In my opinion, the plot does not progress until Rose finally runs away from her deranged family, at age 17 and approximately page 300. And the oh-so-perfect and improbable ending which neatly ties all the loose ends into a bow... Well, I'm sure it was meant to emulate the improbable endings of the Greek myths mentioned liberally throughout the book (That's another thing - if you're not familiar with Greek myths you may soon be lost), but all I could think was "Puh-leeze!".  For a much better read about a boy raised as a girl try Jeffrey Eugenides fabulous MIDDLESEX: A NOVEL.
