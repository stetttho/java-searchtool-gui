 It turns out that one of the most bizarre movies I have ever seen is also one of the most deliciously bizarre books I have ever read. Many times I found myself saying "What the..." aloud as the plot grew more and more bizarre. At the end of the book, I immediately turned back to page one and began reading again. If you're looking for something good and different to read - this is definitely it.
