 PAVANE is made up of six interconnected stories, all taking place in an alternate universe where Elizabeth I was assassinated and the Spanish Armada defeated the British navy, thereby paving the way for the Catholic Church to keep a stranglehold on Europe until the twentieth century.   All the stories take place in the gloomy region of Durnovaria, starting in the 1960s and stretching out over thirty years or so, recounting the events which lead up to the final revolt against the Catholic Church. A very interesting concept and well written, but dark and depressing, I had to force myself to finish.
