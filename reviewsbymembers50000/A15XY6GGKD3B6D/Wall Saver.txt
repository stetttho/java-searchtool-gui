 If you didn't know, cats have little oily scent glands on their "cheekbones" that they use to mark territory. Plus, most of them love to have their faces rubbed. I have one little tabby who was forever rubbing a corner in my hall - which resulted in a nasty blackened spot on the paint. This device is a god-send, and the little kitty perpetrator loves the brush. I watched her rubbing on it for almost fifteen minutes this morning.
