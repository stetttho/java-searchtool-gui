 This long (2:23) biography of Ayn Rand, founder of the Objectivist movement and rabid anti-collectivist, is filled with touching pictures of her as a little girl in Russia and as a young woman in Hollywood. Her faithful followers and friends, including Leonard Peikoff, Ayn's secretary and her various biographers are interviewed extensively. Also shown are excerpts from Ayn's television appearances, most notably two interviews with Phil Donohue, who seemed to adore her.   The obvious bias of the film and the reverent worshipful tones of narrator Sharon Gless are a little too much treacle to swallow without question - something Leonard Peikoff and her other acolytes seem to do wholeheartedly. The whole debacle with Nathaniel Branden was glossed over, with Ayn portrayed as a victim, not the immature virago her writings make her seem. (Read some of it, it sounds like a cult denouncing a former member.)  Frankly, I felt a little queasy watching this because Ms. Rand's books and philosophy made such an impact on me as a teen. (Ms. Rand's philosophies are perfect for teenagers, for whom everything is black-and-white, all-or-nothing.) Rather than make her seem a shining beacon (as I'm sure this film was intended), Ayn Rand ends up looking like the egocentric head of a creepy cult of personality.
