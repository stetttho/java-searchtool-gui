 After all the wonderful ads, I was really looking forward to this movie. I was disappointed to realize the ads showed the very best parts. Overall, I thought it was lacking in plot, and it centered around the father character, who was not in the least bit likable. The special effects were good, if a little dark and creepy like everything of Tim Burton's, but special effects cannot carry a bad story.
