 I was very much looking forward to reading a novel about Eleanor of Aquitaine, so I was more than a little disappointed that more than half of this novel was devoted to Ranulf, Henry II's Welsh uncle, and the subplots about Welsh political intrigue. Still, it was very well-written and engaging, with sharply defined characters. I did not want it to end so early in Eleanor's marriage to Henry. Oh well - I guess that's what the third book is for.
