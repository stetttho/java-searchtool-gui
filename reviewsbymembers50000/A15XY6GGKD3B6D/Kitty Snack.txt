 My cats love this treat. Unlike the typical grass that grows in your yard, you will not find your house full of green barf after your cat eats this. However, if your cat is like mine, it will pull the grass out of the pot, roots and all, which slings dirt around the house. I can't win. This treat is more than a little too pricy, in my opinion. You can have the same thing by going to your local feed-store and buying rye seeds to plant - super cheap.
