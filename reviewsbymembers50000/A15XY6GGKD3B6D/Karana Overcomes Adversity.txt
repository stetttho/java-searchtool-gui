 When her tribe is moved from their home island, Karana stays behind with her little brother. After he is killed, Karana faces 18 lonely years alone on the island. Based on a true story, it shows the courage to survive in the face of incredible odds and the strength of the human spirit. Karana is seen again in Scott O'Dell's book ZIA, where the lonely woman is reunited with her niece. Great reading at any age. One of my absolute favorites.
