 I love the romance of the old Arthurian legends. (Heck I even love Monty Python's The Holy Grail.)   But this revisionist history gore-fest was not for me. Bloody battle scene after bloody battle scene, this movie was obviously competing for the kind of audience garnered by the Lord of the Rings movies. I know life was cheap and bloody in the olden days, but this is not what I associate with King Arthur and Guinevere. If you like big, bloody battles, then you will probably love this movie and be able to overlook the plot holes, inconsistencies and absurdities.
