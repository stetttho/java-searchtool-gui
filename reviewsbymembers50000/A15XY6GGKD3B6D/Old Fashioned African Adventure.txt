 The infusion of wailing guitars of 70s rock monsters and the flashy action sequences are all that really separate this movie from the old black-and-white movies I would watch on rainy Sunday afternoons. Matthew McConaughey is buff, Steve Zahn is funny, Penelope Cruz is more than a pretty face, jam-packed with action scenes - all in all this movie was much more enjoyable than I thought it would be.
