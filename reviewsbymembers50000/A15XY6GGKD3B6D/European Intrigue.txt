 In this installment of the Alias series, rookie spy Sydney Bristow is undercover as the assistant of famous magician Trevor Raven. Works of art just happen to be stolen in the cities where the tour stops, so Sloan tasks Sydney to keep an eye on Raven's employee - and suspected villain - Victor Romero. Noah Hicks, Sydney's hunky on-again, off-again boyfriend is also on the mission, and the two of them get to spend a little time alone.   In my opinion, this is the best book of the Alias series. There is more fast-paced action and mission interactions between Sydney and Sloan, like an episode of the TV show. The mysterious Rimbaldi is also implicated in the works of art being stolen.
