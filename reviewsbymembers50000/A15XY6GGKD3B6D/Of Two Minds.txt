 I was expecting more from this novel after all the glowing reviews I read. Granted, it is not your usual romance and has characters more complex and satisfying that the usual cookie cutter "Rich, Handsome Aristocrat" and "Beautiful, Delicate Girl". Howver, I found the writing style hard to get into. The prose was choppy and did not flow. I hate in when I have to read a sentence over. So, it's a good story, but in my humble opinion, could be written much better.
