 Catherine da Costa has one dying wish: That her squabbling granddaughters Suzana and Francesca Abraham find the memoirs of their ancestor, Hannah Mendes. The spoiled young women care nothing about their Sephardic Jewish heritage or the history of the conversos in Spain, but learn much in their quest. The historical aspects of the book and Hannah's story are very interesting and compelling. But these girls finding too-perfect, hunky, rich Jewish doctors to marry in Europe... Puh-leeze! I wish this novel hadn't degenerated into a smarmy romance.
