 Nathan Price, a ?holy roller? Baptist preacher in the 1950s, drags his wife and four daughters off to the Belgian Congo to preach the gospel to the heathens. This book is written in the voices of the four daughters and the mother, which I thought were each distinct and believable. It is fascinating to see the exploration of faith, love, hate, ego, and bigotry as it is played out among the stranded Price women and the increasingly insane Nathan Price. Unlike the typical novel, which would have probably ended when the Price women finally left Nathan, this one continues on so that you find out what happened to the girls after they grew up. A thought-provoking lesson about African politics and culture and America?s ethnocentrism.
