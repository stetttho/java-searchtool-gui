 The idea of what happens in the afterlife is intriguing. I more readily believe that heaven and hell are the products of our thoughts than punishments or rewards imposed by an outside source, so I thought the premise of this book very easy to envision. It was, on the whole, well written, thought necessarily depressing for the last half. The movie was actually a very good adaptation, although it made the two main characters seem selfish. I would recommend this if you are not offended by having traditional Christian dogma questioned.
