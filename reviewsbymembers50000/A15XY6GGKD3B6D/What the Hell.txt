 I have been a fan of David Eddings' BELGARIAD for years and years, so I was thrilled when I saw his name on a new book. Big disappointment. Words cannot describe how big a disappointment this book was. But I still read all the way to the last sentence, like someone who is unable/unwilling to look away from a car wreck.   The premise is that one of a pair of identical twins is murdered and they cannot tell which twin is which, because identical twins have the same DNA. Nice, but I've got two words for you:  DENTAL RECORDS. I think it is statistically impossible for even identical twins to have identical cavities, tootbrush wear patterns, etc.
