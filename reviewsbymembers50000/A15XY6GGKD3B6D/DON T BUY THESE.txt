 These may look like the leading roller ball pens - but they are not. Take my advice, you want to pay a little more for the Pilots. These have a very sharp point and write like they are carving and scraping the page - which they are in fact doing because the ink does not flow smoothly and half the time you are scraping your paper with a bare metal tip. Very frustrating pens! I will never buy these again.
