 Season Two marks a turning point in the Highlander series, when the writers finally break out of the territory established in the original Highlander movie and introduce new ideas. The Watchers are introduced, a secret society of people who have been watching and recording the Immortal's deeds for centuries. While I can't help but wonder if this idea was liberally borrowed from Anne Rice's books, the Watchers quickly became my favorite aspect of the show, especially the tentative and growing friendship between Duncan McLeod and his watcher, ultra-cool guy Joe Dawson. It really adds depth to Duncan's character to see him interact with someone not in "the biz" from whom he has nothing to hide. In fact, Dawson may know McLeod better than anyone ever has, including Duncan himself. The abrupt death of Tessa during Season 2 may be upsetting to some fans, but her presence in McLeod's life stagnated the character, and now he is free to go out in new and exciting directions.
