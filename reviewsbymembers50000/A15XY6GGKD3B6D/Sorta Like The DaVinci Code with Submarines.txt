 I decided to give Clive Cussler a chance after seeing the movie Sahara, based on one of his books. I was expecting a book that was the male equivalent of a Danielle Steele novel, but was pleasantly surprised by the many twists and turns of this adventure/mystery story. A cracking good shoot-em-up, with a far-fetched but intriguing plot which connects Christopher Columbus to the sinking of the Andrea Doria. Of course, there is not much in the way of character development, but a very entertaining read.
