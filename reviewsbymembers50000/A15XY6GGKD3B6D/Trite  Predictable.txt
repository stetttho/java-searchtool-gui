 Katie, the pregnant heroine of the story, was left by the wonderful house painter-cum-poet Matt Harrison. He gives her a diary to read to try and explain his departure, the diary his perfect, dearly departed wife Suzanne wrote for their much-loved, perfect baby Nicholas. I had a hard time finishing this book because it was torture to force myself to read any more of the trite, cloying phrases. Sickeningly sweet, predictable, smarmy, just oozing with smaltzy sentiments. Get the picture? In other words, terrible if you want real literature instead of a greeting card.
