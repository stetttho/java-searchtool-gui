 Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon in a wonderful performance as the compulsive, pushy over-achiever) is determined to win the high school election. Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick looking very frumpy in a role that is ironic considering his Ferris Bueller alter ego) is the social studies teacher having a really bad time in his life. Lots of complications begin when McAllister's best friend was fired for having an affair - with Tracy of all people. When Jim puts popular jock Paul Metzler (Chris Klein) up to running against Tracy... of course, this means war. A deliciously dark comedy that is a good adaptation of the book by Tom Perrotta.
