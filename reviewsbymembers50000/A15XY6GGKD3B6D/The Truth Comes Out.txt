 In another compulsively readable novel in Sharon Shinn's Samaria series, the inhabitants of this world finally learn the truth about the spaceship Jehovah, which they have long thought to be the god Jovah. Shinn builds a good and suspenseful plot around twins, one angel, one human, who were separated at birth. A welcome departure from her first couple of Samaria novels which were very enjoyable, but sadly all seemed to have the same plot of Archangel-angelica love story. Another book for my "favorites" shelf.
