 I wish Philippa Gregory had stopped after The Queen's Fool. I was excited and intrigued by the concept of a novel written from the point of view of Amy Robsart, the long-suffering wife of Robert Dudley, the love of Queen Elizabeth's life. However, the book was mostly about Robert, and both the women in his life were portrayed as whiny, annoying, and more than a little crazy. Serious fans of Elizabeth will not be amused. I found myself waiting anxiously for the stair scene as Elizabeth and Dudley's romance drug interminably on and on, like listening to whiny teenagers.
