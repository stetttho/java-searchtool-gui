 When my husband rents a movie featuring Matthew Lillard, I usually find some laundry to do, or go balance the checkbook. However, this was not the raunchy teen comedy I expected. Three friends try to honor the memory of a fourth dead friend by going on a camping/canoeing trip he had planned. Of course, the tree-hugging girls and fat rednecks they meet are the basest of stereotypes, but overall it was actually funny - rather than the disgusting sequence of jokes about bodily functions I expected. (You know what? I think Seth Green may actually be able to act. Sshhh - Don't tell anyone.)
