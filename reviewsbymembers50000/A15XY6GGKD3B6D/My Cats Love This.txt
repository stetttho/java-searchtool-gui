 When my Petmate drinking fountain died, there were no replacement motors or new Petmate fountains available at my local PetsMart. They did have this Catit fountain (more reasonably priced than the Petmate), so intrigued by its unusual look, I bought it. My cats received this replacement enthusiastically - but now that I see it in action, I am not so crazy about its design. The water comes out of a central point in the top of the half-sphere and covers the entire outside of the dome. The cats seem to like the novelty of multiple places to lick the water, but the water is exposed to airborne contaminants (and cat saliva) and quickly becomes dirty. The half-sphere is also the water reservoir. To refill the water, you must take the entire dome off, turn it upside down under the faucet to fill it, then flip it back over and line up three pegs to settle the dome back into place. If you are not that coordinated - like me - you can quickly end up with a big puddle of water spreading across the floor before you line up the darn pegs.   Pro - Cats Like it. Con - Big points off for not being user friendly.   Conclusion - When this one dies, I'll go back to a Petmate or the more expensive Drinkwell.  UPDATE-This broke after only 2 months of use!
