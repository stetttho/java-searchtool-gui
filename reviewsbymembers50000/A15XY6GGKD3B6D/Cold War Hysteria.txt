 ALAS, BABYLON is the story of a washed-out lawyer living in small-town Florida in the 50s.  In the aftermath of thermonuclear war, he becomes the leader to rally his family and neighbors to survive in the desperate situation.   I'm afraid I can't say much to recommend this book. The characters are flat and uninteresting, with persons of color and women portrayed as the barest of stereotypes. Far too much time is spent in the beginning of the book describing the chess-like moves of the USA and Soviets that lead up to the war. This book is probably typical of the mentality of the 50s, but seems extremely dated to a modern reader. The `group of survivors after a world-wide catastrophe' has been done much better by other authors; for example THE STAND by Stephen King.
