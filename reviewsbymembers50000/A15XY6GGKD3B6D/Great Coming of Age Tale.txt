 Coriel spends nine months of the year living with her grandmother, the village witch-woman, learning her herbs and spells. During the summers, however, Corie goes to Castle Auburn, to be with her noble-born half-sister Elisandra. An intelligent and open girl, Corie makes friends with everyone from the nobles to the kitchen maids, but feels an especially deep connection with the Aliora, a fairy-like people who are kept as slaves in the grand houses. The story begins with an Aliora hunting expedition during the summer of Corie's fourteenth year, and narrates her changes and adventures over the next few years of growing up. As Corie ages, she begins to see through the glamour of court life to the dark political maneuverings and rivalries, and the true nature of the Aliora servants. A deeply felt coming-of-age tale, deftly written (as always!) by Ms. Shinn, one of my favorite authors.
