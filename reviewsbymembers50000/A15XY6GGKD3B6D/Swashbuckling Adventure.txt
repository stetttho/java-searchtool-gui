 ZORRO is Isabel Allende's admirable telling of the life and times of the California folk legend, Don Diego de la Vega. Unlike the various movies we have seen, Allende starts the story before Diego is born and tells of the union of his parents Alejandro de la Vega, the Spanish grandee, and Toypurnia/Regina, the half-Indian warrior queen. The story covers Diego's tutelage in Indian mysticism, swordplay, acrobatics, magic and gambling as a child and young man. Along with his milk brother, Bernardo, he perfects the skills which enable him to get out of sticky situations during his stay in Barcelona as a love-struck young man, then later as the avenging spirit Zorro upon his return to California.
