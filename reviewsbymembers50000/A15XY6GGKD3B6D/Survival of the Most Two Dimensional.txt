 Kristin Bjornsen was a student in Denver before she was kidnapped and enslaved by the Catteni, a race of war-mongering giant humanoids. She escapes from slavery on the planet Barevi, lives off the land, then is captured again. She and a multitude of others are dumped on an unknown planet where they must fend for themselves. Most of the writing is spent on scouting expeditions and the mechanics of survival and food procurement. Too boring for words. If you are looking for character development or plot, look elsewhere. So bad I couldn't force myself to finish.   Is it just me, or have Anne McCaffrey's books gone to hell since the loss of Judi-Lynn Del Rey? Just shows you what a good editor can do.
