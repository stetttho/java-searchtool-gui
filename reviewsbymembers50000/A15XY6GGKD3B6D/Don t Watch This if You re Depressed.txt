 The ads for this movie make it look like a dark comedy, but as is the case with so many movies, the ads contain the only funny parts. This movie is the sad story of two rather pathetic friends going on a trip through California's wine country the week before one of them gets married. Miles is the perpetually sad unpublished author and wine connoisseur. Jack is his old college roommate, an over-the-hill, out of work actor who is scheduled to marry an Armenian real estate princess in a week. It is painful to watch these two co-exist for a week as the immature, perhaps bipolar, Jack tries to nail anything female that moves and Miles goes through a series of depressing setbacks when he learns his ex-wife has remarried and is pregnant. The absolute best scene in the movie is when Sandra Oh beats the ever-loving you-know-what out of Jack with her motorcycle helmet, something I had been wanting to do since the first few minutes of the film. The abrupt ending could not come soon enough.
