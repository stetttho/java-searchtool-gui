 Still Life With Woodpecker is a love story about an exiled princess and a crazy bomber in Hawaii. Definitely one of my top ten favorite novels of all time; it is kooky, weird, sexy, unpredictable, and downright hilarious. Cannot recommend it enough, as long as you don't take it or yourself too seriously
