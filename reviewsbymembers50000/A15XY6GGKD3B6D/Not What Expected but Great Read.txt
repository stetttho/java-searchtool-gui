 I was hoping that this third installment of the Harper Hall trilogy would be about my favorite character, Menolly. Instead, the book is about Piemur, Menolly's friend, whose golden voice changes with puberty, and he is forced to reassess his life. Piemur runs away from Harper Hall and finds adventure in the jungles of the Southern Continent. Menolly is mentioned here and there, so we find out what happens to her. Maybe it's because I'm female, but I just couldn't get as attached to Piemur, as immersed in his world. Still a great book by one of my favorite authors.
