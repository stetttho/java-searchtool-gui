 ANGRY HOUSEWIVES chronicles four decades in the lives of five Minnesota neighbors who are members of a book club. I really enjoyed this novel, but I can understand the criticism. If this had been written before the era of "Lifetime Television for Women", the themes of the book would have been sharp and original. However, now we're all a bit over-exposed to stories such as: the perfect wife who's really an abuse victim, the gay child, the drunk mother, cancer, car wrecks, divorce, extramarital affairs, etc.   What can I say? I'm a sucker for sentimental stories, and this one is done well in my opinion. I would recommend it for your book club.
